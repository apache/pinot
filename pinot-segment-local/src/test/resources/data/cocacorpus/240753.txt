Professor Mike Sharples is an Academic Lead at the Educational App Store , and is considered by many to be an expert in the field of mobile learning , having done extensive research into human-centred design and the evaluation of technologies of learning . <p> The interview covers the History and Future of Mobile Learning , with Prof. Mike offering insightful answers to the questions raised by many educators who have implemented tablets into their school , or those who are thinking of doing so . <p> The below article covers the content discussed in videos 1-3 of the afore mentioned interview . <p> What are the origins and history of mobile learning ? <p> Mobile learning had some fascinating pioneering work in the early 1970 's by Xerox , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop what they called the Dynabook , a personal dynamic medium that was about the size and shape of a book . It 's niche was that anyone could use it and it had high definition simulations and material from around the world , which forty years ago was an amazing concept . Unfortunately the technology could n't keep up with it then . <p> It was around the early 2000 's that practical mobile learning really started up with the introduction of tablet computers . We started an early project at Birmingham Uni , surrounding the idea that people should have access to learning whenever and wherever they needed it . <p> What did you learn from that early work at Birmingham University ? Could you identify key factors that would influence mobile learning even then ? <p> The key aspect was personalisation " the idea that anyone could have access to learning opportunities whenever they needed them , not simply the technology they ran off . <p> What advice would you give schools in relation to their tablet use in the classroom ? <p> The main piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the potential for learning that comes with it . For instance , getting the right software applications and apps that will run on the devices . Firstly , the school has to have a strategy for securing the devices before they consider which pieces of software are going to benefit individual learners . It 's all about maximising the child 's capacity for learning . The questions to ask are : where can they then use it ? In the classroom ? The school ? Home ? The aspect of connecting learning from school to home is the most important . It allows children to continue learning on a device they have a constant connection to and can then bring back to school for assessment in the classroom . <p> There are quite a large number of programmes being rolled out in schools in regards to tablet adoption . Some revolve around certain individuals having tablets , some around a class and some around a whole year . What 's your view on the premise of different programmes for different schools and what should we be aware of ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school is different and has different needs . There was an issue when the early programmes started , where a whole year group got access to tablets at the same time and then two years later the tablets were out of date , again all at the same time , and the school would often have issues relating to the repurchasing appropriate technology . <p> A different model relates around working with the parents . This involves a subscription service that the parent pays each week for , approximately the cost of a price of beer , which they can pay for a period of up to three years . After that the child gets to keep the tablet . That 's a good model , which many parents can afford and which can be subsidised by the school if they have identified a hardship case . <p> What types of software are currently available and what should teachers , parents and students be aware of in regards to software ? <p> It 's an important opportunity to introduce appropriate software that matches the curriculum and the needs of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some free and some paid , so it 's a challenge to decide what to buy or adopt that will meet the needs of each child . That 's why the EAS is so valuable , in providing advice on how you can correctly match software to the diverse needs of children . <p> From the perspective of parents , schools and teachers , many believe that free apps are not necessarily of the quality they need to be . Does a piece of software being free equate to quality ? <p> There is a huge variety of free software applications , but generally they have n't had the design and thought of learning put into them . It 's fine to have a glossy base to an app , but it has to enable and foster deep learning . There are a number of good ways to learn ; through practice , through constructing knowledge , through sharing with other people , and through enquiry . The key is to firstly identify what that app is trying to promote , then secondly think how does that app meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the learner , analysing their ability whilst having customisation features that constantly stretch a child 's learning potential . There are two main things to consider " what sort of learning those apps enable and how they adapt to the learner as they develop new knowledge and skills . To do that , the teacher needs to understand that software in-depth . Again , as the EAS provide recommendations by teachers who have used those apps in class , it gives others confidence in the app , not from a commercial point of view , but from actual teachers in a real classroom capacity . <p> Part two of this article will be published next week , but if you 'd like to watch the interview in full do n't hesitate to visit our YouTube channel .

@@75177601 @3877601/ <h> How teachers can assess the usefulness of educational apps <p> For many teachers , time is their most valuable asset and any time spent off task i.e. away from teaching , must be spent on developing skill sets that enable more time . <p> Technology has proven in commoditised industries to do just that : save time and increase productivity . However , technology in education , although in its infancy , has yet to demonstrate its full potential . <p> Currently , the majority of teachers acquire their digital skill set by default for use in the classroom . They purchase their own mobile devices ( tablet or smartphone ) then through a variety of techniques , such as use of the internet , trial and error and help from friends , gain some confidence in the use of the device and content . However this may be ok at the outset , but what happens when a professional learner with a responsibility for teaching others , needs to progress ? <p> With the form factor of smartphones and tablets unlikely to change significantly over the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come in the delivery of content , specifically packaged software i.e. apps . <p> Currently there are over 250,000 apps found under the Education category in the major stores . However , the content is heavily weighted towards technical structure , rather than that of integrated learning systems , continual assessment , adaptive activities and analytics . We are still in an era of pre package , however we are starting to see the introduction of apps that are adaptive and show a basic understanding in regards to the pathways of learning . A good example of this is the language app Duolingo ' that employs the learning techniques of spaced repetition and mastery learning . <p> Before choosing any app for the classroom we would recommend that as a teacher that you work your way back from your expected outcomes and are crystal clear on what success looks like . If an app is to be used for a reward at the end of a lesson then ensure that it is fun , but if it is to acquire domain knowledge , then the best apps are those that map the national curriculum . 
@@75177602 @3877602/ <h> The History and Future of Mobile Learning : Part 2 <p> Today sees part two of our interview on the History and Future of Mobile Education hit the blog ! Recently , our CEO Justin Smith sat down with Professor Mike Sharples " an influential thinker in the realm of EdTech " for an in-depth discussion on mobile learning and the pedagogical concept currently driving tablet adoption in schools across the world . <p> This post covers videos 4-5 of the interview , which can be viewed in full here . Alternatively , click here if you 'd like to catch up on the first half of the interview . <p> Do you think teachers may feel threatened by children bringing in their own devices and using them for the wrong reason in the classroom ? Do you think it could be potentially disruptive to the classroom if students are not using them for the purpose intended ? <p> One of the things I 've found from talking to colleagues in Scandinavia , who have the same concerns about cyber safety and inappropriate behaviour , is that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actively encouraging children in responsible use . We 've started this in the UK as well , with cyber responsibility being taught in Primary and Secondary schools . Once they get into Secondary school and upper Secondary , that provides a foundation for children to bring in their own devices , used under the jurisdiction of proper , managed use . To some extend it goes back to the early 1980 's when children brought in their own pocket calculators . There were similar concerns that technology would take over from traditional methods of arithmetic , and schools brought in policies to manage that . In fact , tablet computers are cheaper in real terms now than the early pocket calculators of the 1980 's , and so the argument that young people ca n't afford it is becoming less important , but of course , still needs to be considered . What is a key underlying factor is the need for a proper policy of management . <p> How do you feel about educational apps and them demonstrating that they can help with attainment ? <p> Demonstrating attainment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . One of them relates to being able to do something with a mobile device that just was n't possible before . For example , mobiles and tablets are sophisticated toolkits . They 've got built in sensors , accelerometers , light sensors and sound sensors , so you can use them as scientific toolkits . The other is to do with formative assessment . Because the students have their own personal device that they 're using for learning , you have the opportunity to assess them as they learn , to assess them to support their learning . The teacher is able to get continual diagnostic information back about how the student is progressing ; what problems they have ; which assignments or quizzes they 're failing on , not just for individual learners but across the class as well , as dashboards allow teachers to see how the whole class is doing at a glance . <p> In the process of tablet adoption in schools and by individuals , we do have to understand that EdTech integration can take a little time . It 's not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't blame the technology . Do you feel that for the first time in a very long time we 're getting intergenerational learning ? Where we get the student coming into the classroom with apps that they 've identified help with learning at home , vs. what the teacher feels is appropriate ? Are we seeing that one can learn from the other ? <p> Yes , it 's a fascinating possibility and we 're just starting to see that happen . Because the children can carry their learning from one classroom to another on the device , and also from the classroom to home , we 're starting to see children doing their own interest led projects at home , and then bringing that learning back into class . <p> One way that we 've done this is through enquiry based learning , where a teacher sets up a science investigation in the class , and then the children go off and carry out the investigation at home , subsequently bringing the results back into class . An example of this centred on healthy eating , and started with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy diet ? ' They then used their mobile devices to take photos of their meals , and with a simple app they could then record the diet of each meal , which automatically calculated its nutritional content ; the carbohydrates and fats etc , so the children could engage with those results and compare them in class . <p> With over 600,000 tablets currently found within primary and secondary schools in the UK , and forecast to be over 1 million in 2016 , it 's here to stay . How do you see the future playing out ? <p> To some extent the technology recedes into the background . It 's what you do with it , it 's how you individualise your own learning , how you manage yourself as a lifelong learner , how you share the learning with other people , and the role of the teacher in orchestrating and managing that learning , from the earliest age through school and into college and university . The teachers will have a very much enhanced role , not as deliverers of content , but as managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future is much more complex , because it wo n't just be contained within the classroom , it will be a lifelong learning journey that all of us take . It will also be a very productive environment , as it will enable us to use the technology in ways that suit us best to individualise and collaborate in our learning . <p> It is clear from this conversation that there are true benefits to the learner from the use of tablet and mobile technology , following on from a trend that extends back 30 years to the first commercial calculator . There is evidently a lot of work that still needs to be done to support the teaching community and to ensure that all members of staff in schools are fully confident when it comes to using 1:1 technology in class . <p> In another session , Justin and Professor Mike will talk about the personal development of teachers and how they can be supported going forward , to best ensure that this surge of EdTech is a truly successful change in education .

Literacy helps us to relate to the complexities of our world . - The importance of this skill can not be underestimated as studies demonstrate that societies with poor rates of literacy are linked to poor mental health , criminal acts , lower economic success and well-being in life ( Clark and Dugdale , 2008 ) . <p> In the 21st century , literacy teaching and practise in the traditional format competes with digital screen time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six hours of screen time per day ( this includes TV , laptops , computers , video games , mobile phones and tablets ) . The problem is not necessarily the amount of time that is spent looking at the screen . The negative effects are as a result of how that time is spent . Therefore it is very important to understand the importance in the quality of content for mindful interaction and mindful acts of literacy learning on the internet . <p> MINDFUL INTERACTION WITH SMARTPHONES AND APPS FOR LITERACY <p> Academic researchers have demonstrated that children who use mobile devices for reading and learning show more cooperation skills and retain more information ( Korat 2008 , Maynard , 2005 , Grimshaw 2007 ) . The rationale behind the positive results demonstrate that creating content in a contemporary format and using lively animations , colours , music and videos enhances learning outcomes . <p> We have identified some of the mobile apps that are available for developing literacy skills in Secondary School children according to the framework of engagement , vocabulary building and social collaboration that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ! <p> This is a fun app that makes children interact with their peers in order to create a story . The idea is that someone begins by writing a common saying and then the friend or parent grows the game by drawing an illustration that depicts the sentence . Then , the next friend creates another title or saying describing the picture and the process goes on and on The end result is often funny to read as imaginations run wild in the process <p> Every day you can learn a new word. - This is a great app that not only explains the meanings of words . there is a recorded voice that teaches how the word is pronounced . One day a word , accounts for 365 new words per year . That is a great benefit to our vocabulary development . The words come from the Merriam-Webster Dictionary . <p> A Word a Day for Android is an English Vocabulary widget that is very good at reinforcing the relationship between letters and sounds in order to enhance reading achievement . <p> Despite the whole range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are also thousands of apps that have other interesting topics that can also engage children into enhancing their literacy skills . <p> This is a great story that follows the adventures of an intrepid astronaut as he prepares to go into Space . The app has interactive scenes , voiceovers and original music . Readers will learn about the development of rockets , gun powder , air resistance , as well as getting the chance to build their own rockets and to test their Physics knowledge at the Rocket Academy ! This is definitely , reading , learning , listening and comprehension rolled into one . The illustrations are very pretty too . <p> The app acts as a way for children to explore the artists and to engage with the art that is on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York . Children can also create art works , sound compositions and discover artists ' processes and inspirations . The great thing about the app is that there are creative prompts for extra inspiration , there are also sharing features for children 's work so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Literacy is not only about reading and comprehending , it is also about creating content , writing and expressing ones own ideas effectively . This is why we have chosen the Makewav.es app . It is an app for blogging on school projects , video sharing and safe social networking . All content is vetted by teachers in order to maximise healthy usage . Another great feature is that schools can interact with each other and compare and contrast their work on specific projects . That 's real 21st century collaboration training ! <p> The apps that we have chosen aim to create a self-aware reading culture that adopts a mindful attitude towards digital interaction . Furthermore , the apps that are available in order to improve literacy are many . Whilst the topics are interdisciplinary , the common aim is to create informed and well structured conversations around topics that are of interest , engaging and that provide value to the intellectual achievement of our children . <p> Do you have any other apps that you enjoy using for literacy practice and learning or that your children/students enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section below. -

Where there is no shortage of educational apps being made available to the teaching community , more and more schools are investing in mobile applications ( for usage on iPads , RM Slates and Android tablets etc ) to use creatively and within core subject areas to enhance teaching practices . <p> However , the dilemma that most teachers and parents face is in determining what constitutes as developmentally appropriate applications to support and encourage learning with young children . <p> According to academic research , the following guidelines are found to be a good starting point when selecting applications to integrate into classroom settings : <p> 1 . - Look for apps that are purposeful and educational While they can be fun or enjoyable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home setting ) must be designed with clarity and include clear learning aims . <p> In the instance where you are considering apps that encourage children to read , look at the methods that are used within the app to determine the suitability it may have for teaching . <p> In a scenario where the recognition of the individual sounds of the alphabets , or phoneme awareness , is crucial in the early stages of reading , it is important to find apps that suit the requirements of the subject area in the classroom ; be it synthetic letter by letter awareness or whole word analytic word acquisition . <p> 2 . Locate apps that are interactive , transparent and intuitive " Particularly , in cases where the app selected should provide for both interactivity and transparency ' in which their functions should be clearly defined and intuitive . This takes into account the design of the app transparency and the child 's intuitiveness , where if the child touches the pad , with the intent to zoom in and out of focus , the app completes the clearly defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of apps should encourage children to be more brains-on and hands-on , - engaging and empowering , and be able to give the child complete control so as to support the child 's learning potential . High levels of involvement and engagement is a good indicator that the child is focusing on the activity or exploration itself and not on the functionality or jazziness of the app . <p> Be cautious with apps that include rapid change of images and fast moving illustrations. - This can cause strain on the child 's eyes and can also result , if over used , in producing short attention spans. - At the same time , be aware of non-interactive apps where the child is watching the screen for periods of time which can lead to passive viewing and overexposure of screen time . <p> 3. - Encourage the child to be in control " The child must be in control when using the app and not vice versa where the application is controlling the child through some type of programmed learning. - Where there is evidence to suggest that programmed software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and literacy skills , this approach is contrary to popular conceptions of good practices . <p> There are several apps that include closed ' problem solving where there is only one right answer and the child has several attempts to find the correct answer. - In cases where a child can not progress to the next level because the child is unable to answer the question correctly , and the app is programmed such that there is only one solution , there is general consensus among educators ( and parents too ) that this type of learning may actually hinder the child 's progress to learn and can result in the child 's loss of motivation and engagement . <p> More effective apps which offer multiple- solutions to the problem are more appropriate and- where there is a real challenge for the child to clarify a problem. - In the case of a maths app and young children , look out for apps that have timers attached to them . Unless used as a quiz or a quick test , the use of timer can make children anxious and hinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage collaboration between the **26;236;TOOLONG and child - While this is especially important in the early years between that of teacher and child ; this is less instructive in the primary years , where the teacher takes on more of a role as a facilitator. - While many apps can provide for independent exploration , research shows that more collaborative working and engaged joint attention ' can bring about better cognitive challenges <p> More communication and collaborative approaches of teaching methods are found to be especially rewarding as it encourages a balanced approach of learning setting for both the child and the adult . It is found to combine the provision of independent exploration with more focused group work that can involve adult instruction and facilitation within a more naturalistic ' environment . <p> This type of learning scenario is highly successful when teachers have a strong grasp of their subject content knowledge along with sound pedagogy practices and technical knowledge of the educational app . <p> 5 .

Avoid apps that contain any indication of violence or stereotyping " As with any new forms of technology , the chosen apps should be tasteful and suitable in content ' to justify for its use within the educational curriculum. - Avoid apps with images which resemble aggressive actions o which contain images of weaponry. - Be overly cautious and steer clear of stereotypical images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctions . <p> The plethora of apps available can lead to much confusion in understanding what will benefit children the most when used within a learning setting .

However , in those early times our staff were resilient and made the best of what training and support were given to them . <p> I 've since moved to a different school , one that has been watching with interest as this revolution in education has sparked throughout the country .

First and foremost , there needs to be a dedicated cohort of skilled and enthusiastic members of staff , each bringing something unique to the process . Without this team , it will be slow-going and the problems will inevitably compound . <p> The technical side must be treated with just as much planning and support as the training side , perhaps even more so . In teaching , staff will put their trust in technology perhaps two times , the first try because they 're willing to develop but throwing in a second failure will mean belief and interest nose-dives .

Asking for outside help beyond the skills of the school 's staff is a wise move if the financing allows for it .

Do you agree ? Tell us your thoughts in the comment section below ! <p> In the past few weeks , having discussed what constitutes the selection criteria of an educational app- and taking into consideration the appropriate pedagogical practices- whilst using mobile technology in a classroom , the third and final set of the trilogy evaluates how best to use technology appropriately and discreetly within the curriculum subject and content . In other words , how best to ensure that apps which are incorporated into the classroom are integrated seamlessly and transparently within the classroom lesson . <p> Apps in Curriculum <p> In the past few years , many schools have bought into the idea of introducing the use of educational apps within their settings , with the view to engage and motivate students , as well as to enhance and encourage 21st century learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to incorporating apps successfully into the classroom settings , there are still very many scenarios where the use of technology is not discreetly integrated within curriculum . A very common misconception is that mobile technology must be used as part of an ICT lesson in the ICT room , of that which includes a detailed lesson plan and instructions for the children to follow . <p> However , the use of mobile apps within a curriculum needs to go beyond an ICT lesson. - Effective use of apps is about its space ' within subject content matter where it is not just an add on ' but rather works as a discreet complimentary tool within the classroom materials and settings . <p> Easing technology into classroom instruction means more than just teaching basic ICT lessons through the use of software programs in class. - Effective technology integration must happen within the focus of the subject content in ways that research shows deepen and enhance the learning journey for the student. - More successful integration is achieved when the technology is transparent and when it supports the learning outcomes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the usage of tablets and apps simply becomes another expensive add-on tool within the traditional and structured stand-and-deliver classroom . This goes hand in hand with the newer forms of pedagogy strategies where children 's communication , media and collaboration skills also need to be considered as part and parcel of the whole learning process . <p> The Book Bag Design : Technology as an Everyday Feature in Children 's Rucksacks . <p> - Taking the form of materials in a book bag ( Parmar , 2013 ) ( extended by the concept of - the " pencil case design " , by Jem Peck , KG ) , the use of mobile technology can be pictured to sit side by side with more traditional resources such as , notebooks , pens , calculators , drawing instruments , music recorders etc. in a child 's school bag so that it can be used interchangeably and as a complement to the other school resources . <p> So where in some cases , the use of traditional paper and pen is most effective ( i.e. planning a literacy assignment ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to translate more complex concepts both creatively and simply to children ( i.e. 3D effect of the solar system ) . - As a result , teachers have the autonomy to drive the learning processes for their students in ways which are more appropriate within the subject matter . <p> In this way , technology is used in ways that become an integral part of how a classroom functions " and as accessible as the use of all other classroom tools . The focus of the use of integrating technology in the lesson is , in effect , the curriculum outcome and not the use of the particular type of technology . <p> However , simply handing over mobile applications to a teacher will not suffice. - Both teachers and staff need to be protected from re-inventing the workflow wheel and require some type of professional development and support to take this type of innovative and collaborative teaching forward. - So , how can we do this ? <p> Teacher- Side Professional Development <p> In very simple terms , teachers require a form of coaching ' ( Technology , Coaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of professional development , coaching works as a powerful support mechanism. - Coaching is customised on an individual level , providing both modelling and instructional approaches , which when conducted correctly , can harness the potential for teachers to maximise what needs to be accomplished in technology-rich environments . <p> In terms of understanding the role and use of mobile technologies discreetly within education , the role of coaches can help empower teachers with the knowledge to make intelligent decisions about how to integrate educational apps within context and focus of the study. - They can further encourage teachers to become more motivated and responsible for the choices and learning environments in which they create , thereby making it relevant to the lessons currently being taught. - Finally , the coaches can ensure ongoing increase of skill set and sharing of information across subject areas , hence encouraging peer to peer learning with frequent on-going support . <p> So , in the context of introducing an app within a lesson in the classroom , the coach works side by side with the educator to first increase technological awareness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second , the coach and teacher evaluates the most appropriate and effective pedagogic strategies required to succeed within a communicative and collaborative context and finally , the coach works in partnership with the teacher to enrich teaching and learning within the subject content matter of the lesson plan in curriculum . <p> As a result , with all this information in the teacher 's hand , technology will no longer need to operate as a standalone tool in the corner of the classroom. - It will no longer need to be brought into class as an ICT lesson or an exploratory tool. - But , it can , through sustainable knowledge and extended practice , be integrated within the classroom , both discreetly and purposefully within curriculum content and structure . <p> At the Educational App Store blog , we are always looking for authoritative voices and opinions on the topic of Mobile Learning .

However behind it there is a lot more going on that is also about enhancing the learning experience for young people . <p> The app opens up with some simple yet really effective illustrations and a three option menu . This is a choice between getting straight into the app and playing on it to selecting some setup options . These setup options include changing options for adult and also the child that is using the device . On selecting the supervisor or adult setup option you are taken to a further menu where you have the option of choosing between the different types of tracing outlines that will appear in the screen . This is selected from three options ; full , an outline or no tracing outline at all . The second option , the kids setup menu , allows you to choose which pages you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you would do this once you start playing the app , however it would be really useful if this were explained in the menu somehow . <p> Once you have completed your setup you can then select the Let 's Play tab on the main menu and start playing the app . As mentioned before , it is at this point that you realise that it is your job to create a book , a book where each page you are given a drawing and a simple sentence . Within the sentence there is a weather related word highlighted . When you click on this word it is read aloud for you to help you pronounce it correctly but also to help you realise that it is this word that is specific to the weather features of the app . On each page the picture is at the top and underneath there are a couple of tracing lines . If you click on these tracing lines then a new window opens up with the weather specific word in large text . This is where the user can practice their letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the user simply clicks on each of the letters then depending on which option was selected in the supervisor setup menu then a hand appears and shows the user the correct way to write the letter . This is a fantastic extra of the app , however , as with a couple of other things it would help if there were an easy guide somewhere in the main menu to explain how the user can make the most out of all these small , yet app enhancing elements . <p> Once the user has correctly traced the letters then they can click the green tick and their text is implanted onto the story page . If , however they make a mistake or would like to keep practicing until they feel it is perfect they can also rub out their attempt and start again . I can see this being used to good effect in encouraging the young person to get it as perfect as they can and therefore practice their letters each time they do it . <p> Once you have created your text then you can click on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you do this you then have the ability to colour in the picture . This is completed through using a number of colouring tools . Again , there is also an option to wipe everything clean if you wish to start afresh ! The line of text also appears at the bottom of this picture , again with the weather specific text highlight in a different colour and as before by clicking on the word the user can hear the correct pronunciation . <p> The user goes through each of the pages in the same way as this , coming against different sentences and weather specific phrases on each page until they have completed their book . There is a very good balance between the fun elements of the app : the drawing and colouring , and the educational elements of it : the tracing of letter formations and introduction of weather specific words , exactly what you would expect of a Montessori style app . <p> Overall it is a really good app but with the addition of a little extra guidance to help the user navigate all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant .

Each caption is illustrated and busting to be coloured in by a budding artist . <p> The illustrations include : christmas trees and snowy scenes with snowmen and snowballs , icy scenes with polar bears and penguins , sunny days on the beach with ice cream and sand castles , cloudy days with helicopters and a planes , rainy days splashing in puddles and being stuck indoors ( that one is a bit sad ) , stormy days with lightening and big waves ! foggy days with lighthouses and fishermen beautify rainbows with castles , start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the ice skater and the the skiier ! <p> Post your favourite ( coloured in please ! ) on our Facebook page ( **26;264;TOOLONG ) , we 'd love to see what you can do ! <p> If you want to colour in you must do your writing practice first - harsh but fair ! <p> Tapping the letter makes the magic hand appear . The magic hand shows you exactly how to form the letter . Then you trace the letter ... it really is great fun and you learn letter shapes , letter formation , spelling and writing all at the same time ! <p> Hidden Feature : 1 .

It begins with organising objects around us , of comparing and contrasting , categorising and creating mental images and recognising symbols . This is how we recognise numbers , pictures and words around us . Apps for early years may assess the recognition of colours and animals and use hand-eye coordination to follow moving objects and control fine muscle movements ( Fine-Motor Control ) of fingers by coordinating physical movements with visual input .

The ways that we create are increasingly interdisciplinary which means that we must be able to work with people from a diversity of backgrounds in order to come up with finished products . As a result collaboration skills are increasingly part of teachers ' agendas . This consideration takes into account whether the app provides the framework to support group interaction and sharing throughout the learning process . <h> Communication Skills <p> Communication skills also build on Critical Thinking as it takes into account how best to convey the information once it has been thought out . Apps for early years and primary school promote the development of children 's communication and listening skills in order to help them express themselves with their language and social interactions . <h> Creative Development <p> Creative skills are important in order to make sense of and digest the world around us .

As a result , many Inventors and Engineers use lateral thinking and creative processes in order to create novel things . <h> Critical Thinking <p> From Early Years to more advanced students , Critical Thinking builds on Cognitive Development skills . It takes into account the ways in which the app develops thinking and analytical skills in order to test whether statements are true , false or fair . It can also be related to early years and young kids ' learning by showing them ways in which they develop their own ideas and strategies , engage with people , objects and activities as they explore the world . Critical Thinking forms part of a whole range of subject areas such as Ethics , Maths , English , History , Politics and Science . <h> Emotional Skills <p> Once again , these skills are non-academic and are an extension of Life Skills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is about having the self-awareness to know one 's emotions , values and goals to come to decisions as well as having social skills that manage relationships and take other people 's feelings into account . It is also about self-regulation so that children may learn how to manage their emotions learning to take their own emotions into account and manage them accordingly so as to not feel overwhelmed . Motivation also features heavily in this category . This means that we learn to be driven by achievement and satisfaction of completing projects . All these qualities come about time and time again amongst leaders . The apps that we have placed in this category range from Health and Fitness , to Meditation and Alternative Therapies . Any apps that teach you to be more competitive or self-aware and empathetic of others will make our children more well rounded people for the future . <h> Engagement and Usability <p> These two factors are very important in order to assess whether the app is able to sustain children 's attention for long periods of time and how easy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is intuitive to understand or whether an adult will have to read a set of instructions in order to guide the child along .

@@75177637 @3877637/ <h> Developer of the Month <p> We 've reviewed Nessy Learning 's Hairy Phonics range , and it 's so good we 've decided to make them the EAS Developer of the Month for April 2015 . Take a look at what our teacher Adam had to say about the app below . <p> This fantastic app is part of a series from developers Nessy Learning that aims to help young children with the initial stages of learning to read . This is a free app on android and is also available as a paid-for app on IOS . This specific app focusses on the tricky stages of learning consonant digraphs - two consonants that make a different sound when blended together than you might expect from their separate sounds , for example : ch , ck , ff , ll , ng , sh , ss , th , zz . One of the leading comments on the description of the app is that it aims to bring phonics to life . I would say it certainly does this , and more . <p> The design of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appeal as much as possible to young children . The use of a gaming format within the app - trying to save the ' Hairies ' from an icy blast that has frozen them solid - is also very successful in keeping the user engaged . As an educator and parent it is also clear to see that the developers are well aware of how young children learn to read and there is definitely a large amount of phonic knowledge that has gone into creating this app . <p> When you first open the app you are introduced to the main page where you have a couple of different options . These include moving onto the game itself , finding information on how to access the game or finding out more information about the developer . In clicking on the option to find out how to play the game the user is taken to a different screen . On this there is an extremely well thought out , pictorial , and written description of how you can access the app . There is also the ability to reset the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the information tab about the developer the user is taken to a different page where they see what else the developer offers and a link to their website should they require further help . The developer 's website itself is a really useful tool . On it there is a lot of information about their products along with extra help information , should it be needed , for accessing the apps . However , one of the strong points of the app is the extra information they have available for both parents and teachers . This includes lots of extremely useful tips and hints for working with dyslexic children . <p> Once the user has selected to start the app they are given a short animation that shows the ' Hairies ' being trapped in blocks of ice . You gather from this that it is your job to try and unfreeze them . This happens by working your way through a couple of games that unlock the further you get through the app . The first part helps the child in their understanding of the sound itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the context of a word , with some repetition of the actual sound that is being focussed on . This is done in a clear British accent . Once you have been given this you are then able to learn the letter formations of the sounds . The app shows the user how to write the letter correctly , with the correct movement , and then an opportunity is given for the user to do it themselves . After they have successfully achieved this they move on to the more game-like aspect of the app . Using the correct sound the user has to spell a word to help the ' Hairie ' across an ice bridge . Correctly getting four of these means that the Hairie can collect a crystal which unlocks the new sound . There are plenty of opportunities within the game for the user to have support if they are struggling . By clicking on the different blocks ( that need to be rearranged correctly to get the right word ) the sound is replayed nice and clear . If the user has forgotten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the character at the side and have the whole word read out for them . As they move through the four words they get slightly harder with a longer word at the end . The aim of the app is to unlock all the ' Hairies ' and therefore all the sounds , learning about each one through the games and letter formation activity as you go along . <p> This app is pitched perfectly to the right level , repeating words with the sounds broken down into smaller blocks to aid the user in understanding and application . Overall this is a highly successful app that helps young children in the initial stages of learning to read .

@@75177641 @3877641/ <h> Spell Bear <p> Spell Bear has been developed to help the young children compound and improve their understanding of spelling as they begin to enter the world of the written language . It has been developed by an Australian company and so does carry and Australian accent throughout so this is something to be aware of if you wanting to use this app in a different country . The accent does n't  detract from the learning within the app though however when teaching young children it is important to be aware of dialect differences with different pronunciations of certain sounds and letters . 41963 @qwx661963 41964 @qwx661964 <p> This app has been developed to help young people on their journey to become proficient spellers , writers and readers . The app utilises gameplay to help encourage the user to learn through enjoyment and this also goes some way to helping keep a user engaged in the app and wanting to keep coming back . This in good in terms of helping young children in their learning as repetition is one of the strongest aspects in learning especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the app the user can choose from three different difficulty levels ; easy , medium and hard . Each one uses the same words however there is a different amount of support available for the user in each of the levels . For instance in the hard choice the user does not receive and extra helping in getting them to spell the word correctly but in the easy option some of the letters are already given . This means that the user can either work through each of the difficulty options , moving on as they become more proficient , or if they are already confident then they go straight to one of the harder options . Within in the difficulty options the user can also add more words if they wish to . This is a good addition as it gives the app the ability to personalise some of the learning directly to the actual user . This is obviously beneficial as it means that the user can be stretched in their learning . <p> The way the game works is to have to user drag the letters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example the A picture of that is an ant . The user is presented with the letters that spell ant ( in the form of childrens letter blocks ) and they have to drag the correct letter into the space provided at the bottom of the page to spell the word correctly . To add help the user can click on the letter to hear the sound that letter makes . This helps as it teaches the user the sound related to that letter and helps them to spell the word correctly as they can use the sounds to mimic the word they are trying to spell . At the beginning of each letter the user is reads aloud the word to help them distinguish the correct sounds . One addition that may be useful at this point would be to have the option for the user to hear the word repeated whenever they needed it . This , alongside hearing the letter sounds of the words might be extra help in linking the sounds of letters to their written form . <p> If the user gets the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again this is really good as it encourages the user to keep trying and to feel good about themselves and what they have done . If the user however drags a letter to the wrong place then the app does not accept the spelling helping the user to think about whether they have it right or not . This then allows the user to correct their mistake and not feel like they have made a mistake . <p> Another good addition to help the user returning to the app and enjoying it is the little shop that is available . With every correct word spelt the user is able to purchase more clothes for the main character of the bear . By earning a paw for each correct spelling they can add different items of clothing and dress bear as they wish . Again , this is a good little part of app that will continue users to return and challenge them to spell more words correctly as they will want to earn more paws to buy more clothes . <p> Overall this is a good app in helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell basic words . There is a requirement that they are aware of sounds of letter formations to access the app and for it to be as beneficial as possible though . 41962 @qwx661962 <p> An educational gamified app that teaches children how to spell in a fun interactive way . Children are encouraged to keep trying through encouraging statements like " well done ! " and being awarded bear stamps for each correctly spelt word . Bear stamps allow the child to customise their bear by changing the bear 's clothes . <p> Why Spell Bear ? <p> Multiple difficulty levels to cater for a developing child . <p> A reward system to encourage the child to continue trying to spell in a fun way !

Its a complex process so here are my top tips for you to use apps to promote reading and which run across different ages and abilities : <p> Multi-sensory. - As with any early learning , its important to bring in a variety of sensory stimuli to appeal ( to readers ) . Reading is a multi-sensory process ( seeing letter and words , - hearing sounds and associating them with letters and letter groups , playing with and physically touching and creating letters ) . Apps are well placed to help here as they are use visual , tactile and auditory interactions to appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found to appeal to a range of senses is Teach Your Monster to Read- with its lovely monster characters , great audio and endless gameplay . Its an app which provides much fun and is pedagogically fantastic ! <p> Synthetic Phonics.There are a vast number of phonics apps but not all of them are worth downloading . One of the best , which uses game play and has been created by primary school teachers , is Fab Phonics . It combines learning sounds and words , concentrating on blending of the sounds together to make the words . Children can earn points which enable them to play games and have a lot of fun in the process too . <p> Sight Words.Do you remember learning to read ? My first memories of early reading ( as a pre-schooler ) were sitting opposite my mother as she held up flash cards . In the 70s phonics was not in vogue and I was given an early foundation to reading through repetitive visualisation of high frequency words . Labelling around the house with high frequency words is great for this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adds to . Of course there are apps that do this too , and one of the best is Pocket Sight Words . <p> Decoding. - This is the ability for a reader to understand the relationship between letters and letter combinations and the sounds they make when read aloud . Some children find the decoding process really tricky and this can lead to them guessing , becoming frustrated and getting put off reading . Children who struggle with decoding can have underlying reading issues such as dyslexia . Nessy apps are geared for supporting children who might be struggling and- What 's My Reading Age ? is a great Nessy tool for parents to get a handle of where their children are in terms of reading ability . <p> Last but not least is having fun ! Apps are fun and low-pressure resources to appeal to readers of all ages . Word play apps provide a bit of light relief whilst encouraging reading ( without kids realising ! ) .

Computers will ONLY do what they have been instructed to do via a piece of code . <p> Children expect the computer to know the expected outcome when they start to code and become frustrated when it does not work . They can not understand why a missing space within the syntax of code can cause it to be misinterpreted .

At a basic level , we could quickly find out basic wants and requests , using the device in a similar way to Picture Exchange Communication ( PECS ) .

A supportive environment that compliments the app is vital ; the symbol system that a particular app uses should be incorporated into the wider environment that the child will come into contact with . This enables AAC users to generalise symbol/word recognition outside of device use , a common difficulty for children with autism . Collaboration with parents is also important ensuring a consistent approach to core word modelling outside of school . Many parents are reluctant to use devices as potential communication aids for their children in the hope that language may naturally develop down the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over reliant on the device to communicate , yet studies show that the use of AAC , both hi-tech and lo-tech ( communication boards ) can kick start speech .

The use of synthesised rather than digitised speech has come a long way over the last few years allowing AAC apps to be more natural sounding and personal to the particular child . <p> Many children with autism use associative rather than linear thinking , strong visual processing skills allows the child to associate symbols with words allowing them to make sense of the world around them , develop language competence and enable access to areas of the curriculum that they previously could n't . If you have a minimally or non-verbal child in your classroom , AAC applications could have the potential to do this .

The nature of computers in the past has restricted them to the role of occasional aid rather than the ubiquitous tool they had the potential to be . Even laptops did n't  do much to solve the situation ; both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy and to maintain than that of a tablet . They are also heavier and lack the battery power necessary to become educational work horses . Laptops are also not designed in the same way as tablet screens , and so are not optimised for the best of reading experiences . Therefore , although experiments in arming legions of students with laptops showed great windows of opportunity , there were no practical applications . Simply put , even though the equivalent software to educational apps and to e-readers did exist , the medium available to use them ( the laptop ) was not suitable and unable to exploit their full potential . <p> Tablets in education retain all of the advantages of laptops , but also offer some significant improvements . They are smaller , no harder to cart around than your average textbook ( and much lighter and less obtrusive in some cases ! ) , and although much more breakable than textbooks , they can withstand more punishment than the laptop . Crucially , by their very design tablets are also more secure against the threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . The range of environments open to tablet PCs is also much broader than that of a laptop ; lightweight and compact designs coupled with long battery lives and high durability makes them an ideal addition to any field trip , for example , or a part of a workshop . <p> Of course , there is a human side to all this as well . Tablets come under suspicion of facilitating cheating and classroom distractions , and the upfront costs of supplying a school can seem staggering . However , as technology in education becomes more widespread , ways are being developed to tackle this darker side to tablet technology and teaching methods are evolving to both incorporate tablets in lessons and to limit their negative capacities . As for the monetary aspects , tablets can actually become part of a money saving regimen at a school . For example , the costs of reprinting and repurchasing out of date textbooks as opposed to downloading digital costs represents a massive saving in and of itself , and educational grants exist to minimise upfront costs in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of integrating tablet technology into education , so focused are people on potential advances and pitfalls , and the futuristic glamour of the devices themselves . Whereas picking up technology is second nature to most children , teachers need more help immersing themselves in it . The purpose of technology in education is to assist the teachers , not to take over from them , so if pupils are to fully benefit then teachers must be fully involved from the outset . <p> One thing is certain . Advances in tablet technology are set to escalate and tablets in education will follow on . New hardware , new applications , new and innovative uses , and ultimately lower costs will yet make one tablet per child an achievable goal , although it will be up to teachers and education ministers to see that they are best utilised . From this point on , change will come quicker than ever before and staying on the vanguard is a challenge that we must ultimately meet .

Along side these mini pieces of art you will find a few paragraphs of accompanying text to get you thinking even more about this world we inhabit . <p> The main concepts that are covered in this app include the Earth in space ( with the seasons , night and day ) , our planets atmosphere and structure , animals and plants , the map of our world . This is all presented using high definition cartoon illustrations that are bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine detail . <p> The opening screen offers a choice of reading the content on your own or listening to a narration with the written text still visible . Both options will serve a purpose to assist with literacy skills , either by hearing the pronunciation of new words or testing fluency in reading . The style of language used is friendly and quite informal . It is in no way like a science text book , yet it still provides a fair level of descriptions and key words for each topic . <p> Moving through the book from page to page is straightforward and happens at your own pace . It is also possible to jump from one page to any other by tapping on the tab at the top of the screen which will reveal a mini strip of each page for you to select from .

However , there are a few interactions that help animate the concepts described in the text and add to the learning experience . When reading about the seasons of the year the illustration of a log cabin will mimic the actual season due to the position of the Earth relative to the Sun . There are also a couple of illustrations that display additional labels that provide more detail for each topic . The solar systems planet names appear in one illustration and the layers within the Earth are shown in another . This idea could have been extended to the map of the Earth or the names of the animals to support further learning . <p> The opportunities for learning has been slightly hampered by this science books approach and presentation .

@@75177666 @3877666/ <h> 3000+ Fractions <p> A helpful and engaging app packed full with fraction-related activities , useable over a wide range of ages and skill levels . This app has received an EAS certification of 5 Stars . 41963 @qwx661963 41964 @qwx661964 <p> 3000+ Fractions is an educational app for teaching children all about fractions , including what they are , how they relate to whole numbers that they will already be aware of and how to manipulate them . The main body of the app is divided into 3 sections , " Learn " , " Progress " and " Dictionary " . <p> " Learn " is where most of the action is . From here the user is presented with a list of topics referring to fractions , in a sensible order from " getting started " to " problem solving " . In each of these topics the user is presented with a series of quizzes of different types . Some quizzes need the user to give a correct fraction for the set question , while others are multiple choice . The user interface for entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , add 5 to , take 1 away from or take 5 away from the numerator or denominator , making it quick and easy to get to the right number without having to go through a keyboard input . In addition to this , the user can access a full-screen calculator , which outputs its answer to a textbox on the screen for easy reference , and can even pull up a scratch-pad within the app for quick notes or working out . Each number entry also comes with its own mini-calculator which can be used to work out each part of the fraction in turn and put the answer straight into the right place . <p> Quizzes are made of a series of questions to answer , and feedback is given immediately as to whether the user got the right answer , and what the correct answer was if they missed it . There is also a feedback section at the end of each quiz to summarise it , and your last result is stored against each quiz , along with how long ago you went through it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where children can learn about the topic or refresh their memories before taking on the quiz , and an examples section where a number of worked examples are available to fully illustrate the theory in practise . These sections are very complete and easy to follow , and between the two of them even I managed to revise a couple of techniques for multiplying fractions . <p> The " Progress " section helps with evaluating areas of strength and weakness , showing each topic of the app , how much of it has been completed , and how recently . Clicking through to a particular topic will show you a timeline of quizzes taken , as well as how many questions were answered incorrectly , how long it took to complete a quiz and the best time for that quiz . While this section provides all the information needed for tracking progress and growth , perhaps there could be room for graphing or visualisation of this data within the app . <p> Finally , the " Dictionary " section contains a sizeable glossary of Maths terms and definitions . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition , including visual examples , which is a nice touch , and sure to be helpful to anyone . <p> While the scope of this app may be limited to fractions , I 'm happy to report that this topic is covered in every way you could possibly want . The app has a robust interface , and many different ways to enter information and children should be able to use the app far more quickly over a short period of time . <p> In conclusion , considering the limited expertise of 3000+ Fractions , it is an expertise indeed , and fortunately the developers are producing a series of apps specialising in other areas of Maths . And to answer your question , I have n't counted but I 'd be very shocked if there were less 3000 fractions in this app. 41962 @qwx661962 <p> 3000+ Fractions consists of over 3000 fraction questions The questions progress in difficulty and are suitable for learners in the age range 8 to 16 <p> The fractions are presented in batches of five or ten . Whenever you attempt a batch the questions are shuffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold to suit different levels of learner . <p> In addition to the questions each element provides step by step examples and the necessary theory . <p> The elements for fraction arithmetic : addition , subtraction , multiplication and division provide fully worked answers for the questions . <p> The App provides a translucent sketch pad that slides in over the question , allowing you to write directly over it as you solve it . The App provides a translucent calculator that slides in over the questions <p> The app records your progress , and it will tell you : What percentage of the element you have completed How many batches you have completed with no mistakes What percentage of the element you have completed that day Which batches you have attempted and how you did for the last five attempts The date and time of when you last attempted the batch The time it took you to last complete the batch with no mistakes Your best time ever to complete the batch with no mistakes And it records whether you used the calculator to answer a batch <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is standard with all our Apps . <p> The questions and other material has been designed to cover the requirements of most national curriculums e.g. USA K12 and UK Key Stage 3 , Key Stage 4 and GCSE . <p> We hope by working through our questions and completing all elements to a 100% this brings the learner a rewarding sense of achievement and accomplishment. 
@@75177667 @3877667/ <h> Punctuation <h> Punctuation <p> Punctuation by Daydream Education is a comprehensive app that focuses on the use of a wide variety of punctuation marks . It is a fantastic resource that can be used to help children learn about punctuation marks and practise using them . The punctuation marks include : full stops , question marks , exclamation marks , commas , apostrophes , speech marks , brackets , dashes , colons , semicolons , bullet points and hyphens . It has achieved 5 stars in our Certification . 41963 @qwx661963 41964 @qwx661964 <p> As soon as the app is opened , you see the main menu screen , from which the content of the app and fun features can be directly selected . The main menu for the content includes an Introduction to Punctuation , which when selected , displays all of the punctuation marks featured in this app . This provides a great overview of the punctuation marks , as visual representations of the punctuation marks are presented in a pyramid-like manner , whereby basic punctuation marks for example full stops and question marks are presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example semicolons and colons are featured at the bottom of the pyramid . This feature reminded me of the punctuation pyramids that are often used in classrooms . <p> From the Introduction to Punctuation screen , pupils can either tap on the punctuation mark of their choice , or scroll down the screen to be given a brief explanation about the purpose of the mark and an example of how it is used . There is also guidance on how to use capital letters , as even though they are not punctuation marks , they are included as they are a very important part of sentence structure and organisation . <p> If you choose to use the app by selecting a punctuation mark of your choice from the Introduction to Punctuation screen , having read the brief explanation , it is possible to press the + button , which opens an information screen . For example , the full stop screen has an explanation of the purpose of the mark ; the usage of the mark ; a picture showing what it looks like and how it sits on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the ability to press on the red speaker phone button to hear the sentences read out ) and further expandable boxes providing examples of where else full stops can be used , for example in titles , acronyms and abbreviations . <p> Within the full stop content , there is also a facility to practise finding the missing punctuation , which can be accessed by selecting the ( + ) sign at the bottom of the screen . Once selected , a screen opens which asks children to circle where the punctuation marks are needed in the sentences . To do so , the children must select the middle pen icon , and then they can simply draw on the tablet where they feel they should be placed . If any mistakes are made , the eraser icon can be selected which allows children to rub out their mistakes , or alternatively , the green x can be pressed which clears the hand drawn content from the entire screen . Once the children are happy with their work , they can press the green show button for each sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The app has a range of activities for each punctuation mark featured , including an explanation and activity if necessary . <p> If the app is worked through in a linear manner , it is possible to work through all of the punctuation marks , starting from full stops before moving to question marks , exclamation marks , commas , apostrophes , speech marks , brackets , dashes , colons , semicolons , bullet points and hyphens . <p> What I really like about this app is its attention to detail , making it a very comprehensive resource . For example , the material for question marks provides examples of a variety of question types including yes/no , either/or , closed and open questions . Likewise , the material for commas explains how they can be used to separate items in a list , as well as being used to break up large sentences and separate extra information in sentences . In addition , the apostrophe material explains the difference in usage between ownership and omission . These are all highly useful features for anybody wanting to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities also ask the children to try writing their own sentences using the notes function , which can be accessed from the top left hand side of the screen . Once this function is selected , the children can type up a heading , for example brackets , and then move to the bottom of the screen to practise writing their own sentences . Whilst the app does not correct the childrens input on this screen , the children can save their notes so that their teacher or parent could look at them and work through their sentences together . The saved notes can be accessed at any time by clicking on the notes icon . <p> Returning our attention to the main menu screen , the learning objectives supported by the app can be displayed by selecting the Learning Objectives tab on the right hand side . Furthermore , on the top left hand side , there is a help screen detailing the main icons and features of the app can be found , and an ability to add/change users and view their progress . <p> The progress feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a child is struggling . <p> Alongside the main content regarding punctuation marks , strength of the app is the fun features menu that is accessible from the main landing page . Here , children can select various activities which can be used as a way to reinforce and assess their understanding including a Quiz , Capital Letters , Apostrophe and Missing Punctuation activities . <p> The Quiz , which has 3 different levels of difficulty , is a multiple choice activity that covers different punctuation marks as highlighted in the topics covered boxes beneath the quiz level selection boxes . Once a quiz level has been selected and questions have been completed , a screen outlining all of the questions asked in the quiz , alongside the response given and the answer are presented . There is also function which allows an email address to be entered so that a copy of the results can also be sent via email , to a parent , guardian or teacher . Having finished the quiz , it is also possible to play again , and what is great is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , which really allows children the opportunity to practise and increase in confidence . <p> The Capital Letters activity is a fast paced timed 60 second activity where children must decide which word in a sentence needs to be capitalised , and the Apostrophe activity requires children to choose the correctly punctuated sentence out of selection of sentences . The Missing Punctuation activity is my favourite activity which draws together all previous punctuation knowledge . It presents children with a section of text which lacks punctuation , and requires the children to drag down the appropriate punctuation mark from the selection . <p> Progress data for all of the Fun Features can be accessed at any time from the drop down menu at the top left hand side of the main menu screen . Again , an email address can be entered so that a progress report can be sent on to a parent , guardian or teacher . <p> The app looks great as it uses strong , bright colours and is very easy to navigate and use . Pictures where used , are attractive and the font @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using it and feel that children would feel the same way . Overall , I thoroughly enjoyed using this app and think it is a valuable resource for educators who are trying to teach punctuation . 41962 @qwx661962 <p> This fun and interactive app is packed full of engaging educational content and stimulating assessment activities that are appropriate for a whole range of ages and abilities . Within our Punctuation app users can learn about and practice using a wide variety of punctuation marks including ; full stops , question marks , exclamation marks , commas , apostrophes , speech marks , brackets , dashes , colons and semicolons , bullet points and hyphens.

@@75177676 @3877676/ <h> Podcasting to enhance expressive language <p> We are all now aware of the powerful potential of the podcast to share a message to a huge audience across the internet . Schools are increasingly using this medium to promote what they do and share their experiences . Allowing children to share their own work let 's parents and other family members hear progress being made . <p> One area in particular in which we have used podcasting , is in the development of speech and language skills . Many children with autism have difficulties with expressive language and by using podcasts you have the potential to identify and target difficulties in this particular area . Three years ago we as a school wanted to focus more on the development of expressive language with our pupils so we decided to create a school radio station called Speak FM . All pupils within the school have 4 Individual Education Plan ( IEP ) targets that are worked on each term . 1 of these targets has a speech and language focus which we decided to incorporate into the Speak FM project . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children whilst producing a podcast that focussed on a particular book that each class was following at the time . <p> After introductory training for teachers on podcasting , each class in the school was tasked with creating a podcast by the end of term . During the training , we focussed on the use of Garageband and iTalk Recorder to show how easy it was to create a podcast . The school had been using Audacity as a means to record children in the past as it was installed on the school system , while other podcasting apps available include Podbean , Voice Thread , Mobile Podcaster and iPadio . The use of mobile devices to now do this was agreed as a more attractive and engaging option , especially for more collaborative work . Many good questions were raised during the course of the session such as : how could our non-verbal children access these activities ? ' This question , among others of a similar nature , led to a brainstorming of potential solutions including the teacher becoming the lead presenter , asking questions which could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication . Although their answer would not necessarily be heard on the podcast , their preferred medium of communication would be used and reiterated by the teacher and they therefore would still be a part of the process . <p> With my own class , I introduced podcasts that were related to their own particular interests . At the time , these were based around Pokemon , Lego and various video games . These days , many of our pupils listen to various podcasts about Minecraft . We then established our E-safety rules for creating a podcast , these included ; not using your real name , not giving out personal information and using appropriate language throughout . <p> I then let the children explore Garageband on the iPad , using the stingers and various jingles available which really engaged the children . During the following literacy lessons , I got the children to work together to prepare for the podcast the book we were following at the time was The Butterfly Lion by Michael Morpurgo . <p> The children in a group of 5 created a script in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show and worked really well to do so throughout . One child took the lead in asking the questions whilst the others took turns in answering . The children recorded the first practice podcast and we listened back to it once they had finished . Before listening back , I asked the children to listen for parts in where they could improve . During the first recording there was lots of dead air ' and the children quickly recognised that this could be improved . This was a good point to show them how to edit away the dead air and they quickly picked up on how to do this . Some of the children wanted to re-record their answers and in these moments I reminded them of their IEP targets . <p> The following day I asked the group to listen again to their podcast to identify how it could be improved further , they all agreed that they should completely re-record the podcast as they felt it could be a lot better .

On one occasion a pupil interviewed his great-grandmother who was an evacuee during WW2 . <p> Create a podcast on e-safety <p> The possibilities are endless for ways in which podcasts can be used . Let your children listen to other podcasts before they start . This is a great way of finding out what they are all about and discovering what it is possible to do .

Within many of our classroom we have pupils of diverse nationalities , religions and from countries around the world who 's ancestors , if not immediate relatives have come from many different parts of the globe . We embrace such diversity within our schools so providing children with a deeper understanding of the cultures and people that make up our society is increasingly important.Apps lend themselves really well to opening up discussion and learning around topics of Geography ( both human and physical ) . With interaction and game-play to allow for fun and collaborative interactions between pupils , there is huge opportunity for you to incorporate geography apps in your lessons . <p> To this end , here are our top tips for Geography success , as ever with a digital twist : <p> 1 ) Dynamic Data There are some great apps that work in a similar way to traditional atlases but are more interactive and easier for a child ( even a very young one ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , land mass etc is easy using apps such as Barefoot World Atlas .

Many of the geography apps that we review come with different language modes and so offer an opportunity , not just for English as an additional language children to have a way to easily access information , but for pupils to learn terminology and phases in different languages too . <p> 3 ) Clock the country Many children struggle when it comes to knowing where countries , and even the seven continents , are on an atlas .

Now with many apps such as Globe Earth 3D Pro , children have a portable bank of geographical knowledge ! <p> 5 ) Compare and Contrast Children like to imagine themselves living in different countries and having contrasting lives . Learning about children of a similar age but in very different cultures , climates and locations is always interesting for pupils and a good way to help them to develop empathy . Considering housing , schooling and hobbies make other cultures very real for our pupils .

It appears that today 's teenagers can not sit in silence and purely study for long periods , a detriment to the times . Last minute cramming before the exam , studying into the early hours of the morning , the appearance of endless energy drinks and poor diets .

@@75177706 @3877706/ <h> Tips for Parents : Ways to Help Your Child with Reading Comprehension <p> Reading comprehension is something that children can struggle with in a test format , and a topic which can be pretty daunting to even the most avid readers . <p> We as adults enjoy reading for pleasure , without the pressure of having to answer a variety of questions on what we are reading , including tricky inference ones . Getting our children to practice reading comprehension , in a non-pressurised way , is a careful balance we as parents need to get right ! <p> Exposing children to a variety of texts is really important , as is the over-riding importance of developing a love of reading . To that end , any reading comprehension practice ( and revision for primary-aged kids in general ) should be undertaken in a non-pressurised way . Which is why using apps for revision to a great way to change the focus and provide an alternative way of working . In our experience , kids love using apps for revision ! <p> Give children plenty of exposure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditionally published and in digital formats . This could and should include newspapers ( both on and offline ) , poems ( there are some great poetry apps including The Poetry App ) , different fiction and non-fiction genres or styles . <p> Comprehension shouldnt just focus on writing the answer . It could just as well be a conversation or discussion . Inference ( reading between the lines ) comes from a broad- understanding and is often helped by ideas generated in conversation . So discuss a text together and give your child plenty of opportunity to chat about a book you are reading together . A book or app-based book or story at bedtime is a great opportunity for this . Try Rockfords Rock Opera , great for all ages ! <p> Kids love acting out a scene for a book so encourage role play activities at home with you taking part too ! - Acting out a scene from a book or poem brings it to life and helps spark other ideas too . <p> Reading text out loud means children process WHAT is written . Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however old they are . <p> Have fun ! Have a bit of down time from straight text and get children reading purely for fun using fun reading apps like Reading Trainer . Through word searches and other word games , theyll be building their reading ability without even realising it !

Utilising a number of strong features including storytelling the app personalises the learning of the individual to maximise the learning outcomes of the young person using the app . This app is best used for young people with a reading age of around 6-9 and could be used for older EAL pupils . The main aim of the app is help shorten the time that it takes for a young person to become an independent reader . 41963 @qwx661963 41964 @qwx661964 <p> This app has been extremely well produced . It is clear to see from both the app itself but also via the developers website as well as from the content within the app . From visiting the developers website and reading the guidance that comes with the app it is clear to see they are a very knowledgeable company who have put a lot of time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce results . Unlike some literacy and phonic apps that claim that they do make a difference this developer has spent time undertaking research in school settings to make sure their app not only meets the needs of schools and the users but that it does have some benefit . It is small aspects like this from a developer that really gives confidence in an app when you are choosing between so many apps in such a saturated market especially when school budgets are tight and they are looking to maximise the resources that they do purchase . <p> The app itself is very well designed , matching the work that has clearly gone on behind the scenes in developing the content . The opening of the app feels very much like the beginning of a tv programme or a films trailer . It introduces the user the world of Lumos and tells the story of the beings that live there . Immediately the user is drawn into the app as they are challenged to go on an adventure to learn . The crux of the story is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congregate around the learning tree which lights up when new things are learnt . This then follows through when the user begins to play the app itself as the content of the app is accessed by clicking on the branches of the learning tree . The learning comes in the form of sounds that the user works their way through lighting up each branch on their completion . <p> The learning within the app is also personalised so not only does a user set up their own account but the app learns from the ability of the user to adapt the learning to what they require . This is done by helping the user discover and learn the sounds they do not know and by allowing them to progress at their own progress . Using formative assessment , the app very much fits into the school setting although it could also be used at home too . The app suggests that users try to learn at least three new sounds a day and this can be tracked . From the developers research when the app is used over a 20-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Importantly the app is discreetly checking how secure a user is with their knowledge of each sound and will detect the level of this competency . If it detects ( using a powerful algorithm ) that it is not secure the knowledge tree will suggest for this learning to again be undertaken . <p> Not only is the content of the app one of the biggest features , alongside the usability of the app but there are also a number of different added bonuses that really add value to the learning of the app too . One if these is utilising the microphone in the app to allow the user to record their own voice saying the words to see if the match up with the correct answer and also to see videos of the sounds being pronounced and the mouth formations created whilst pronouncing them . This is useful in helping young users see first-hand how the sounds are produced especially if they are struggling with this . Another massive bonus is the sheer volume of content that the app contains . Over 90 sounds and 1800 words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways and by so many different types of people . For instance , older EAL students could easily benefit from an app like this as they are able to access so many words in a friendly learning environment . Supplementing this are hard copies of mats and posters provided by the developer to help further extend and embed the learning . <p> Overall this is an excellent app that will work extremely well in both the education and home settings . With so many literacy and phonics app this one will certainly stand out with its design , content and learning potential . 41962 @qwx661962 <p> " Sounds English Phonics is an excellent product which was complementary to our existing teaching programme .

It can sometime be a challenge to take children to galleries , either because of distance , cost or organisation but , by bringing art to children through digital devices , they can get a sense of the wonder of the art and even interact with the pieces they see . <p> To this end , here are our top tips to help you open up your class to art appreciation : <p> 1 ) Select your pieces- carefully- - Children relate particularly well to art that includes people . They like to think about historical contexts and to imagine themselves in a given time or place . With this in mind , select at least some pieces to view that have people in them . They could be people of different ages , in different settings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of subjects in a variety of contexts . <p> 2 ) Use open questions and peer discussion- - Encourage peer discussion around an open question such as " what do you think the subject is thinking and why ? " Youll be wowed by the childrens responses and justification for their answers ! <p> 3 ) Make it cross-curricular With time being squeezed for practical art opportunities , there is even less time and opportunity for art appreciation in the timetable . However , if planned carefully , art appreciation can be brought into other subject areas using a cross-curricular or creative curriculum approach . Even if your week is n't topic-based ( which generally lends itself well to art ) it can- be featured in maths , science , history and more . <p> 4 ) Keep it relevant - Children like to compare art that they see with their own lives and so , by choosing art where a direct comparison can be made , this will make for an interesting and successful lesson . For example art that features child subjects or a setting that they are familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add a extra dimension of interest for your pupils . <p> 5 ) Compare and contrast Try to choose a wide variety of pieces with at least one common theme ( for example representations of children in art ) . that way they have an immediate point of reference and can- feedback accordingly . <p> Apps can open up art that might otherwise be inaccessible but to get a real feeling of the size , texture and feeling that live art produces do try to take your class to a local gallery if you can .

Having quick mental recall of times table facts gives children a leg up when it comes to working out mathematical problems and means they are able to work out more complex sums quicker and with greater confidence . <p> Times tables run through most areas of mathematical practice and , if children have to spend time working out a times table fact before progressing with a second step , they are already at a disadvantage . <p> Apps lend themselves really well to learning and practising times tables as the functions and interactivity mean that children can measure their success , challenge themselves and progress with confidence . There are some really super times table apps out there , but look for ones that allow you and your children to integrate the following top tips for times table success : <p> 1 ) Confident counters Multiplication is repeat addition so make sure your child is fluent with counting forwards and backwards from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp of number concepts such as number bonds , addition and subtraction is key . <p> 2 ) Look for patterns Using a multiplication 100-square ( find one in the- Squeebles- app ) ask your child what patterns they can find in each times table . Children love to find patterns such as sequences of odd or even numbers . Can they identity and test some rules ? Does the 10 times table always end in the same digit ? What about the 5s ? What do they notice about multiples of 2s or 4s ? So many fun patterns ! And , if they colour the multiples in on the number square itll make some pretty ( and regular ) patterns too ! <p> 3 ) Vocab victory Children need to be fluent in the vocabulary associated with , not such multiplication , but all four number operations ( addition , subtraction , multiplication and division ) . There are many ways to say the same thing and children should be asked the same multiplication sum in different ways so that multiplication vocabulary becomes part of their tool box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 , 2 multiplied by 3 , 2 lots of 3 , two threes and what 's the product of 2 and 3 ? <p> 4 ) - Make it visual- Many children ( not just visual learners ) need to associate mathematical number problems with a pictorial representation , to fully grasp an otherwise tricky abstract concept . Using counting blocks , counters , buttons or even sweets , show simple multiplication sentences in a visual way . Ask your child to group items or order them in simple arrays to match a given multiplication sum so that they match them together , making that association and cementing the image in their mind . <p> 5 ) Do n't  learn them in order Times tables should n't be learnt in ascending order . The easiest to start with is actually 10s followed by 5s and then 2s , then ( generally ) 11s , 4s , 3s , 9s and lastly 6s , 8s and 7s . This is because the sequencing of the earlier tables is easier to grasp ( ending in 0 or 5 ) , there are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a simple finger trickassociated with it , and so onRemember practice makes perfect ! The key is little and often , but make it fun and motivational too . Apps are great here and so easy to get immediate results and feedback from .

The latter items have been part of students ' lives for many years now . In them , lies the difference between homework being done or not , on time or late , done correctly or done wrongly . <p> It 's a pity then that this item of such importance is so often lost and , with it , the chance for a student to avoid the sanctions of homework not done . It is also a shame that children 's confidence in their ability to later translate the few cryptic words with which they have described their homework in their journals is rarely justified . Notes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages of the journal , falling out and deteriorating as the days pass . <p> Homework journals have never been up to their task of standing between a student and the steely gaze of a teacher asking where the due homework is . An app comes to the rescue in the form of Show My Homework . <p> Schools using this app overcome the problems with homework journals . It is no longer possible for a child to lose the record of all of their set homework . It is the teacher 's words that describe the task , not the child 's distracted and rushed scribble . For the conscientious student , they ca n't let themselves down . For the unconscientious student , there are far fewer ways to justify a homework no show . <p> Supporting resources are also managed by the app . Supporting notes and worksheets are appended as downloadable documents . Multiple-choice activities and spelling tests can be created by teachers using the app 's website . This gives teachers the tools to create quick , self-marking homework . <p> Teachers benefit from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow as much lesson time to set it . References and helpful comments can be made throughout the lesson knowing that the task itself will automatically be pushed to children 's accounts . Recording and tracking the homework is also easy in the teacher 's part of the account . <p> Parents are also brought into the process . Children ca n't suggest they have no homework if their parent can see exactly what they have been set . This involvement does n't have to be purely as an overseer either . Seeing the homework tasks might prompt an idea for parents to make children 's learning more enjoyable . A piece of history homework might prompt a visit to a local museum . A maths task might remind a parent of a tip that their own teachers gave them . <p> The differences between how the different types of users experience the app are mostly to do with what they can update . Parents have the ability only to read what students and teachers have added . Students can check off their tasks as they complete them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates . Students and teachers can also easily pass on messages about the homework to each other . <p> Access to the actual homework is flexible .

It is fully featured for its specific purpose but not bloated with superfluous features . This keeps it simple to use for everybody . Schools that adopt it will need to put a little work in at the start to ensure that it is universally supported and used by staff , parents and students .

@@75177723 @3877723/ <h> Grow Grammar <p> An English Language app that helps children learn about the structure of sentences and how to construct and deconstruct them . There are many elements in the app that aid young people in becoming more proficient in their grammar knowledge and would sit as comfortably in the home for individual use as it would in the classroom for group or solo work . 41963 @qwx661963 41964 @qwx661964 <p> This app has been developed with the American Core Standards in mind however there is certainly enough about this app to make it useful in country where young people want to become more proficient in the English Language especially concerning grammar and the construction of sentences . From looking on the developers website there are lots of small chunks of information to help build up an understanding that they are knowledgeable in this area and this adds a lot of weight to the quality of the app . Also on the website are videos explaining how a user can get the most out of the app with explanations on how the app works and all the elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are given a tutorial on how the app works and how the user can build sentences and even gives some examples of these sentences . You immediately notice that the layout of the page is extremely clean and slightly clinical , giving it a definite education/learning feel . This is n't to say this is a bad thing and that it detracts from the learning , more that there are not extras on the screen that might themselves distract learning . The look and feel also fits perfectly well with a slightly older audience . The content is above lower primary and so the look and gameplay would invariably be different . <p> Through the examples the app shows how a simple sentence is broken down in its composite parts such as noun and verb phrases and then articles , adjectives , nouns and verbs . It does this by showing the links through a simple line connecting each word in the sentence to the correct grammatical feature such as noun or verb . In looks it is very similar to looking at a drawing of family tree and just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words . <p> Once through the tutorial the user can decide to tackle two different ways of utilising the app . The can decide to simply create sentences of to enter the challenge mode where they are given a sentence and then have to deconstruct it back to the root . Each of the different options is equally good at helping children to understand how a sentence is put together and what all the different grammatical aspects of a sentence are . In the create option there is more flexibility in being able to play around with the construction of sentences and would probably suit someone who wants to improve their grammatical knowledge through experimenting and with 4 different levels , getting more complex as they work through , there is certainly a lot of learning that can go on . The challenge option has a more rigid structure where the user works through six sets of five different sentences over the four levels in the app . As you would imagine the sentences get more complex as the user works through the levels and this an excellent way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in an educational setting to differentiate between the users depending on their prior knowledge and proficiency . <p> At any point in the app the user can capture the sentence they are working on or have completed so they can use it at a later date and this also allows an educator to keep a track of the understanding of the individuals or groups using the app . In the top right hand corner there is also a question mark which allows the user some extra guidance if they are struggling with anything in particular . The main content of the app is run completely from one page and this certainly adds to the usability of the app meaning there is no back and forth between pages . Again this is definitely in keeping with a more mature app for a slightly older child to use . <p> Overall this is a good app for helping young people gain more proficiency in grammar which in turn has such a big impact on their overall literacy abilities . 41962 @qwx661962 <p> Watch kids grow a firm grasp of the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy way by constructing and deconstructing sentences . <p> Guided by Common Core standards , Grow Grammar was developed for elementary and middle school students , and provides a fresh contemporary approach to a traditional subject . A knowledge of grammar principles is now believed by many educators to enhance and support the development of literacy skills including reading and writing . An understanding of grammar is also important for learning other languages . <p> Grow Grammar is a classroom app which works equally well in the home , and is suitable for environments where iPads are shared . It is effective for both group activities and individual study . <p> Grow Grammar comes equipped with two modes of interaction : " create " and " challenge " . In " create " mode , students build their own sentences using a dynamic , grammar-based tree structure . In " challenge " mode , students work in the opposite direction by analyzing the underlying grammar and correctly identifying parts of speech : articles , nouns , verbs , adjectives and prepositions . <p> Grow Grammar has four levels for students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With each successive level , students grapple with increasingly complex grammatical structures and more advanced vocabulary .

This is the student or home version and is therefore more directed towards to individual . There is also the lite version which is a slightly watered down version , as you would expect , and finally a classroom version , coming in at the more expensive end of 69.99 . The classroom version includes a getting started guide as well as the ability to set up 30 users on the system . However , you can not delete users so these 30 licenses must be used sensibly . The developer also has a website which contains some FAQs about the app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On opening the app the user is immediately given 3 different options ; An Introduction , Let 's Go , and Results . On clicking on the Introduction tab the user is taken to a different window where there is an explanation and guideline on how to make the most out of the app . This is an extremely formative guideline giving over lots of information which includes the recommended length of the test as well as the research behind the product . Probably the most informative part though is the section on working with the learner . This gives a real good basis for using the test with the individual and how to structure the session as well as how to get the most out of each of the sessions . There is also information in this section on the types of help that a user can access in completing the tests and further information on the sentences themselves . <p> The app is extremely easy to use and the user can quickly and simply move through the menus and back to the homepage and navigate through the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design and usability where the content is the most important feature rather than the look of the app . <p> The next option on the home screen menu takes you into the main content of the app . This is preceded by a small window where you can select which level you would like to go from . This ranges from 1-8 with the higher the number indicating the difficulty level . Once this is selected then a new window opens where the main content of the app is . In the window you are given the sentence that the user will be reading and spelling as well as some further information . For instance at the top of the screen you can see clearly which level you are currently on and which group of sentences you are also on ( the sentences are grouped 4 at a time ) . You are also given the number of attempts it has taken you to get the sentence correct . At the bottom of the page there is also further guidance on how the user can use certain interventions to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the look of the words , whether they sound right or whether the user has any prior knowledge of similar words that may be able to help them . This is perfect in helping the user become more independent in their reading and writing and instilling in them strategies they can use to guide their work and the importance of reflection in their work too . <p> The sentences are the main part about the app and the aim is for the user to listen and read to the sentence and then attempt to spell it . To help them access the sentence they can have it read out loud to them . This is where my main criticism lies with the app . The app utilises the text to voice application but the speed and pronunciation can be really unclear . This can result in some words sounding very different to what they should be such as did sounding like did n't  . However , on their website the developer is clearly aware of this and states that they are looking at ways to slow the speed the speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an understanding of what the sentence is and that they are confident in attempting to spell it they click on the spell option . This hides the original sentence so the user has to remember and use the suggested strategies to attempt to get the sentence correct . Once they have done this they can submit their version . In the app guide it goes into detail about how the user should use the strategies to make sure they are confident with their answer before they submit . Again , this is really good in teaching students strategies to help them proof read and correct their work . <p> Once the user has submitted their answer they can then compare the sentence they have written to that of the original sentence . If they need to they can also have the sentence played out to them again . When the user gets the sentence correct they can then move onto the next one . <p> Once the user has finished they are able to go back to the main menu where they can click on the final tab , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the sentences and the success as well as the number of attempts for each one . This is a really useful guide in helping to target and personalise the learning for the user . They can clearly see which ones they either got incorrect or which ones they struggled on , highlighted by a higher number of attempts . These can then be revisited to maximise the usefulness of the app and the learning of the individual . <p> Overall this app has many excellent uses but importantly is a real good app for students in helping them to improve their reading and writing . There is plenty of support within the app to help users make the most of all the features . Although there are 8 different levels of difficulty within the app I would certainly suggest that there could be a higher level version created to help older students who are struggling with their literacy .

However , there is scope for this app to enter into the realm of education and the classroom in a more direct way . Word Magic Software has taken the initial steps , in this regard , by introducing a flash cards option to the app . Users , merely , need to " star " or favourite a series of words up to a maximum of one hundred , according to your in-app settings and can then access these words collectively through the favourites " star " at the bottom of the screen . The flash cards can then be flipped to reveal meanings in both languages and is further accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After each card has been studied the user can like or dislike the card in accordance with whether he or she is confident with that particular piece of language .

Yet with updates being regularly pushed out , I hope it will not be too long before additional elements to complement the flash cards come to fruition . One such recommendation so to genuinely endear this app to teachers would be to add a review game for your flash card groupings , with the possibility of sharing your scores across social media . As a teacher , the idea of having my classes sign up to a set of words that I have " favourited " and then compete to achieve the best score and/or time , for example , would be invaluable as an informal motivational and progress-tracking tool .

The four experiments are explained with a list of things you need , a set of instructions to follow and the all-important reason of how it works . <p> There is a lot of fun to be had in the Arcade room where three basic games can be played . They are loosely based on chemistry ( Kaflooey Ka-Splat ! , a matching chemicals game ) , biology ( Honey Bee-Spree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , completing circuits game ) . Each game is easy to pick up and there are two levels of difficulty to keep you entertained . <p> As with the cartoon TV show this app is aimed at primary school aged children who are beginning to connect with the world around them using a scientific mind . Their interest and curiosity will be fed in many different ways by this app . Significantly , most of what they can learn is found through their own investigating because the app does n't  follow any set path , it is up to the user to go where they want , when they want . <p> Some of the scientific language can be a bit inconsistent ; it is sometimes slightly too complex for the average pre-teen scientist . With this in mind a nice addition to a possible future update would be to include a glossary of scientific terms for each section and this might help those learners who are enthusiastic about knowing more . 41962 @qwx661962 <p> Together with Thomas Edison , the greatest inventor of all time , the Secret Lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , its a BLAST !

You start by either focusing on up to 3 phonemes or practise all of them in series of 10 , 25 or 50 questions .

Still , there are many wonderful iPad and Android drawing apps - some free , some very inexpensive - that let children express their artistic side . Some of the art apps also let kids collaborate with each other , or share their artwork with parents or with other children . <p> Take a virtual coloring book or easel with you wherever you go with these playful and colorful drawing apps . You could never carry this many paintbrushes , crayons , or sticks of chalk in your purse , and now you do n't have to . <p> Do you want to be the next Picasso ? Even if you prefer to draw with pen and paper over a stylus and tablet , these apps and games are perfect picks to turn your device into a digital sketchbook . Kids of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , explore their interests in animation and comic creation , and even gain inspiration from museums all over the world . There are also valuable apps available for advanced artists to refine their skills . <p> This unique app does more than simply encourage artistic creation . It introduces young learners to the masterful works of modern art from MoMA . The app includes nine activities inspired by famous works of art , including creating a mobile , making a chance collage , and creating a shape poem . There 's even an activity where students collaborate on a group drawing . The app let 's students share their artwork via email or on Twitter , and even send it to MoMA . <p> MOMA matches an artists work with the activity to educate children about modern art while creating their own masterpieces . KinderTown really likes how the activity directions can all be read aloud to children making the app accessible to children as young as four . <p> The Anti-colouring Book app is a unique concept by Susan Striker that steps away from the traditional colouring book pages and encourages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than colour in a pre-conceived drawing . Overall we love the concept of the Anti-colouring app and how it will open young minds to creativity and imagination . Its a great idea that will appeal to an audience of all ages where the possibilities are endless . <p> Upon opening the app the user is shown several options : To begin a new drawing , to look at the art gallery of saved drawings or to learn more about the author . We believe that the latter options should have been left off the main menu as this stage . The graphics here are self-explanatory if not a little pixelated . <p> Richard Galbraith 's Cartoon Workshop 1 is a neat app for iPads that helps children learn to draw in a cartoon style . The app contains seventy two different cartoon drawings , each of which is broken down into steps to make it easier to copy and follow the process . A second iPad app , called " Richard Galbraith 's Cartoon Workshop 2 " is also available , which follows exactly the same format , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for children who want to learn more , or for variety of content . <p> Throughout the app , the style is very simple and user friendly , and each of the cartoon illustrations is designed well to appeal to children . The themes will also be engaging to the target audience , with the first app containing simple drawings , heroes , villains , animals , cute cartoons and funky food , whilst the second app contains people , fantasy drawings , the sea , aliens , robots and cool stuff . Each category has twelve drawings within it , and the style and design is consistently high throughout both apps . <p> ExplorArt Klee is an interactive art appbook from Lapisly that is designed to introduce children to Paul Klee and his work . Paul Klee was a prolific 20th Century Swiss- German artist who combined influences from many different artistic movements , including Expressionism , Cubism , and Surrealism . He greatly admired childrens artwork and tried to achieve a child-like simplicity in his own work . <p> The app would be a great way for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Paul Klee 's work . It is also a wonderful source of inspiration for talking points and lessons . It could even become part of some cross-curricular work . How the veins of a leaf define the shape of a leaf and their similarity to trees , can cross to science lessons . For music lessons , the strong link between this artist 's work and music belie his talent with a violin . It is n't explicitly said so in the app , but it also touches on fractals for maths lessons . <p> Start With Art By Madcap Logic , LLC is a great art educational tool that is curriculum based and offers high quality animated videos and learning activities through four lessons . The app features three fun characters Furnace , Ruby and Tickles - that help children learn about the world of art and creativity . The app meets the National Standards for the Visual Arts , and for all the content that you get it is very good value for money . <p> What we liked about the Start With Art is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find more about art and explore the subject . This is a multi award winning app and a joy to play and learn with it . Do n't  let the price discourage you from trying this app ! Its totally worth it ! <p> How to Draw-Full Version contains seven drawing " episodes " that teach kids -- even younger kids -- how to sketch a dog , cat , space shuttle , princess , and more . The verbal instructions , given by a childlike voice , are clear and very step-by-step . The on-screen cues disappear after a line is drawn and the user moves to the next portion of the lesson , which means only your kid 's rendition of the drawing is left visible for him or her to color , erase , save , and send via email . In the end , it really looks like your kid " freehanded " the entire drawing , which is sort of the case -- just with a lot of help . <p> With How to Draw , kids learn practical steps for drawing specific objects like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes and part-whole/whole-part relationships . It 's instructional for kids to see , step-by-step , how shapes such as circles of various sizes or a triangle play a role in various parts of the body of an object or animal .

Learning to draw is n't easy for some kids , but this step-by-step app removes most of the frustration while increasing the fun . 41965 @qwx661965

The app presents both domestic and rare wild animals and also features an interesting fact on each of the animals . Cute Baby Animals also has a puzzle mode where children can test and enhance their visualisation skills and eye-to-hand coordination . Its a lovely way of teaching animals to young children and we think its worth making the in-app purchase to access all the animals . The app receives a 5 star EAS Certification . 41963 @qwx661963 41964 @qwx661964 <p> Cute Baby Animals by Polygon Play is an educational app that helps toddlers and small kids to learn about animals . The app is contains 40 pages of the cutest puppies , kittens , bunnies and cubs ranging from a Jack Russell Terrier to a Sumatran Tiger . <p> What parents need to know is that the app has a Parental Gate so that children can not make any in-app purchases or follow any link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a little guidance with certain features . The free version of the App includes only 8 animals and you will have to make a single $2 in-app purchase to get access to all the animals . <p> The main screen opens with an adorable blue-eyed black lemur as a background and you will see the big Play button , a control function for the music/sound on the top right corner and on the bottom left corner the More Games button which is protected by a multiplication operation . This will allow parents to visit the Polygon Play website where they can find information on other apps . <p> We were impressed with the high-definition graphics and the quality of the photos . The app has a full retina support for all devices and we have to say that it looks stunning on the iPad . The background music is really comforting and the female voice over is smooth and clear . Pressing Play will open with the navigation screen where you will see one animal in our case the first one was a Maltese puppy but every time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen you will see a set of information in the top left corner : the name of the animal , the age and an interesting fact about it . You can not zoom in , but if you click on the animal the voice over will say the name of the animal reading out the interesting facts would have been a good add-on for pre-readers . <p> You can scroll left to right through all the animals and if you want to see them all on the screen press on the first hexagon on the right . Pressing on the second hexagon gives children the possibility of browsing the animals as puzzles . The puzzle game mode adds hexagonal shapes that tessellate on top of the animal images and children can drag the shapes into the right place . We believe that the correction , whether a puzzle piece is placed in the correct or wrong place , should be more emphasized in order to help children understand they 've got it wrong or right . All this is very subtly done at the moment by making the images lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short audio sound . The images can be moved all around the screen and are not being taken back to the pile . One glitch that we noticed is that when you place parts of the puzzle pieces at the end of the screen you 're on and then decide to move to another picture of a baby animal , parts of the puzzle from the previous will be visible - we are sure this could easily be rectified with an update . <p> The stunning pictures of animals are a joy to watch and finding interesting facts ( like our favourite about the Blue-eyed Black Lemurs who are the only primates other than humans to consistently have blue eyes ) makes Cute Baby Animals a must have app for animal lovers . The app is very useful for developing conceptual skills and kids will adore the appealing content . It is a relaxing app and we hope the team at Polygon Play will continue to add more beautiful baby animals .

These are best described below . <p> There are 6 items here focusing on a split screen where the user has to match the shapes .

Very often small children with limited fine motor skills struggle to place objects accurately on a device using their fingers .

Each graphical prize awarded is linked to a similar theme , for instance , creating a house or creating an alien . The reward element really focused the children to explore more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved in their own gallery . Once again here the graphics are visually stunning , quirky , funny and use vivid colours . <p> Level 2 Shape constancy : Children use their developing visual-spatial skills to explore and recall a variety of shape combinations . <p> This level again explores matching shapes but also asks the user to expand and reduce the shapes to fit . The application also has a number of prompts to help the user move through the tasks with pace . We did find that the application works best on a tablet device than that of a mobile when expanding and reducing the shapes with their fingers . <p> Level 3 Two Shape combinations and orientations . Children explore and recall spatial relationships with shapes in frontal and rotated positions . As we reach the 3rd level we found that the app really builds on the previous skills and enables children to gain confidence . It goes without saying that the rotation of a shape is quite tricky but our users handled this with ease due to previous learning . <p> Level 4 Triangles : Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isosceles , equilateral and right angled triangles . Maybe further information can be given about these types of shapes ? <p> Level 8 Bringing it all together : Children use all the skills learnt in the previous levels to explore and imagine with a wide range of shape combinations .

I was expecting something different or a reward when we had completed all of the levels . <p> The ' Picture it ' gallery This part of the app features after each item is completed and provides the user with a new creative graphic every time .

This is ideal for a multiplayer situation or a classroom task . The teacher can move around the classroom creating patterns within the split screen for the child to match .

The developers could consider a differentiated approach with each level having a starting set of shapes ; easy , medium and hard . The developers could also consider a scoring system for the app to create a competitive leader board . It is also noted that the narration is in American English , this is minimal , however the developers may consider other languages , this could have a great global appeal as most of the app focuses on visual aspects . <p> We discovered that the thinking behind the application comes from the Agam Method .

One note to take into consideration is that you have to be patient and persevere as the app contains many videos and each new lesson is unlocked if you complete all the parts in the previous . <p> The lessons are a perfect tool for both teachers and parents to use for stimulating children to engage in creative activities and to learn that art is accessible to everyone . All the lessons are build on the sayART , seeART and do ART.Each lesson offers activities to support the learning and unleash all the ideas children will have : <p> Art as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression and as a visual language and what you can communicate through art . Learn how artists like Leonardo da Vinci , Michelangelo , Paul Gauguin and Salvador Dali used art and what their work process was at times ( e.g. Salvador Dali would wake himself up the moment he fell asleep in order to vividly remember and paint surreal dreams he had ) . The lesson ends with a doodle tool that can be used for drawing and painting - the only remark we have is that the painting did n't  always follow our fingers on the screen and at times the pressure sensitivity was n't responsive enough . <p> Messages in Art : Learn how to view art and what questions to ask to better understand it . Discover how to tell stories using colours and watch how a cartoony Michelangelo painted The Last Judgement and other iconic images in the Sistine Chapel . The lesson ends with activities meant to make children draw signs and labels to get a message across - the idea gizmo suggested in our case to make a sign to tell everyone there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds . <p> Line : Meet Edgar the mouse and see his cute demonstrations in order to show you how lines can express emotion , direction and action . See how a line from the eye to a perceived object affects an artwork and how a great composition makes strong use of the natural attraction to lines . By creating powerful lines in your artwork you decide exactly what the viewers eyes should follow and what should hold his attention . After going through all the videos children can try to draw their own maze and use the idea gizmo for personalising it - we were suggested to draw on one side of the maze a fire-fighter who was trying to find the way over to a burning building . <p> Shape and Form : Use what you learned about lines to create different shapes and try to identify a form only by looking at its silhouette . When we create art we always use interesting shapes and this lesson will help children understand how shape and forms are used in different compositions and also to identify and utilise them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create origami models and they can pull the handles of the idea gizmo to get ideas for different animals to make . <p> The app includes an extensive glossary that is useful for users of all ages and our consideration is that the search could be improved with a functional search box . The access to the doodle screen is easily accessible and the game allows saving the art creations to your device . We would suggest that users are asked if they want to save their work before they press the back arrow , as the app does n't  save the drawing if you exit the screen . <p> The videos are great fun to watch and the activities created with the Idea Gizmo will develop your childs creativity and thinking . There 's no doubt regarding the apps educational value and we could easily see it used in an educational setting if the teacher manages to synchronize a certain activity within the app . Parent are not left out as they have a dedicated page to be used as a guide in order to supervise and encourage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content ( all 16 lessons ) there are 32 Creativity Builders . You 'll find information on assignments and what the learning outcomes of the different activities are and soon realise the wonderful fact that kids wont even know they 're learning . <p> As well as being packed full of fun video content , a recent update has added a new interactive dimension to the lessons . Quite a few of the animations now lead to a section that asks children for their input sometimes to give their opinion , at other times to experiment with what they have just learned . For example , when learning about lines , children are guided to switch between different styles of line to convey different emotions or aspects to a story . Understanding silhouettes involves rotating an ice hockey playing polar bear and then snapshotting his form . Another interesting form of interactivity allows children to view the different parts of Michelangelos artistic process by just showing one stage of what is now a finished artwork . <p> The term interactivity shouldnt leave you expecting any game-like mechanics . This is not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow children to look through different examples at their own pace or flick back and forth between alternative settings to compare the differences in the current example . Alongside the rest of its excellent content , it is another way to increase the engagement and interest of its users . <p> What we liked about the Start With Art is that it suggests activities outside the app and that encourages learners to find more about art and explore the subject . This is a multi award winning app and a joy to play and learn with it . Do n't  let the price discourage you from trying this app !

Essentially each one works identically but is distinguished from the others by the topics of maths that it covers and the difficulty of the question . As such this review can be seen to apply to the entire range of Let 's Do Mental Maths from Andrew Brodie apps . These are available individually or as a bundle . <p> Having selected the age appropriate version of this app you will be met with three options . The first provides a general quiz that can help to point out areas to work on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a tightly focussed quiz on a specific subject within maths . The third option shows a selection of timed quizzes with each covering a variety of maths topics . All but the first is initially locked and adequately completing them opens up the subsequent ones . These are general quizzes and do a good job of showing the students progress through the app . <p> The quizzes themselves provide an excellent test of mental arithmetic . Each one is read out by a clear voice and also shown in written format . The visual presentation of the quiz is quite different from competing apps as the questions are presented in a horizontally scrolling format , and the player can look ahead at the questions or even answer them out of order . Occasionally between questions there will be a tip or an extra maths challenge . The longevity of the practice section is ensured by the questions being randomly generated each time . <p> The individual questions are answered by typing the answer into a built in keypad . Two levels of hints can be obtained : The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next hint rules out one of the incorrect options . <p> These apps are ideal for use by an individual student at home or by a whole class at school . Students can enter their names to enable the reporting section of the app to track their engagement and progress with it . These reports provide an excellent breakdown of what each student has attempted and a number of indicators of their performance including their average time per question . To assist teachers in comparing progress and understanding across their class the locked quizzes have their content fixed . This ensures that teachers can be sure that each child has faced the exact same challenge to achieve their results . <p> With an increased focus on arithmetic in primary schools , and this being an area of maths that only practice can develop , apps such as those in this bundle grant a way to build it in to childrens maths tuition and also to monitor this skill without adding any extra administrative burden to teachers .

This may have seen slightly overwhelming for some younger users as levels can not be skipped or jumped . The developers may consider the option to try harder levels throughout the trail without competing previous ones . <p> Level 1 This asks the user to listen carefully to a musical instrument and then identify it from the pictures shown , choosing 1 from 2 .

The user has to achieve 6 correct answers choosing one from three musical instruments . Completing all the stars against a timer , an incorrect answer will reduce the time . Correct answers are rewarded with items for the band . This is shown in the Ferris wheel section . Here the user can have great fun dressing the band members and trying different instruments .

The graphical quality and audio of the app is excellent and it will appeal to both boys and girls . It is a shame that the developers have not included a saved profile within the app .

The cute cartoon graphics along with the humorous animation immediately gives the player the sense of fun and enjoyment , which is of course what gaming is all about . On the flipside , the one thing that the developers have undoubtedly achieved is a high calibre-learning element right at the very heart of this concept . <p> Your cartoon characters , Ruggles and Non Chompsky , are on a space mission to find ice cream and so they head off in their space rocket to explore three different worlds . The red furry-balled Ruggles is transported onto the surface of the planet and travels along on his hover-board . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above a number line with each metre distance marked on it . The bottom half of the screen displays a motion graph and it is up to you to move Ruggles across the screen and match the illustrated motion on the graph . Do a good job and Ruggles gets his ice cream ! <p> Each of the three worlds represents progressively more challenging motion activities . You start from understanding the basics about the relationship between position and time , all the way through to recognising acceleration by calculating the slope of a velocity-time graph . Instructions of how to use the app are also given in snippets as and when you need to know them . There are a large number of challenges to complete , each building on the success of previous challenges you have mastered . For each challenge you will always have a helping hand to remind you of how to control Ruggles on his hoverboard and if you fail the first time then do n't  worry , you will get two more chances . Individual progress is saved automatically and up to five users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graph feature is fully interactive . Co-ordinates can be displayed by simply tapping on the grid and a helpful triangle appears if you tap and hold on one co-ordinate and drag to the next co-ordinate .

There is alternative feature included that can be used to find the slope and it makes use of both the co-ordinates and the slope equation . The mathematics within this section is presented logically as well as being very user-friendly . <p> This app falls clearly into the category of game-based learning and has managed extremely well to balance the gaming with the learning . Teachers will be hugely thankful that for every effort that was made to make it an engaging game , the same if not more effort was made to make it educational .

With a cast of memorable characters and exciting gameplay , students will be on the edges of their seats to understand the meaning behind motion graphs . <p> How does Action Graphing help students learn ? <p> Created by a teacher , Action Graphing employs sound teaching practices in a highly stimulating and fun gaming environment that emphasizes the core concepts of graphing and slope while keeping students engaged . <p> Action Graphing promotes a deeper understanding of position , time , and velocity . It helps students learn two major concepts : ( 1 ) that the slope of a position-time graph represents the object 's velocity ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents the object 's initial position <p> Action Graphing was inspired by a lesson that Matt Blackman , an award-winning high school physics teacher , found to be highly effective in helping students understand motion graphs on an intuitive level . In that lesson , Matt would set up a motion detector in the classroom , and students would move their bodies in order to reproduce a motion graph in real time . Matt found that when the students were able to physically experience the motion that the graphs represent , they developed a far deeper understanding of slope and y-intercept . <p> Action Graphing greatly expands upon Matts lesson and brings it to the palms of students ' hands . Very easy for teachers to use , Action Graphing is designed to supplement , but not replace , the crucial role that teachers play in classroom instruction .

He blogs at www.nick-chater.com and tweets from @nickchater . Here he gives us his opinion on how to choose a great educational app . <p> 1 . Why ? Why do you want to use an app ? What is it that the app will do that you , as the teacher , can not do ? Will the app reinforce the concept you have taught ? Is it a drill and skill , simulation or creative tool ? <p> 2 . One size does not fit all ! What you consider is good , may not be for the learner ! You will know this from your own teaching , so do not make snap judgements and celebrate the rich diversity of routes to authentic learning . <p> 3 . Metacognition . The importance of any app is its ability to stimulate a dialogue between learner and teacher around the concepts that are being taught . The richness of learning conversations that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluating it . <p> 4 . Platform . Do not get bogged down by the devices they are using , a good app will always shine through regardless of a favoured operating system . Many good apps are platform agnostic and can easily be used on any device . <p> 5 . Cost . Free is great , but be warned , the app may not have the essential complexity necessary for a useful learning tool . However a free app may lead you into a suite of paid additional apps that can develop the learner . Essentially it is important not to just ignore the paid apps , there are a vast range of excellent tools . <p> 6 . How do I know which app to choose ? The best way to determine whether the app is suitable for use as a learning tool is to play with it yourself , failing that then find a suitable reviewing website such as this one ! Why ? Because the apps are easily searchable within topics and stages and have been reviewed by experienced practitioners .

It is available in both the Google Play and the Apple store . It consists of 3 packs ; the first one is free and the rest two are paid .

The app is suitable for young children aged 3-6 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the jungle ( first pack : Ancient Jungle Puzzle ) , the deep sea ( second pack : Magical Underwater Puzzle ) and outer space ( third pack : Mysterious Space Puzzle ) . To complete the fox 's journey , children are asked to solve a number of puzzles by matching , sorting and categorising shapes and colours . For example , in the fox 's journey to the jungle , the children are asked to match a triangle , a square and a circle with the corresponding shapes of leaves by dragging shapes to the right position . If the matching is correct children hear the name and colour of the shape e.g. green square . If it is wrong , the chosen shape moves back to its original position indicating to children that they should try another shape . A correct matching often unlocks items such as a snake coming off a pot and brings up new items such as a pyramid . <p> Children can see a map of the entire journey and the position of the fox at a given moment . Yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed all previous puzzles . They can only move backwards and restart the journey .

Overall , the app is well-designed and enjoyable and benefits children in a number of ways , including learning new vocabulary ( shapes and colours ) , practising problem solving , and developing motor skills through dragging and dropping . Yet there are instances when the colour of shapes does not fit the environment within which shapes match such as colourful shapes as missing parts of a grey stone . It would be more realistic if the puzzle activities were better integrated into the fox 's journey and did not appear as a layer added on top of the journey .

However the developers of Hales Tale certainly understand this . <p> The graphics are very similar to popular Minecraft and this immediately gives quite a warm feeling to the app that makes it feel a lot less like an educational app and more like a fun adventure game . In fact , the more you proceed through the app the less it feels like an app aimed at learning to read , especially from a childs perspective .

As the user moves through the game the challenges become harder and introduce more sounds , letters and words with each helping to lay the foundations in creating a proficient reader . <p> This is n't an app that can be used solely as a way to create readers however it makes no claim on this . Instead , the app itself describes the adventure and mini games as helping to strengthen early reading reads such as rhyming , phonemic awareness , letter-sound knowledge and word recognition ( amongst others ) .

The best way to describe the app is as a book where each chapter involves narrated and written story elements alongside full length songs that highlight key aspects of the story . Together , these provide variety within this app , as well as distinguishing it from other apps of this type . <p> While describing this app as a book gives a good idea of how it might be used , it does deviate from the structure of a book in the traditional sense . The chapters are more like scenes made up animation , narration and songs . Page turns are used as a way of cutting between these sections but users of the app do n't  need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes are beautifully drawn in a way that represents the idea of this fantasy imbued rainforest perfectly . The visual interest of these scenes is further enhanced by its stylised animation . Sweeping vistas of the rainforest are panned across with a clever simulation of depth of field controlling levels of focus on different elements . This lends it all a majestic and slightly dreamy aspect that suits the app as a whole perfectly . Individual characters are likely to glide along with these scenes rather than be directly animated in themselves , but it all works well and looks wonderful . <p> As the story develops , the characters , sometimes human , sometimes animal , occasionally plants , burst into full length songs . These are fully developed songs with verses , choruses , full instrumentation and quite often a strong dose of catchiness . You may find yourself wondering where that snippet of tune you keep humming came from , until you remember it was this app . <p> There are a number of uses for The Rainforest Musical : Kakamega . The most obvious is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits of the enhanced aural and visual elements . Both individuals using it alone , and classes watching it unfold on an interactive whiteboard will be drawn into the story . Despite the fantastical elements of the tale , it makes a good job of highlighting the morality and politics of rainforest destruction in a way that children can understand . This makes it an ideal way to introduce rainforests as a topic for geography lessons . <p> The full version of this app requires an in-app purchase but comes with a number of interesting extras . Not just the rest of the story but the musical scores and lyrics for the songs . It will need a musically able teacher , but this could allow it to form the basis of a fantastic class assembly about their work on rainforests . <p> Offering a substantial experience , even without spending any money , there is no reason for not having a good look at this app for its sheer child-pleasing entertainment value . For those who can combine it with a unit of learning about rainforests it becomes even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . <p> Children will enjoy learning fun facts about the rainforest , meeting new animal friends , and playing along with Kakamegas rich musical score ! <p> Kakamega follows the story of Kaka and Yano , young twins who live in the lush , diverse -- but endangered -- rainforest . When Henry , a sick boy from the city , runs away into the forest , Kaka and Yano decide to help him by finding a mythical , magical , healing flower . Joined by singing animals and talking trees , the children make their way through the rainforest . On their journey they discover the dangers of the logging industry , and make it their mission to convince the loggers or the importance of preserving their forest home .

Using both sounds and letters/words the app works through a number of different ways to help young people become familiar with the sounds that different letters and words make as well as being able to recognise the different letters and words . <p> The app is set out using 8 groups of letter sounds and graphemes , growing in complexity as the user works through the lists . These lists for an integral part of the app once the user begins to access the different parts of the app . There are 2 main parts to the gameplay of the app which include a learning element where users can access the different sounds/letters , blends and words and then a game element where they can compound the knowledge gathered from the other side of the side in a fun interactive way . The learning element is split into sounds and words with each allowing the user to select which list they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list there is a small tracking element which tells the user what lists they have already started and what their progress is . This is quick and visual and a good aid to seeing at a glance how well a user is doing in working their way through each of the lists . <p> For the user it would make sense for them to begin with the sounds and then move onto the words aspect , however because it is split it does mean that users of different abilities can access the app at what level they require . The added bonus of this is that you can keep coming back to the app at the point you require of it and different abilities of young people can also access the app appropriately rather than having to tediously work through the app until they get to the bit that is right for them . <p> Once in the game section , the other half to the learning section , the user can choose again from either sound games or word games . There is also a choice of different games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of the app . The user earns stars for the more they do in the learning stages of the app . The games within this section also expand depending on how many words , sounds etc they have worked through . The more of these that have been completed in the other side of the app the more there is available in the game . This competitive nature will not only keep the user engaged through the app but will encourage them to continue using it other a period of time rather than just the odd one-off here and there . <p> The gameplay and usability of the app is very good . The display is quite simple but this is definitely a plus as it means the user can easily access all the functions . From the home screen the user can also access a parent/teacher feature . This gives a couple of different options which really add value to the app as a whole . From this menu you can add multiple users , ideal for a classroom setting access the lists and the letters that appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to female or even the ability to record your own . This is a fantastic feature as it means , again especially in a school setting , the educator can adjust the pronunciation of the sounds correct to the dialect of the area . Another excellent feature within the app is the ability to see the progress a child is making and the ability to export this information . These features not only add value to the app but make it an extremely worthwhile one for an educational setting . 41962 @qwx661962 <p> Fab Phonics has been designed in conjunction with primary school teachers to help give your children the best possible start when learning how to read . It combines learning sounds and words , concentrating on blending of the sounds together to make the words .

It is easy to check out the app 's suitability as the first lesson of the app is available as a free sample . <p> Astronomy is n't an area where teachers have access to a lot of resources for their lessons nor one where they might be particularly confident themselves .

And where do the constellations come from ? Beginners and experienced Star Gazers alike are entertained along the way , with musical accompaniment and the ancient myths of the heavens . As we explore a given area of the sky , a map of that area appears on your phone or tablet screen , enabling the app to be used at any time of day or night . <p> The narrative structure builds on the history of astronomy itself .

A supplementary sixth chapter gives a comprehensive historical overview of the discipline . The whole of Chapter 1 , along with observation hints and a contents list of the complete app , is made available in the free download . <p> This app , published for the first time in English , was available a year earlier in German . Astronomie.de comments : We love the way this app explains astronomy . Switzerlands leading educational observatory , in Steffisburg , describes it simply as the best app in years . Consistently rated with 5 Stars on Google Play Store and the Apple App Store , this guide to the stars will surprise and thrill you . <p> If you want to consolidate the information you hear , you may use the free work sheets supplied on the author 's website . They are especially helpful if the app is used in classes .

@@75177822 @3877822/ <h> Tabtor Math <p> Tabtor Math app is more than an app . It is one of the most exciting math learning programs we reviewed , with a great potential of becoming a service that will be easily adopted by students , teachers , educational institutions and parents . The student will get unlimited digital math assignments , personalized to his needs , and a personal teacher that will alter his learning programme accordingly . The apps data collection offers a personalized learning experience that focuses on what the creators call Point of Learning , where students will be challenged and will get the support they need in order to improve their math skills at critical stages in learning . It receives our EAS Recommended status and a 5 star EAS Certification . 41963 @qwx661963 41964 @qwx661964 <p> Tabtor Math app works on a subscription basis and offers a personalized service for active math learning . Learning should be personalized but teachers do n't  have the time or the right tools to offer an individual learning experience . And we all learn at a different pace , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path you 're on requires to be adapted to your needs and capability . This is exactly what Tabtor does with the help of its mobile learning platform . At the moment the app works only on iPad devices but will probably be scalable to other devices and operating systems in the future ( Android , Windows 8 ) . We tested the Student app and the Teacher app . <p> The student app - how does it work ? <p> You first have to create the students profile where you will be asked to add their date of birth ( used to determine age and skill level ) and specify what grade they 're in . The next step is to complete the diagnostic test that will allow the personal teacher to tailor and assign math exercises based on your level of proficiency . Before taking the placement test you will have the chance to practice on a sample assignment . The diagnostic test is very useful because is key to determine the appropriate math assignments that need to be assigned . <p> We liked that the design of the app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you open your assignment ( usually formed of 30 questions ) the screen transforms in a piece of paper on which you can write to work out what the answer is ( you will have to encourage students to use a stylus pen and adapt the palm rest area to their needs ) . In order to move to the next question you have to enter your answer from the right side panel where you have a numerical keyboard . Its very straightforward and wont need constant guidance either from a teacher or parent . The questions are very clear and accurate and you are offered an immediate feedback whether your answer is right or wrong . If you answer incorrectly you get to try one more time . You can also consult a short video tutorial that can assist you if you 're having problems . You can skip a question if you do n't  know the answer and return to it later with the back and forward button . To pause the test you have to press the top button next to the forward button and a new screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions you have left , how many you answered correctly and where you can also decide to submit your assignment as it is if you do n't  want to continue . <p> The page where you can see all your assignments is divided into three areas : Your Next Worksheets , Submitted worksheets and Instructor Feedback . Once you finish with an assignment you can review your answers under Submitted worksheets where you can check what the correct answers were , how much time you needed to finish the test and how many points you earned . Your math assignment is then sent to your personal instructor who reviews on the same day . You are then sent a workout summary with the feedback for each wrong answer and a nice message describing how you did and which math concepts you need more practice with . <p> So after finishing two assignments , the Simple addition and Missing Numbers in Subtraction Statements , we were impatiently waiting for our review . We got it on the same day after a couple of hours and were pleasantly surprised to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written explanations , just like in a classroom , on how to work out the answer and with some questions you even get a personalized explanatory audio note that starts with your name .

New math assignments are assigned based on your performance and results in previous assignments . Each completed exercise is awarded with gamification points and at the end of every month students are eligible to get a gift card or other rewards depending on their scores . To get the most out of your experience with Tabtor do n't  forget to watch the video tutorials that will explain new concepts and demonstrate solutions and also use the " flag " option where you can ask a question regarding exercises .

Teachers will see Tabtor as a tool to track students progress and to generate individual reports . And an immediate effect of using such a platform in schools is that students will be able to complete and submit their homework exercises more easily through the app . No more my dog chewed up my homework excuses ! <p> The Teacher side of the app looks similar to the student profile . The assignments you receive are organised in two folders : Inbox and Reviewed . The same simple and clean layout is used , from where you can easily review how your students are getting on with their assignments . The worksheets are corrected automatically , but as a teacher you can analyse each of the questions : see for how long the students focused on each question , understand what they did at the point of learning , add your comments and even record an audio message . You can then mark the assignment as reviewed , just like the way teachers do it on physical paper , and send your comments to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review and do n't  have anything to add you can easily file it under Reviewed and send it without any comments . <p> Teachers will be able to offer the extra support to students who need more attention and also identify gifted students easily . We can see it used as a tool for taking a test or completing an assignment in the classroom or as a homework companion . Tabtor Math will save teachers time and will allow them to have a clear view and maximize every students potential . <p> We think the Tabtor Math ( https : //tabtor.com/ ) has all going for it and is a well balanced platform for learning maths . The app is available for a two-week free trial if you 're not a Tabtor member or for free if you subscribe to the monthly membership .

Furthermore , it is well constructed and progressively builds upon prior activities to both reinforce knowledge and then challenge and extend its retention . <p> This app boasts an impressive lexicon of well-over 450 words and phrases ( according to the developers themselves ) and , by welcoming native speakers on board to voice the audio , has brought an authentic feel to the learning and study processes . Throughout the learning stages , users are guided and supported in their acquisition of the vocabulary and regularly display this by completing the written and interactive activities . <p> From the outset , the user is graced with excellent , visually pleasing graphics and animations ideally suited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start-up of just under fifteen seconds , users can select from a series of activities be it : following the storyline , which includes all videos , workbook and interactive activities ; going straight to the games section ; watching the video series ; practising the newly-learnt words with their workbook ; or , for the more mature learner , practising writing the newly acquired words and/or phrases the majority of which are in-App purchases , either individually or as a bundle . Unfortunately , the main menu screen takes a little time with which to become familiar , as it is not immediately evident what objects are links to extra content and what are there for show . The use of the game controller will be obvious to most users , but the purpose of some of the other links is not clear from the outset . Finally , on returning to the main screen menu , there is a short animation each time you seek to access it which after a while , in my opinion , becomes a little tedious . <p> Regarding the functionality of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monkey and Lulu the bird give us engaging , interactive storylines , which are easy-to-follow and progressive in their content . As the six stories unravel from the park to the city users get to explore these areas with Jojo and Lulu , all the while picking up snippets of French language along the way . The language is taught and instilled in a learn-as-you-hear approach , with it being regularly revisited and sometimes applied in new and extended contexts . The learner is encouraged to learn the core elements and structures of each story and aim to apply these across a range of scenarios . The scope of the app is not to teach vocabulary outright , but to have students acquire it in a manner akin to how they would have acquired their mother language . Users will respond to the story and activities in different ways and it is in this style that the natural and immersive language-learning process comes to the fore . Although , aspects of grammar and syntax are not explained , students are still progressing at their own pace and , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they have learnt even though they have no formal understanding of it . <p> Therein lies the challenge of language teaching and learning : to permit students to acquire the language in as familiar and as natural a way as possible , while still putting across the knowledge needed for them to adapt this language in spontaneous and creative communication . Although , Early Lingo does not serve as a formal education tool , for those young and avid learners taking their initial steps in French it will be the wonderfully effective and motivational medium that will set them well on their way . The more able readers will be able to apply meta-cognition strategies and see structures appearing in the language , whilst others will see clear improvement in their French skills , but from a different standpoint . <p> To have the entire scope of the app at your disposal is a not an insignificant expense , coming out at over 40 . However , it will certainly have your child interacting in the language and recalling , at the very least , their favourite words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal way to track progress it is left to the user to take what he or she wishes from the program and it , for the most part , does not coincide with the formal curriculum outline of introducing yourself and then taking it from there . However , I do not intend that as a criticism , merely a statement of facts . This app centres around the notion of language discovery , and it does it through the truly effective and engaging medium of storytelling . The learners will be acquiring words and structures that will go with them for the rest of their lives , as the language is being presented in a memorable way . The developers , here , understand that language-learning is a skill , not knowledge-based , and strive to equip users with those abilities as they make their way towards more formal and in-depth language instruction . <p> I recommend Early Lingo French Language Learning for Kids for anyone wishing to support their child in their initial steps in French . It is a comprehensive app , framed in creative and charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the while seeing their language skills improve and , with some support , help them to understand and apply these skills en route to becoming true linguists . 41962 @qwx661962 <p> Using a guided learning experience , children are able to unlock adventures but only after completing interactive exercises , games and videos from the park to the city . Each lesson builds upon the last and reinforces previous activities . Designed for ages 3-9 , the program grows with your child . <p> Characters Jojo and Lulu make learning a foreign language interactive , dynamic , engaging and fun for children . Early Lingo uses the Total Immersion Method , a method that envelops the child immediately within the target language , with no use of clunky , outdated translation techniques .

Earwig is a system that schools buy into , which includes the main web-based application and mobile apps that can be used on either iOS , Android or Windows platforms . The web application has an enormous numbers of features and huge scope for different uses , the main aspects of which will be discussed here . <p> For teachers , the Earwig system saved the age-old problem of trying to record evidence of classroom activities for assessment , reporting to parents and recording for internal school use . Rather than spend hours printing , cutting and pasting photos into different notebooks and files , the Earwig app makes it incredibly easy to take pictures which can then be used in a rich variety of ways within the web application . Through this combination of native app and webapp for creating and assigning information to captured moments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information about individual students , small group or class activities , topic or subject based selections or items of whole school interest . Once information has been uploaded to the system , it is very easy to reuse it , edit and share everything . Another major benefit of this over the more traditional approach of pen and paper with some photos stuck in is that there can be a variety of media used . In particular , the use of video opens up whole new ways to record and report on learning in the classroom . <p> Once teachers have recorded information about a particular learner , and chosen to share it , this is then viewable in the parents timeline for this child . This opens up opportunities for parents to take an interest in , understand and celebrate their childrens learning without having to wait until the next parents evening . Whereas teachers would never have been able to spend this much time communicating with individual parents in the past , using the Earwig system a rich volume of relevant information can be given to parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrators are the final group poised to benefit from a school using Earwig , both from the point of view of easily being able to monitor and report on activity on a whole-school level , but also given the opportunity included to make some money from parents buying the photos that appear in their childrens timelines . <p> The effects on students of knowing that both their teachers and parents will be able to recognise any learning successes more easily should provide a motivating aspect , and indeed some schools encourage children to ask for their class work and performances to be recorded into Earwig . This extra incentive to learn and share the learning journey is never going to be a bad thing , and may also lead to greater learner involvement and responsibility for making sure that valid assessments and recognition of learning outcomes are recorded on the system . <p> One aspect worthy of particular note is that the system is currently set up with the EYFS curriculum outcomes loaded in , making it especially advantageous for early years teachers and other staff involved with this age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving , relevant outcomes and stages can easily be ticked off , meaning that evidence is automatically organised and development reports become incredibly easy to prepare and print as required . Hopefully in future , this would be a common feature for those teaching other age groups as well , since the additional benefit of this ease and precision of assessment against learning outcomes could make a huge impact across the board . <p> It would be possible to discuss the great features and probable impact of using the Earwig system at very great length , and those interested in finding out more would do well to watch some of the video testimonials from real teachers and headteachers already using the system , as linked to from the Earwig website . It is hard to fault this product for its genuine ambition to change the lives of teachers , lessening administration time whilst simultaneously vastly improving the volume and quality of recording and reporting that can take place . It is clear that the developers of the Earwig system are keen to keep making improvements and work with teachers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be for them , and it is hard to think of another app or system that is likely to impact its users quite as much as this . 41962 @qwx661962 <p> This is the new app for teachers at schools using the Earwig software package . You can now turn photos and video into teaching evidence with a couple of clicks . You will need your Earwig login details .

Opening up a subject reveals the list of topics and formula for specific reading . Each topic has a brief explanation of the formulas context as well as indicating what each variable represents and an example of the formula in use .

The largest section of roughly 30 shapes is the geometry section . The Physics section includes formula for mechanics , optics , electricity , thermodynamics , and radioactivity . In Chemistry , as well as the usual molar equations , there is also a detailed periodic table and some common definitions . The section for Electronics is very similar to the Physics section with some extra information about safety and symbols . For each of the subjects there is a search function that will filter through formula and theory for any of the key terms you enter . <p> There are two in-app purchases on offer that extend the content beyond just the theory and allow you to process calculations for some of the formula . A little calculator symbol appears on the screen if the section has this function available . A simple tap on the calculator opens a new window where the calculation can be performed .

What is amazing is that with more practice the actual physical device can be dispensed with and proficient users have a mental abacus with which they can perform maths faster than a calculator , with just some twitches of their fingers showing that they are still using the abacus in their head . <p> In countries that truly appreciate this device , the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the rest of us develop familiarity with this tool and introduce our students and children to them ?

With four broad exercises , fully supported with tuition , users of this app are led through perceiving and interpreting numbers on the abacus before going on to counting and doing arithmetic using it . The exercises involve both manipulating the abacus to reach an answer and using your own mental abacus to do so .

This feature does require that you have internet access , although the rest of the app can operate perfectly well without it . One of two types of abaci can be used in the app . A more modern one with a single bead above the horizontal bar and four below or the older version with two above it and five below . Each of the exercises can be tailored to the users ability with ranges of numbers and time delays for questions allowing for a gradual increase in challenge . <p> The app displays the abacus and questions clearly , and the methods of interaction are easy and natural .

Parents who would like to work on a fun and useful maths project with their children , teachers who would like to offer an extra-curricular activity , or mathematically interested children who would like to learn an impressive skill , could all make use of this app. 41962 @qwx661962 <p> Working with the Mental abacus app will help you develop your mental arithmetic skills using the abacus .

@@75177844 @3877844/ <h> Number Bonds 1-10 <p> This is a great app for kids who are in Early Primary to gain familiarity with numbers and to begin to build associations between whole numbers and addition . The game is exciting and continuously builds on concepts as the game progresses . We have given at an EAS Certification of 5 Stars and EAS Recommended Status . 41963 @qwx661963 41964 @qwx661964 <p> One of the main reasons we really liked using this game is that it leaves a lot of the thinking and learning up to the user . This is a game that develops skills of logic and hones the skill by mode of repetition . <p> In this app , the numbers only go from 0 to 10 . The idea is that a number between 1-10 pops up in the middle of the illustration . The learners mission is to point out all of the numbers that make up the number . So , for example , if we are asked to point to " 4 " , we must then include all of the combinations ( using only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0+4 , 1+3 , 3+1 , 2+2 . The larger the number , the more combinations there are . <p> The great thing about this is that the numbers that the learner chooses from are set in a circle which makes it easier to see the associations between numbers . This is very interesting as the creators of the app have effectively created their own abacus-style representation in order to develop counting skills . Once the app has been completed in number order during the first play , all the numbers are set at random so that the game can be played over and over again . <p> To improve upon the app , I would add a system by which the app counts out your work if you choose so that the child can really understand how to count out his/her work . Children do spot patterns quite easily and if they spot the symmetry involved in the number-circle of the numbers making-up the final number , they may go on automatic mode . Therefore , to get the most out of this app , perhaps an adult can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fact that numbers are just an abstract concept that directly related to things in the real world . I say this because so often I have seen how maths can just turn into something abstract and far-removed from a childs mind so that we often hear " but why ? " in relation to a mathematical problem or concept . If children can understand the philosophy behind numbers , it will really help as maths gets more complex in later years . <p> Despite the meandering , the app leads in the right direction . The bright colours , the easy illustrations and the music make this app an exciting and fun addition to your maths repertoire ! 41962 @qwx661962 <p> Vemolo Number Bonds 1-10 is an educational game , designed for children between the ages of 4 to 6 . Number bonds are an essential part of primary school mathematics education , and is part of the curriculum in the UK and many other countries . It is the foundation of numbers ; and this game helps children to become familiar with them , and be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a fun game . <p> The game utilises visualisation , colour coding and repetition to take the pain out of learning , and allows the child to form strong associations in their mind on many different levels - however they learn best . This game teaches children to understand each number and it 's makeup i.e. number 3 is made of 0+3 , 1+2 , 2+1 and 3+0 . <p> The game is colourful , exciting and progressive . It gives children the desire to play again and again to reinforce their learning , and a sense of achievement when they have finished each level .

@@75177845 @3877845/ <p> An engaging word and sound game with a number of fun rhyming activities . 41963 @qwx661963 41964 @qwx661964 <p> Buds Rhyming Words is an education app and part of a series of apps from developer Nimble Minds LLC that includes a number of initial language apps . The app itself is split into three different word related games : Word families ; Pick and Click and Catch the Match . <p> Each of the three different games has a slightly different focus but each use rhyming words to help young children learn new sounds and words and make connections between the two . <p> On opening the app users can choose to either set up a profile , play an existing profile or select to be a guest player . Once in the game you have the choice of the three games . There is no specific order and no need to play the games in any particular order . The first game on the list however is Word Families . Selecting a vowel the user is then directed to a pathway of activities . In each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correct word at the bottom of the screen . The picture appears at the top and need to be dragged to the correct word . Wrong moves are welcomed with encouragement and correct moves awarded with points . There is no choice of difficulty within the game but as you progress along the pathway of activities the vowel sounds do get progressively harder in some of the vowel sounds . <p> The game play is simple enough to allow younger children to engage and use the app and the visual elements are uncluttered where children can simply focus on the elements of the game . There is a high quality of graphics which is pleasing to the eye and the pictures used offer a good explanation to their meaning . However , some of the words chosen do not necessarily match up with how you would first describe the picture and sometimes this feels a little forced . I would also have liked to been offered the chance to be read the word out loud to encourage different abilities to engage in the game . <p> In the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have to match up to a seventh picture based upon which words rhyme . Again , points are given for correct choices and encouragement for wrong ones . The graphics are again of a high quality and children are given the opportunity to enhance their knowledge of rhyming words as well as their visual literacy skills in defining the meaning . Some pictures again do not on first glance match , however , with the opportunity to click on each picture and be read the word this does clear up any misunderstandings . <p> The final game , Catch the Match is probably the most successful of the three . Users are given the option of 3 levels of difficulty which relate to how many stages they need to get through . By moving a swimming character up and down , users have to catch the five words that rhyme . As with the first two games incorrect choices are met with further encouragement and correct ones with points . After each successful stage users are given a recap of the words they have caught . Again there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can not be read out but this does n't  detract too much from the overall learning experience as trial and error opportunities balance this out . <p> Throughout the app the music is welcoming and not too over powering especially if you are playing for a long time . The whole game play experience is perfectly matched the recommended age range and with a slow pace to the games children are able to take their time in exploring the correct answers . Users or parents are able to view the score card which highlights in each game the scores and amount of attempts . This is a welcome element that allows a competitive nature but also a focus on performance and improvement . A further parents section gives an explanation of each game as well as the opportunity to sign up to updates . This is found through a locked portal allowing an element of e-safety . <p> The app is obviously fully focussed on rhyming words but through this children are able to improve their visual literacy skills at the same time . It is a successful app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text to be spoken , would further improve the app. 41962 @qwx661962 <p> Let the kids pick &amp; click or catch the match in 3 wonderful rhyming games , which covers 40 word families through more than 225 words and pictures . <p> Word Families : It enchants learning through selecting a vowel and a word family , then its time to match the pictures or objects to the words . It promotes object identification , increases vocabulary , reading skills and interactively enhances proper pronunciation . <p> Pick &amp; Click : It is the most thought provoking activity , as the kids are asked to match the pictures of rhyming words . This game acts as a reinforcement of the ' word families ' in an engaging and intuitive manner peaking your child 's curiosity . <p> Catch the Match : Bud is set out on an adventure to explore the ocean bed in search of the rhyming words .

@@75177846 @3877846/ <h> Badanamu : Alphabet Talk &amp; Trace <p> An app that helps young children develop their understanding of letters by teaching how to write each letter through its Trace feature and make learning English alphabets simple and easy . 41963 @qwx661963 41964 @qwx661964 <p> The aim of this app is to help young children develop their understanding of letters . It does this in a couple of different ways and means to help the user not only recognise letters but know their sounds and how to write them . Because of this the child can utilise the app to gain a good understanding of the letters of the alphabet but also it will help them when they begin the process of reading as they will already have prior knowledge of the sounds of each of the letters . <p> On opening the app the user is taken to the opening page where it is apparent that the app is going to be very user friendly to the younger audience it is aimed at . There are a number of animated characters across the screen ( called Nemies by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shape of the word attributed to that letter . For instance A is for Apple so the Nemie for A looks somewhat like an apple . B is for Bear so the B Nemie looks like a bear , and so on . <p> Once you have clicked the Start button then you are straight into the app itself . The game play is extremely simple and intuitive and even though there is an instruction guide within the app it is not necessarily needed due to the simplicity of the app . The instruction manual can be found within the Grown Up area . This can be accessed at any time by clicking on the small building blocks in the top right-hand corner of the screen . This menu also allows you to skip through to different letters in the alphabet if you wish . Also in this section there is further information about the developer , other apps on offer and links to the developers website . The website itself is also very useful and has video clips and further information about to use and make the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the app can help develop young peoples knowledge of letters and sounds . <p> The app itself starts off with each letter and asks the user to trace both the upper and lower cases of the letter so they can understand how the letter is correctly written . From an education perspective these are all correctly done with circles all being drawn anti-clockwise . As the user is tracing the letters the app speaks the sound for each of the letters . This is continually repeated to make sure that the user fully understands what the letter sound is . This is also where this app sits more in the American market than the English with some letter sounds being different , for instance the H , M and N letter sounds . <p> Once the user has successfully traced out the letters ( if they do it incorrectly they can keep trying until they get it right ) a small clip opens up with the attributed Nemie , and an animation helping the user to further understand and know how to successfully use the letter . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each of the letters adds a lot to the app and takes it from being a simple letter tracing app to something that a child will continue to return to and want to learn from . <p> Overall this is a really fun app that will keep young users engaged as they discover the different Nemies for each of the letters and find out more about them . It will also help young children in the journey to becoming confident with letters and sounds as it will help them to identify , write and use the letters in the correct fashion . 41962 @qwx661962 <p> Badanamu Alphabet Talk and Trace makes learning the ABCs great fun ! <p> To pre-k and kindergarten children learning the alphabet can be a bit overwhelming . Badanamu brings the fun back to the alphabet . We make letters and sounds relatable to children by using silly sounds , catchy music , and adorable characters . Letters are n't  just boring old letters anymore ! Now they are living creatures we like to call Nemies . Remember hearing " A is for apple " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The A Nemie character looks and sounds like an apple , helping children easily remember the shape and sound of the letter A. <p> Tracing letters has never been more smooth and confidence building for children . Each of the ABCs has a traceable capital and lower case letter .

Typically it provides access to the My GCSEs , Assignments and My Playlists ; further down the screen is the Teacher Area and " Usage Summary . <p> The My GCSEs section can be set up to list all the GCSEs that the teacher teaches with the specific exam board , once set up the teacher can then view the playlists for each section . For example if I was teaching AQA Biology the three units would be displayed and within each unit the number of chapters would be shown . So , for example , Unit 1 displays thirty-five chapters within the playlist . Viewing the playlist displays another intuitive menu list where the chapters can be viewed , relevant to the topics .

The chapters that the teacher finds relevant and useful can be starred and placed on a My Favourites Playlist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Area let 's the user set up the correct exam boards for the teacher . The Extras section is a user resource bank where teachers can add their own set of digital resources , typically , podcasts , quizzes or YouTube Videos , which can then be allocated to the teacher assignments . The Groups section is where the teacher can view , edit and report on all users of the site and where they can create or manage their own groups of students . <p> The Pods section of the main portal provides an extremely comprehensive selection of Pods per subject area , the intuitive menu system guides you to the relevant Pod quickly and from there a teacher can select the chapters within the pod to assign , via a playlist to the students . <p> The Assignments section of the main portal provides the teacher with a very powerful resource . The menu system guides the teacher through the process of creating an assignment . Firstly the teacher sets up the assignment name with a short description , any particular instructions for the students , then a deadline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are relevant to the assignment , again an easy step through to the desired information . The next step creates the questions designed to test the students understanding , with a choice of both free text and multiple choice , the group is then assigned and the work is published . The assignment then appears in the student area ready for them to get going ! The application also provides a very sophisticated reporting tool for the user to track progress of all or groups of students from the tests provided in the assignments created . <p> Overall this application is an excellent tool for creating engaging teaching , learning and revision sessions for students , but that is not all , the company have provided some outstanding teacher and school wide analytic tools for tracking knowledge and understanding ; what more could a teacher ask for ? I would highly recommend this software for any busy school interested in saving time but not cutting corners , good value for money . 41962 @qwx661962 <p> This App is only compatible with the new GCSEPod 2.0 website . <p> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.0 this is a must-have for your iPhone or iPod Touch !

There are twelve maps in total and users advance , almost like an adventure game , taking part in different lessons . The maps and lessons get progressively more difficult as the user works through them and as they learn more about the skills of reading .

Due to this there is also a wealth of information and resources available on the actual website itself . Educators can access previews of all the lessons as well as downloadable resources . This allows them to not only plan what content they wish to use , but also to personalise the specific learning to the individual needs of each child .

@@75177865 @3877865/ <h> Kidz Fun <p> Kidz Fun contains a collection of multi-media tools for introducing young children to the world around them through numbers , letters and simple objects . The app makes full use of Internet resources to give the user an all-round educational experience and keep them engaged and exploring . The app could benefit greatly from polishing up its design , and may be off-putting or even confusing to some users , as well as occasional bug problems . This app has received an EAS Certification of 2 Stars . 41963 @qwx661963 41964 @qwx661964 <p> Kidz Fun is aimed at teaching young children about colours , numbers , simple objects and the alphabet . The app has a number of options on the main menu : " Alphabets " , " Numbers " , " Songs " , " Stories " , " Questions " and " More " . Along with these options , there are links for merchandise and to rate the app , which can only be reached through a parental lock system , requiring the user to do a complicated sum to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverts which can not be clicked on by default , but this can be enabled through a similar parental lock system . <p> Within the " Alphabets " section there is a list of each letter of the alphabet , complete with an anthropomorphised version of the letter and the image of an object whose name begins with that letter . Clicking on each letter takes the user to a randomised page , containing only an image of an object whose name begins with the specified letter , along with a child narrator announcing that " Alligator begins with the letter A " . The use of a child narrator is a nice touch , though the sound quality is consistently poor for one particular narrator , and I feel the use of sound on its own may not be good enough for the user to understand the message . Some form of text reinforcing the message would go well here . <p> Within the " Numbers " section there is a similar list of the numbers 1 to 10 , along with a number of images to match each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user to a screen with an image of a number of objects and a child announcing the number of said object . The child will often add a descriptor such as " one cute bunny " , which should help engage the user with the app more emotionally . Again , additional information or visual feedback would further help here . <p> The " Songs " section contains a list of YouTube videos of various songs for children from various artists and organisations . These rank from that special sort of annoying that only a childs song can produce to a couple of songs I actually found myself listening to a couple of times . The use of YouTube videos helps to build up a varied bank of content , though it does add the difficulties of having to go through and vet each video to make sure it is suitable , as well as keeping the app up to date with these videos ; I did find one video that had been taken down since the app went up . <p> In a similar vein , the " Stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ videos that consist of adaptations of childrens story books , audio of stories being read with still images to accompany , and the occasional Disney video . This again comes with the problem of having to keep on top of these videos and making sure they are available in the same countries as the app , but also loses some aspects of story book apps that I have seen in the past ; interactivity . Some story book apps are great because they act more like a book than any other source of media . They allow the user to control the flow of the story and to interact more with it , often with the additional benefits of multimedia reinforcement such as narration . Obviously , the focus of this app is not to be a story book app , but there are pros and cons with each approach . <p> Finally , in the " Questions " section , users can work through a series of randomised , multiple-choice questions testing their understanding of numbers , letters and objects . It is useful for there to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood the content within it , though this could be made even more useful with a system to track the users marks , or even a simple scoring system beyond the simple " Correct/Incorrect " feedback presented by the app . <p> The overall content of this app seems on track , and should be useful in introducing children to the world around them , but unfortunately this is let down somewhat by the presentation of the app . The illustrations within the app are a mixture of real-life images and illustrations , each in a different style , and when put together it does unfortunately look messy . Even simple things like the choice of font used lack polish and detail , with the text often blending in with the background images , making it hard to read . Beyond this , there are a few bugs scattered throughout the app , none crucial , but noticeable nonetheless . The most apparent of these is within the " Questions " section , where each question is loaded twice , causing visual disturbances and interrupted narration . <p> Overall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but really needs to think more about usability and design , even for younger children . Toddlers will likely find the use of media and videos engaging , but may struggle to discern the information from the limited visual clues and muddled pictures . If you can get past this however , you will find a free , useful app with lots of content to keep toddlers busy and interested . 41962 @qwx661962 <p> Kidz Fun is an application for Preschool and Kinder garden kids .

This just demonstrates the wide ability of the app , starting at the very basics , and moving to some of the most complex exercises and abilities available to any user . The exercises use the microphone for sight-singing , or a simple tap on the screen for clapping .

We like how students can get a jumpstart on the creativity process by using a selection of randomly generated words . There are 7 word categories to choose from , and more than 4500 words total . We like how the app features a unique interplay between the written word ( text ) and visual design ( adding backgrounds and stickers , etc. ) , however we did find some of the menu systems a little unresponsive . Students can then combine as many word categories as they like , as well as add their own words . Students will decorate their creation with multiple backgrounds as well as stickers , making their very own creativity book which can then be shared . 41963 @qwx661963 41964 @qwx661964 <p> This app is based on the sets of fridge magnets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each magnet containing a word and near-infinite possibilities for rearranging them in different ways .

If the app is being used in a classroom environment this is a particularly useful feature , meaning that each student can have their own book to keep their work in . Otherwise , this can be used to organise the pages into themes , or in any other useful way .

All these options should make the app enjoyable to use by children wanting to express themselves in a creative way . To add to the educational usefulness , there are also options to press on each word to access different forms of the words - for example to make nouns plural and to match different versions of verbs . As well as being useful for creating sentences that make sense , this could be used as a teaching point , if a lesson was planned in the right way around these options . <p> Overall , the app has an impressive presentation , with clear graphics and a very user-friendly interface .

However stable and relevant the platform is , if the users point of contact with it is cumbersome and unwelcoming , it wont be used properly . From a teachers point of view , data collection is both essential and yet hugely problematic . With the many random variables in a class that are the children , collecting and recording data is a distraction from the supervision and education that is the real purpose of a teachers role . If an app makes this collection difficult , teachers will begin to fill it in when they can give it more of their concentration . This is likely to be at a later time when a teachers memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , this app makes the recording of relevant information easy . Setting up a class is hassle-free . Entering names and attaching a photo to the entry can all be done from within the app . Once set up , it is very straightforward to open the app , locate the relevant child and update the necessary record . The photos of children and relevant icons give teachers the visual cues that will help them to avoid errors in their recording . A simple tap illuminates the correct record or increases/decreases the appropriate number . The clear layout allows a whole class to be updated in just a few seconds . <p> It is important that this information is accurate because it will help parents form an overview of how their children are doing at the nursery . Are they eating ? Are they happy ? Are they using the toilet ? With accurately recorded information provided to them , parents will be able to notice any issues with their child that staff , with their far more numerous children to monitor , may miss . <p> The app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It links with the devices camera so that staff can take photographs of children and let parents see and preserve moments from their childs school day . Messages about special events and occasions can be sent directly by the teacher to parents , ensuring that no child is disappointed because a message did not reach her parents . <p> This does n't  just help parents . Schools can make good use of the data and the photographs to support their evidence when they are inspected . Social services may also be able to gain insights into a childs life from it , allowing schools to discharge their child protection responsibilities more effectively . <p> This app is a module built around the iCare platform . This platform is accessible through web-based tools as well the apps . It is through these apps , however , that most users will engage with it . With its clear design and useful functionality , it is likely to be welcomed by its users . 41962 @qwx661962 <p> The iCare Teachers tablet application is designed for use along with iCare kids parent 's application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires minimal typing as the user can simply choose the entry from preset menus . The application eliminates the need for paperwork and is directly integrated with the Administration panel on the Parents module .

@@75177902 @3877902/ <h> Ricardo 's Alphabet Game Board <p> Ricardo 's Alphabet app has been designed to help young children familiarize themselves with the English alphabet , both sounds and letter shapes . The app presents three educational games aiming to help children recognise letter shapes , recall letter names and sounds and remember the letter-sound associations of the English Alphabet . The app primarily targets children aged 4-6 years old who have limited or no previous experiences of learning the alphabet . The app is a good introduction for engaging children with letters in a playful way . 41963 @qwx661963 41964 @qwx661964 <p> Ricardo 's Alphabet app aims to teach young children aged 4-6 the sounds and letters of the English Alphabet in a playful way . It is available for purchase online for a small download fee . It presents three well-designed educational games aiming to help children recognise letter shapes , recall letter names and sounds and remember the letter-sound associations of the English Alphabet . Children are presented with a dashboard with the three games and are free to select and start any of the games they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help Ricardo jump across the river rocks . To do so , they hear the sound of a letter and move Ricardo to the rock that showcases the respective letter shape . They have to select the right letter shape from a number of other shapes in three different occasions for Ricardo to cross the river . This repetition helps children learn better and recall letters easily . The Vowel Catch game presents a letter shape and asks children to catch the kite that relates to this letter . By touching the letter and the kites , children hear the sound of the letter and/or words . Yet it is noted that matching in this activity is not as straightforward as expected , as it incorporates a degree of fine motor dexterity , for children to match the string of the kite to the letter and not just drag and drop the kite near the letter . <p> The Hidden Letters game is a hide and seek activity ; children are asked to identify a series of letters that are hidden in a scenery . Some of the letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a baby goat while others are entirely hidden behind e.g. the door of a house . This activity might need time to digest for young children as a lot of letters are presented to them at the same time while they may not be able to identify where letters are hidden , especially the ones that are overly hidden behind items . A question mark gives a hint as to where to look , yet it is up to the children whether they will press the question mark and get some help or ask a supervising adult for assistance , so that they can be encouraged to persevere with a new or difficult task before choosing to opt out of the activity before completing it . All games have three different levels of difficulty by introducing new letters , upper and lowercase , and beginning sounds of words . This is particularly useful as it helps children progress with the learning of the alphabet and accommodate children with diverse learning needs - being experts or novices in learning the alphabet . <p> What is particularly useful is the reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen showing children 's progress throughout the game . This would be further enhanced if it was more visible and prominent on the screen and accompanied with sound e.g. , two more activities to go . Also , in each activity there are a number of stars indicating how many sections children have to pass to complete the activity . Again , it would be more helpful if this system was better integrated into the design so it draws the attention of the children and motivates them to complete the activity . Overall , the app is well-designed and appropriate for young children . Yet , it could better support learning if the instructions were more intuitive rather than written text and oral instructions . However in this current format , the instructions are automatically spoken on the first play of each game , the audio can be re-played upon the press of a button at any time during the game or read aloud by a supervising adult at any time also . 41962 @qwx661962 <p> Ricardo Reading Mouse is sure to delight children , as they enjoy learning their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educationally-based games . Great care has been taken to ensure each game , develops essential early literacy skills in a safe , supportive , encouraging and fun way . We have no in-app purchases or live streaming . <p> As children interact with Ricardo , they will meet the 26 letters of the English Alphabet . They will learn to : 1 . recognise letter shapes ; 2. recall letter names and sounds and 3. identify and remember the initial letter-sound associations of the 21 consonants and the 5 short vowel sounds of the English Alphabet . <p> This app has been designed to target primarily the under 6s and it is a beautiful addition to any classroom or home learning environment . It is also a perfect place to engage older children who are struggling and require extra time and support to practice learning their letter names and sounds . <p> THREE GAMES : Hidden Letters find the correct alphabet letters as they play hide and seek Vowel Catch help vowel characters catch matching kites I Hear help Ricardo jump across the river rocks by matching letters and sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teaching lowercase letters , uppercase letters and beginning sounds of words . Children can freely move between each game and level within a game , at their own pace by selecting a game on the main home screen and then by selecting a level on the first screen of each game . <p> Instruction boxes with text and audio automatically open up on each initial play of the game and upon repeated game plays . The instruction box can then be selected with an icon on screen . There are indicators on the screen in each game which show the childs progress throughout the game and how many screens are remaining before a reward screen appears . <p> We recognise the importance of children needing a healthy balance of screen time and active play time . So attention has been given , to ensure we provide games and rewards that serve as a gentle reminder to children of how much fun it is to put their device down and engage in safely supervised active play like flying a kite , using a scooter or pogo stick , leaping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Such active play also assists in the development of visual motor skills which are vital when learning to read , write and spell . Disclaimer : Childrens activities are always at the discretion of their supervising carer . <p> Some levels within the games have interactive rewards . Ie. fast , normal and slow buttons where children can change the pace at which Ricardo is doing an activity . For other rewards , children have the joy of seeing Ricardo appear doing a task to a pleasant , up-beat little instrumental or vocal . <p> As children are naturally inquisitive , there are also some surprise interactive touch points , in the games , that when pressed will delightfully reward children with a movement , a sound or both . We trust you will enjoy exploring these with your child . <p> LOCKED PARENT SECTION FEATURES : 1 . More information about the visual processing aspects of this app 2 .
