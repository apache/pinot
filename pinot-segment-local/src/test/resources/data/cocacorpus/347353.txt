Bryan <p> My name is Michael C. Bryan . I 'm a success coach for Fortune 500 executives , thriving creatives in all fields and business owners who are having middle to major success . <p> What is a success coach ? The title can sound cheesy , but my results are anything but . I 've worked with the President of NBC News , the CEO of Time Warner Global , the President of NYU and the heads of many movie and TV studios . I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've helped people figure out what they really want in life and it 's not more cars and more money and more houses . Sure , we 're all worthy of those things , but what we really want is a feeling of peace and ease as well as all the material things . We also want to know what we 're doing matters . <p> What I do is guide people so they can get what they want faster and have fun along the way . It 's possible to have fun and a wildly successful career . I 'm proof . <p> Too often we see life as a race . A mad dash to the finish line where we croak and we 're done . Most of us know that kind is thinking is futile . There is part of us that knows life is mean to be easier . And we 're right , there is . <p> We 're human BEings first , no human doers . Once we re-learn how to BE , then the doing comes naturally and effortlessly . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want have to be so hard ? It does n't . The model of hustling and working hard and making things happen is exactly how we do n't make things happen . <p> Writing this , I 'm reminded of something George Lucas once said . He suffered a devastating car crash at the age of 18 . He was a teenager , he wanted to be an engineer . He had no interest in spiritual pursuits , but after nearly dying , he came to realize that " there is a part of us that 's connected to other humans , connected to other animals , connected to the universe . I do n't think we can understand it through any kind of verbal , written or intellectual means . But I do believe that we all know this , and it 's on a level beyond our normal conscious thoughts . " <p> That 's the core of the work I do . This ' something ' we 're all looking for lies within us and all we have to do is chronically focus so we can align @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then we do n't have to come up with a spread sheet on what to do or a list of goals ... we just know . <p> Of course , we do n't have to live like this . We can live like 90% of the people in business do . We can spend thousands on focus groups and endless off-sites seeking the advice of others until we 're blue in the face . How we live is our choice . Always our choice . But if the choice of working less , allowing more and being happier is how we get all we want , why not give such a way of living a shot ? Because for most of us , the other way simply is n't working . It 's only logical to try a new way that has always been the easiest way . <p> I 've spent many years working with the people who run Time Warner , NBCUniversal , Turner , TNT , Paramount Pictures and many more . No matter how high someone is in their role , the challenges are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meaning in work . How to feel good doing the job they 're doing . How to find out what we 're meant to do , and how to find the courage to do just that . And most of all , not to listen to anyone who tells us otherwise . <p> We all want the same thing : to feel free . To feel worthy of our success . To feel as if anything is possible . Which , of course , it is . The work is learning how to feel that regardless of any condition in our lives . <p> As playwright Ed Albee wrote , it 's a delicate balance . <p> The work I do is free of dogma , falseness and self-sanctimonious chatter . While I know there are tremendous things to be had from organized religion , any religion that tells others that in order to achieve salvation that they must act in a certain way is a waste of time . <p> My work is a mix of metaphysical science , cutting edge behaviorism and in-depth psychology as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While I do n't believe in tough love , I do believe in chronic focus . Focus , clarity and intention on a very consistent basis is what we all need to get what we want in the fastest way possible . <p> Life is a mystery , but happiness is n't some elusive idea . It 's something we can have access to right now . The greatest thinkers and artists and innovators of our times knew this . Time for you to experience more of it yourself .
