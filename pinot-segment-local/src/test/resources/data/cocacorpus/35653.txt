Hosting24 limitation is maximum 250000 files in the cPanel account only.Is there CPU Usage limitation ?

You can have a maximum of 20,000 files uploaded on your account .

However , with Premium plan you can have up to 200,000 inodes and with Business plan you can store up to 400,000 inodes on your account .

Simply upload all your files to the ' publichtml ' folder on our server . If you have a PHP website , check if it has any configuration files where domain name or path to the files can be set . Update these values if needed . If your website is using MySQL , you need to move the database here and update configuration files of your scripts accordingly : 1 . Backup database on the old server If your current provider has a MySQL backup tool - use it . Usually you can login to phpMyAdmin , select your database and click on ' Export ' tab . Choose Save as file and select ' gzipped ' . Download of your database backup should start afterward. 2 . Create the database on our server Once the download is finished you will have file named something like yourdatabase.sql.gz .

Once inside , click on ' Import ' tab , browse to the backup file of your database ( yourdatabase.sql.gz for example ) and click Go . Database restoration procedure will begin . Please be patient , as it can take quite a lot of time to complete if your backup size is large . 4 . Updating configuration files Now , when the database is restored , you will need to open the configuration file of your PHP script and update database host , database name , database username and database password values . Use the values that you 've written down when you created the new database . Note : we do not use " localhost " as MySQL hostname , our MySQL host is " mysql. #masterdomain "

You can learn a lot about what is going wrong from the error messages PHP gives you . If you are n't currently getting error messages , this tutorial LONG ... shows you how to turn on PHP error reporting . 2 . Test your code often . If you 're testing each piece as you add it , then at least if you encounter this problem you know generally where to look for it ... in whatever you just added or changed . 3 . Try a color-coded editor . A lot of PHP editors ( many even free ) color code your PHP as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that do n't end , because you 'll have large chunks of code in the same color . It 's non-intrusive for those of us who prefer to code with no bells-and-whistles , but helpful when troubleshooting. 4 . Comment it out . One way to isolate the problem is to comment out large chunks of your code . Start at the top , and comment out all but the first couple lines , then echo ( ) a test message right above the comment . If it echos fine , then the problem is below . Move the start of your comment and your test echo downwards as you work through your document , until you find the problem .

In order to better serve you and improve our service quality , we have redesigned our email system . These changes will be implemented on 19th of May . <p> Free hosting users will no longer be able to use IMAP and SMTP services . Our email service is currently heavily abused by bad users who are sending spam , overloading servers and damaging reputation of our email delivery system , which results in rejected emails sent even by good users . <p> Free hosting users will still be able to use POP3 service to receive email and for SMTP we recommend using your internet service provider SMTP server . All internet service providers will give you a SMTP server for free . Additionally you can still use our WebMail client to send email if needed . <p> Good news for paid hosting users - we have added SSL support to all email protocols , so you can now enjoy : - SMTP with SSL : port number 465- SMTP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is blocked- SMTP without SSL : port number 25- SMTP without SSL : port number 2525 if port number 25 is blocked- POP3 with SSL : port number 995- POP3 without SSL : port number 110- IMAP with SSL : port number 993- IMAP without SSL : port number 143 <p> Additionally , for paid hosting users , we have increased email sending limits , moved all email to dedicated premium email servers and will implement an automated email backup/restore feature in nearly future !

And in most cases it is due to incorrect . htaccess file configuration . Although this is generally caused by a problem within the script , many times it is caused by incorrect file permissions either on the script itself , or another file or directory used by the script . You should also verify the that the script paths are set correctly . You should also verify that the scripts were uploaded in the correct mode ( ASCII or Binary - check the readme for the scripts to see any special instructions . Normally it is ASCII ) . Another problem could be permissions of the file or directory . Your script permissions should be 755 , or rwxr-xr-x . There are few ways to fix it : 1 . Interference with an . htaccess file . If you have implemented . htaccess on your site , it may be interfering with the web page you are trying to load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ configurations to ensure that it does n't contain any errors . To confirm whether an misconfiguration . htaccess is the cause of the 500 internal server error , either remove or rename the . htaccess file . 2 . PHP Coding Timing Out If your PHP script makes external network connections , the connections may time out . If too many connections are attempted and time out , this will cause the internal server error . To prevent such time outs and errors , we suggest that your relevant php scripts be coded with some timeout rules . 3 . Search on Google for your script name + internal server error . For example if you get this error on Wordpress blog - query Google for Wordpress internal server error Fix .

If you upload file using PHP ( instead of FTP ) , max file size limit is 8 MB and it could not be increased anymore . If your file is very large , it might be that web-based upload could fail , so we strongly suggest uploading big files with FTP client .

We recommend using Gmail services for this . Google GMail offers a free SMTP server which can be used by anyone who has a GMail account . If you do n't have a GMail account , you can create one at the GMail account creation page . Afterward , you will need to configure your mail client to use GMail for outgoing mail server . The details needed are listed below : * Outgoing Mail ( SMTP ) Server : smtp.gmail.com * Use Authentication : Yes * Use Secure Connection : Yes ( this can be TLS or SSL depending on your mail client ) * Username : your GMail account * Password : your GMail password * Port : 465 or 587

The most common reasons for a hacked ( defaced ) website include : - Outdated web application . Every popular web application ( Joomla , WordPress , PhpBB ... ) has had security problems and that 's why you have to use always the latest version . - Outdated web application extension . If you have installed any third party extensions , you have to keep them up-to-date just as you keep your main web application . Very often users neglect this fact and outdated extensions become easily exploited by intruders . - Weak user / administrator passwords . You must ensure that all users have strong passwords , especially the admin and the ones who can create content to your site . - Infected local computer - some computer viruses/worms are known to steal FTP logins and after that add malicious code to web files . For this reason make sure to have an updated antivirus software and scan your computer for viruses regularly . If your account was hacked , please be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have advanced security modules ( such as Apache modsecurity , Suhosin PHP hardening , PHP openbasedir protection and others ) and no more accounts were hacked on same server , which would most likely show , that the issue would lie in your website.

@@40325913 @325913/ <p> Mine too , but I am still getting Page not available , etc errors quite often . I have sent a ticket in and asked them to please check the logs to see what is up . It has been up and down like this since the beginning , making it hard to run a shop etc . <p> First , your website , and design are wonderful , I really like the clean professional look ! Big problem tho .... your domain url that you added in your post above is locked , in other words masking the real website url , so I am assuming you purchased the domain address elsewhere , and redirected it to your website , with masking on . I do this with many of my . com domains too , but the problem with masking is , it covers the actual page address , and does not allow for spidering . The engines can only spider the one page , therfore , the page I just tried to share to Pinterest just to see if I was correct , gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this link because it may lead to spam . And the link they actually blocked was this one : LONG ... which read like this on Pinterest : http : //reinvented.esy.es/ so you see , by masking your address like that , you are causing problems in many ways . Unless you can or do the normal pointing your web address to the site thing , ( which I never do for my own reasons , what I do is create a splash page normally , with links and content to the rest ) you will have this problem . What you need to do to use it masked is to create that splash page , with relative links to where you want to navigate , using target tags ( opening in same window will cause the mask to stay locked ) and be sure you place a proper meta tag property in your HEAD area of the page , with all the relative tags , so search engines will spider the . com page . Or simply tell your domain carrier to NOT mask the domains , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addy which was this one : http : //reinvented.esy.es/ Hope I make sense to you , I am not a programmer . Only someone with lots of experience using pointed domains , and not actually attaching them to a host . I have and use several . coms this way , and a . net or 2 also . My site address here was bought with the package , treasuredscrapsrva.net bought I own the . com also , with a domain register I have used since 1995 Anyway , your design is awesome ..... <p> I tried getting help or info from their actual site , but they do n't support clients from hosted sites , only direct clients to their service . I really need to know if their is an instruction area for Zyro I am overlooking , as most of these issues I am having with the design , are in the layout itself . For instance , no matter how I try to position a page so that page content , and footer area are within an inch or so at most from each other at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sometimes maybe 6 inch or more white space between end of content and footer , and then another 6 inch white space to the end of the page itself . Or , sometimes , it is simply 12 inches of white space between end of content and footer , which is actually at the very bottom sometimes , instead of smack in the middle .... I sure hope I am making sense . Using or changing the grid perspective does not help at all , I do n't understand why I can not align the **28;2109;TOOLONG etc .... It is very frustrating , especially when the rest of the page looks so great , all of a sudden it is like , oops , WTF . Is anyone else having similar issues with Zyro , or does anyone have any insight into fixing/dealing with these issues . Thank you for any and all responses my site is http : //treasuredscrapsrva.net <p> I have been trying to work in the admin panel of my Premium hosted website for days now , and all I get is PAGE NOT AVAILABLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this .
