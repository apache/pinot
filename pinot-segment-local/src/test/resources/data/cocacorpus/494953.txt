The form has three sections , Allowable Unit , Annual Totals , and Monthly Totals . <p> Wells that have Oil Production information will most likely be historical records . Oil volumes are displayed in barrels . Gas volumes are displayed in MCF ( 1000 cubic feet ) . <p> The first section of the form is the Allowable Unit . An Allowable Unit is the amount of oil or gas , which can be produced in a certain time span for a specific unit as determined by the Corporation Commission . The unit could be a single formation , multiple commingled formations , or multiple wells in a pool . There can be more than one Allowable Unit for a well , if the well has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commingled . Check the status bar at the lower left of the Production form to see how many Allowable Units exist for the selected well . If the status bar displays " Record : 1/1 " as it will in most cases , it signifies that only one Allowable Unit exists for the selected well . More than one well can share an allowable , provided they are producing from the same formation . When there are two or more Allowable Units per well , the scroll button next to Allowable Unit can be used to navigate between allowable units . The Allowable Number includes the county number , base number and sub number . The sub number is used to distinguish between separate Allowable Units within the same well . <p> There are three Allowable Types . They are Individual ( I ) , Shared ( S ) , and Ratable ( R ) . A Shared Allowable is a situation where more than one well shares an allowable . Ratable is the same as shared allowable but the wells do not share equally . Wells that share an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Numbers . <p> The Pool Number is a five digit number used for special allocated wells . The pool number refers to a common source of supply for the wells that have the same pool number . When a well no longer is producing the Production Terminated field will display a " Y " for yes . <p> The next section is the Annual Totals . Each allowable unit may have multiple years of production . The most current year is already selected . When the arrow button next to " Select Year " label is pressed all years of production will be shown . For each production year , there may be one or more reporters ( purchasers , operators , transporters , etc. ) reporting production . The Oil Totals and Gas Totals are based on all of the monthly volumes that has been reported for the selected year . The totals for the selected year for all reporters is calculated and displayed below the individual reporter totals . If a reporter is no longer reporting production , an " N " will appear in the currently reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scroll bar can be used to view the remaining reporters . <p> In the Monthly Totals section , volumes that have been reported will be shown by month for the selected year . If nothing was reported , the field will be blank . If there is a " 0 " in the field , it means that the reporter did report a volume of " 0 " . The Oil Volume and Gas Volume totals are displayed for all the reporters for the selected year for each month . Use the scroll bar to view all twelve months . <p> The Plugging form has tabs that can be used to view other information . The data will be in ascending order with the oldest plugging date first . A plugging completion date or a 1003D ( Affidavit of Old Well Status ) approved is required to create a plugging record . <p> The Reject Date and Approved Date will not contain values until the system is complete with add and update forms . <p> The Operator Browse button will open the operator application . This application will provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business operators , operators by county or a list of all , open and out of business purchasers . <p> Well Status indicators are the OG and ITD columns . These status indicators will help in understand the status of the well . The UIC column indicates that this well may be used as a Underground Injection Well . This table may help explain the options available for the OG and ITD status fields . <p> There is a rare occasion that a Well has a canceled status . This occurs when an intent to drill is canceled on a new drill ( ND ) . In this case the OG Status will be " CA " and the Permit Status will be " C " . <h> Search by Allowable Number <p> Production information can be search by two ways , either by the Allowable information or basic well information ( Api Number , Well Name , etc ) . A combination of Allowable Number and Well information can not be used .

It provides general information regarding a well . All of the wells will have some basic information . The Basic form will always be navigable from any of the other forms , by selecting the Basic tab . <p> On the API Resolved to fields with the red labels there is a different display if an API number is ' Resolved to ' or ' Resolved from ' .

In this case , records without completion dates will be displayed first . <p> One of the things that will be on the Completions form , that will not be on other forms is an * ( asterisk ) in the S ( suffix ) field . This signifies that this information has been added to the database from other sources . Also , the Operator Name may be gray text instead of black . This indicates that , although a valid operator number was not available for lookup , the operator name was available as part of the historical completion record .

These records were incorporated in the Well Inventory System from sources other than a form 1002A ( Completion Report ) from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the Basic Tab page , will not contain any data but will be used when the system is completed . Also , the Measured Total Depth and BHL ( bottom hole location ) from Lease fields on the Bottom Hole tab page will not contain any data . <p> The production form has several terms that may require further explanation . The form has three sections , Allowable Unit , Annual Totals , and Monthly Totals . <p> Wells that have Oil Production information will most likely be historical records . Oil volumes are displayed in barrels . Gas volumes are displayed in MCF ( 1000 cubic feet ) . <p> The first section of the form is the Allowable Unit . An Allowable Unit is the amount of oil or gas , which can be produced in a certain time span for a specific unit as determined by the Corporation Commission . The unit could be a single formation , multiple commingled formations , or multiple wells in a pool . There can be more than one Allowable Unit for a well , if the well has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commingled . Check the status bar at the lower left of the Production form to see how many Allowable Units exist for the selected well . If the status bar displays " Record : 1/1 " as it will in most cases , it signifies that only one Allowable Unit exists for the selected well . More than one well can share an allowable , provided they are producing from the same formation . When there are two or more Allowable Units per well , the scroll button next to Allowable Unit can be used to navigate between allowable units . The Allowable Number includes the county number , base number and sub number . The sub number is used to distinguish between separate Allowable Units within the same well . <p> There are three Allowable Types . They are Individual ( I ) , Shared ( S ) , and Ratable ( R ) . A Shared Allowable is a situation where more than one well shares an allowable . Ratable is the same as shared allowable but the wells do not share equally . Wells that share an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Numbers . <p> The Pool Number is a five digit number used for special allocated wells . The pool number refers to a common source of supply for the wells that have the same pool number . When a well no longer is producing the Production Terminated field will display a " Y " for yes . <p> The next section is the Annual Totals . Each allowable unit may have multiple years of production . The most current year is already selected . When the arrow button next to " Select Year " label is pressed all years of production will be shown . For each production year , there may be one or more reporters ( purchasers , operators , transporters , etc. ) reporting production . The Oil Totals and Gas Totals are based on all of the monthly volumes that has been reported for the selected year . The totals for the selected year for all reporters is calculated and displayed below the individual reporter totals . If a reporter is no longer reporting production , an " N " will appear in the currently reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scroll bar can be used to view the remaining reporters . <p> In the Monthly Totals section , volumes that have been reported will be shown by month for the selected year . If nothing was reported , the field will be blank . If there is a " 0 " in the field , it means that the reporter did report a volume of " 0 " . The Oil Volume and Gas Volume totals are displayed for all the reporters for the selected year for each month . Use the scroll bar to view all twelve months . <p> The Plugging form has tabs that can be used to view other information . The data will be in ascending order with the oldest plugging date first . A plugging completion date or a 1003D ( Affidavit of Old Well Status ) approved is required to create a plugging record . <p> The Reject Date and Approved Date will not contain values until the system is complete with add and update forms . <p> The Operator Browse button will open the operator application . This application will provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business operators , operators by county or a list of all , open and out of business purchasers . <p> Well Status indicators are the OG and ITD columns . These status indicators will help in understand the status of the well . The UIC column indicates that this well may be used as a Underground Injection Well . This table may help explain the options available for the OG and ITD status fields . <p> There is a rare occasion that a Well has a canceled status . This occurs when an intent to drill is canceled on a new drill ( ND ) . In this case the OG Status will be " CA " and the Permit Status will be " C " . <h> Search by Allowable Number <p> Production information can be search by two ways , either by the Allowable information or basic well information ( Api Number , Well Name , etc ) . A combination of Allowable Number and Well information can not be used .

@@106538994 @1938994/ <h> Pooling <p> Oklahoma law permits only one initial well in a drilling and spacing unit . Owners who want to propose a well must secure the commitment of other owners in the unit . Other owners must either agree to share in the well 's expense , or lease or assign their working interest to the proposing owner in exchange for a royalty interest in future production . To propose a well , you would first attempt to reach agreement with all owners to lease their interest or participate with you in paying their proportionate part of the drilling and operating expense . Those who did not want to lease or participate could block the drilling unless there was some method to force them to participate or sell . That is the " forced pooling " process . <p> Forced pooling causes the proposed operator to search records in the county and other sources to determine all persons with the right to drill and locate them with their correct addresses . The application to pool is filed with OAP and the owners who have not leased are named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and published giving the respondents notice of the time , place and purpose of the hearing , together with the requested pooled formation . At the hearing all persons who have a right to drill may appear and let their interest be known . <p> At the hearing , the Administrative Law Judge ( ALJ ) will insure the applicant has given the respondents proper notice , mailing and publication . The ALJ will inquire whether the applicant has made a good faith effort to bargain with the respondents prior to filing the pooling application and from testimony set the costs of drilling and completing the well . The ALJ will also inquire as to the fair market value of the mineral interests in the unit ; that inquiry includes testimony on what was paid for leases in that unit and the eight surrounding units within the last year . Generally , the fair market value of the mineral interest is determined by consideration of open market transactions , impacting oil and gas rights , between willing buyers and willing sellers in the vicinity . <p> The unleased mineral owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the fair market value for royalty often provides for a royalty percentage above the one-eighth . The fair market value consists of a cash bonus and royalty ( percentage of revenue share on production ) . Frequently less cash and more overriding royalty combinations are found to be equivalents and alternates . <p> The ALJ requires the applicant to prepare a Pooling Order and submit it for review and signature of the ALJ and the full Commission . The operator must mail copies of the order to each respondent within three days . The order provides Respondents 20 days to either participate in the well or elect to take one of the fair market value alternatives . Payments to respondents of any cash consideration are required to be made within 30 to 35 days of the date of the order , depending on the recommendation made in the order . <p> The Pooling Order will contain other provisions , usually requiring the operator establish an escrow account for owners whose addresses are unknown or owners with title problems , provisions describing rules for future wells and limiting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause is shown . <p> If any party objects to the pooling application , they will be able to present their case at the hearing and a report will issue recommending the case be granted or denied . That report can be appealed to the Referee who will issue a report recommending the report be approved or overturned or modified . This can also be appealed to the Commission en banc who will then grant or deny the case . Upon issuance of a Pooling Order from a protested application , it can be appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court . <p> Oklahoma 's forced pooling process benefits operators , working interest partners , and mineral interest owners . It stimulates a competitive market for development of oil and gas , which results in revenues for investors and royalty owners .

There is always the possibility that the pump might be inaccurate but typically the vehicle capacity rating is only an approximate volume . Manufacturers evaluate the entire fuel system when determining the tanks rated fuel capacity . The rated number can easily vary by 3% . The manufacturers even round off the rated amount to the nearest whole number . The fuel tank capacity also does not account for the vapor head space or the filter pipe . If a customer does not stop pumping gas when the automatic shutoff engages the customer can " overfill " the tank .

@@106539208 @1939208/ <h> Information on why I was able to pump more gasoline into my tank than my vehicle manual states is the capacity . <p> The vehicle manual indicates my gas tank should hold a certain capacity but the fuel metered was more than the gas tank should have held . There is always the possibility that the pump might be inaccurate but typically the vehicle capacity rating is only an approximate volume . Manufacturers evaluate the entire fuel system when determining the tanks rated fuel capacity . The rated number can easily vary by 3% . The manufacturers even round off the rated amount to the nearest whole number . The fuel tank capacity also does not account for the vapor head space or the filter pipe . If a customer does not stop pumping gas when the automatic shutoff engages the customer can " overfill " the tank . If you feel a station has shorted you on gasoline , please contact the OCC at 521-2487.
