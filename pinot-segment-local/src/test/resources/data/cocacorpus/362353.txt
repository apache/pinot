Even with the easing , shipments activity continue to reflect improvements in the sector , much like the new orders data discussed above . On a year-over-year basis , factory shipments have risen 5.3 percent since March 2016 , or 6.0 percent excluding transportation . <p> International Trade Report The Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Census Bureau reported that the U.S. trade deficit edged marginally lower , down from $43.76 billion in February to $43.71 billion in March . In the first quarter of 2017 , the trade deficit averaged $45.21 billion , buoyed by January 's $48.17 billion figure , which had been the highest level in nearly five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $41.71 billion in 2016 as a whole . In March , goods exports ( down from $128.34 billion to $126.28 billion ) and goods imports ( down from $193.49 billion to $191.79 billion ) were both lower , essentially offsetting one another . Goods imports were at their slowest pace since November . In addition , the service-sector surplus rose somewhat from $21.39 billion to $21.80 billion . <p> More importantly , the manufactured goods exports picture appears to have improved through the first three months of 2017 . This is a welcome development after the declines in each of the past two years . Using non-seasonally adjusted data , U.S.-manufactured goods exports totaled $263.83 billion year to date in March up 3.67 percent from $254.49 billion in the same time period one year ago . <p> This reflects better year-to-date figures in five of the top-six markets for U.S.-manufactured goods : Canada ( up from $63.62 billion to $66.93 billion ) , Mexico ( up from $55.63 billion to $58.70 billion ) , China ( up from $25.21 billion to $29.50 billion ) , Japan ( up from $15.06 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $12.31 billion to $12.95 billion ) . The exception was the United Kingdom " our fifth-largest trading partner " with year-to-date exports slipping from $13.38 billion to $13.08 billion . <p> ISM Manufacturing PMI The Institute for Supply Management 's ( ISM ) Manufacturing PMI slowed in April but continued to expand modestly . The composite index declined from 57.2 in March to 54.8 in April . As such , growth in the sector remained decent overall despite easing from February 's two-and-a-half-year high reading ( 57.7 ) . Indeed , it was the eighth consecutive monthly expansion in the headline number , recognizing definite progress after two years of notable challenges in the sector . The sample comments tend to echo those improvements , citing better economic conditions and a more favorable outlook . At the same time , respondents noted some lingering headwinds and increased pricing pressures . The ISM report mostly mirrors other sentiment surveys that have observed some pullbacks from multiyear highs post-election , even as they remain mostly encouraging . <p> Digging into the underlying data , production accelerated in April to a two-month high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure has averaged 60.0 over the past five months ( December to April ) , a notable improvement from the 53.5 average in the prior five months ( July to November ) . Exports rose at the fastest growth rate since November 2013 ( up from 59.0 to 59.5 ) . On the other hand , most of the other measures eased for the month , including new orders ( down from 64.5 to 57.5 ) , employment ( down from 58.9 to 52.0 ) and supplier deliveries ( down from 55.9 to 55.1 ) . It was those decelerating figures that pulled the headline index lower , but still , each has expanded for at least seven months , providing some reassurance for the sector . <p> Prices for raw materials remained highly elevated despite some easing in April ( down from 70.5 to 68.5 ) , with input prices pulling back slightly from its quickest rate since May 2011 . Meanwhile , inventories expanded in April for the second time in the past three months ( up from 49.0 to 51.0 ) . With stockpiles quite depleted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in demand should necessitate strong growth in production moving forward . <p> Personal Income and Spending The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that personal spending remained flat in March , slowing from more robust purchasing at the end of 2016 . Personal consumption expenditures ( PCEs ) were unchanged in both February and March , down from gains of 0.6 percent and 0.2 percent in December and January , respectively . The data suggest that Americans have once again become more cautious in their spending . To illustrate this point , personal spending grew 0.9 percent at the annual rate in the first quarter , decelerating sharply from the 5.6 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter . More than anything , that helps to explain the soft real GDP numbers for the first quarter of 2017 , up just 0.7 percent . In addition , the saving rate has moved higher with weaker spending activity , up from 5.2 percent in December to 5.9 percent in March . <p> To be fair , we have seen improvements in personal spending over the longer term . For instance , PCEs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saving rate was also slightly higher one year ago at 6.2 percent . <p> Meanwhile , personal income increased 0.2 percent in March , easing from 0.3 percent in February and rising at its slowest rate since November . On a year-over-year basis , personal incomes have continued to increase at a decent clip , up 4.5 percent since March 2016 . This was unchanged from the prior report and was nearly a two-year high . Despite the higher data overall , manufacturing wages and salaries edged down from $859.2 billion in February to $852.7 billion in March . Nonetheless , there has been a steady upward trend in manufacturing compensation in general , with wages and salaries in the sector averaging $806.7 billion and $829.4 billion in 2015 and 2016 , respectively . <p> In other news , the PCE deflator decreased 0.2 percent in March , the first decline in one year . The lower figure in this report came mostly from reduced energy costs , down 3.4 percent . Excluding food and energy , core inflation also experienced weakness , down 0.1 percent . The PC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 2.1 percent in the prior release but up from 0.8 percent one year ago . Even with accelerated pressures in recent months , core price growth remains mostly under control for now , with core inflation up 1.6 percent over the past 12 months . <p> Productivity and Costs The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that manufacturing labor productivity rose 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 2017 , slower than the 2.0 percent gain in the fourth quarter of 2016 . Nonetheless , it was the second straight quarterly increase in productivity in the sector , with fourth quarter activity rebounding from declines in each of the two prior quarters . In this release , output per worker in manufacturing increased 2.8 percent , its fastest quarterly rate since the second quarter of 2014 . Unit labor costs increased 2.1 percent . There were large sectoral differences in the data , with labor productivity for durable goods firms down 1.1 percent in the first quarter but up 3.2 percent for nondurable goods manufacturers . As a result , unit labor costs rose 2.5 percent and 1.3 percent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Overall , since the Great Recession , the data continue a trend of lethargic growth in manufacturing productivity , which rose just 0.2 percent in 2016 . For instance , manufacturing output per worker essentially stagnated from 2013 to 2016 , down 0.05 percent per year on average , well below the 5.2 percent pace from 2002 to 2008 . Over the longer term , manufacturers have benefited from being leaner , but the recent sluggishness in productivity and output growth has meant that unit labor costs have risen 12.9 percent since the end of 2011 . <p> In the larger economy , nonfarm labor productivity declined 0.6 percent in the first quarter . This ended three consecutive quarterly increases , with a gain of 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter . Nonfarm output eased from 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter to 1.0 percent in the first quarter . Similar to the manufacturing data described above , nonfarm labor productivity has slowed considerably since the Great Recession , averaging 0.5 percent per year from 2011 to 2016 . It was up only 0.2 percent in 2016 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@25684651 @5684651/ <h> Law Center Search Results <p> In November , 2013 , a California judge ruled that the California Air Resources Board ( CARB ) has the discretion to raise revenues by auctioning and selling allowances under the state 's greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program . The NAM had intervened in this suit to bring to the court 's attention the extraordinary revenues generated by the auction and reserve sale provisions adopted by the CARB , which we said were far beyond what the law required for administering the program . We also argued that the fees constituted a new tax that must be approved by the legislature , an issue that the judge considered a close call . <p> On March 7 , 2014 , the NAM appealed the case to an intermediate California appeals court . Our opening brief was filed Oct. 20 , 2014 , and our reply brief on May 4 , 2015 , making these same arguments . <p> We argued that AB 32 does not authorize the Board to generate billions of dollars in revenues over and above the regulatory fees separately authorized to implement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any environmental program in the United States . Moreover , the revenues vastly exceed the amount necessary to implement AB 32 , which is already full funded through a separate statutory provision expressly authorizing the collection of regulatory fees . There has been no showing that those revenues have a reasonable relationship to the regulatory burden imposed on manufacturers , and the funds have been set aside to fund programs that have not yet been identified . <p> Moreover , if raising such large sums through auctions and reserve sales is authorized , then that revenue-raising authority is a tax that violates the California Constitution because the law was not adopted by a two-thirds majority of the legislature . <p> On its own initiative , the appellate court issued a set of questions to the parties in preparation for upcoming oral arguments . The NAM filed a supplemental brief in May arguing that ( 1 ) allowances are taxes , not property rights , ( 2 ) there is no relationship between environmental impacts and the billions of dollars in excess revenue generated by the auctions and reserve sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( 4 ) they can not be upheld on the ground that they confer the " privilege to pollute , " ( 5 ) fees generated in excess of the amount needed to run the program are taxes , ( 6 ) the purchase of allowances is not in any practical sense voluntary , and ( 7 ) the relief that should be granted is elimination of the tax . Oral arguments in the case were held on Jan. 24 , 2017 . <p> On April 6 , 2017 , the Court decided 2 to 1 to uphold the allowance auction system . The majority felt that AB32 authorized the State Air Resources Board to adopt the cap-and-trade system , and left the development of the details to the Board . It also found that the money paid by companies that buy allowances in the auction do not constitute a tax because , unlike a tax , ( 1 ) they are not compulsory , and ( 2 ) purchasers receive something of value in return . Click here for a summary of the trial court proceedings . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade auction system created by California 's Air Resources Board ( ARB ) . The system generates extraordinary revenues , far beyond what is needed for administering the program . In the lower courts , we argued that the fees constitute a tax that must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the legislature . <p> The trial judge upheld the auction system , but said it was a close call . His ruling was affirmed 2-1 on appeal , and , on May 16 , 2017 , the NAM appealed to the California Supreme Court . <p> We argued that the lower court should have used the controlling legal precedent to assess whether a charge imposed for regulatory purposes is a tax . By rejecting that precedent , the court provided " a roadmap for the evasion of Proposition 13 , " which requires a two-thirds vote of the legislature to increase taxes . <p> " ARB purposely designed the allowance auctions to raise billions in excess revenue that could be used for general public benefit purposes , " we argued . The Board endorsed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government 's reliance on ordinary taxes for financing expenditures . " We urged the court to review the ruling , which " concerns the constitutionality of a multi-billion dollar transfer of wealth from California businesses to the State . " The ruling " effectively grants ARB a blank check to raise unlimited revenue , free and clear of any meaningful restraint . " <p> We also challenged the appellate court 's view that auction allowances are voluntary because a company is free to " choose to leave the state . " We argued that that " holding defies precedent , the record evidence , and common sense , and taken to its logical conclusion , would mean that virtually all taxes are ' voluntary . ' " The idea that business in California are simply " volunteering " to pay billions of dollars to the State out of the goodness of their hearts is nonsensical . Every tax can be avoided by leaving the state , but that does not make the tax voluntary . Moreover , while the auction allowances may be a valuable asset , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable assets ( sales taxes ) or to engage in a valuable activity ( income taxes ) . <p> In November , 2012 , the California Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the fees charged by the California Air Resources Board ( CARB ) for the state 's cap-and-trade greenhouse gas program . The NAM moved to intervene in the litigation , focusing not on the legality of the cap-and-trade program itself or the merits of climate change science , but on the extraordinary revenues generated by the auction and reserve sale provisions adopted by CARB . <p> The effectiveness of the cap-and-trade program comes from the state 's ability to ratchet down greenhouse gas emissions from year to year . CARB may not go beyond this authority to generate a huge income stream for the state . The first quarterly auction of greenhouse gas allowances in November , 2012 , raised nearly $289 million for California , substantially more than the $62 million required to implement the law . Moreover , that revenue is projected to increase to as much as $70 billion over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2 billion is expected to be generated by the program , and most of the funds already collected have been earmarked for housing and transportation projects . <p> We argued that that income goes far beyond simply paying for the costs of administering the program , and thus exceeded the legal authority of CARB . Alternatively , even if the fees were authorized , they constitute a massive new tax that must have been approved by a 2/3 majority of the California legislature under the state constitution . <p> On Nov. 12 , 2013 , the judge ruled that the Air Resources Board was given the discretion to raise revenues by auctioning and selling allowances . The fact that the Board may charge an administrative fee does not prevent it from also auctioning the allowances . The judge also ruled that the revenues were not an unconstitutional tax , although he called that a close question . He analyzed the difference between taxes and government regulatory fees , and found the charges more like traditional regulatory fees . The primary purpose is for regulation , not revenue , the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the fees collected are reasonably related to the burden imposed by the greenhouse gas emissions . The court was at a loss to know what the fees will actually be used for , but the law requires that they be used to further the emissions reduction goals of AB 32 . It admitted that " since nearly every aspect of life has some impact on GHG emissions , it is difficult to conceive of a regulatory activity that will not have an least some impact on GHG emissions . " Thus , the decision gives extremely broad power to the state government to use the funds collected and not have them be considered a tax . <p> This income scheme will significantly raise energy costs in the state and further harm its competitiveness , without providing any additional environmental benefits , since it will still be affected by GHG emissions from elsewhere around the world .

Sadly , Rhode Island is consistently near the bottom when it comes to national competitiveness scorecards . <p> One well-publicized analysis showed that 60 percent of the state 's truck traffic is from out of state and the remainder in-state . This calculated divide has provided RhodeWorks supporters the ammunition to defend the truck toll as something to be paid mostly by commercial drivers just passing through . Regardless of who is in or out of state , that toll revenue to be paid by interstate trucking and other heavy-duty haulers will have supply chain impacts that make manufacturing and businesses located in Rhode Island less competitive . The punitive costs imposed on trucking , if tolling is carried out as planned , will continue to harm the state 's overall business climate .

Unfortunately , impacted transportation users and manufacturers have been marginalized in the pursuit of the RhodeWorks program . The courts could be an eventual next step to help settle questions concerning economic harm , potential violations of interstate commerce or process , but it 's an option that we hope can be avoided .

@@25685098 @5685098/ 55391 @qwx255391 55392 @qwx255392 <h> Legislative Process <p> Introduction : Anyone may draft a bill ; however , only members of Congress can introduce legislation , and by doing so become the sponsor(s) . There are four basic types of legislation : bills , joint resolutions , concurrent resolutions , and simple resolutions . The official legislative process begins when a bill or resolution is numbered - H.R. signifies a House bill and S. a Senate bill - referred to a committee and printed by the Government Printing Office . <p> Step 1 . Referral to Committee : With few exceptions , bills are referred to standing committees in the House or Senate according to carefully delineated rules of procedure . <p> Step 2 . Committee Action : When a bill reaches a committee it is placed on the committee 's calendar . A bill can be referred to a subcommittee or considered by the committee as a whole . It is at this point that a bill is examined carefully and its chances for passage are determined . If the committee does not act on a bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Subcommittee Review : Often , bills are referred to a subcommittee for study and hearings . Hearings provide the opportunity to put on the record the views of the executive branch , experts , other public officials , supporters and opponents of the legislation . Testimony can be given in person or submitted as a written statement . <p> Step 4 . Mark Up : When the hearings are completed , the subcommittee may meet to " mark up " the bill , that is , make changes and amendments prior to recommending the bill to the full committee . If a subcommittee votes not to report legislation to the full committee , the bill dies . <p> Step 5 . Committee Action to Report A Bill : After receiving a subcommittee 's report on a bill , the full committee can conduct further study and hearings , or it can vote on the subcommittee 's recommendations and any proposed amendments . The full committee then votes on its recommendation to the House or Senate . This procedure is called " ordering a bill reported . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a committee votes to have a bill reported , the committee chairman instructs staff to prepare a written report on the bill . This report describes the intent and scope of the legislation , impact on existing laws and programs , position of the executive branch , and views of dissenting members of the committee . <p> Step 7 . Scheduling Floor Action : After a bill is reported back to the chamber where it originated , it is placed in chronological order on the calendar . In the House there are several different legislative calendars , and the Speaker and majority leader largely determine if , when , and in what order bills come up . In the Senate there is only one legislative calendar . <p> Step 8 . Debate : When a bill reaches the floor of the House or Senate , there are rules or procedures governing the debate on legislation . These rules determine the conditions and amount of time allocated for general debate . <p> Step 9 . Voting : After the debate and the approval of any amendments , the bill is passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Referral to Other Chamber : When a bill is passed by the House or the Senate it is referred to the other chamber where it usually follows the same route through committee and floor action . This chamber may approve the bill as received , reject it , ignore it , or change it . <p> Step 11 . Conference Committee Action : If only minor changes are made to a bill by the other chamber , it is common for the legislation to go back to the first chamber for concurrence . However , when the actions of the other chamber significantly alter the bill , a conference committee is formed to reconcile the differences between the House and Senate versions . If the conferees are unable to reach agreement , the legislation dies . If agreement is reached , a conference report is prepared describing the committee members recommendations for changes . Both the House and the Senate must approve of the conference report . <p> Step 12 . Final Actions : After a bill has been approved by both the House and Senate in identical form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President approves of the legislation he signs it and it becomes law . Or , the President can take no action for ten days , while Congress is in session , and it automatically becomes law . If the President opposes the bill he can veto it ; or , if he takes no action after the Congress has adjourned its second session , it is a " pocket veto " and the legislation dies . <p> Step 13 . Overriding a Veto : If the President vetoes a bill , Congress may attempt to " override the veto . " This requires a two thirds roll call vote of the members who are present in sufficient numbers for a quorum .
