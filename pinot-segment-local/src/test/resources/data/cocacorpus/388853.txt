This article describes how to best use font families that have extended weights that may range from Extra Light all the way to Extra Black . <p> Here is how a regular and bold weight would be defined : <p> font-weight:normal font-weight:bold <p> But for all other weights a numerical range from 100 to 900 is used . One of the challenges with web fonts is that most web browsers do not properly support font weights other than normal &amp; bold . The following chart describes the possible mappings of weights to the numeric definitions : <p> 100 Extra Light or Ultra Light <p> 200 Light or Thin <p> 300 Book or Demi <p> 400 Normal or Regular <p> 500 Medium <p> 600 Semibold , Demibold <p> 700 Bold <p> 800 Black , Extra Bold or Heavy <p> 900 Extra Black , Fat , Poster or Ultra Black <h> How Webtype solves the issues with font-weight <p> We have solved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to customize the font-family name for each web font . For example you can create a font-family definition for Interstate-Light , and then use the font-weight:normal definition ( versus font-weight:100 which does not work properly across all browsers ) . <p> You will find the option to customize the font-family name after you have added fonts to a CSS resource in the Web Font Manager in your account .

@@45706887 @5706887/ <h> Web Font Quality <p> We often are asked the question of why fonts look different on a Mac vs Windows , or in one web browser compared to another . This article will address the issues of web font quality . <p> First of all , it is the Operating System ( OS ) , and not the web browser that impacts font quality . <p> The Mac OS has a different font rendering system than Windows . And Windows has three different rendering options that generate different quality results . <p> We recommend reviewing web fonts in the sizes that you will be using in four different rendering modes to judge font quality : <p> Mac OS X <p> Windows Standard grayscale <p> Windows ClearType <p> Windows DirectWrite <p> As you can see above there are significant differences in each of these rendering modes . <p> Mac OS X renders text using sub pixel rendering . This makes type look smooth , which some people prefer but others think is too fuzzy . Also , it can make the font bolder looking than on Windows . Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into TrueType fonts , rather it has its own algorithms to render the text on screen . <p> Windows Standard Grayscale : This is the default setting in Windows XP and uses grayscale antialiasing to smooth the edges of screen fonts . TrueType fonts can be hinted to be optimized for this setting . <p> Windows ClearType : This uses color pixels to smooth the edges of fonts using subpixel rendering to improve font rendering on LCD screens . ClearType is an option in Windows XP , but is automatically enabled in Windows XP with Internet Explorer 8 . ClearType is on by default in in Windows Vista and Windows 7 . <p> Windows DirectWrite is a new text and graphics rendering system in Windows 7 , and is also available for Windows Vista SP2 . DirectWrite significantly enhances the quality of text by adding y-direction antialiasing . Thus the tops , bottoms and diagonals of characters appear much smoother with DirectWrite . New versions of browsers , including Internet Explorer 9 and FireFox 4 are offering support for DirectWrite . <p> Here is the most recent data for OS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 48.78% <p> Windows 7 - 27.68% <p> Windows Vista - 15.1% <p> Mac OS X - 6.56% <p> Linux - 0.74% <p> Thus the two most prominent Windows rendering modes today are Standard Grayscale and ClearType . All the fonts on Webtype are optimized for proper rendering in Windows at their designated size ranges . <p> Fonts in the Text category will look good at text sizes ( 12 to 24 ) . <p> Fonts in the Headline category will look best at larger sizes ( 24 on up ) . <p> Below are examples of fonts in each of the different rending modes : <p> Mac OS X default font rendering : <p> Windows - Grayscale font rendering : <p> Windows - ClearType font rendering <p> Windows - DirectWrite font rendering <p> Webtype provides high-end fonts for online typography .
