There are several sites to help you find free camping , including this one , but let 's concentrate on learning to fish instead of looking for fish dinners . Were going to point you to some of the primary sources for free camping information and try to show you how to find what you 're looking for . <p> First , here 's a list of terms to be familiar with : <p> Dispersed Camping Dispersed camping is camping outside of a campground area on public lands . Often , there will be existing fire rings , picnic tables and/or lantern posts in a pull off from the road . However , in most areas , as long as you are not blocking a road , gate or trailhead dispersed camping is fine as long as dispersed camping is allowed in that district . <p> BLM Bureau of Land Management . The BLM administers public lands that encompass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of these lands are in the western states . Often mineral rights or grazing land are leased from the BLM by private companies or individuals . <p> Dispersed camping is allowed on most BLM land for up to 14 days . Even if land is leased or has mining claims , you may camp there unless posted otherwise by BLM management . You may cross private land ( as long as there is a public road ) to reach BLM areas . You should not come across a locked gate , but if you cross a gate , please leave it in the state you found it open or closed . <p> USFS US Forestry Service . THE USFS administers the 175 national forests and grasslands in the United States . They are responsible for regulating logging , grazing and mineral rights on these lands as well as maintaining roads , trails , campgrounds and law enforcement in the area . The forestry service offers many developed campgrounds as well as a large number of official dispersed camping sites . Regulations vary based on the ranger district , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 14 days . <p> NPS National Park Service . The NPS manages all 58 national parks in the U.S. as well as 333 national monuments and historic areas . Many national parks offer campgrounds , but park lands are often more protected than forestry or BLM lands . As a result , dispersed camping is not allowed in many national parks , although this is not an across the board rule dispersed camping areas do exist in some national parks . <p> WMA Wildlife Management Area . WMAs are state run areas of land that are often designated for hunting , fishing or simply preservation . Rules vary from state to state and often from one WMA to another within the same state . Some states allow camping in the majority of their WMAs , some disallow it entirely . Some charge a day use or seasonal permit fee . The name of the agency that runs the state WMAs varies , but a web search of " WMA &lt;state name&gt; " should point you in the right direction . <p> County Parks County parks may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect , the rules vary greatly , but depending on your area , there may be some great parks that allow free camping . The more remote an area , the better your odds are that it allows camping . You may also find that multiple organizations within the same county have their own park systems which means even more varying rules and fee schedules . <p> City Parks City and Town parks may be the easiest of all to find if they exist at all . If a city park allows RV camping , they will often advertise the fact . Often you will find that they have dumpstations , drinking water , electricity and/or free wireless internet . The cities that maintain parks such as these are hoping to attract travelers in order to- boost their economies . One such park we visited went as far as having signs on the outskirts of town advertising the amenities , directions and how long you could stay . <p> Now that we 've got some definitions out of the way , where exactly can you find camping information ? One important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal agencies that are potential sources of free camping areas , they are all broken up into individual units . <p> For national parks , you only need to check the site for the individual park . For BLM lands , you begin looking in a specific state and then see that the districts are broken up geographically and select the district you are interested in . Forestry Service land is similar to BLM land , but often you will see contiguous districts within the same forest . The name of an area may change when it crosses a state border , but often the BLM or USFS area may be administered by the same district . <p> Once you 've narrowed down your area as much as possible , start checking out the information provided on the website . Look for links such as recreation or camping . Remember that not only does each district have different regulations , they also have different websites ! Often these sites look very similar , but you 'll find that some links are n't  where you 've grown accustomed to seeing them or on occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the websites administered by the same organization . <p> Some key things to look for are lists of campgrounds and camping regulations . Often you can find a complete list of campgrounds in the district along with prices and amenities . A surprising number of these campgrounds have no fees associated with them or very reasonable rates . Obviously , the more amenities a campground offers , the higher the price is likely to be . If you can find a list of camping regulations , often dispersed camping will be mentioned . Look for language that states camping is not allowed outside of designated campgrounds or language that states dispersed camping is permitted under certain circumstances . <p> If you 're unable to find any dispersed camping regulations or a campground that suits your desires , look for the district office phone number and give them a call ! For the most part , employees at these agencies are very helpful and will be glad to point you to free campgrounds or dispersed camping areas . You may have to explain what you mean by dispersed camping to some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive a rude response . If the person you 're talking to does n't  know the answer , they will likely ask someone or transfer you to someone that does . We even had one lady scan a map and email it to us ! <p> If dispersed camping is permitted , but there are no official areas or campgrounds in the area , you can still go out and pick your own spot as long as you comply with the local regulations . I think the best method for this is simply asking the locals where to find a nice campsite . Rangers can be a great resource as well as people that live in the area . If you stop in a district office , you can get excellent maps . Depending on the agency and what maps are available , the prices vary , but when you think of it as your campground fee , they will seem quite reasonable as you 're paying a few bucks to camp for up to two weeks . <p> Now , assuming you 've found a spot you want to check out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you figure out where it is ? If you get lucky , the responsible agency has provided you with GPS coordinates , but do n't  bet on it . More commonly , you 'll see driving directions . Typically , these directions assume you are coming from one town or perhaps two or three if its an area with multiple population centers nearby . On occasion , you 'll find nothing more than a site name and a description stating what road its on and perhaps how far from the nearest intersection . Some agencies may provide a detailed map showing the area and the local roads . <p> Getting these various formats plugged into a GPS system can be challenging at times . GPS coordinates pose little problem if they are a fairly standard format , but they are pretty rare , so let 's look at the ways to resolve the other types you may find . <p> One of the first problems you 'll run into is that many free camping areas are on very small roads . Often these roads have only numbers associated with them or , even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number , but your directions have one variant and your mapping software has the other . Another common problem is that the important roads for finding the campsite do n't  show up on your map unless you zoom in to a high level of detail , making it difficult to follow the turns and directions . Finally , the road may not even exist in your mapping software as it is a new road or so small as to have escaped the notice of the cartographer entirely . <p> We have found that Google Maps can be an excellent resource for cutting down the research time when trying to pin down coordinates for a particular site . One of the first things I will try is going to http : //maps.google.com and trying a map search . The important thing I have found is to click Show Search Options , which will bring up a drop down box to the left of the Search Maps button . Often , you get much better results by changing the options from " All Results to User-created Content . If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or the state abbreviation where it should be . If there is no name associated with the area , you can try the name of the district its in along with campground , campsite , primitive , camping , etc . <p> Many people that enjoy camping are actively putting up GPS coordinates for places theyve stayed . Often you may find half a dozen GPS coordinates in the same general area for the site you 're looking for . <p> The last trick involving Google Maps is figuring out how to get that little marker into a plain old GPS format . <p> If you have multiple pins , decide which one you want to use . <p> Close the text box associated with the pin . <p> Right click on the pin and select What 's Here ? <p> Google will put the Longitude and Latitude in the search box . <p> You may now copy and paste the coordinates . <p> If you strike out with a Google map search for the camping areas name , you can try to virtually follow the given directions inside of your chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to match up road shapes from a provided map with unnamed or differently named roads . You 'll find you often need to zoom in to even see the roads you 're looking for . You may even need to use multiple types of mapping software as you find the roads you 're looking for do n't  exist in one or the other . Do n't  give up easily though , if you have a hard time locating the site , it just may be one of the more pristine areas out there and one you 'll truly appreciate . <p> Finally , if you 've done all of the above and tracked down a keeper , why not share it with the community here at freecampsites.net ? If we all contribute just a little bit of research time , well all have many more sites to choose from with a lot less effort to locate them .

In general , you can camp anywhere in a national forest unless posted otherwise . Individual forests might have their own restrictions , so it is always best to check with them before setting up camp . The same thing goes for BLM land . <h> Camping In The Wild <p> It is called dispersed camping . When you disperse camp , you are on your own . The only thing provided is an un-designated patch of land . You have to bring everything that you will need and pack out everything that you brought . You will have to deal with your own poo by burying it or packing it out with you . In addition , there will not be any drinking water supplied . There might be a spring or body of water near by . In that case , you will want to filter it before drinking . or cooking . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is first come , first served . <p> If possible , I suggest scouting out the area before you try to drive your large RV to it . That way , you will know what to expect . Its no fun driving 10 miles into the forest to find a locked gate and no where to turn your 40 ' motorhome or trailer around . If you are in doubt and cant scout , call the rangers office and ask about the conditions . <h> Dispersed Camping Guidelines <p> Each area has its own set of rules . Its best to contact the individual agency for specifics . As an example , here are the guidelines from Colorados San Juan National Forest <p> All dispersed campers should follow the ideals of Leave No Trace and practice the concept of Pack It In Pack It Out . <p> You may not travel more than 300 feet from a designated road ( see MVUM below ) <p> When using a dispersed camping area , the general rule is to be a minimum of at least 100-200 feet away from any road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to stay a maximum of 14 days in any 30-day period . <p> 90% of the time , the only dog restriction when you are dispersed camping is that they need to be under your control at all times . <h> - <h> Finding Dispersed Campsites <p> We recommend using our website , http : //freecampsites.net as we make it really easy to locate dispersed camping in your area . We have maps , gps coordinates , pictures , and user submitted reviews . <p> Contacting the agency who manages the area you are interested in is also a great way to find campsites . They are on location and know the current conditions . <p> You can also go out on your own and try to discover " unknown " wild campsites . If you decide to go it alone in a national forest , make sure that you have their most recent Motor Vehicle Use Map . They also show where dispersed camping is allowed along with areas that it prohibited . Why MVUMs ? Since the Travel Management Rule for the U.S. Forest Service was implemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vehicular travel . The rule requires each national forest or ranger district to designate those roads , trails , and areas open to motor vehicles . Designation will include class of vehicle and , if appropriate , time of year for motor vehicle use . A given route , for example , could be designated for use by motorcycles , ATVs , or street-legal vehicles . Once designation is complete , the rule will prohibit motor vehicle use off the designated system or inconsistent with the designations . Designations will be shown on a motor vehicle use map . Use inconsistent with the designations will be prohibited . The rule requires each national forest or ranger district to designate those roads , trails , and areas open to motor vehicles . The MVUM can usually be obtained at a local ranger station . They are provided free of cost . Many times you can download them in PDF form from the individual forests website . Learn more about MVUMs : http : **40;74;TOOLONG <p> Google Earth and satellite maps are also a tremendous help . You can use them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even leaving your house . Often times , you 'll even see other people camping . <h> Other Lands for Dispersed Camping <p> Most states have lands that are managed by the states Fish and Game Commission . These are usually called Wildlife Management Areas ( WMAs ) . Many allow you to camp . There are a good number of states that allow camping on State Trust Land . State Forests might also be a good bet in your area . There are only a handful of states that have State Parks with dispersed camping . Some utility companies allow it on their land . Privately held conservation lands might also permit dispersed camping . All of these options vary from state to state and each owner might have a different set of rules . <h> Enjoy Yourself <p> Welcome to the world of free camping ! I hope you enjoy it as much as we do .

In general , you can camp at any time of the year , weather permitting , on National Forest and Bureau of Land Management land . You are normally allowed to stay up to fourteen days in any one location . Camping locations managed by other agencies , like a Wildlife Management Areas , might only allow camping seasonally . The good news is that National Forests and BLM land make up the majority of the land that you can camp on .

I have placed it here , because I believe it is important to get the word out : <p> HR 5204 is written as an amendment to the current law , in the form of line-by-line additions , deletions , and substitutions , which makes it very difficult for the public to understand . ( Probably this was the intention . ) A detailed analysis of the major provisions of HR 5204 can been seen at this link . <p> Action is urgently needed to stop a bill introduced in the House , and already rammed through Committee and ready for a floor vote . HR 5204 would authorize the Forest Service and BLM to charge fees for all public lands , for any activity , by any person , any time . Details follow . Please TAKE ACTION NOW !

Although HR 5204 has attracted no sponsor in the Senate so far , its likely that if attached as an appropriations rider it will pass both chambers without scrutiny or public debate , and become the law of the land , because appropriations bills are considered " must pass " in order to avoid a government shutdown . <p> HR 5204 , if enacted , could destroy the concept of public lands as places where everyone has access and is welcome . Every place , every activity , every person , could be required to pay a fee an additional tax on top of the taxes that already support public lands for access , regardless whether they are highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or completely undeveloped like Wilderness Areas . <p> HR 5204 would allow the kind of fees that have not been controversial to continue , such as fees for developed campgrounds and National Park entrance fees . But in addition to those fees , it would allow general access fees for any federal recreational lands and waters . It would accomplish this by two types of fee : Day Use Fees and Permit Fees . <p> The only meaningful requirement for a Day Use Fee would be that where you park there is a toilet of some kind ( could be a porta-potty or a stinky outhouse ) within 1/2 mile . <p> The only meaningful requirement for a Permit Fee would be that where you park gives access to a " special area . " Neither " special " nor " area " is defined . The land agencies would have complete discretion to claim that any place at all is a " special area . " <p> So where there is a toilet it could be called a Day Use Fee . Where there is not a toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result is the same : there would not be any place where a fee is not allowed . And since the agencies would get to keep all the fee money directly , there would be not be anywhere that they would n't have a strong incentive to charge a fee . <p> Public lands ? Forget that . Not any more . Not if this passes . <p> There is other stuff in HR 5204 ( like no more fee-free days , citizenship checks on annual pass holders , and overhead costs rising from 15% to 25% ) , but they only rearrange the deck chairs on the sinking ship of our public lands . <p> A detailed analysis of the major provisions is on our website at this link . <p> Congress is on vacation until the week after Labor Day .

Tell them that this major change in public policy can not be allowed , particularly without any public hearing or debate . <p> HR 5204 lacks any over-arching vision or framework of our public lands being spaces where we all are welcome and have access . Yet its being supported by groups like the National Parks Conservation Association , The Wilderness Society , and America Outdoors , because it throws a bone here and there to their special interests . But for the general public , there is nothing redeeming in this bill , nor any way it could be amended into something acceptable . It represents a complete change in public lands policy , which would be accomplished without public hearings or debate . <p> * Use their webform. * Call their office in Washington . * Call their local office . * Write , phone , fax , drop in in person . <p> Do all of the above .

Dispersed camping is the term used for camping anywhere in the National Forest OUTSIDE of a designated campground . Dispersed camping means no services ; such as trash removal , and little or no facilities ; such as tables and fire pits , are provided . Some popular dispersed camping areas may have toilets . <p> There are extra responsibilities and skills that are necessary for dispersed camping . It is your responsibility to know these before you try this new experience . Camping rules and regulations apply to make your experience safe , and to keep the natural resources scenic and unspoiled for other campers . <h> Rules for Dispersed Camping <p> Groups of over 75 people who wish to use the forest , need to obtain a special use permit . There is no fee and permits can be obtained at the nearest District Office . <p> You need to be self-contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrooms or trash cans . <p> You may camp in a dispersed area for up to 16 days . After 16 days , you must move at least 5 road miles for camping in another dispersed area . Campers may not return to the same campsite within the calendar year . <p> Please place your campsite at least 100 feet from any stream or other water source . <p> Be Bear Aware . There are bears on the National Forest , so camp accordingly . <h> Where Can I Disperse Camp ? <p> The best way to find out what areas are open to dispersed camping is to contact the nearest Forest Service office to the area you wish to visit . Typically , dispersed camping is NOT allowed in the vicinity of developed recreation areas such as campgrounds , picnic areas , or trailheads . Many people drive out on Forest Service roads into the woods and find a clearing or a spot near a stream or with a view of the mountains . Do not drive on meadows to access your camping site . Drive on existing roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-mile perimeter away from campgrounds and 100 feet from any stream . To prevent resource damage please keep your campsite within 150 feet from a roadway . <h> How to Pick a Campsite <p> If you are going to an area where others have camped before , pick a site that has been used before . Plants , soil and wildlife are impacted by new campsites so using existing ones will minimize your impact in the forest . If there is no existing campsite , then follow these Leave No Trace guidelines . <p> Camp on bare soil if possible , to avoid damage or killing plants and grass . <p> Do NOT camp within 100 feet of any water source , plants near water are especially fragile . <p> Do not camp in the middle of a clearing or meadow ; try to make your campsite less visible so that other visitors will see a " wild " setting <p> Do not try to level or dig trenches in the ground at your campsite . Pick a tent site that is already level with good drainage . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites and fire rings . Wood permits are not needed for usage on the forest . If wood is transported home for personal use , pick up a permit at the nearest District Office . <p> The National Forest has wildfires each year . Many of these are caused by human activity , typically escaped campfires from dispersed campers . Campfires are allowed when you are dispersed camping unless there are fire restrictions in effect due to high fire danger conditions . It is your responsibility to know if fire restrictions are in effect before you go camping . You can learn about any fire restrictions by contacting the nearest Forest Service office . <h> Tips for Safe , Low Impact Campfires <p> Use existing fire rings if they exist . Minimize the scarring of new rocks , soil , and plants by using existing fire rings . <p> Select a site that is not in a meadow or clearing , that is not next to a tree with low overhanging branches , that is at least 100 feet from any water source to protect fragile vegetation . <p> Clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet in diameter . <p> If you do n't bring your own firewood collect only dead wood that is on the ground . You should not cut branches off of live trees . If a popular camping area does not have dead wood on the ground , please bring your own firewood . The animals , insects , and micro-organisms in the soil need rotting wood on the ground to survive . <p> Before you leave your campfire make sure is it completely out . You should be able to put your whole hand into the ashes without being burned , it should be cool to the touch . Stir the ashes to make sure all embers have cooled . This is very important ! Many forest fires are caused by abandoned campfires that were not completely out . <h> Water and Toiletting <p> Water gets contaminated by visitors who do not take care of their human waste or their garbage and food properly . <h> Going to the Bathroom in the Woods <p> Dispersed camping means no bathrooms and no outhouses .

It could easily get into the local water source and contaminate it . <h> Treating Your Water <p> We used to be able to take a cup and drink directly out of the sparkling creek , a rushing waterfall , or a clear , deep lake . There is NO safe water source anymore . With an increasing population and visitation to our National Forest , water sources have been contaminated with invisible micro-organisms that can make people very i 'll and even kill them in some cases .

There are several sites to help you find free camping , including this one , but let 's concentrate on learning to fish instead of looking for fish dinners . Were going to point you to some of the primary sources for free camping information and try to show you how to find what you 're looking for . <p> First , here 's a list of terms to be familiar with : <p> Dispersed Camping Dispersed camping is camping outside of a campground area on public lands . Often , there will be existing fire rings , picnic tables and/or lantern posts in a pull off from the road . However , in most areas , as long as you are not blocking a road , gate or trailhead dispersed camping is fine as long as dispersed camping is allowed in that district . <p> BLM Bureau of Land Management . The BLM administers public lands that encompass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of these lands are in the western states . Often mineral rights or grazing land are leased from the BLM by private companies or individuals . <p> Dispersed camping is allowed on most BLM land for up to 14 days . Even if land is leased or has mining claims , you may camp there unless posted otherwise by BLM management . You may cross private land ( as long as there is a public road ) to reach BLM areas . You should not come across a locked gate , but if you cross a gate , please leave it in the state you found it open or closed . <p> USFS US Forestry Service . THE USFS administers the 175 national forests and grasslands in the United States . They are responsible for regulating logging , grazing and mineral rights on these lands as well as maintaining roads , trails , campgrounds and law enforcement in the area . The forestry service offers many developed campgrounds as well as a large number of official dispersed camping sites . Regulations vary based on the ranger district , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 14 days . <p> NPS National Park Service . The NPS manages all 58 national parks in the U.S. as well as 333 national monuments and historic areas . Many national parks offer campgrounds , but park lands are often more protected than forestry or BLM lands . As a result , dispersed camping is not allowed in many national parks , although this is not an across the board rule dispersed camping areas do exist in some national parks . <p> WMA Wildlife Management Area . WMAs are state run areas of land that are often designated for hunting , fishing or simply preservation . Rules vary from state to state and often from one WMA to another within the same state . Some states allow camping in the majority of their WMAs , some disallow it entirely . Some charge a day use or seasonal permit fee . The name of the agency that runs the state WMAs varies , but a web search of " WMA &lt;state name&gt; " should point you in the right direction . <p> County Parks County parks may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect , the rules vary greatly , but depending on your area , there may be some great parks that allow free camping . The more remote an area , the better your odds are that it allows camping . You may also find that multiple organizations within the same county have their own park systems which means even more varying rules and fee schedules . <p> City Parks City and Town parks may be the easiest of all to find if they exist at all . If a city park allows RV camping , they will often advertise the fact . Often you will find that they have dumpstations , drinking water , electricity and/or free wireless internet . The cities that maintain parks such as these are hoping to attract travelers in order to- boost their economies . One such park we visited went as far as having signs on the outskirts of town advertising the amenities , directions and how long you could stay . <p> Now that we 've got some definitions out of the way , where exactly can you find camping information ? One important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal agencies that are potential sources of free camping areas , they are all broken up into individual units . <p> For national parks , you only need to check the site for the individual park . For BLM lands , you begin looking in a specific state and then see that the districts are broken up geographically and select the district you are interested in . Forestry Service land is similar to BLM land , but often you will see contiguous districts within the same forest . The name of an area may change when it crosses a state border , but often the BLM or USFS area may be administered by the same district . <p> Once you 've narrowed down your area as much as possible , start checking out the information provided on the website . Look for links such as recreation or camping . Remember that not only does each district have different regulations , they also have different websites ! Often these sites look very similar , but you 'll find that some links are n't  where you 've grown accustomed to seeing them or on occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the websites administered by the same organization . <p> Some key things to look for are lists of campgrounds and camping regulations . Often you can find a complete list of campgrounds in the district along with prices and amenities . A surprising number of these campgrounds have no fees associated with them or very reasonable rates . Obviously , the more amenities a campground offers , the higher the price is likely to be . If you can find a list of camping regulations , often dispersed camping will be mentioned . Look for language that states camping is not allowed outside of designated campgrounds or language that states dispersed camping is permitted under certain circumstances . <p> If you 're unable to find any dispersed camping regulations or a campground that suits your desires , look for the district office phone number and give them a call ! For the most part , employees at these agencies are very helpful and will be glad to point you to free campgrounds or dispersed camping areas . You may have to explain what you mean by dispersed camping to some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive a rude response . If the person you 're talking to does n't  know the answer , they will likely ask someone or transfer you to someone that does . We even had one lady scan a map and email it to us ! <p> If dispersed camping is permitted , but there are no official areas or campgrounds in the area , you can still go out and pick your own spot as long as you comply with the local regulations . I think the best method for this is simply asking the locals where to find a nice campsite . Rangers can be a great resource as well as people that live in the area . If you stop in a district office , you can get excellent maps . Depending on the agency and what maps are available , the prices vary , but when you think of it as your campground fee , they will seem quite reasonable as you 're paying a few bucks to camp for up to two weeks . <p> Now , assuming you 've found a spot you want to check out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you figure out where it is ? If you get lucky , the responsible agency has provided you with GPS coordinates , but do n't  bet on it . More commonly , you 'll see driving directions . Typically , these directions assume you are coming from one town or perhaps two or three if its an area with multiple population centers nearby . On occasion , you 'll find nothing more than a site name and a description stating what road its on and perhaps how far from the nearest intersection . Some agencies may provide a detailed map showing the area and the local roads . <p> Getting these various formats plugged into a GPS system can be challenging at times . GPS coordinates pose little problem if they are a fairly standard format , but they are pretty rare , so let 's look at the ways to resolve the other types you may find . <p> One of the first problems you 'll run into is that many free camping areas are on very small roads . Often these roads have only numbers associated with them or , even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number , but your directions have one variant and your mapping software has the other . Another common problem is that the important roads for finding the campsite do n't  show up on your map unless you zoom in to a high level of detail , making it difficult to follow the turns and directions . Finally , the road may not even exist in your mapping software as it is a new road or so small as to have escaped the notice of the cartographer entirely . <p> We have found that Google Maps can be an excellent resource for cutting down the research time when trying to pin down coordinates for a particular site . One of the first things I will try is going to http : //maps.google.com and trying a map search . The important thing I have found is to click Show Search Options , which will bring up a drop down box to the left of the Search Maps button . Often , you get much better results by changing the options from " All Results to User-created Content . If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or the state abbreviation where it should be . If there is no name associated with the area , you can try the name of the district its in along with campground , campsite , primitive , camping , etc . <p> Many people that enjoy camping are actively putting up GPS coordinates for places theyve stayed . Often you may find half a dozen GPS coordinates in the same general area for the site you 're looking for . <p> The last trick involving Google Maps is figuring out how to get that little marker into a plain old GPS format . <p> If you have multiple pins , decide which one you want to use . <p> Close the text box associated with the pin . <p> Right click on the pin and select What 's Here ? <p> Google will put the Longitude and Latitude in the search box . <p> You may now copy and paste the coordinates . <p> If you strike out with a Google map search for the camping areas name , you can try to virtually follow the given directions inside of your chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to match up road shapes from a provided map with unnamed or differently named roads . You 'll find you often need to zoom in to even see the roads you 're looking for . You may even need to use multiple types of mapping software as you find the roads you 're looking for do n't  exist in one or the other . Do n't  give up easily though , if you have a hard time locating the site , it just may be one of the more pristine areas out there and one you 'll truly appreciate . <p> Finally , if you 've done all of the above and tracked down a keeper , why not share it with the community here at freecampsites.net ? If we all contribute just a little bit of research time , well all have many more sites to choose from with a lot less effort to locate them .

We are having a hard time finding a place in the south-bay area that allows camping overnight in a truck . We would really appreciate any advice given ! : ) Thanks in advance for your help . <p> Generally , you can sleep in your vehicle at most of the campsites listed on our page . That is not always the case though . It depends on the individual campsite . Your comment was posted on our page about finding campsites that are n't listed on our website . If you are interested in camping at a specific location , you should contact the party that oversees it . Most of the time , you will find their contact information on the page for that campsite . In example , if you were interested in camping at Alabama Hills near Lone Pine , CA , you would go to http : **33;155;TOOLONG and look for the contact phone number and/or website near the top of the page . Being the law makers and enforcers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Alternatively , if you are unable to find the contact information on our website or elsewhere on the Internet , you can leave a comment/review on our page for that campsite .

Anyone that sleeps in the woods is , more or less , boondocking . Now , if you want to boondock constantly and be comfortable , that is another thing entirely . If you are happy with a tent and a backpack , there 's probably not much we can teach you . If , however , you are planning to take an RV out and bring the comforts of home with you , we might just have an idea or two you can use . <p> Before we even start talking about what to bring , there are two important things you should memorize about your rig . How tall is it and how much does it weigh ? When you get to that scenic , hundred year old covered bridge , you definitely do n't  want to become part of the landscape ! <p> Everyone is going to have different things they want to bring along when they head into the wilderness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet connection . Others are happy with a few books and a guitar . We will discuss a few of these luxuries in future articles , but for now , let 's stick with the basics . We all need to eat , drink and stay warm or cool . That is what the basics of survival boil down to . But , we are talking about being comfortable as well ! <h> Water <p> Regardless of how you plan to get where you are going , you will need to think about water . If you are only going to be camping near streams , you could go very minimalistic and just bring a backpacker style water filter . Otherwise , you will need to bring your own water . For most RVs , this is not a problem . The real question is how big your holding tanks are . Water is almost always the first resource you will run out of . Consider , you need water for drinking , bathing , cleaning dishes and flushing the toilet . Water conservation will become completely natural if you spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also a consideration . If the area is secluded enough and the weather is right , you might consider taking showers outdoors ! As a general rule , you should not be dumping your gray water on the ground forty gallons at a time , but you know that , right ? Using the outdoors shower or even washing your dishes outdoors is a little different , though . <h> Food <p> Do we even need to mention food ? You have been eating your entire life and I doubt you plan to stop just because you will be out in the woods . Well , here are a few tips anyhow . Most RV refrigerators are n't  as big as your average household refrigerator . Camper vans or people car camping may not even have a refrigerator . Of course , the bigger your refrigerator , the more goodies you can bring along , but do n't  forget about staple foods that can be stored anywhere . Sure , you could bring frozen corndogs and microwave them , but it is a much better use of space and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little ground sausage . Black beans and rice takes no refrigeration at all , but makes quite a tasty , nutritious meal . <p> These days , many people are happy with a burger from a fast food joint or a frozen meal that requires a few minutes in the microwave . Think about whether or not you really enjoy that sort of food or just eat it because it is convenient . If you are going to be camping out in the woods for a few days or weeks , it is much easier to bring along real food and cook it . You have all the time in the world ; why not use some of it to make a healthy meal that really tastes good ? <h> Comfort <p> Finally , we started out talking about how to be comfortable while boondocking . For most people , that means find a comfortable temperature . For fulltime RVers , the best answer to this is to move to a comfortable place ! When it starts getting hot , we look for places with shade and elevation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking a lot better . No matter how well insulated your camper may be , the best climate control system is still Mother Nature . <p> Still , there are those times when you actually want to camp at the ski slopes or near the beach during bikini season . The best tip I know is to dress appropriately . If you dress for winter and come inside to a camper that is fifty degrees , it is comfortable and does not burn through propane like trying to maintain seventy-two degrees would . If you are relaxing in the shade with a cold glass of water and a breeze , you will rarely need an air conditioner . Your body will acclimate to the temperature if you dress reasonably and do not insist on over exerting yourself in unreasonable conditions . <h> Electricity <p> Okay , we understand that the weather can not always be perfect and some times it rains . No matter how well you plan , you will still end up needing climate control once in a while and you might just have to watch a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite show . There are gadgets galore to help out with this and we will talk about some of them , but your first consideration is how you are going to power them all . <p> From least complex to most , your choices are the alternator from your vehicle , a generator , and solar panels . Some fulltimers even use wind energy as a supplemental source of power . This can be a pretty complicated decision , so we will look into the technical side in a separate article . Briefly though , your alternator will charge your batteries without buying any new equipment , except perhaps an inverter if you need AC power . In the long run , the cost of fuel to charge batteries will probably outweigh the cost of either other alternative unless you are already planning to do a lot of driving . <p> A generator is going to have some up front cost associated with it . This cost is variable and , not surprisingly , you get what you pay for . A quieter , more fuel efficient generator can cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit less efficient . And , just like your vehicle , you are going to need to carry fuel to run it . <p> Solar panels are the silent choice that require no fuel at all . As of this writing , solar power is in the same price range as a quiet , efficient generator if you shop around and handle the installation yourself . The complexity of the installation and figuring out just what is needed can be a daunting task , however .

Water is almost always the resource to run out first unless you happen to be camping next to a pretty clean water supply and take advantage of it . In this article , we will look at a few things you can do to make the most of your water resources during an extended boondocking trip . <p> Many people extend their water supplies via jerry cans or large water tanks . Its a quick and easy way to get a bit more water for your trip . You may even want to invest in collapsible water jugs so that they take up less space when empty . This method also means that if you have a vehicle besides your camper , you can run into town and fill up your water jugs without moving the rig . If you go this route , you will still need to think about how you are going to handle gray water . <p> My favorite method of water management is plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just need to realize that water is going to be what makes you pack up the campsite and head back to town and then try to handle it accordingly . For many people , the biggest drain on their water supply is bathing . Now , I 'm not saying you need to go without a shower until the ranger can locate you by the smell , but if you do n't  smell bad enough to run your spouse out of the camper , maybe you can skip the second shower of the day . <p> Alright , I get it . You do n't  want to stink . Well , if you really must shower , learn to take Navy and Army showers . Navy style showers consist of turning on the shower long enough to get wet and turning the water off . Next , you lather up and scrub without running water . Finally , you turn the water on and rinse the soap off . Easy as can be , but you save the water that most people would just leave running in their home showers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your helmet ( or your bathroom sink ) and that is how much water you get to use for your shower . Its the same basic principle as a Navy shower , except you do n't  use the getting wet phase . You do that with a damp soapy rag . Its best to use one rag for lathering up and a second for rinsing the soap off so you do n't  get too much extra soap in your helmet . With a bit of practice , even long haired folks ( take note hippies ! ) can wash their hair and body in a gallon of water . You might not be Sunday-go-to-meeting clean , but you probably wont be mistaken for Bigfoot at least not by the smell . <p> After showers , dishes are one of the things that tend to take a lot of water . My favorite method of doing dishes ( I do n't  think I ever expected to use THAT phrase ) is pretty good on water conservation . First , find the biggest dirty pot you have . Fill it halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sponge or dishrag and wash the rest of the dishes over that pot with the soapy water . Rather than rinse them right away , pile them up in the clean side of the sink . Once you have a sinkfull , rinse them using just a trickle of water . If you rinse a dish above the other soapy dishes , the run off from that dish will help rinse the ones below it , requiring less water for those . <p> One final topic of water conservation is using the toilet . First of all , use as much water as is required . Trying to unclog an RV toilet is considerably worse than trying to unclog a household toilet as they are rarely airtight and a plunger wont do anything but make a mess . The best way to cut down on water usage is to use only as much toilet paper as is required . The more paper in the toilet , the more water you need to flush in order to prevent clogs . <p> A common source of toilet water usage is rinsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lever open until enough water has run through to remove any stains . We have found that a better solution to this is to keep a small spray bottle full of water in the bathroom . A directed squirt does more to clean the sides of the bowl than running water through the toilet and takes both less water and electricity for the water pump . <p> Some folks even use spray bottles for showering and dishes . If you happen to find a good pressure spray bottle , its actually a great way to conserve water . Its much easier trying to take a shower when you can pump up the bottle rather than having to squeeze the trigger constantly . Small bottles are great for this , but a bug spray type bottle works fairly well . <p> Of course , when heading out to the woods , make sure you have empty wastewater tanks and a full white water tank ! If you happen to be camped near a free dump station with water and are only going to stay a few days , go nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you have the room to bring one along , use a good quality garden or " Hudson " sprayer . They hold more water , have adjustable nozzles , and can be pumped up to a higher pressure . You can even use two , one for soap/detergent and one for rinse . Label them if you do that !

They love to be charged and if possible each and every cycle should be brought back to 100% state of charge . <p> Charging them causes a chemical reaction to run " backwards " .

That means that more voltage ( think of that as " push " ) is required at low temperatures . <p> Trojan , who are a respected battery maker , now recommend 14.8 volts for their jars to become fully charged . <p> The simplest charge controllers were simple " on off " devices . They simply pass the voltage from the panels to the battery bank . The bank determines the voltage . As the bank approaches 100% full the controller would keep the charging circuit switched off for longer and longer periods of time , slowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame in which to charge a bank . Generally the figure used is 5 hours per day . While it is true that charging may begin shortly after dawn and continue to dusk , not much energy is moved into the bank . Most of the power will be harvested in the 90 minutes before solar noon , and the 90 minutes after solar noon . It is true that solar may take care of the parasitic loads , and that leaves any " extra " power to do a low and slow charge of the bank . <p> More sophisticated controllers may use PWM which stands for pulse width modulation . When the battery is low all the harvest may be poured into the battery bank . As the bank passes 85% state of charge the pulsing may begin . The pulses get shorter and shorter and faster and faster so that energy is still being presented at the acceptance rate of the battery . <p> There is another type of controller that uses an MPPT design . That translates to " maximum power point tracking " . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are favorable . However , this extra performance increases the cost of the device . When panels were expensive in cost per watt , going MPPT was a no brainer . Today it may be cheaper to simply add an additional panel . There is still a place for MPPT , especially if there is no more room on the roof for more panels . <p> So what must a good controller include in its design ? <p> adjustable voltage set points for the various types of charging <p> a temperature compensation probe on the battery bank <p> Any controller that has those features will work better than one that does not . My current favorite is a 40 amp controller from Grape . It is quite inexpensive and can be " programed " from a cell phone using a blue tooth connection . <p> 40 amps refers to the output of the controller . If we use 12 volts as a nominal value , a 40 amp controller will function well with up to 480 watts of panels . But remember , panels are often 17 volts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the " real " answer becomes 17 volts x 40 amps , or 680 watts of panels . However the " harvest " would be as if there were only 480 watts of panels ( at 12 volts ) . <p> If you are willing to use propane for cooking and cooling 480 watts may essentially eliminate generator use . <p> If you wish to have more solar harvest , then either a higher capacity controller is needed , or the voltage needs to be doubled to 24 volts . That would mean about 1360 watts of panels could be used . The additional equipment needed would be a 24 volt DC to 12 volt DC converter , capable of handling the regular 12 volt loads in an RV . <p> 1360 watts puts us within " striking distance " of being totally off the grid while allowing some use of a roof air conditioner . <p> The biggest capacity controller I 'm aware of is from Magnum and is rated at a whopping 100 amps .

Boondocking is essentially camping without hookups . You may also hear it referred to as dry camping . Often , dry camping means staying in a campground without hookups , whereas , boondocking typically means staying in a completely undeveloped area . You may also hear people talk about dispersed camping , which is the official term often used by government agencies . <p> The real question to ask is whether or not boondocking is right for you . If you enjoy being outdoors soaking in peace , quiet and natural beauty , then it just might be . If you prefer to be surrounded by neighbors and have lots of defined recreational activities , then maybe you would be happier in a campground . While boondocking , you often need to amuse yourself rather than go to the campgrounds swimming pool or the golf course down the street . <p> At Freecampsites.net , we understand that both types of camping are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change regularly .

Ten dollars is n't what it used to be , so campgrounds that meet our most important criteria tend to be closer to boondocking than fancy resorts . However , there are still plenty of activities for people in the right mindset . <p> Did we scare you off yet , or have you decided that free camping might just be for you ? The good news is that if you decide to try boondocking , you will find some of the most serene and beautiful campsites anywhere . You may very well end up with the kind of campsite that you , literally , can not pay for ! If there was anyone around to collect your money , theyd stick fifty campsites on the land and ruin what makes it special .

Depending on the time of year , you may also see some gorgeous desert plants in bloom . <p> Traffic on Box Canyon road is light .

It is in addition to the " Free " and " $10 or less " types . This will allow sites that , like the BLM LTVAs , are a supreme value but do not quite make it into the $10 or less category because your out of pocket cost is more than $10 . Another example of a Permit or Pass Required site would be a Texas Wildlife Management Area . They require you to purchase a $12 Limited Public Use ( LPU ) Permit to recreate on them .

The price must also be the same for everyone . No membership , age , military , or status restrictions . <p> While we rarely use these sites , we do understand their value . This really comes into play in areas where there are n't  any free spots , where it would cost more than $10 to drive to free spot , or in an area where dumping and filling your water costs the same as staying in a $10 campsite who provide those facilities for their guests . <p> Pass or Permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for places that require you to purchase a pass or permit to camp in the area .
