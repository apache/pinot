@@22054385 @2054385/ <p> On the NAHBS 2016 Coverage page , we 're experimenting with new higher-res photos , which should show to users with high-DPI displays ( like the Apple Retina display ) on desktop browsers . Let me know if you notice any quality or speed differences . I hope to introduce higher-res photos to all bikes on the rest of the site soon if all goes well . <p> I also fixed a couple bugs around photo uploading . Photos should no longer be rotated incorrectly , and when a bike photo is replaced , the new one will always show now . <p> Please let me know what you think . Things are going good and there 's a lot more coming soon . Cheers ! <p> Speed is king . Faster websites are better for both the visitor and the server , and as Pedal Room has grown , bits of the site have gotten a bit too slow for my liking . <p> So over the last couple weeks I 've been working on lots of small improvements , mostly behind-the-scenes and mostly speed-related . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member profiles should be a bit faster . The speed tweaks will be especially necessary when I release the Pedal Room mobile app , which is currently under development and should be done soon ! <p> Also , the home page design has been tweaked a bit to be more compact and load faster . <p> Several people have requested this , so you can also now browse all of the previously featured bikes . And ordering searches by most-favorited is back by popular demand too . <p> Today I 'm happy to announce the release of new search tools for Pedal Room ! <p> The biggest change one will notice is that searching or browsing for bikes is now much , much faster . Also , bike pages , the browse bikes page , bikes by tag , member profiles , and your logged-in control panel should all be much faster . <p> Another big change is the way the search engine now works . Bikes are now only shown if they match all keywords ( before it used to be if a bike matched any keyword . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search terms all now work : <p> colnago master -pista <p> bikes with keywords " colnago " and " master " , as long as keyword " pista " is not found <p> @title cannondale track <p> bikes with title that matches both " cannondale " and " track " <p> " columbus max " <p> bikes with exact phrase " columbus max " <p> The search engine now also matches shorter words ( as short as two characters ) and usernames . Furthermore , the search engine now matches only bikes with photos by default . You can still do a search for bikes without photos from the bikes search page if necessary . <p> Finally , the browse bikes page has gotten a facelift . It now shows photos of recently added and updated bikes . Also , the updated bikes column now excludes recently added bikes so that a new bike does n't show up twice on the page . <p> Hope you guys enjoy the new search features . I 'm excited because searching is not only better and faster , but the new search engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . Stay tuned , and let me know what you think ! <p> I just released some work on the forums to allow anyone to subscribe to a topic . Once subscribed , you 'll receive email notifications when a new reply is posted . <p> You can unsubscribe anytime , or see/unsubscribe from all on the new notifications page at http : **33;0;TOOLONG ( works only once you 're logged in ) , which is also now linked to from your control panel . <p> Let me know what you think and what else you 'd like to see . I 'm also working on things like a quick reply for the forums ( which is tricky due to the image uploading ) and some other nice improvements . Cheers ! <p> The biggest change is that messages going forward will be in a threaded format , so that all replies back and forth are captured in one view . You can also tell if the recipient opened the message based on the icon next to any sent message . <p> There are also changes to your inbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including sent ones , at a glance and see reply counts , now that messages are in a threaded format . <p> Let me know what you think , and if you 've got any concerns or suggestions . And stay tuned for more improvements coming very soon ! <p> It 's been a long time ! The last few months have kept me busy with mending a relationship , nursing injuries and illness , and work to pay the bills , but I 'm happy to finally be back into the swing of things with Pedal Room ! <p> Today I released a couple small tweaks . <p> First off is flagging of forum posts and bikes . There have been some problems lately with trolls , spammers , and fights , and that 's going to stop . The first step is community flagging . Now , when you see a forum post or bike that violates the rules ( spam , hateful , not a bike , etc. ) , you can click the " Flag " link , add some comments , and flag that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action is necessary . I 'm also working on moderator tools and appointing some moderators to help me manage the site . <p> Second , bikes now show a " last updated " date . Small , but progress ! <p> There are a lot of upcoming changes coming soon , and I 'll be posting about those more in the next few days . Cheers ! <p> Today I 'm happy to release the new Pedal Room Blog . The design has been refined , and more importantly , the blog should now be much , much faster . <p> The main reasoning behind this is that Pedal Room 's old blog host , Posterous , was aquired by Twitter and is closing its doors on April 30 . So the blog had to be moved . <p> But aside from the blog not going down , there are also great benefits to the new blog . It 's hosted on Amazon S3 , so it 's more reliable . It also uses static HTML , so it 's much faster ( key parts of Pedal Room , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast ) . It also gives me control over the codebase , meaning I can fix bugs that existed previously and do things like integrate the blog better with the site in general . <p> The ease-of-posting with the new blog , coupled with the recent infrastructure upgrades , should also encourage me to post more as I get some much-needed work done on the site and work on new things like the Pedal Room mobile app , which is currently under development . <p> I plan to migrate comments over in the next few days , along with some other tweaks to Pedal Room in general . In the mean time , feel free to email me at coomer@pedalroom.com with your comments , questions , concerns , or suggestions . Hope you like the blog ! <p> Just a heads up that you may experience slight downtime this weekend as the servers the site runs on are upgraded . The new servers will allow for a faster site with improved features such as better searching ( not immediately , but soon ) , and should be more stable as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition over to new servers . Cheers ! 
@@22054386 @2054386/ <p> I 'll admit , when I was learning to skid , I leaned forward a few times just to get the feel of stopping my bike with my legs . It was all new and strange . I think it 's a combination of building up your leg strength and getting a good idea of timing your pedal strokes . Figure out which leg is your power leg . For me , I favor my left but I can go both . When that leg is almost extended on the down stroke , that 's when you 'll push against the rotation of the spin , causing you to skid . The more you stay put in your seat when doing this , the better . <p> thanks alot , these tips gave me better and clearer idea on how i 'll skid ! the reason why i asked that is because every skid tutorials i 've watched , they do lean forward and i think it 's dangerous . i 'll just do what you guys told me . <p> When they lean forward to skid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to skid , but the skid is long and weak . The less you lean forward , the more weight you 'll have on your back wheel so your skid will be more effective in stopping . I do n't recommend leaning that far forward to skid just cause its impractical and does n't slow you down fast enough . But you still need to shift some of your weight forward , but not all of it . <p> Depends on the bike I think , its like impossible to skid on my conversion , easy as butter on my cdale . Also I had metal toe cages , then switched to all city plastic doubles ...... best investment for the whip . <p> i 've been mainly riding track drops for a long time , and have n't had a single problem with skidding . I would n't say it 's even near " impossible " . If you have good grip , you'lll hold up just fine with any style of bars . if skidding for practical use , try to stay on your seat . this keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and you 'll actually stop more efficiently . when/if you skid by leaning more forward and off your seat , your putting all the weight in the front which pushes the bike forward , making the stop very gradual ( not always a good thing. ) you 'll get this when you 're trying it out . sounds a bit more complicated than it really is. practice makes perfect ! <p> thanks for all your advice ! my parts are all stock of mongoose maurice 2012 , i think i 'll stick with these parts first and just feel it until i get comfortable and afterwards maybe i 'll change some parts if needed . just this morning i got to skid without using breaks ! i followed what chewypurple said about push/pull , great help ! : ) my foot retention i think is doing good and my gear ratio is 44:18 i think which for me right now is ok. i just started to ride here last two days so i 'm really new . 
@@22054387 @2054387/ <h> To grease or not to grease <p> So I 'm finally starting to build the klein and while I 'm super pumped , I 'm realizing I do n't know what to grease while putting it together .... I think I covered everything but I want to make sure , and if I 'm not supposed to grease it let me know <p> everything you listed . you can locktite the derailiur pulley threads if you want . that 's how they come from the factory . But as a rule you just grease everything with threads . or anything that might seize up without grease . <p> A lot of differing opinions on this but I typically advise against greasing square-taper BB spindles . <p> Because most people are n't professional mechanics and tend to over-tighten everything , grease allows the crank arm to slide further than necessary onto the spindle and could potentially cause deformity or cracking of the crank arm interface . <p> Also , it 's perfectly fine ( and pretty common ) to use a very thin layer of grease on both the steerer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly , there will be no slippage and it prevents creaking . <p> The " to grease or not to grease square taper " debate is probably as old as time itself . Some people claim that if you grease , you could tighten it too much causing excessive deformation ( which can lead to cracking ) . Some people claim that if you do n't grease , the metal on metal friction will ream the metal on the crank and cause the same thing . There is no definitive proof that either way is superior and I do n't think it really matters either way as long as you tighten it to the proper torque .

Turn it counter clockwise and watch the crankset remove itself from the bb spindle . <p> I can understand that service is n't free . Shops need to make money . But this is no harder than filling up two wheels with air . $45 seems like a steep price for that : ( <p> BB is removed with either just the standard shimano BB tool ( BBT-32 ? ) . or . BB tool and lock ring tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a better pic of the crank arm dust cap svp <p> It almost looks like you do n't  have a self extracting cap . Looks like its been replaced simply with a bolt/washer combo . You might need to take the extracting cap off the nds arm and use that to remove the ds arm . All that work could justify $45 . <p> However .. with $45 of tools ( or less ) you can learn to do it yourself ! : ) You should ask to buy the tools from your LBS , then ask them to show you how to do it . They make money , and you learn to wrench a bit on your own machine . Win Win <p> You need an Octalink crankarm puller , which should cost about $20 . Park Tool makes the CCP-44 for Octalink ( and the CCP-22 for square taper ) , or if you want a square taper AND Octalink/ISIS puller in one unit , get the CWP-7 , but you use your own 15mm wrench for the handle of that one . <p> i du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new mechanic in are LBS got a attitude problem , there last mechanic charge me nothing he just removed the crankarm and BB less than 2min and install to my new frame for 2min , i give him $10 for consideration thanks for your suggestion . The good news is i already removed the dust cap by using of scissor and pliers and i break one of my cheap hex 8mm , i might need puller i guess ( but the last time i saw the mechanic that removed my crankarm he never used a puller but will see what happen ) <p> 7710 's have a self extracting bolt . You leave in the dust cap and use an 8mm allen key to take off the crank . Takes literally 20 seconds . You should n't need a puller if your 7710 's have the right stuff . But you pic sucks wiener and we cant tell if it has the correct dust cap . <p> I ca n't put myself into the owner 's shoes , but I can tell what I would charge as the mechanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shit all day every day . Either way , a full hour 's labor charge to remove cranks and bb on Octalink is way too much . Also , what shop charges $45/hr ? Most shops have seen do $60/hr currently or more . I wish our industry had more standard labor rates , so shops could n't undercut each other so much and the good shops with good service would flourish and shitty shops would sink into the ocean . <p> And yes , some mechanics do work " under the table " while we 're on the clock , but some mechanics do a quick service for a regular customer just as a nice courtesy , perhaps while their current customer is on a test ride and they 'd otherwise be standing around trying to find an orifice to put their thumb into . <p> I think its absolutely fair , as he s probably a new customer coming in and inquiring about work being done . Shops will never .. well most shouldnt ... over promise and under deliver . So $45 now can be $10-15-20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , Shimano 7710 has a self extracting bolt attached to it . an 8mm Hex Key is all you need . <p> Now , if you have the cash to pay for a $250 dollars crankset for your bike + $70 for the bottom bracket , you should n't have an issue paying an extra $45 to get it removed as budget did n't seem to be an issue when you choose your parts . <p> I would have done the same if I was LBS owner and someone with Dura-ace components all over their bike walked in my shop . <p> Sorry to bump the thread , but just want to know how hard is servicing a dura ace 7710 , just has mine service by a bike shop and I feel ripped off .

@@22054401 @2054401/ <p> Definitely worth talking to a bike fitter . I have roughly the same measurements and would definitely go for a 60 . The only concern I have is whether or not it 's an actual 60 as I 've never known Cinelli to make a bike that fits me . <p> The work frames run small because on Cinelli 's geo chart they list the frames by the center to top length along the seattube . Which in my opinion is one of the most useless lengths to define a frames size . <p> So my advice would be to size up from the labeled size . Double check that toptube length . <p> I really could have sized up on my frame , but so far I have n't had any complaints with the size I went with . <p> To give you an idea , I 'm 5 ' 10 " and riding the work frame with a 53cm c-c effective toptube length . My friend who is 6 ' 1 " rode a work frame with a 57cm c-c effective toptube length . <p> Consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geometry charts of those bikes to the work frame geo chart . Or what @Jehu said , consult this with a bike fitter . <p> **25;35;TOOLONG because somehow you confused me , the Effective toptube of the XXL Work Frame is 60cm C-C right ? I know for sure that my seatube has to be in the 58cm-59cm range .. or 60cm .... the toptube is my concern . <p> I had a previous bike from cinelli and it was the First Production Cinelli Mash at size XL which felt allright in size terms . THe geometry of the Mash was this : <p> The two bikes that fit you previously both look to have had 57.5 top tube length ( effective TT length for the histogram since it has a sloping TT ) the Supernaut had a TT length of 61 ! ! ! No wonder it felt big . <p> The 58 Mash ( 57tt ) is gon na fit better based on the info you 've given us &amp; the geocharts , the 60 Mash might be too long due to the 60tt . I also prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem . <p> Just my two cents . A fitter will probably help getting stem lengths &amp; reach of bars &amp; proper saddle position setup though so +1 on that route if you 're stressing about fit <p> If you forego the consensus of talking to a bike fitter and make a decision solely on the comments from this thread , then i 'd have to say Pwebb is coming correct . Altho if you go for the ladder and decide to go for the xxl i have always been a big fan of these stems ... <p> Due to mash work frameset exotic size chart , same reply as Scrodzilla : top tube length ( i used to choose 56cm frame size ( st ctc &amp; tt ctc ) so i chose L ( 55cm tt ) and changed the stem for a longer one . I would add standover height ( 2 fingers clearance between my balls and the top tube when feet are on the floor ) . <p> what did you do ? i 'm currently in the same boat , and similar height 6 ' 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tt length , but the seat tube is low , and makes it look like i have a foot of seat post sticking out . I might go for the xl 57tt , since it is similar to the parallax . i would be using the work frame for sscx most likely <p> Depends how you like the fit &amp; your legs-to-torso measurements . I 'm 5 ' 11/180cm &amp; just picked up an XL ( 57cm t-t ) . The geo is essentially the same as my 56x56 NJS Samson , just with a tt that 's 1cm longer on the Mash . I have long arms/torso and am hoping to not show a ton of seatpost also so this seemed like the right choice . Wont know till im done building . <p> Looking @ Paralax geo I 'd personally go with L frame for myself though , so you most likely wan na size up to the XXL mash Work frame . Work frames are long &amp; low so seatpost will be shown . Again , your arm/torso/leg measurements will affect this decision . <p> I 'm 6 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XXL work being too long for me but to my relief it was spot on with a 10cm stem and a riser with 1cm spacers . But as people said earlier , it all depends on your torso , arms &amp; leg ratio . <p> I would imagine with drops the 10cm stem might be too long , so the optimal fit can also depend on your handlebar+stem combo.

@@22054407 @2054407/ <h> Fixie High End War : State Undefeated Vs . Cinelli Histogram <p> ( closed ) <p> So if your looking to get a pretty high end fixie bike this summer you have undoubtedly heard of the prestigious Cinelli brand . A brand name that sounds so good that you just might think their frames are still hand made in Italy . Whether it is the " rich cool kid " hipster bike is still to be determined , but its clout and quality remain an undeniable fine wine among fixie riders that have expensive taste . <p> Which leads us to the problem of buying a 2014 Cinelli Histogram frameset : it is going to set you back a cool 1000 USD for the frameset alone . Throw on a decent set of Cranks , pedals , wheels , stem , etc. and you 'll be up into the 2000 USD budget in no time , maybe even in the 3000 USD range if you decide to get the best components / wheelset money can buy . So for those looking for a race ready track bike that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents ... <p> Enter The State Undefeated for a fraction of the price . <p> Like the Cinelli Mash Histogram , the Undefeated model comes with a 7005 aluminum frame with some key differences . The Histogram is triple butted Columbus Airplane 7005-T6 aluminum . The State Undefeated on the other hand is Double Butted ( Aero Shaped ) 7005 aluminum frame . Both come with carbon forks but as far as advertised weight goes , we see why the Cinelli costs more . <p> The State Bicycle Co . Undefeated advertised weight for the frame/carbon fork is 4.625 pounds . The Cinelli Histogram frameset ( frame and carbon fork ) comes in at a feathery 4.5 pounds . So not that big of a deal to most in the weight weenie department , but certainly the Cinelli will hold the lightweight title . And a lighter frameset always comes at a price . <p> For the advertised $945 of the Undefeated you are not only getting the frameset , you are getting a complete arguably race ready bike with some nice omnium cranks / sram gxp bottom bracket which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem that the State undefeated has tried to make the complete bike the way to go seeing that a frameset alone by itself would set you back $549 . Basically , the crankset and frameset by itself is worth $749 . So you basically get everything else for $200 more dollars ( wheels , one brake/brake lever , bull horns , stem , seat ) etc . I suppose the question is will the stock wheels hold up ? Heck you could always use those as training wheels , while you save up for a really nice wheelset . <p> All in all , the State Bicycle Co . Undefeated really gives the Cinelli Histogram a big run for it 's money . The State Undefeated is made in Taiwan and the Cinelli Mash histogram is made in China . While the Cinelli brand is more recognized and renowned in the fixie bicycle world , kind of like Apple in electronics , the Undefeated provides a quality package at a great price . It 's stealth matte black finish with the neon highlights give this track ready race bike an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete Undefeated bike is basically a full race ready bike for the price of a Cinelli Histogram frameset . But seeing that the 2014 Histogram looks a lot better ( some may say ) than the 2013 Histogram , people might be able to get that 2013 histogram frameset for a lot cheaper on ebay . Just the other day I saw one on ebay for $750 . Great deal for a premium frame set . <p> Some other notable brands to look into for that awesome fixie bike to get you around this summer if you have the benjamins : The beautiful Bianchi Super Pista ! This high quality bike is made in Taiwan . Their Aluminum/Carbon frameset costs around $750 . So a bit cheaper than the Cinelli Histogram but more expensive than the State Undefeated . Unfortunately I was not able to find the weight of this beautiful frameset : <p> In conclusion all are good products with impressive specs and designs . None of these bikes are hand built in italy as their name suggests . All three frames appear to be race proven as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What it will boil down to is budget and preference . In the end , buy what you like , and ride what you like . Tough choices but all seem to be good , and all of them look amazing . <p> LONG ... Warning ... before reading further there are apparently bikesdirect people here with an agenda . These people are people that work , or are being paid in some form by bikesdirect . Bikesdirect has been known to do this before . LONG ... <p> They are a mail order company that sells generic frames with decent components and tout them as the deal of the century . These people are : Scrodzilla , mattymo , Zeb , nightstalker , jaysumthin ... evidence : scrodzilla owns a shop and is advertising a kilo tt ... <p> Some seem to be making false accusations as well , and when I mention the issues of the kilo tt fork issues , and frame defects ... and evidence of cracked frames from this bikesdirect company ... <p> cracked motobecane cracked kilo tt pro <p> They go all crazy just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ google search . <p> What is funny is that I wrote this from my research as I planned to buy a bike . I actually am going to preorder a 2014 Cinelli . <p> As I said in my initial post , ride what you like ... would not hesitate to buy the bianchi or state . <p> I never heard about that . Did a google search about it and it does not come up . Your probably lying given your initial response . I 'm not sure if many people even own the Undefeated yet as they were just barely released . <p> And that thread by the way was before the Undefeated was even released , so it really holds no weight / credibility . And seriously broke the cranks ? <p> If you can break a set of $200 omnium cranks which most consider bombproof you need to be in the tour de france ... like today , lol . <p> Bit suspicious of that thread as well since they keep saying " go to bikesdirect " so maybe slanderous marketing is part of bikesdirect marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real people on forums . It 's a pretty pathetic tactic . <p> Why do n't you compare the geometry of the two frames ? This bike looks like you 'll be uncomfortable and stretched out when your riding it . Is the geometry even made for the track or does have more of a road friendly type of geometry . I mean brand names , tubing and paint jobs are n't the only reasons for the pricing on these frames . Lastly as for that bb cracking story makes me rather get a leader frame . Quality over quantity bro . <p> The histogram , undefeated , and super pista are all advertised as track bikes . <p> Realize that the cracked BB comment was made in an older thread before the Undefeated was even released . So unless that guy was Psychic , he is probably just a competitor saying bad stuff about a brand . <p> And with any manufacturer you will get bikes with defects . All major companies get their fair share ... and most of these companies manufacture their frames in Taiwan . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forums right now - dudes affiliated with State ( but claiming they 're not ) creating new accounts solely for singing the praises of a bike nobody gives a shit about . <p> I guess I understand . It costs a lot of money for a company to develop new products , have them manufactured to their specs and import them so it makes sense that State is trying to move them any way they can . I wish they could be a little more honest about it though , instead of employing people to pretend they are potential customers on forums . <p> I compare three bikes ... compliment three different brands with similar specs . Some people hate cinelli , bianchi , etc . Seen guys sell histograms because it was not for them either . Makes no sense to buy something you do not like . In the end all three of these bikes will perform great . Jist depends what your budget is . <p> Definitely NOT Cinelli MASH ... I personally know the factory that makes them . Regardless , QC is horrendous in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass QC either get rebranded and sold as a nameless frame , or they attempt to fix the issue as best as possible and the company buys them at a discount price .

The first model of a race bike , named CHESINI BICIPRECISION is forged in that year , in the workshop of Nesente , a small village near Verona in Italy . . In the post war period , the activities grow quickly and , in 1947 , Gelmino Chesini acquires a bike factory , CICLI VALLETTI , and moves the headquarters of CHESINI BIKES to Via San Paolo. in Verona . . The sixties are the years of the Italian economic boom that brought a big change in people mobility . Cars were now more affordable and popular and started to became a status symbol .. And so , to further capitalize on the deep knowledge in precision mechanics and on the experience in the production of distribution mechanisms Mr. Chesini starts a service center activity for SINGER sewing machines . . However CHESINI never stops researching innovative solutions for its bikes . In 1963 a Chesini bike wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1965 CHESINI also wins the Team 100 km World Amateur Championships . . Soon the collateral activities were abandoned , choosing to follow the passion for the production of the highest quality bikes . As Gabriele Chesini , son of Gelmino , and strenuous and dynamic continuer of the company , used to say , . " Our real and unique intent is to build special race bikes , perfect for racer and amateurs " . . With the passing of time it became clear that the pursuit of this goal was antithetical to large scale production , but there was no doubt as to which route to choose deciding , rather , to aim even higher by adding to the renowned quality even the uniqueness . Today every CHESINI bike is special because unique , handbuilt one by one with dedication , skill , attention to details and unchanged passion . info by : http : //www.chesini.it . .

It 's such a versatile country to ride in and I 've been lucky enough to ride up and down the country , I studied in Glasgow ( Scotland ) where I began riding properly , moved to London for a year and then this last year I moved to Leeds ( closest to my home town ) which now suits me best as it 's quite hilly terrain . <p> Tim : Pretty much . I 'd followed Fixed Gear Leeds for quite some time as they not only had a good reputation generally but there was always really interesting content on the Fixed Gear Leeds blog spot . I attended the Restrap 2nd Birthday Alleycat in February , got to know some of the guys then and the rest just flowed from there ! <p> Coomer : Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Race , right ? Can you tell us more about that ? <p> Tim : Yeah pretty much . Since Leeds fixed gear was specific to Leeds and very similar to many other blogs around the UK we wanted to introduce something new where not only was the content fresh and from riders around the UK but also an organisation to produce events , competitions and specifically get people riding from all aspects of the cycling world . <p> Tim : I did an Alleycat in Glasgow maybe 4 years agao now , I did n't know the city too well and I knew I had no chance of winning which made it a lot more fun as I did n't feel any pressure ! The alleycat itself was made up of 7 clues to street names where you had to go , when you got there you had to look for a picture of an animal on a signpost or mounted on a wall , etc . It was a really clever idea and was probably my first taste of how alleycats can be so different from one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favorite had to be the Restrap 2nd Birthday event where I came in 2nd place . I went without knowing many of the riders , let alone the city , had a pretty rubbish start , but managed to pull places back with the hilly part of the section . It was a lot of fun and a huge rush of adrenaline ! I guess alleycats have changed for me a little now as I 've helped organise 2 this year ! <p> Tim : I become aware of Death Spray Custom maybe a year or so ago when Sam from Fixed Gear Leeds blogged about the collaboration project between Tokyo Fixed Gear , Feather Cycles , Nike and Death Spray Custom . I did a bit more research and found a website &amp; blog and just started following projects . He also followed me and I assume saw that I had quite the passion for cycling . It was about March I think , I got a direct message from David ( of DSC ) that went something like ... " Are you fast ? " as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30-40 riders in the Restrap race just a month ago and that I thought I was in pretty good form at the minute . <p> He then asked if I 'd ride on behalf of DSC for Tokyo Fixed Gear Hunt Criterium race . His only request was that I ride his bike . - I was a bit worried about riding his Pro Lite as with such a beautfiul paint job , and with it being a stunning track bike , I did n't want to crash it or anything . The day before the race he simply said " Ride it like you stole it . " I came 5th out of 30 in the first heat and 13th out of 30 in the final heat . I was pretty happy with both positions and David was n't too fussed what position I came . He asked me to send my forks down maybe a month or so ago ; I did n't know too much about what he was going to do to them , and in honesty I did n't care , I love everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious nature behind any projects he takes on .

It 's everything I wanted and was without a doubt worth the wait . There may be a few additional changes , maybe some new paint in the future , but we 'll see .

@@22054419 @2054419/ <h> Specialized Diverge vs . Crux E5 for road/cx purposes ? <p> I am looking to get a bike for cross and road purposes that wo n't break the bank ( broke college student ) . And I only have room for one more bike so I am hoping to get one that I can ride/train on the road with and potentially use in cx races ( pretty light/beginner ones ) . I 've been looking at the Specialized Diverge A1 and the Specialized Crux E5 . I like the price point of the Diverge , but I like the internal cable routing of the Crux ( is internal routing worth the extra $500 I would have to spend to get the Crux ? ) . I am not looking to race super competitively , mostly just for sh*ts and giggles ... and I want a bike that can be ridden comfortably on century rides and whatever else I encounter . I know the geometries are different , but would I notice that much of a difference if I am not too serious of a rider ? I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple gears . General thoughts would be appreciated . <p> You 're comparing two very different bikes . The Crux is a cross bike , and the Diverge is a comfort road bike . FWIW the Crux seems to fit what you 're looking for much better . <p> The internal routing may mean you can upgrade the disc brakes to hydraulic if you ever find yourself wanting more fine-tuned braking control . This depends on if the frame has stops or if you just run the housing through the internal guides . <p> The tapered headtube is gon na provide some extra stiffness in the headtube which is especially handy in cross racing , as it helps with steering control over bumpy sections of the course . <p> BB30 is pretty neat , more stiffness from the crank spindle meaning less power is lost through flex . I had a BB30 road bike for a short time and it was decent . I did n't prefer it over standard threaded bottom brackets , but I certainly did n't dislike it . <p> Comes stock with 3mm wider tires than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Since the Crux is a cross bike it comes with a better gearing range for cross riding than the Diverge . <p> It has a higher bottom bracket for more pedal clearance when riding cross . <p> If you want to do cross races , whether competitively or just for fun , get the cross bike . It wo n't be any fun trying to race cross on a comfort road bike . <p> If you 're not going to get competitive , consider the diverge . The crux is gon na be more aggressive , which I think is unnecessary if you 're not going to compete . And most of the time that I have heard people say they may possible enter a couple of cross races ... they really never even bothered . Haha The diverge is more of a adventure type of bike ... it takes fat tires . Can take it off road on some single track . Can do some touring . The crux wo n't be as accommodating . And as mentioned , the diverge is obviously more endurance oriented ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so caught up in racey aggressive bikes and they do n't even ride em like they 're meant to be ridden . But that 's the same with a lot of bikes . I would get the more practical option that YOU think would best fit your intentions and riding style . <p> It sounds like the Diverge would suit you better . The A1 has Claris 8 speed , but if you go up to the Elite A1 at $1400 you get Tiagra 10 speed with a wide ratio cassette and it 's less than the basic Crux E5 with a better groupset . The Crux E5 has Sora 9 speed . The Diverge is basically a do anything bike you can fit 35 's on it and has a geometry that you ride all day comfortably . The Crux is a great bike but it 's made for pretty much one thing , racing . <p> Fwiw , I looked into a Diverge , and always found something better for the money . The problem is , it tries to be everything . Not built for true CX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for gravel grinding , but it can do any of them . Jack of all trades , master of none ... <p> That 's just my opinion , though ... <p> If you want to be more original , and have the endurance , check out a Raleigh RXS ! <p> Belt driven single speed CX bike . That thing would be more fun than anything in that price range ... !

In my retirement , I enjoy all kinds of bicycles but mostly enjoy restoring and riding classic road bikes . I divide my interest into four groups . I have a great interest in pre-bike boom road bikes of the 60s ( that I drooled over as a kid ) . The bike boom road bikes of the 70s and early 80s ; which carried me to many an adventure . I also find the transition era road bikes ( between classic steel and modern monocoque carbon ) interesting . In the 80s and 90s they showed great innovation that may never be seen again . Lastly , Klunkers and other proto-mountain bikes , have a strange organic appeal ; they remind me of simpler , carefree days . I live in the mountains of California where level road only exists to connect climbs and descents . I soon discovered that I needed lower gearing and a slightly more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2/3 of it works ) , compressed disks ( in my neck ) and my carpel tunnel syndrome . Youth is wasted on the young ! I am not a purist , but respect history . This is reflected in my build philosophy.First , a bike must please me and I must enjoy riding it . I need low gears ; but love the feel of a racing frame . For me to enjoy the bike , it must be equipped for my needs.Second , modifications must be plausible , period correct and reversible . I have been riding road bikes for over 50 years and remember what was done to them back in the day . It was rare for a road bike to remain as delivered . I try to make what would have been logical upgrades for the time . For example , a good early 1960s bike that was equipped with what was top of the line equipment when it was built , say Campagnolo Gran Sport , might have logically have been upgraded in the late 60s or early 70s , to the much nicer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in reasonably good condition . If I repaint , I might use the original scheme and color ; but only if I like it . If not , I may tweak the scheme to fit my taste while trying to maintain the " flavor " of the original . At this point some purists may scream , but remember my first rule.Fourth , original is nice but normal wear items are basically up for grabs . During their active life , many bikes were upgraded to a more modern sealed bottom bracket and/or headset . Derailleur pulleys were commonly upgraded to " Bullseye " pulleys . Back in the day , many riders had at least two wheel sets . A tubular set ( we called them sew ups ) and a clincher set for training . I usually convert to clinchers using period correct pieces . Who is to say what wheels would have survived for 40 or 50 years ?

Going off the description the only unknown is their in house hubs , which remind me of the Cane Creek hubs . The consensus is that Factory Five produces quality stuff . <p> The flange design looks kind of stress break prone to me but the machining and anodizing looks pretty nice . I just do n't know if I would trust brand new hubs that cost $109 for a set in a brand new wheelset that only costs $80 more , especially since there are n't any internet forum reviews yet . And being made in China I 'm sure that there is at least a minor percentage of lead that somehow made it into the alloy , so the actual hubs you receive will probably be heavier than Phils . <p> Caveat emptor .

To me they kinda look like a knockoff of the Phil chainring pattern , but cheaper and more widely available . <p> Long story short , try the hubs and wheels and be the first to report back . Maybe they 're a new offering from a newer company and they 'll be the new hubs to lace to TB-14s . Or stick with products that are tried and true and popular because they work and have tons of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the Quality Assurance/Quality Control guinea pig in a catastrophic failure . <p> The F5 chainring is an OEM design they branded .

They 've since switched aluminum grades ( only for some colors though ? ) so I ca n't speak for those . <p> As to the hubs , they 're new enough that it does n't surprise me no one knows about them yet . Especially considering they have that whole paired spoke deal going on . I think that would turn a lot of people off from them .

I 've been thinking about a Cinelli X Mash in some form for a long time . Just a fan - simple as that . And understand the quality of Cinelli construction . However , just from an aesthetic perspective - the Leader 725 is a mean looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two into a deeper set of wheels . I 've also thought about ordering a Low// but the lead time and cost is more than I really want to deal with . So these are the bikes I 've really had my eye on . Does the quality of the Cinelli make it worth the $300 difference in price between the two ? That 's one question I have . Also , just from a high-level perspective - what is everyone 's opinion ? <p> I just recently upgraded from a 725 to a histogram . i know its not the bolt but the metals are the same . i can honestly say i noticed a difference in weight and ERROR? i had the exact same parts on both bikes i just switched out the frameset. definitely worth the money in my opinion getting the nicer frame . throw on some solid wheels for the streets and you 're good to go . <p> leaders are lower end frames . the only notable frame they offer is the kagero. personally , the mash frames are well worth the extra money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . or even a vigorelli for that matter . I say this only because the quality from cinelli is outstanding . they are incredibly stiff frames . leaders , not so much . <p> Interesting . I 've heard from quite a few people that both frames had similar flexing . Of course , if frame stiffness is a major concern in your decision and you want some longevity out of your frame , I really would n't go with either . <p> As for which of the two are " lower end " the Cinelli marque has not been a " quality " frame maker for quite a while now as they have shifted their aluminum frame manufacturing overseas like many other companies . the best bang for your buck stiffness/weight wise is still the Bianchi Pista . Granted , the last revision of this frame has gained some weight , but with track frames , weight is not as big a concern unless you 're doing a lot of standing starts or hill climbing . <p> Another issue with comparisons between frames is deals with frame sizing/geometry/tube profiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Cinelli has gone through the bought and sold phases the quality is not what is used to be . The Bolt and the Histogram are not " high quality " frames . Do not mistake branding for quality . These frame flex quite a bit . <p> ok , well i would n't put them on the same level of quality at all . true , cinelli may not be what it used to , but neither is campagnolo ... leader is the shit tier of shit . the ride sucks and the quality sucks . with cinelli , you will pay for the name , but the frame is also loads better than the 725 ... <p> Leader has a bad rap but every tasteful Leader build I 've ridden has felt fine . The Kagero is definitely their best frameset in my opinion . As far as Cinelli , it 's a name . I 've ridden a Histogram and a Vigorelli and just do n't see the hype . Their both fine , but the Cinelli is n't worth the price point . If you 're riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . A twitchy frame is good to an extent and no matter what , aluminum is going to feel a bit rough on the streets . <p> I 'm from chicago ... nuf ' said lol really I 've owned a leader 725 2011 midyear .. 1st build up was with buget parts by comparison to high end name brands .. before I bought or build I went thru sleeplessness. it came down to the best bike with the best preforance for my goals in cycling for the best price for my budget . after building it up with crap parts as some would consider , I loved it . but before I decided to invest into greater components I went and test rode other branded bikes . at the end of the day I was glad of the purchase I had made because the frame &amp; fork offered me what I was looking for . a street bike for commuting , fitness and all around fun , that would also allow me the ability to race if I so chose . It did hold up past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes I 'm sure some of it 's true . but for all the bad it gets from peple , I never had any of the issues . I would still be riding it if it was n't for the fact that a notable competitive cyclist for both road &amp; track ( not going to name drop ) had n't been visiting here in chicago who had seen me tooling around town dusting others with there 2k-6k or so bike who use to ride leaders before being sponsored to ride other bikes ... which also often drives market price for bike .. which many often assume means better bike , made me an offer I could n't refuse . so I sold it . I went and took the oppertunity to build another bike , and I stuck with leader , went steel and I say this I will never go back to carbon or aluminum track or road bikes again . maybe as one poster mention you probably should n't just limit yourself to just these two . there so much out there and everyone 's got an opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just voiced mines . as others stated it comes down to what the rider can handle and torque , weight etc .... so to the guy who started this thread ... these are the things " YOU " have to decide for " Yourself " at the end of the day .... our opinions only matter so much . just go build a bike that is capable of doing the job you want it too . frame &amp; fork are but a small part of the larger cycling picture . I 'll put it to you this way . years ago , aerospokes were being sold on nashbar for 70 bucks ... hipsters , new kids to fixed gear , roadies such as myself who wanted to give fixed a whirl that did n't know much about the etc have driven the price to nearly 500 bucks ... does that mean because they are now 500 bucks , that they are truely preformance difining component to cycling ... not even hardly tried it cool looking strong but that 's where it stoped for " me " ... so does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nope ! ... Cinelli bolts mash or histograms are great bikes I can say that , but so are leaders they both will have moments that fail to live up to expectations ( just like for me the preformance also that they removed the loveable logo on the downtubes of the vigorelli 's which was what I thought my dream bike was ended that dream ) ... but that should be solely up to you ... but you wo n't know till then ... once you build your bike , you 'll like it or hate it ... " red pill or the blue pill " they 're both pills ... <p> I 've ridden a built up Leader 725 and the geometry felt weird . It did n't feel balanced . And it was heavy but I 'm sure the B43s did n't help that . ; ) . I did n't like it ( my opinion ) . They do however ' look cool ' .. i guess . <p> Have n't fucked with a Bolt yet .. but the Mash felt great . Rode spritely and was light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd spend the extra and go with cinelli , you wo n't regret it .

@@22054485 @2054485/ <p> there is a story i like to tell at this point . there was this famous german frame builder who made a titanium bike for one special customer ( not me ! ) . after the bike was ready he called the customer and asked him to pick it up . <p> when he arrived a few days later he was very impressed by the bike - all components were exquisite , but there was one thing he was not happy with : he said : " hey , i want to have a titanium chain on that bike too . for the weight !

As all sugino 75 cranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as for the hatta , they have no problem working with all other NJS cranks . But both are ISO tapers .

Or , can you use a Dura Ace FC-7600 or any NJS crank on a regular square tapered bottom bracket ? <p> From what I remember , Hatta R9400 or any njs bottom bracket for that matter are ISO , so putting something square tapered on these bb 's will risk stripping the spindle or the crank . This also applies to your question on the " fc-7600 cranks on any regular square tapered bb " . *Correct me if I am wrong* <p> Square tapered refers to both ISO and JIS they are interchangeable for the most part , but you can run into problems when installing JIS cranks on an ISO spindle .

The one that came with the original Surly build is a Fox 32 which 29 " with a 15mm QR but it is rather expensive for me considering this is my first mountain bike . The bike itself is what Surly calls a 26 " + so I was looking at a RockShox Recon Silver TK 26 " fork . Obviously the main difference is this is a 26 " fork , but it is a 9mm QR and the travel is 100mm not 140mm . To me this seems like it should work , but if I am missing any obvious or not so obvious flaws in my idea please let me know .

I do intend to use the bike the way it was made , but I am looking for a cheaper alternative than what originally came with the complete build only because I have never mountain biked before . <p> The Instigator is technically a 650b bike that has 26x1.75 tires on 50mm rims . You need a 140mm 27.5 ( 650b ) fork for it . A shorter travel or 26 " fork might work but could throw off the geometry of the bike making the bottom bracket too low , and you would n't be able to use 26 plus tires with a 26 " fork there is not enough room for the tire .

I 'm using cage straps right now but got injured my left foot due to keep skid &amp; skidding for no reason ...... and I think maybe my cage are too small , it can only hold 3/8 of my feet . You think clips pedal is a good idea ? or maybe I just need it to rest coz last time I ride for like 7hrs straight and keep skidding for every 10-20secs lol still practicing ... Any advice ? : ) <p> Yeah a bigger toe cage would help . I prefer clipless over straps or cages because it provides much more secure retention ( unless you 're at the track in which case you would run a cage + clipless ) . I would not recommend running clipless if you do a lot of tricks ( where you need to bail off of your bike fairly often ) or are primarily using your bike for commuting . The major drawback to clipless is that you need cycling specific shoes with cleats meaning that if you want to ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which are fairly uncomfortable to walk around in ) . It 's also fairly expensive to buy clipless pedals and shoes ( probably around $60 MINIMUM for the pair ) . <p> you injured your foot due to skidding because you skid for no reason ? i 'm confused ? as long as the ball of your foot is over the pedal spindle , you 're fine . not completely sure what 's going on here though <p> What it could be is that you need shoes with better support " especially if you 're using OG pedals that do n't have a decent platform . I only know this because way back when I rode , like the proto-hipster that I was , MKS pedals with Asics Tigers . Foot hurt like hell . <p> Take a page from the roadies and trackies : get a shoe with a stiff footbed and maybe even go so far as riding with a platform pedal . <p> Well we all have our opinions ... Time Atacs are great . But depends what you 're gon na use them for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedals when you go for a ride ( little to no walking ) you might as well get a set of road clipless pedals ( 3 bolt ) and if you 're commuting and riding around town ( getting off and walking every now and then ) you 're better off with some mountain bike style ( 2 bolt ) pedals . If you 're going for MTB pedals time atacs are great and come in a few models so you can get which ever one works $ wise . For road pedal there 's shimanos pedals , agian a good range of models to choose from , I think the 105s are you best bet . There 's also look , I 've used the look keo classic pedal which is their cheapest keo pedal and it 's not bad , I 'd look into them or the other keo models . Agian this is just my opinion you may not like the pedals I mentioned , but I think those would be good . As for shoes just go try a bunch on and get the ones that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the same number of holes , ca n't switch from 2 bolt style cleats to 3 bolt style cleats with the same shoe unless your shoe has holes for both . Most will only have one or the other so if you want to have both types of clipless pedals you need two sets of shoes unless you get a pair of shoes that have holes for both . ( For road pedals the adjustment is with the cleat , and mtb pedals you slide the cleat up and down in the shoe ) 3 bolt style <p> I have been using the nashbar cleats with crank bros MTB on my road and track bikes for a few years with no problem . there is a little more play than I would prefer , but they are pretty light and comfy <p> Float is the amount of rotation of the shoe/cleat in the pedal before the pedal releases the cleat . In track cycling it is common for riders to have no float whatsoever . In road applications , having a little float helps out a lot on long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to knee pain . <p> Release tension is the amount of force required to force the pedal to release the cleat . In many road pedals this is adjustable . The Speedplay pedals do not have an adjustable release tension aside from having a track-specific pedal ( Track Zero ) where the tension is higher than the Zero pedal ( more on this later ) . The Zeros do have adjustable float tho " its worth noting that the float adjustment on these is more adjustable than SPDs in that you can dial in the min/max rotation whereas on SPDs its limited to a mushy float related to release tension . <p> For my track-road / road bike setup , I like float with a very high release tension so that I do not accidentally release the cleat form the pedal . As a comparative example : Shimano 105 SPDs pedals have slightly less tension available than the Ultegra and Dura Ace ( for some weird reason ) . <p> For track , I eliminate the float . I used to use Speedplay Zeros and the track zeros " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both " this seems to be a common experience . Comparatively , the release tension of the Speedplays is about the same as the middle tension of SPDs.

I specialize in doing custom builds for people . I really enjoy working with classic bikes , specifically ' 80s , ' 90s , and early 2000s frames and parts . <p> Coomer : How long have you been doing Emerald City Bicycles for ? <p> Bryan : Emerald City Bicycles officially started in March , 2012 . So this is my first year in business . I 've been a bicycle mechanic going on about 10 years , and I 've been tinkering , taking things apart and putting them back together , for as long as I can remember . I got a big-wheel ( one of those plastic tricycles ) when I was a kid , first thing I did was take it apart . <p> Bryan : Being surrounded by bicycles , working with my hands , and of course getting to build beautiful machines that are functional and useful . <p> Coomer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your favorite bike , and why ? <p> Bryan : Currently , it 's my Tommasini Sintesi . I built up the Tommasini with a full Campy Chorus 10-speed alloy group . It 's a beautiful classicly styled Italian bike with slightly more modern Italian steel tubing and Campy 10-speed drivetrain . So it rides smooth , works well , it 's not too heavy , it 's stiff and responsive ... and it looks good . <p> Coomer : What do you have in store for future projects or future plans with Emerald City Bicycles ? <p> Bryan : With Emerald City Bicycles , right now I 'm an appointment only shop . So a customer will contact me about a bicycle , we 'll sit down , typically over a cup of coffee or a beer . We talk about what they want to do with their bike , how much they want to spend and what they want the finished product to look like . From there , I go out and find a frame , hand select all the components and then put everything together for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I 've also started doing bicycle fits , so I can fit the bike to people better and find better-fitting frames . So you end up with an essentially a custom-built bicycle without the custom-built price when you have a custom frame made . I use used frames , vintage and classic frames , newer bikes too , but I really do love the ride and aesthetic of steel frames . <p> For the company itself , right now it 's just me , a one-man shop . I 'm looking into expanding into a storefront sometime in the not-too-distant future , and making it more of a full-time retail space as well .

@@22054501 @2054501/ <p> Accessories:Monogoose water bottle/ Mongoose 15 function cycling computer . I have now added a rear red light and a LED style front white light to make the bike night time legal . <p> More Info:This bike was bought a Zellers on sale for 264.99 . It was on sale . It is not a expensive bike but after riding it 255 km it is holding up well . I makes for a nice budget bike . I have now put 800 km on the bike and it is holding up good . In the late part of August , I ran into a parked car , bending forks on the bike . The good news is I was not hurt and the bike was fixable . The bike is now fixed and running again . A sledge hammer managed fix the fork problem . I e-mailed Jim Langley and he said that a minor repair like this would not affect the bike at all . It feels like it was before the crash . <p> I think i will keep my mountain bike for my dirt road needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bike paths . Also i do n't  know much about bike maintanece and i rather not have to do it too often . Does this bike require alot of maintenence . Also i 'm 5 ' 6 , is the bike the right size for me ? <p> Other then taking apart the bike ( the Bottom Bracket bearings , wheel bearings , etc. ) there is little to do onthe bike other then replacing the tires if they get a flat . The chain should be looked at about once a year if it is used a lot for wear . The same goes for checking the gears . Basicly you should have no trouble with it . For winter riding , the salt in the water will get into everything causing problems with details like the spoke fastners locking up due to rusting if they are steel . Winter riding is very hard on a bike . <p> Hello Steve and Coomer . I just saw this bike today at Zellers for $329 . I absolutely fell in love with it but I was unable to test ride it.However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure it does n't fall off after few rides.I see that you guys have had it for a while . How do you like it and do you recommend me to go and get it ? ? Thanks <p> I have 752 km on the bike and it is holding up great . Other then small tune-ups on it like adjusting the gears , brakes and slight wheel trueing , it runs well so far . The shifters are the base level shimano type , nothing like the 105 group shifters that are used on the brake levers but the base shifters on this bike work out . For a basic entry level bike it is nice . The indexed shifting works so far . It would make for a nice beater road bike when a more expensive bike may not want to be used . <p> My girlfriend bought for me last year . The normal price was 329.99 but it was reduced to the price I posted on the site . The bike was bought in London , Ontario at the Zellers in Westmount Mall . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is last years stock . The bike was assemblied but I still had to do a of of small tuning up to get in into good riding order . When I took the bike home , I hag to remove both wheels , take out the seat post and loosen the handle bar stem to allow the bike to fit into my cars trunk . The car is a 1999 Neon . The one item I might think about replacing is the factory stem . Depending on how the bike fits you , this may have to be changed out to give a better fit for you . The other thing that could be changed is the seat . It may or may not feel right for you . I think that once you fit the bike to make you comfortable and your riding style , it hopefully will work out as a bike that will be used for some time . <p> It was posted at 329.99 . I saw two there and I will check out if they are at the store . As far as the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other name brand road bike but not by much . The alumium frame is very stiff proves a firm , solid ride . It is much quicker in terms the speed you get and feels a lot nicer then a mountain bike . Just take care of the fact that you are using tires much smaller in size then a mountain bike . pot holes can cause flat tires due to pinch flats . I happened to me just last week . I hit a small , deep hole in the ride and had to walk the bike home to fix the tube . I forgot my small basic tool kit I normally take with me . A spare tube that is carried on the bike is a good idea . This does not happen too often but it will happen at some point . <p> Let me know if you find one . I like it a lot . I figure you will need a bit of changing items like the stem tp get a good fit . If you where using mountain bike try raising handle bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit until you feel comfortable on the lower height . I think that you will like the feel that a road bike gives . <p> The frame size is 20 " . The wheels are 700c/ 26 " in size . I am 5 ' 7 " tall and the frame is a bit on the tall side for me but not but to much . Depending on where you live , you my find one near you . As far as I know , Stratford 's Zellers still has two left . I would phone them up to see if they are still there . Depending on how far you are coming , it my or may not be worth the trip . Stratford is a nice place to visit with some nice river riding near the main theater building . 
@@22054502 @2054502/ <p> I would suggest getting a shorter bottom bracket spindle then , like what is recommended for the cranks ( I think for the double , it 's 110mm JIS ) . On the dt250 hub , you 'll be able to move the cogs around to achieve straight chainline .

@@22054507 @2054507/ <h> 1981/ ' 82 Pinarello pista <p> " catch of the day " Giovanni Pinarello , or " Nani " as his friends call him , was born in Catena di Villorba on the 10th July , 1922 during a difficult post-war period in Italy . He was the eighth of twelve children . His love for two wheels and an innate gift as an indomitable fighter , led him to pursue a career in cycling . This is the Eroico ' ( Heroic ) era in cycling : Coppi , Bartali , Bobet on white roads , difficult , very difficult terrain . But the young Nani immediately attracted attention , winning over 60 races and the tender age of 20 won la Popolarissima " in Treviso , an important race in the Dilettanti circuit ( a level of racing which opens doors to being a Professional ) From 1946 Giovanni makes his mark in the world of cycling . But it is in 1951 that Nani has his personal date with destiny : racing in the 34thGiro d'Italia , which is won by Rosa Fiorenzo Magni and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last place comes Giovanni , but in those years last place was not a disgrace , instead , the last rider wore the Maglia Nera ( Black Jersey ) . Giovanni still tells stories of the strategies he carried out in order to take this ranking . There have been known cases of cyclists purposely flattening their own tires , hiding in barns or bars in the aim to lose time in order to arrive last in a stage.this was definitely another era of cycling . Arriving last also means a moment of celebration , including a lap of honor with the winners in Vigorelli velodrome . Giovanni did just that on the 10th June , 1951 carrying this triumph to Milan between Magni and Bobet . That jersey went on to tag Giovanni forever the one with the Maglia Nera " . Gino Bartali , a very good friend of Giovanni 's , noted a dedication , which is still visible today in the store in Treviso " The Black Jersey of Cycling ... but the Pink Jersey of Life . " In 1952 , Giovanni prepares to ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very last moment , he is required to give his spot to the young Pasqualino Fornara , who had just beenfired from the Fausto Coppi 's Team Bianchi . Giovanni is disappointed , but his team offers 100,000 pounds to set aside , a considerable sum of money for those times . This money is used to bear the fruit of what shall be the crown of this his dreams : opening a small bike workshop in order to build his own bicycles . We are now in 1953 in Treviso and Cicli Pinarello is born . Thus begins Giovanni 's dream , building 100% handmade bikes in a workshop close to home . Giovanni worked hard , harder than he had ever before , but he had so many good ideas . Slowly in 1961 Pinarello sponsors its first ride and its first victory at the Tour de l'Avenir thanks to Guido de Rosso . The Pinarello brand begins to carve out its own space ahead of the bigger names of its timesmall sponsorships , small goals , slowly the plant grows . In 1975 , Pinarello enjoys its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction . Cicli Pinarello begins to enjoy widespread popularity and the 80 's become a period of great satisfaction for the small factory in Treviso . In 1988 , his young son Fausto enters the business and alongside came the first Tour de France victory with Pedro Delgado . Pinarello begins to change , it is no longer a small workshop , and things start to get serious . The 90 's open the door to a decade which will mark the fate of this Treviso born brand . Giovanni slowly leaves his position open to Fausto who shall continue his dream . Fausto Pinarello also known as FP ' Fausto Pinarello , son of Giovanni begins working in his father 's factory at the tender age of 17 . As they say here in Treviso , he began to immediately breathe Pane e Copertoni " ( Bread and Tires ) .

We are now in the mid 80 's and the Pinarello brand enjoys great popularity in Italy . But Pinarello is one of several Italian bike brands and thousands globally ; the challenge for Fausto has just begun . Fausto has a strong and decisive character , one of which can be seen expressed in his business decisions which are aimed for the future . Fausto begins to develop alliances with Teams who seem to be only of second grade ' but over time , become extremely successful , producing champions who take the Pinarello brand to great heights .

The result is more victories , in all disciplines , with FASSA team dominating the scene for the next 5 years . This period coincides with one of the largest technical innovations Fausto has ever introduced : MAGNEIUSM And with Magnesium is born the DOGMA , the TOP END BIKE for Pinarello whose name from here on becomes the reference point for absolute HIGH END ROAD BIKE 's in the market . In the years to follow , the Pinarello factory in Treviso begins to churn out successful models every two years , this marking a decisive growth in the Treviso bike manufacturer 's status in the sector .

Overall build is excellent but let down hugely at the seat collar . Weird when you finish a ride and you notice your seat is pointing towards your right thigh 
@@22054514 @2054514/ <h> 1978 Gitane " mexico " piste ( sold ) <p> Gitane is a French manufacturer of bicycles based in Machecoul , France ; the name " Gitane " means gypsy woman . The brand was synonymous with French bicycle racing from the 1960s through the mid-1980s , sponsoring riders such as Jacques Anquetil ( 1963 " 1965 ) , Lucien Van Impe ( 1974 " 1976 ) , Bernard Hinault ( 1975 " 1983 ) , Laurent Fignon ( 1982 " 1988 ) , and Greg LeMond ( 1981 " 1984 ) . It is owned by Grimaldi Industri AB . . . Gitane cycles have their roots in 1925 , when Marcel Bruneli+re opened a smith and agricultural repair works at Machecoul in the Loire-Atlantique region of France . He began making parts for bicycles and the following year opened a further workshop to assemble bicycles for G.M.B and Marbru . Bruneli+re began making his own bicycles in 1930 , choosing the name Gitane ( meaning " gypsy " feminine ) . He added light motorcycles in the 1950s . The name changed to Micmo in 1960 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Micmo was owned by Renault , the car-maker , which had acquired 30 per cent of the shares in 1974 . In 1976 it bought the rest. 1 Gitane bicycles were first imported into the U.S. in 1958 by Mel Pinto Imports of Virginia , and as such were among the first European racing bicycles to be regularly imported into that country . The arrival of a new director-general at the head of Renault in 1985 , Georges Besse , led the company to sell Micmo to raise capital . Micmo continued and then in 1992 joined Peugeot and the Spanish company , BH , to form the Cycleurope group to compete with growing competition from Asia . Later , BH sold Gitane/Peugeot and the rest of Cycleurope to the Swedish Monark conglomerate . . . 54 Center Center 56 Center Top 56 Top Tube

@@22054516 @2054516/ <h> Best Carbon Fiber Drops <p> I am looking into buying some new carbon drops for my Cervelo T1 . What I have in mind are the 3t Scattos and the Easton EC 90 's . Any recommendation for better ones ? I would like the stiffest carbon track drops possible for &lt;$400 . I currently run the Nitto b123 Cromoly . These will only be strictly used as velodrome drops . Thanks . <p> I 'm sure that people who have ridden longer than I will tell you the same thing . The best drops are the ones that allow you to keep your elbows in so that you ate more effectively pulling against your pedal strokes . Nittos are fine-some of the British track team use the aluminum bars and last year the American team used the ec90s . Those riders I bet are stronger than both of us combined . <p> Optimally , a bar 39cm across ctc is a good starting point to determine if your need to go narrower or wire to achieve a good position . <p> Scattos are very nice bars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not racing category races-and it 's not because they 're stiff and aero either . Hoy uses them because they come in a 35cm width . Watch vids of him racing these and watch his body positioning with regards to his arms . <p> I think those nittos will do you fine , what size are you using ? I use the ec90s , I know they 're a few cm too wide for how I ride , but I 'm not gon na pony up $400 when the Alpina track drops Re going for around $200 on sale and they come in a more widths--which is what I 'm gon na end up with . <p> Here 's an interesting read from velocipede salon when considering handlebars . The author was writing to a poster about problems they had with finding the right bars in terms of width . <p> CONI ( the Italian national cycling governing body ) published a line drawing about 40 years ago showing that one should have a bar width at the ends equal to the width between the humeral protuberances at your shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything else except their equally problematic knee-over-pedal-center drawing . The Japanese keirin manual actually specifies a fit that cribs both images from the same CONI handbook , and it 's become cycling lore . <p> CONI did a study in about 2002 or 2003 of over a thousand promising amateur Italian cyclists , both road and track . Among other things , they took measurements of various body dimensions . Interestingly , despite a wide range of sizes and physiques of riders , when an orthopedist actually did the measurements and measured from the center of the humeral ball ( the center of rotation in the shoulder joint , which is probably what CONI was originally suggesting and arguably is the best measurement point if you believe there 's one at all ) , virtually all cyclists had almost an identical measurement of 39 cm . They could have incredibly broad shoulders , but the body always seems to keep the actual ball-to-ball distance at very close to 39 cm . <p> These wider bars came about because with the positions road riders took back in the 70s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . This caused the rib cage to slide down farther over the lungs , which limited available movement of the diaphragm . The perverse solution was to widen the bars a bit ( pioneered actually by Merckx , who used 42 bars when 40 's were considered normal to wide ) . Unfortunately it did n't improve breathing much , and the aerodynamic and leverage effects were counterproductive . Spreading the arms actually decreased the fore-to-aft depth of the thoracic cavity , lowering breathing volume . <p> More recently , riders have come to realize that they can move their arms forward without really changing their centers of gravity much ( after all , it 's only your forearms that are really moving forward , not your whole body ) . This opens up the rib cage and also creates a more aero position . There 's no longer a need for such wide bars , and instead ( depending on the state of your back and shoulders ) you may want lower ( deeper ) bars instead . <p> Think for a minute about the leverage involved as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight of your torso and head is n't supported under your arms , but rather hangs between them . Your spine and head tend to sag , and you get more back problems . With narrower bars , you can keep the weight of your torso more directly over your arms . Plus , you are pulling up on your bars at the same time you 're pushing down on your pedals . Now the outside-to-outside distance on most pedals is plus-or-minus 36 centimeters , so with wider bars it 's like reaching out from your body to lift up a heavy weight . You do better pulling up in the same line that your legs are pushing . So these extremely wide bars are simply a case of poor leverage -- watch most riders on them and they rock back and forth a lot when they 're out of the saddle , and they do n't generate the same watts they 'll generate if they go to narrower bars . It 's for this reason more than anything else that track sprinters have pretty much narrowed their bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maclean ) to 39 and 40 cm . Look at all the carbon Easton and VO2 track bars , and they are nearly all 40 cm center-to-center ( and the only exceptions are 38 cm c-c ) . <p> The author goes on to note that he does not provide any dimensions or methods for finding the right bar size . <p> What 's not mentioned is bar reach and drop which adds another mess to the pot . <p> I do n't think most people need the stiffest handlebars on the planet . I mean , how strong do you really think you are ? Get a solid middle of the road track handlebar with a decent price point and do n't do anything silly and they 'll last you forever . <p> stiffness matters when you 're racing . most road racers stick to alum. more often than carbon bars just because they 're stiffer . obviously they 're gon na be riding high end stuff and not origin 8 bars . you do n't want to lose any power during the last sprint , or even during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree that steel is gon na be your best friend in that regard . However , have you tried to flex an EC90 ? I just tried to pull and push on my EC90s bracing my feet in the pedals and I noticed that the stem is more flexible than those bars . Granted , those EC90s are 38cm and just like most materials , the narrower the bars , the less torsional flex you 're bound to have . And considering how people are positioned during most track events aside from full on standing sprints you 're not going to be able to pull that hard on a set of bars . <p> I dare to say that these EC90s are just as stiff as my last pair of Aluminum Nittos . Benson 's right in that carbon bars are not the most economical . However , you can buy a set of good carbons for much less than $400 . <p> Why even deal with carbon if knowing that any crash can create catastrophic failure ? Width , reach and drop . In a lot of cases I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon bars in these terms . Take the Alpina Carbon Sprint bars or the 3T Scattos . The former comes in a 33cm width , the latter : 35cm each with different reach and drop . I have n't seen any lightweight and stiff bars out there that match their profiles . At that point , its not about material . <p> Of course , that 's not the point of this thread now is it . And my banter goes on ... <p> I completely agree . stem choice also plays a big role as well . I think this matters more so in terms of which material you use as opposed to bar choice . and I have tried ec90 's ; currently on on ec90 aeros ( not on a track bike though ) . plenty stiff

Having your chain line off is n't that big of a deal . Especially if you have to compensate for the risk of damaging your frame .

My experience was that the Alfine 11 setup works well for most types of low effort purposes .

Only made for one year , ( 1972 for the 1973 catalog ) , by Panasonic- who was the only vendor to meet Schwinn 's rigid standards , the World Voyageur came lugged with Hand-brazed , double-butted , 4130 cromoly steel , chrome plated head lugs , fork crown and front/rear fork ends , and heavy-duty forged Suntour GS horizontal dropouts with screw adjust . It also featured the first ' Dura Ace ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shimano 's excellent Crane deraileurs , which were quickly proven to be superior to Campy 's Gran Turismo on the Paramount of the same year . This was serious competition to the Paramount series at half the price . In fact now most enthusiasts refer to the World Voyageur as a ' Baby Paramount ' . After one year on the market ( and not even in the dealer catalog ) the World Voyageur was quietly dropped , the Shimano Crane derailleur appeared on the new Paramount Touring , and Schwinn made a large commitment to Panasonic-built LeTours which would become Schwinn 's second-most-popular model through the seventies . <h> 17 Comments <p> I just got one of these in yellow and drops are Shimano not Suntour . This model was actually produced in 1972 for the 1973 Scwhinn catalog but never was shown until Scwhinn released its own advertisement for the World Voyager . Mine came with the rare scwhinn approved barcons shifters which are stock for that model . <p> Interesting ! You are correct about the made in 72 ' part , but everyone seems to list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that catalog . Mine did n't  have the original handlebars when I bought it either . Apparently , there is also a 25 " model that was made in baby blue , but i 've only read about one . <p> In my opinion this was a test model for Scwhinn to see how sales went with this model before they invested and came out with an actual Paramount branded tourer . The World Voyager sold new in 73 ' for $275 where the Paramount was $400-$450 P13 or P14 also take into account new cars costed $3-5000 . I 've seen alot of vintage used bicycles in my day and this is defiantly a high quality tourer . <p> I agree . I also feel they were testing the idea of outsourcing in general . I do n't think they counted on this bike being so damn nice , but Panasonic was top notch , and like you said it ended up being direct competition to the Paramount at a sizeable discount . Although this is such an interesting piece of history , I have been toying with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62-63cm frame , and recently came across a 79 ' Centurion Pro Tour in my size , that I am thinking might be a better fit for that slot in my fleet . Am I crazy ? <p> Yessitr- both my semi pro and pro tour are full chrome under paint . At the end of the day , it 's got ta be the right size , so I reached out to a friend and am going to pass the goodness onto him . All is well that ends well . <p> i believe it was airplane stripper- got it at the local auto parts store , super heavy duty liquid or spray can stripper . need to use it in an open space , wear gloves , eye mask and face mask , but it works , and does n't  touch the chrome . the fenders came that way , shortys , i think Wald makes them ?

I would have much preferred a taller head tube to mitigate the amount of drop I have . When I first looked at your Pulse , I noticed it had an unusually short wheelbase ( crank to wheel distance ) - this could be from the proportionally shorter top tube you say . Pulses , from what I 've read , have little to no toe overlap , and this is quite apparent on their larger frames . Even on my Pulse , I have only the slightest rub . <p> Like you said , I have also found much variance in Pulse geometries and they are probably from different years . Both of our Pulses have a pursuit-styled top tube , but we have different seat collars .

Budget wise i can spend up to 2500$ <p> I 'd say the matte black Bianchi Super Pista would be the closest in comparison in the looks department . The tubes are n't as beefy as the 735 's , but the quality is better , and in my opinion , it just looks a lot cleaner . Also , there are n't too many logos so it 's not over the top . Bianchi has been around for a while so it 's a company you can trust . <p> I 'm with everyone else , with that budget do n't get a leader !

Anyway the replacement fork is on It 's way , the for3 tubes are NOS tubes from the 90 's and they only have enough tube sets to make about 100 for3 's .

Or more equivalent to the tubing of an early 90 's cdale ? <p> You riding street or track ? Leggenda is a great frame . Do consider that the Leggenda has very tight geometry with aggressive toe-overlap . Max tire is 700 x 23c as well ... unless you custom order wider chainstays . Very street worthy with some getting use to ... <p> Yeah they do . And with your funds , you could probably get either one of those exact set ups , which would be killer . You could probably get them in matte black too , with that awesome looking triangular tubing ! Notice how I 'm trying to stray you away from a MASH haha .

Gazelle then grown in 120 years , a small two-man business into a leading international company . Three bicycles sold in 1892 to the largest bicycle brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The number of bicycles sold is always increased more in recent years . For the first million bicycles was required 62 years . The second million followed 12 years later in 1966 . Willem Kolling showed good name to have chosen because then the turn came and Gazelle really found the momentum . The century in 1992 coincided with the production of the eight millionth bicycle . Moreover , Princess Margriet granted the title " Royal " Gazelle in honor of the 100th anniversary . An award that our moral obligation to keep innovating . stay ahead with smart inventions that make cycling more fun or easier . By that time were delivered every 3 to 4 years a million bicycles . This resulted on April 7 , 1999 to a peak in the existence of Gazelle . On that day , explained Prince Willem Alexander namely the finishing touches to the 10 millionth Gazelle . Gazelle went on and on October 31 , 2005 the 12 millionth Gazelle drove out of the factory . Minister Karla Peijs of Transport helped on this day personally join the Gazelle Easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2008 , the 13 millionth Gazelle was produced and even the 14 millionth bike in December 2012 .

@@22054587 @2054587/ <h> FS : FS Aerosports Trialist Carbon Fiber Tubular Disc Wheel $400 <p> For sale , I have an Aerosports Trialist carbon disc wheel . The wheel body is made out of full carbon and the axel has been converted to 120mm track / single speed spacing . The hub takes a 5-6-7 speed threaded freewheel body but currently has a removable track drivetrain adaptor installed ( the adaptor completely fixes all chainline issues ) . The axel uses a 17mm bolt of an unknown tpi . <p> The disc is slightly untrue ( believed to be 1mm ) , round , and in near new condition all around . The valve hole was professionally cut and the wheel shows very little to no road usage from the untouched braking surface and immaculate wheel body . The wheel uses a tubular rim body and is believed to have spent all of it 's time on the track . <p> This wheel is heavy and solid ( I think it 's about 1400g without the tire ? ) which makes it perfect for training and experiencing the different affects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tire on the wheel is no good and will be removed before pick-up / delivery / shippment .

I will deliver locally ( 40 mile radius ) for free if purchased at listed price or if trading for very good product . If I go down on the price , I will charge a small fee of $20.00 to deliver . I will also ship to the Continental US via UPS . I work at a pro bike shop so the wheel will be packaged professionally and shipped 1-2 business days after purchase by me personally . <p> I was looking to get $400.00 for this wheel . Seems a little high , I know . The only reason is because I used to own this exact same disc wheel several months ago and that disc wheel in particular was very out of true , 4mm-5mm , was not round , had a quick release axel ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have experienced quick release rear axels on a single speed with track dropouts , but ... no , not happening ) , did n't have the track adaptor so the chain line was literally ridiculous , the black machined sidewall was almost completely worn to silver , the valve hole looked like it was cut out by a 3-year-old , and on top of all of that , the fricken wheel had a hole in the side of it ! And it took about 2 weeks to sell that thing for $300 bucks ! <p> So $400 is pretty firm , if you take it off my hands pretty quick ( today is 1/14/13 ) , I might go a little bit lower ! <p> I 'm also open for trades !

Ribble or Wiggle for the 1 " forks either one is good . 55cm is fine for me and I 'm 5 ' 9 " . You ca n't go wrong with that frame , especially for the price .. Happy riding ! <p> The frame seems to be a good fit believe it or not . The stem is far too long so a new part is in the post . You 're right about the bar though , it looks completely wonky in the photo . <p> As for the groupset , I guess it 's the eternal debate . I 'm sure Apex and 105 are excellent , but for my needs and financial situation the Tiagra/Sora cocktail is ideal , and works very well . I 'll upgrade to full Tiagra at some stage , no rush .

First off , This bike is extremely smooth and stable , the bottom bracket is low so trying to stand up and bolting down the road is like gunning it in a old Cadillac . VERY stable . The handleing is great for roads and light gravel roads and shitty roads . Yes , any rack will work and your custom parts would work just fine .

The hanger is Steel so you can bend it a lot on a tour if needed to with out replacement . yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like causes it 's disc brake . I also have a Vaya and it 's really fun bike to ride on the road then all of a sudden bolt on to a gravel road or light cross coarse . Both of these bikes are very comfy and not aggressive . Cross bike are much more snappy and higher BB and the reach drop is much greater . <p> First off nice build , great touring set up , next I have a couple questions : how does marrakesh ride , in terms of both stiffness and handling ? I 'm looking for something more light tour-esque to use for gravel , mtb trails , commuting and possibly some cx stuff most of the time I 'd be using a frame bag without much in it and only plan to do lighter touring so I 'm interested in these qualities while the bike is unloaded . I was also wondering about rack mounting with the alternator drop-outs , will any rack work , or I need a specific one , could I make it would with some mods or custom small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was possible , I 'm looking to run 1.9 - 2.3 for max off road capability .

( mine was the first production run - he 's grown in popularity and i 'm sure his orders have increased since ) but his service was superb . He was always super transparent if there were any minor delays and was upfront and honest with everything . <p> The frame quality is insane . The frame is lighter than my Super Pista . The raw finish is completely hand polished - to Andrew Low 's point , the frames come out looking hand made , not home made . Could n't agree more . <p> The geometry . Its an aggressive pursuit frame . Its tight ... really tight . There is more toe overlap than both my Level and Pista . But I got used to it in a few days and it feels fine . I do n't ride on the track , its a street beast . The streets in nyc suck ... and the frame takes a beating without feeling like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... it sorta responds like a steel frame bike . <p> Since its essentially a custom hand made frame ( to an extent ) you can make requests like no graphics or various colored graphics . Custom colors are also possible but anything outside of his standard offerings will cost extra . I 've been riding mine since the beginning of last year and could n't be happier . Its by far my favorite bike . <p> Ca n't say anymore good things about LOW . Check out mine if you want and hit me up with any questions you got . Good luck dude . <p> Just ordered it in the pursuit . My only concern with the pursuit is that if its too steep it might look kind of silly . Its hard to tell how steep it is , as the same bike can look totally different in different photos even on this website . We 'll see . <p> i ride a low ... have the first track version he did . Rides great , probably the greatest track frame i have ridden . Andrew is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would definitely recommend his work ... <p> If your in SF , Freewheel hayes is the exclusive shop that carries his frames . I know they have some in . Stop by and ask for Connor or Dustin they will show the frames . <p> I do n't get the hype motivating people to drop $2400 on a frameset . I understood a bit more when they were $1200-$1500 but now it just seems ridiculous . Sure they 're nice bikes , that look cool and the quality is good - but i 'm not convinced they 're on the same level as say Spectrum , Rob English , Yamaguchi or Tiemeyer ( when he was building at least ) . Frameset costs : <p> and all of those builders offer/offered fully custom sizes , tubes , etc . As far as I know with Low you just pick from the sizes available and then get to do custom colors and decals at extra cost ( this may have changed ) . <p> And I know not everyone cares about resell value but they usually sell well under $1k @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for sale everywhere for months . I mean to each their own but I personally do n't get it . I think about all the bike I could buy for $2400 ; that 's more than I spent on my GT and Yamaguchi frames combined . <p> it used to cost extra for the custom geo , i 'm guessing it still does unless they include it with the price of the frame now . i 'm guessing though do n't though . good for Andrew I guess , make that money while he can . he builds nice bikes that are fun to ride , just probably not 3x the cost of a new Cinelli frame fun . <p> I know if I planned to drop that much money on a frame it 'd have to be for a Cannondale Track . Even then I do n't care that bad to have one to spend that kind of money . Andrew Low seems like a cool dude , has a great product , and knows how to hustle the game !

As it turned out , I needed a Dura Ace AX rear derailleur and he just happened to have one which he offered to me in place of the other pair of water bottles .

This is somewhere between 5-7 years old . Tubeset is described as a " framebuilder 's special " - a mix of Reynolds and Tange chromoly steel , TIG welded . The bike was designed to have typical road race geometry and quick handling , yet clear larger tires . I run slick tires that measure 29c and could have room for fenders . I 've also ran 32c cyclocross tires but have to deflate them to clear the brake pads . That setup barely clears the mildly-dimpled chainstays. 55.5 top tube . <p> Thank you ! I 'm aware of that ' rule ' and debated a silver stem and HS spacers . In the end I like a darker aesthetic to the bike .

@@22054618 @2054618/ <p> More Info:Griffen was owned by Tony Free and was in operation for 15 years before shutting its doors in 2009 . Their frames were handmade in Decatur , Texas USA and were limited in production , costing around $3500 new . The mix of materials in Griffen frames , known as Boron Carbide Metal Matrix Composite , is not melted ; but rather sintered . The raw material is a fine powder squeezed together and formed into shape under extreme pressure . After the Boron Carbide was made , it had to be packed , shipped and fabricated into a bike within one week , or it became unusable . The microscopic structure created by this process is like a honey comb , which absorbs shock and vibration while maintaining a rigid structure . When the frame is finally finished , it hardens and becomes as strong as steel , provides the comfort of titanium , the stiffness of aluminum and has a fatigue life 100 's of times greater than aluminum alloys . The frames were said to be 38% stronger than aluminum alloys and 40% lighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Because of the powder metallurgy process , the material has inherent microscopic pores , which is absorbent to vibration . This results in a smoother ride . Also , because we use more material by volume as our competition ( our material is one half the weight of normal aluminum by volume ) , we achieve better comfort , lateral stiffness and power transmission all at the same time .

@@22054639 @2054639/ <p> More Info : +FERRIVELOCI+ Paolo Paciucci , having obtained a degree in industrial design from ISIA in Rome , moved to Milan to continue his studies at the Polytechnic of Milan . In this period he recaptured his passion for cycling by frequently visiting ciclofficine ' ( a ciclofficina is a place where people help each other repair bicycles for free - or for the cost of the spare parts ) especially focusing on the history of components and frame builders of the past . After years of militancy on the pages of fixedforum , a cultural and educational enrichment website focusing on track bikes , he met Mario Camilotto . After two years of extraordinary stories from the Master , Paolo asked him to teach him everything he knows about the construction of steel frames , in order to pass on the know-how that would otherwise be lost .

In 2010 he moved to Tokyo where he studied Design at Geijutsu Tokyo Daigaku ( Tokyo University of Fine Arts and Music ) , and worked in the Nendo studio . After returning to Italy he worked for a few months with Sovrappensiero Design Studio .

But i just started riding fixed gear since 2010 . I ride almost everyday because I commute from my house to my studio with my bike . <p> Pedal Room : I 'll get right into it , your Leader Kagero x Pedal Consumption is beautiful . How 'd you come across the frame ? <p> Faz : Thanks Coomer ! I met Patrick Thames in Jakarta for the Fixed Fest festival who brought his prototype Kagero and I fell in love with it . At first I was wondering what type of frame he 's using because I 've never seen one before . On the last day of the event we chatted about the frame set and he explained everything about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leader team and riding for them with the Kagero frame set . <p> Pedal Room : Does it see mostly velodrome , mostly street , or a mix of both ? <p> Faz : I have n't ridden this frame in velodrome yet due to some workloads . But this frame will definitely be rockin ' the velodrome anytime soon . <p> Pedal Room : How 's it ride ? <p> Faz : By far this is definitely the most aggressive and responsive frame set i have ever had . <p> Pedal Room : Your other track bikes are also very nice . How 's the Leader compare ? <p> Faz : I had the same frame geometry before this , the Trek T1 and LOOK 464 , which the top tube is slopping at the back and it feels more relaxed . Compared to the Kagero , this would be my first pursuit track geometry frame set and it feels totally different because the geometry itself carries your body weight upfront , and it place your body posture in a great position for sprinting which suits my riding style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got ta be the Jakarta Fixed Fest 2011 . Where i met a lot of great people , enjoyed great food , and feast my eyes with Jakarta 's great scenery .

But most probably I 'm changing the saddle to Selle Italia SLR . <p> Pedal Room : Anything else you 'd like to say ? <p> Faz : A big shout out to Patrick for hooking me up with Leader Bike USA , and not to forget PEONFX for giving me the best . Stop spending times indoors , take out your bike and give it a good spin . Thanks for the featured . A great website I must say ! Ride safe , Malaysia Boleh !

I have both and much prefer the road shoes for riding , but they 're just not practical as far as commuting .

You can walk in them , and they are superb for any type of rig . Track , CX , MTB , Road . If you have multiple bikes , MTB pedals are perfect . There 's nothing wrong with racing in MTB shoes . Heck if people look down on you for having them , just kick their ass in a race . <p> Road shoes on the other hand are more efficient in power transfer in comparison to a MTB shoe .

And then , putting a crown on the crown seems a rather obvious thing to do . Most of these threads suggested Losa or Monark/Crescent , but I do have my doubts . Especially after finding this thread . My frame is definitely related to 2T Tecnotelai Bologna . The crown is the same , and the lug cutouts in the link is the same as the cutout on the fork crown . http : **34;928;TOOLONG ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fork crown really have anything to do with 2T ? Yes , it does . Does 2T really stand for Tecnotelai ? Yes , it does . Tecnotelai Bologna to be precise .

Of the one 's that were still labelled , I could trace some back to bike shops . None had decals of another proper manufacturer . Not much info to be found on Tecnotelai .... Tecnotelai from Bologna Italy . Repainted as a " Bianchi " ( And added a Reynolds transfer ) 52 CC 54 CT 52,5 TT <p> Great finds you made with your bike and your research !

Road group rides / commuting / bike packing . I love my current 52/36 , 11-32 for mountainous and spirited road riding , but do n't find it low enough to slog my loaded bike up long gravel roads . I 'm after lower ratios without sacrificing too much off the top . <p> The shifting on a more standard set up , such as a 11-25 cassette with a short cage derailleur has a lot quicker and accurate shifting . The current set up is not bad by any means , but it is not as good as I am used to hence me possibly going back to a more " normal " cassette/derailleur combo.

@@22054708 @2054708/ <h> Transferring Power to Rear Wheel <p> Hey guys , just curious , in terms of transferring power to your rear wheel , which is better , steel or aluminum ? Also , what other factors are there in transferring the power ? Like geometry , tubing , crank arm length , etc . <p> Do lo-pro/pursuit frames do this better compared to frames with a leveled top tube ? <p> really what you want to look at for power transfer is stiffness . USUALLY aluminum takes it for stiffness but there are some lugged steal frames that are known to be very stiff . Geometry does n't really affect anything in power transfer in my experience , and crank arm length sometimes has different factors ( like the longer the crank arm the more leverage you have ) but not necessarily the power transfer . What you really want are frames , cranks , and wheels that are super stiff . This is usually why on a lot of more expensive bikes they usually have aluminum frames with carbon forks and wheels . Carbon fiber takes the cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of variables . It goes with frame material , frame design , how well it was built , and also components being used . Usually a smaller frame with shorter tubes like compact style and tighter triangles makes a stiffer frame . Steel and aluminum are apples and oranges . <p> In general , power transfer has very little to do with geometry ( although a frame with poor geometry might have more flex but , more importantly , it will probably be very awkward to ride meaning that the user probably ca n't use his maximum effort ) . Furthermore , it 's a common misconception that all frames/components made out of the same material will perform the same . Two steel frames could behave very differently as well as weigh very differently . An aluminum frame can be stiffer than a carbon fiber one ( this is actually pretty true when you compare high end aluminum frames to low end carbon fiber frames which are comparable in pricing ) . Aluminum , steel , and carbon fiber all can have different grades in terms of quality and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not created equal . Quality differences can vary in due to differences in the manufacturing process or what materials are actually used in the manufacturing process . The difference in quality is evident if you compare , let 's say , a generic Chinese made aluminum frame to a Cervelo T1 . Both are aluminum but I assure you that the T1 will far outperform the Chinese made frame which is why the Chinese manufacturer can sell his frame for a fifth of the price . I do have to concede that higher quality frames/components usually come with a higher mark up due to branding , R&amp;D , etc . <p> TL ; DR - Quality matters <p> For the sake of another example , let 's take a look at the Cervelo T1 again . Let us assume two T1 frames were manufactured in the exact same way so as to ensure both frames were built equally in quality . The only difference between the two frames is that one is larger than the other ; let 's say one is 52cm and one is 56cm . Performance wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of both weight and stiffness . Since the 52cm frame is smaller the tubing is therefore shorter meaning that it is much harder to deflect the tubing when force is applied . Of course since the tubing is shorter on the smaller frame it is therefore also lighter than its 56cm brother . This is the reason why many athletes size their frame down ( smaller frames also have shorter wheelbases which means more responsive handling ) . The major point of concern is bottom bracket flex . Almost all your power is being put into your crank arms and therefore the bottom bracket must be stiff enough to resist the force . A bottom bracket that can adequately resist the force will not flex as much and therefore less force will be used to flex the bottom bracket and instead go into your drive train resulting in more efficiency ( amount of power input versus amount of power output ) . <p> TL ; DR " A smaller frame will be more stiff and lighter than a bigger frame of the same model . <p> NJS Frames are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , in most cases , they are inferior to modern frames . NJS Frames must be built to certain specifications which make them legal for kierin racing . The idea behind kierin racing is to set standards so that racers do not get an advantage because of the quality of their equipment . Therefore a NJS stamp just shows that a component is legal for kierin racing and is not an indicator whether a certain piece of equipment is superior to another . It is true that many components used in kierin racing are very high quality components such as Sugino/Dura Ace drive trains . The fact that they are NJS stamped and are of high quality has no correlation whatsoever . The fact that a LOOK frame is not NJS stamped does not mean it is inferior to an NJS frame . In fact , the LOOK frame is vastly superior to the NJS frame in almost every regard ; the lack of NJS approval only means that it is not legal to use such a frame in a kierin race . <p> TL ; DR " NJS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NJS Simply means that a frame/component is legal to use in a kierin race . Kierin racing attempts to give all riders an equal level of equipment so that the winner is the strongest rider , not the one with the best equipment . <p> The last thing is hub flange . High flange hubs are stiffer than low flange hubs . I forget the exact reason why high flange hubs are superior to low flange hubs in terms of stiffness . I know many riders who ride on the street can attest that low flange hubs are more comfortable on extended rides when compared to high flange hubs . High flange hubs are really only popular in the velodrome ; low flange hubs are much more readily available as they are used on virtually every single road wheel set . The only reason why high flange hubs have been in higher demand is that people want to build wheel sets for their sick fixiez for extra street cred ( purely because track racers use high flange wheel sets ) . <p> TL ; DR " High flange hubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the super long response . I 'm at work right now so writing something like this is much more entertaining than actually working . Hopefully this answered all your questions . <p> Stiffness is key for optimal power transfer . Benson 's on the money with all the variables . <p> One thing I want to point out too is weight as it relates to power transfer and more specifically acceleration . If this is important to you then you want stiff and lightweight . These things are key for off the line acceleration and climbs . <p> Depending on how and where you ride , you might sacrifice comfort and a few other attributes but if you care about power and acceleration , then go aluminum . And if you can really afford it , go carbon . <p> Obviously components are important as well . You want stiff and light everything . For example , if your drops flex during a climb , you 'll lose power . etc . <p> high flange is stiffer because the spoke length is shorter and in a sense are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in order to understand . whereas with low flange , the spoke length is longer , thus creating more flex . a good way to counter that is also by the type of rim you use . you could have a deep section rim and lace it to a low flange hub . shorter spokes will be used , making the wheel stiffer . still not as stiff as a high flange set up , but close . <p> also , the material of the frame is very important . for steel , columbus SL or SLX " takes the cake " in terms of stiffness . lower grade steel wo n't be quite as stiff . same goes for aluminum and carbon . also , frames with shorter rear stays is also another factor . bringing in the rear wheel and making the wheel base tighter will definitely benefit more in power transfer . twitchy , but stiffer , more precise control , and easier power transfer . a more relaxed fit will lack power transfer . so it also depends on how you set up the bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter the weight , the easier it is to excellerate. because essentially , you 're pushing . the more weight you push , the slower you will go ( obviously ) and more energy will be needed . think of it that way .

LTD ergonovas are expensive , pro ergonovas are not . Its the exact same shape , one is just expensive and carbon , the other is cheap and alloy . You can find used ergonova pros for cheap ( like 30 bucks , seriously ) or you can buy any old 31.8 bar and see if its comfortable . Literally any stem that is the right length and has the right clamp size will work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new one is 19 bucks . If you 're poor , find a used one . also , any seat post that is the right size will work . You probably do n't know weather or not you want a set back anyway , so just buy the cheapest one . <p> You also do n't need extravagant wheels . a basic rim with some formula ( or similar ) hubs will be just fine . You do n't need phil hubs and h+ rims to have a sturdy wheel . You do n't even need to lace it yourself . ( stay away from purefix ) <p> If you decide to splurge and buy the most expensive bike ever , who cares , enjoy it since you have the means . Being drastic like that is one way ( But expensive ) to test who you want to ride with ( or even who you wan na be friends with ) There will be those that accept you , and will be happy for you , and those that will talk a lot of crap out of jealousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cares , if they 're judging , do n't even factor them being " cyclists " in the equation , they 're probably like that for everything and will be straight up assholes no matter what . So , just do what makes you happy . <p> I think with bikes there is definitely somethings that you can skimp on , stem/seatpost , and there are some that you can just get some cheap used ones until you find what you want ; bars , brake levers , perhaps pedals and saddle . But sadly in the end if you really ride a lot , you are going to need decent parts . The double edged sward of bike building is that parts do n't depreciate THAT much so if you buy a decent set of SRAM S300s you can buy them for $150 and sell them for $100 . <p> However , there are things that are just not worth it at all , shitty pure fix or whatever deep wheels and lasco cranks are a good example .

BUY YOUR SADDLE FROM THE SHOP YOU TEST FROM . common sense , but shitty people used to bypass that one at the shop i used to work at . does n't build positive LBS karma ) <p> stems and seaposts are all pretty much the same . get one from a name brand , but not necessarily expensive ones ( if you 're in with your LBS , they probably have some stock take offs from bikes they sold that are cheap ) <p> tires are a good place to get something decent . I like to fit the fattest tire my frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap tire . conti gatorskins ride a little assy , but they 'll help if you ride in a place where punctures are a concern . <p> did i mention get good tools ? you 'll at least want a multi tool , tire levers , floor pump , and good electrical tape ( go 3m , no name stuff does n't stick in the heat as well ) <p> halfway decent pedals are n't a bad idea , but i hate how sloppy pedals feel . $30 there is good enough . <p> Saddle that fits you , comfortable handlebars ( I am one of those people that swear by 3T Ergos , but most compact drop bar handlebars are good ) , good tires and good pedals ( SPD SL pedals are the way to go , cheap but great pedals ) . You can skimp on the post and stem . For wheels and cranks , you 'll want decent quality but you do n't necessarily need the best ( get the best your budget allows for ) . BB17 Karma ?

There are two possible options to increase the tire size you can use and still have room for full fenders . This depends on what size wheels are you using now ? If you are using older style 27 " X 1 1/4 wheels you can change from 27 " to 700c by either replacing the rims to 700c and re-lacing the hubs or buying new wheels . If there is enough room to adjust the brake shoes down to reach this slightly small wheel / tire you can gain room for larger tires and also gain room for fenders . If your current brakes will not reach you can change the brakes to Tektro long reach dual pivot brakes or use a quality centerpull brakes which have a longer reach . Here are some good articles on this conversion : LONG ... LONG ... LONG ... If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 700c to 650b rims again by either re-lacing the hubs to 650b rims or buying new wheels . For this conversion you WILL need longer reach brakes unless you are already using long reach center pulls . There are three things that have to be measured before trying this conversion . The first is the width between the seat stays and chain stays . Second , is the width between the fork blades . If either of those is too narrow then you should n't bother converting . The third issue is the Bottom Bracket drop . If the current drop is not long enough and you convert you will be dropping the bike down and therefore be risking pedal strike - not a good thing .

What was ur experience with omniums ? And if u had the same problem as me I would love to find out how you addressed this problem ! Thanks you in advance <p> There 's no need to use spacers on the stock Omnium GXP BB in a 68mm shell - ever ( despite what bull**** you read on the internet ) . In fact , using spacers on either side will cause the non drive-side crank arm to not bottom out on the spindle when properly installed and in some cases , cause the crank arm to actually make contact with the bearing cup . <p> The cranks do n't fit either because the chainstays are too wide or the tubing is too thick and not dimpled for clearance . Just cut your losses and sell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who might see this in the future . Do not use spacers on your omniums ! If they do n't fit get rid of them . In the manual it even says spacers are not intended for road use . <p> You are not suppose to put spacers on the bottom bracket for more clearance . There is suppose to be a technical reason why ( I do n't know it . Maybe someone here can explain it a bit further ) . Its a hit or miss with the SRAM Omniums Its compatible with a few frames and not compatible with the others If the Omniums do n't fit then get the 75s ( vice versa ) <p> Either you 're lucky enough to get a set that does n't have a thick ass spider ( or grind them down ) , just do n't give a shit that they beat your chainstay until there 's a " nice " groove , or pair them with a crimped chainstay . Definitely hit or miss . <p> The spacers worked ... Kinda ... if your torque the bolts that secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force is applied . If i loosened it a little the arms would spin a little easier but It would risk them actually falling off . I 've tried with 3 Sram spacers in all possible ways . In final ... If you choose to run with the bolt on tight , you will find pedaling harder and if you loose the bolt , you will risk the crankset loosening/damaging it <p> I have a weird clicking sound coming from my omniums chainring .. they are brand new , my chainline is correct , it is well lubed and tensioned . I am running an izumi ECO chain ... Are these things just noisy , or does it take a bit of time for omniums to " break in " ? it sounds like a roulette wheel ... anyone have some insight on this ? thanks ! <p> Do NOT use a spacer on the DRIVE side of the crank . You can however use a spacer on the non-drive side . This will only help if your chainline is too far out , it will not solve clearance issues with the drive side crank arm .

I learned to skid - and ride fixed in general - on a rainy day and it helped a lot . I was still super bad at it after a while but when i rode in dry weather , i could n't skid at all ... My experience is that you really need to work up your muscles for it . When i got out yesterday for the first time in way too long , I found it hard to get into the rhythm .

What 's your choice ? <p> I 've used both on Dura ace 7710 crankset and Omnium on both different kind of frames . DA on a more velodrome fitted bike and Sram on a street bike . I honestly can say they both are great cranksets . I personally would choose the Sram over DA ... Reasons why ... The octalink is more maintenance opposed to the gxp style bb . I like the feel to Omnium more than the DA 7710 , probably because It was fitted on a more street designed frame . THE MOST IMPORTANT thing to think of is pricing . I 've sold my DA crankset for 325 in really nice condition ... and there are nice deals like that , but if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think it all comes down to budget . The DA Crankset I had were smooth and impressive . <p> " It all comes down to budget " That 's where you 're wrong . Jamesfix , do n't listen to this guy . You should try them out first hand , and see which you prefer to ride with . They 're both great cranks , on and off the street . After that , you can you start looking for whichever you prefer , and find a great deal . <p> I feel like it is ... Because money wise I would like to say DA would run more then the Omnium ... If he has the money to invest in DA , go for it . BUT saying one only had 250 or so . A new pair of omniums would n't hurt . YES you are right about preference . I 'm speaking for riders that would n't have the money to invest in 2 crankset and then end up selling the other ... FROM what I can say is already stated already Maintenance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I love both crankset , but personally I 'll go for Sram . The only con I can think about the omnium is the problem with hitting the chain stay . DA 7710 ... Expensive if bought new .. blah blah blah . Just tryna speak my mind <p> DA has a narrower Q factor than the Omnoms , is stiffer , and imo nicer . If you get them wholesale , just go with the nicer cranks . Might as well start off with the best so you do n't have to upgrade them . <p> Last time i checked the actual material they 're made if is exactly the same but Omniums are a bit beefier . The biggest difference between the two , and the reason why Omniums are stiffer than DA is because they are GXP . They use a big spindle connected to the drive side crank arm which connect to the non-driveside arm ( obviously ) <p> Omniums stiffer than DA ? I wonder why Chris Hoy along with most of the Olympic level track racers use Dura Ace cranks then ( when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huh ? ; ) <p> If you think Octalink is n't extremely stiff then I think you should do some more research . However , they say that the octalink bb is susceptible to a shorter lifespan as well since the spindle is massive and the bearings are small , but that 's not something that 's debatable as some people claim that their BBs have lasted forever . Smaller bearings also makes for a smoother drivetrain , which I suppose can be important in track . <p> Now I 'm not saying that the Omniums are n't stiff , they 're what I use ( along with 1 or 2 olympic track teams ) as well but that 's more of a monetary value decision . You 're getting the better bang for your buck . What 's nice about the Omnoms is that the BBs are cheap so replacement bearings are no problem and they even come with the crankset itself . You can also upgrade the bearings in the BB to ceramic as well without having to go and buy a Red Box GXP . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with but as you progress as a track racer you 'll eventually make the jump to DA ( or if you 're an endurance type of guy , S75s ) . Rotors and all those other cranksets are more for the bling bling than anything ( not saying that their performance is n't bad , they 're just do n't have a good bang to buck ratio lol ) . <p> The OP has probably decided by now , but i 'll add my input for future generations . <p> I 've ridden both Omniums and DA 7710 cranksets . I 'm gon na be completely honest I could n't tell any difference between the two stiffness wise . I 'm also willing to bet my car and life savings that none of you can either . Price often gives the illusion of something being better . Whatever you 're feeling is placebo . <p> I also want to add that GXP BB 's are a hit or a miss . I 've had three crap out on me in the 8 month period that I owned Omniums . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BB if you buy DA 7710 buy a 105 5500 BB . <p> They are both equally easy to install . It all comes down to how much you are willing to spend . <p> I will agree that the stock GXP that comes with Omniums is n't very good compared to a DA bb , but that can easily be changed , just like I did . <p> And honestly I can care less about what professional track athletes ride , Rotor 3D and Omniums would still probably be the stiffest . <p> And yeah , you 're completely right ! We would n't be able to tell the difference between the two , but that does n't really matter now does it ? Because the stiffer something is the less flex there is resulting in higher efficiency in power output NO MATTER WHAT LEVEL OF CYCLING YOU MAY BE IN . <p> the omnium should technically be " stiffer " but track racers rarely get out of the saddle and these marginal difference mean nothing to them . having owned octalink road , its a pain in the ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bb if you do go DA . Either or will work , i 'd take omniums for the price and ease of use . Also , GXP bottom brackets are easier to get your hands on these days and will be around for a little while longer . octalink is has been on its way out for years now and it basically only exists for track bikes and old shimano shit . <p> " And yeah , you 're completely right ! We would n't be able to tell the difference between the two , but that does n't really matter now does it ? Because the stiffer something is the less flex there is resulting in higher efficiency in power output NO MATTER WHAT LEVEL OF CYCLING YOU MAY BE IN . " <p> i understand the concept of stiffness being more efficient , but you wo n't find any evidence of actual power loss due to frame or bb flex anywhere . Most people might be able to get a slightly better out of the saddle acceleration with stiff bikes and cranks and shit . but like i said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding on tracks , and the aero disks and shit that the pros use are n't  very stiff anyway . especially compared to what you see sprinters on the road using .

You could whip skid that without even leaning forward . 48-16 is no good .. you 'll have one skid patch . If you ca n't skid on a 48-17 then do n't go 48-15 . I suggest stay with that gear ratio and keep working on your legs and your form . I started off with a 48-15 and moved to 48-17 just to see how it felt and it was super easy to whip skid on that ratio . Now I run 50-15 . Work on your legs . I think the gear ratio you have on now is fine . Just got work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city requires a lot of changes in speed so running a higher gear makes your life harder . Gearing down let 's you modulate your speed easier when you 're not skidding ( ie : most of the time ) . Skidding is just something you 're gon na have to practice . <p> Since cogs are cheaper than chainrings I 'd pick up a couple of cheapo $10 18T and 19T cogs . You might need a new chain to fit the larger cogs . Once you have a feel for your ideal ratio I 'd spring for a more skid-friendly 47T or 49T chainring. 
@@22054735 @2054735/ <p> I 'm kinda confused ... you said you 've done extensive research , and then your final question ends up being does it hold up ? not trying to come off like a dick or anything , just super confused since it seems like you 've looked into the frameset a good amount . aluminum would be your best bet if you 're gon na be riding in all condition material wise , imo . <p> ps , I feel like you could 've thrown this into your other post instead of starting a new thread . but idk ... <p> Aluminum frames are great " you do n't have to worry about rust protection , they 're stiffer that steel frames . The downside , they 're stiff and you 'll feel that on long bumpy rides . If your frame is tweaked in an accident , you ca n't repair it like a carbon or steel frame . <p> Regardless of my dislike of the CInelli 's they 're pretty ok . But , as I 've said in the past , I have specific needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be using this bike for everything except unclogging the sink . The Bolt will be able to handle it . I do n't know what your terrain is or road conditions are like for where you live so I 'm not any help with the steel vs Al . debate . <p> I will say that if you stick with Al. , there are a few other options that I would consider as some components are worth more investment and investigation than the frame ( GASP ! ) . There are people out there that think " just get it together and see what happens " " I get the feeling that these people are either trust-funders or have bikes that are poorly put together or do n't really ride as much as they think . I 've gone down that route and it sucks . You end up not wanting to do more than 10 miles on a bike that make be aesthetically appealing but not comfortable . <p> sorry , for the confusion and new post , but was hoping to get a bigger audience with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ... being there were mixed reviews everywhere ... it 's kinda like 50/50 ... and doing even more research than i have already done ( which i thought was plenty at first ) i started to see more negative than positive reviews ... ( more positive reviews when i first began my research ) ... maybe i 'm just reading and pulling out what i want to hear ... maybe i 'm getting cold feet as i approach dropping $850 on a frame ... <p> it 's tough dropping that kind of money on something you ca n't test or get a feel for , so all people really have is the internet to gather info ... <p> LBS 's in NYC are not helpful at all honestly ... although i like the store , the dudes at Chari &amp; Co are a little on the high horse/snobbery side .... one guy even told me to just go out and do research without a spits worth of help at all ... <p> trying to be more active on my own to gather more info and opinions here since it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cinelli in general ... <p> just looking for more positive/negative feed back based on why i want a cenilli bolt ... it seems to cover what i want/need it to do , but there are always people negating some of others claims/experience ... <p> people who own them are biased in thier reviews .... people who have extensive knowledge and experience in bike in general ca n't exactly be counted on since they do n't have one ... <p> would like to hear all kinds of peoples experiences with them and cinelli in general ... <p> it 's clearly an ' overpriced hipster ' trap that ' everyone and their moms ' have ... but is it a good frame for all those things i mentioned above ... ? or at least close ... <p> that 's all mang .... just a dude that want 's to drop his hard earned money on an overpriced hipster machine .... but i want it to be fully functional as well ... i 'm 34 ... not really into impressing people with my bike , but would also prefer not to be clowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly hypebeast/hipster shit , with a side of elitist attitude . <p> one thing that 's good about mash's/bolts is that they hold their resell value . well ... from what i see people selling them . even if they 've been used for a year or two people still tend to sell em around 750-800 , which blows my mind to be honest . but yeah , you could always resell it if you do n't end up liking it . <p> or if that much trouble , buy a used frameset if you find a decent deal or complete . or just buy a completely different bike and decide what you 're really trying to get from the bike and what you desire from riding . <p> I like steel , even for all conditions . yes you mayy spend an extra 10min. doing a good cleaning and wiping down on those grimie days but , it 's not a chore . <p> my " personal opinion " is if you can find a used fram in good condition ( alum. frame cinelli or such , then give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a couple of weeks ) , if then or if like now you have some strong doubts , then go steel , the flex in steel proves to be an advantage on city streets , especially since you 're NYC , I 'm chicago so I feel you on that note . yea there an extra 2lbs if you get a matching steel fork , but you could also get a carbon fork with a steel steerer so you still retain your strenghth but also get to shave some wieght. should n't be more than $500 together , and depending on the frame , it will be even less . that leaves $350 to add to the component buget if you wanted or it can go back into your pocket . and you get to sleep stright thru the night without second thoughts . <p> I 've riden all 3 frame materials for both track &amp; road cycling , and I 've concluded fo me light weight steel with a good carbon fork is where 's it at . again my personal opinion offered as a segestion . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you stenghths are in cycling , what 's your goal : cruising , sprinting , commuting , tricking , racing , spending most of your day in a coffeshop reading a nook while your bikes locked up out front on display ... etc . <p> Hey man , I understand your position as I went through kind the same thing when I was looking for my first crit-worthy road bike . <p> BTW , I 'm 39 and knowing that you 're around the same age and are wary of throwing hard-earned money at a bike reinforces why I think you are not going overboard on getting opinions and experiences . <p> Try before you buy That sucks to hear about your LBS " I know we have some shops around here ( SF ) that are the same . The thing that makes LBSs helpful is that they ( should ) be able to offer you a test ride on a build . A lot of these newer trackbike-based LBS 's do n't " which means it 'd be best to try out someone 's bike in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolts are fine , my buddy rides one and he loves it ! He does n't do long rides , but he does commute and occasionally tricks it . Opinions are opinions . But , the questions/facts that you should be looking into are : - Does the geometry work for you ( based on the size(s) you 're looking at ? - Are you comparing frames across brands ? When I 'm shopping for frames , I look at the geometries of frames from different manufacturers " not based on brand awareness . The frame should fit you " it should n't be about how cool the frame is because other people buy into the hype . - Does the price point match up with the expectations of the user and what the frame offers ? If Frame A is $900 and costs that much just because a team rides it and Frame B costs the same but the frame has history behind it , which makes more sense to consider ? - Most cyclists ( roadies , CX'rs , BMXers , tourers , ... ) end up selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and researching ... but the reality is , you never know what 's gon na happen after a few miles on a frame . <p> Alternatives I was in the same boat as you a few months ago " I was looking for a track frame and since it had been a few years since I even looked at any kind of frame I was lost in a sea of this person said this , this person said that . Oddly , I was originally settled on getting a Histogram or a Bolt . But the more I considered what I wanted out of this track build and started looking at things like prices , how they 're made , stiffness , ... trackie stuff , the more I strayed away from the Cinelli 's ( because they did n't satisfy my needs , not because they suck or anything like that ) . Of all the current frames ( and I mean ALL ) I looked at it came down to : - Low ( - new builder , not track-proven , wait times are 8-9 mos / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / + street &amp; track proven ) - Cinelli Histogram ( - heavy , not as stiff as a Super Pista / + pretty , easy to come by ) - Cinelli Bolt ( - heavy , not as stiff as a Super Pista / + pretty , easy to come by ) - Cervelo T1 ( - mid-range priced , not for street riding / + stiff , track-proven ) - Look AL 464 P ( - mid-range priced , not for street riding / + stiff , track-proven ) - Leader 725 ( - heavy , not as stiff as a Super Pista / + pretty , easy to come by ) - Argon 18 Electron ( - mid-range priced , not for street riding / + stiff , track-proven ) <p> The notes for each frame are based on my needs and opinions . But , they were n't based on if someone else rode them or not and that dumping a lot of money on a frame is not something I take lightly . <p> I do n't know if this actually will help you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame you choose . <p> You can possibly throw the Affinity Kissena into the mix . Have you ever considered it ? Definitely track proven and I 've seen people ride them on the street . Although it is harder to come by in used condition and may not have as good of a resell value as the Cinelli Mash . On the plus side , it 's around $100 less than the Cinelli Mash . <p> Stiff and durable frame and relatively light . Andrew LaCorte has told me several times about how the Affinity Kissena is the only frame that he 's been unable to crack and from what the other people at the track have been telling me , he has cracked a lot of frames like the Bianchi Pista Concept and what not . Granted we 're not all Cat 1 track cyclists but I s'pose it just goes to show how the Affinity Kissena holds its own in the aluminum category . <p> @Rdnt - love steel as well no doubt about it ... gon na put some proper parts on my san jose after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feels ( although i have no means of comparison ) , i love many of the steel bikes out there esp a lot of the vintage ones , but i wan na try aluminum ... i like the way they look too . not a matter of what 's better ... there is no doubt that when i start a new build , it will be steel for sure ... but thanks for your input ... i was a little discouraged reading some opinions with alu frames , but now i 'm okay with the pro/cons .... steel has pros/cons too ... but i get the whole ' steel is real ' stuff . <p> My san jose kicks ass ... one messenger/LBS mechanic said it was the best bike he ever had ... he got macked by a large truck and the hit fucked everything up ( including himself ) EXCEPT the san jose frame ... not a dent ! the frame actually was crushed under a giant tire ( he says ) ... he had pics to prove it ... his bike has since been stolen after recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it go ... it really is a fing tank and have been beating on it for about 7yrs and is a fun bike PERFECT for city riding ... esp now that i changed it up a bit with parts that i was hoping to put on a new build ... <p> so to answer @benson ... i just want a little change in my life mang ... a little bit more handling , stiffness , speed and of course different aesthetics ... how 's your Vig ? now considering the 2012 black . can you shoot me some feedback on your lady ? you live in nyc too ... how is it on our streets ? compared to the histo or bolt if you have ever ridden either and your pista concept ... which i am also considering . but i see so many of those ! only ever saw one bolt and it was locked up with 2,000 other bikes at the recent nyc bicycle film fest ... <p> @silly i 'd hop on that zeus pronto , but like i said ... will build a steel frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jose ... thanks for the post though ! <p> @solly affinity was one of the first bikes i noticed when i started thinking about building a new bike ... the kissena is just a little too loud for me ... it just seems like too much bike for me right now i like it a lot ( looks obviously ) but until i start hitting a track ( if/when ) it will be highly considered .... but in that case , i 'd almost be sure the porche like cervelo T1 would be my aim ... one day ... <p> anyhow , <p> @mustang ... thanks so much for the good words ... def have looked at and considered all the frames you listed ... but would never make a decision based on one guy 's forum advice ... however good ... even though low , look , leader might be good bikes as well ... i do n't love the way they look ... they all look cool ... and i 'm sure they are all solid frames ... but let 's all be honest ... just because Bike A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't like the aesthetics ... it 's kind of a turn off ... <p> i 've owned 3 different jeep wranglers ... there are like 5 different variationsof the same jeep ( models ) ... and you always want the one that has a little more AND looks better ... but you have to pay more ... i 'm okay with that ... as long as the performance is the same ... which is true for all . <p> i 'm gon na look more at geometry 's and learn fit more ... i think it 's worth knowing a bit more about it and making comparisons based on geo ... i 'm just a dunce right now ... i do n't really understand it yet ... <p> i 'm starting to see that there is sooooooo much cinelli hate out there ... it 's pretty ridiculous actually .

@@22054737 @2054737/ <h> Why such wide riser bars ? <p> I 've seen a lot of fixies with wide riser bars these days in the city and I 'm curious as to what the reason is behind this . It seems a bit strange since it 's more difficult to maneuver around cars and tight spots . Is there a reason behind the large wingspan ? <p> a wide riser is nice for climbing hills . Single speed mountain bikers have used wide bars for leverage way before the fixie fools inherited it . Like most things though - fixed gear riders think they 're always on the cutting edge of style and innovation . Its is a nice way to ride a fixed gear though . <p> also , maybe these are the smart fixed gear riders who have realized that being comfortable on their bikes and the ability to get up hills is more favorable to being able to squeeze through cars . ultra-narrow risers were always lame . <p> Wide risers are great for off-road , climbing and good control . Cut risers are great for flying through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars are great for commuting . Drop bars are great if it 's windy and for having multiple hand positions .

@@22054739 @2054739/ <h> Specialized AWOL 2015 ... Worth it ? -+ <p> I 've been basically riding shit bikes all of my lifetime . I started riding BMX when I was a 6 year old kid , then traded that for a shitty mountain bike when I was 14 , then traded that for an old rusted road bike , which was converted to fixed gear when I was 17 , which ive used since then , i 'm 21 now . I just moved to Mexico City , and its been amazing , it was almost impossible riding everywhere on a bicycle where I used to live , and now , it is extremely fun and challenging . I used to ride a motorcycle to move around and several short trips when I lived there , ( 2 months ago now ) and even though I miss riding my motorcycle a lot , transporting myself on a bicycle has turned out to be essential . Also , I work as a bicycle messenger now , and my fixed gear has been working fine . Now that I cycle much more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was thinking of buying my first new bike , and i 'm hoping this bike to last for at least another 10 years , with good , everyday , all day , rough use.The type of riding i 'm doing right now is basically for work ( carrying several small items , most of the times not that far ) transporting myself in the city ( sometimes 30km a day when going to several places ) night rides with a fixed gear club ( semi-endurance rides , maybe 30-40km/hr sustained most of the times , throughout the city , and therefore traffic jams , which also done at day ) some 100km rides on weekends , ( maybe twice a month only ) and ive been planning some short trips to small towns around the country , with camping along the way , mixed terrain sometimes . I enjoy riding fixed gear a lot and wont be quitting anytime soon , but I also feel like I need a more useful bike , which will hopefully make me a better rider . In that note , I also have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mental state throughout physical performance , then I should be getting instead of an all purpose bike , a good track bike , which could be used at the local velodrome ( which i 'd looove to ride but need a track bike for that ) and maybe the track bike could also work for those longer trips , also with camping and mixed terrain . I do understand its not designed for that but since my ugly old road bike converted fixed gear has worked decently for that , I assume it would be a lot better on a good track bike . <p> So , my goal here is to improve my performance , and to have a trustworthy machine that will allow me to get to strange places , and of course relaxed rides which I enjoy a lot as well . I have two considerations so far , ( which will be denoted in a bit ) but I also have certain restrictions , one of those is of course , the $ . My dad made me an offer to buy my motorcycle ( even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ) , which I have the chance to bring here but havent done that because ive been enjoying riding bicycle here and havent had the need to use my motorcycle so far , even though i do think it could be useful , despite of having to pay for gas , certaing government regulations , parking , storing and so on , for those short trips , it could possibly work as well . If i sell it to him , i will have enough money to spend on , either a good track bike , or an all purpose bike , or also , maybe other option would be better but have n't thought of that yet , hopefully I can get some assistance on that . <p> So , let 's say I do convince myself to sell my motorcycle , which is not an aaaamazing bike , but nor it is a bad bike ( it is exactly a reliable 2012 Yamaha FZ-16 , not extremely fast or beautiful as I would like , but it does the job , and does not require that much of maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's what i 'm trying to express ) and also Ive decided to use the $ on a good bike . My two considerations so far ( hopefully I can get assistance on this as well ) are : <p> Specialized AWOL 2015 <p> PROS Seems like it will last several years , looks decent , not that flashy , interesting gearing , possibility of belt driven system or internal gearing , width clearence for different tires , pannier , rack ready . Tested it the other day for a very little time , and felt good , hopefully it rides well on the stretch . If i get this , i think i 'd use it also for work , only sometimes i guess , since i think i could still use my present bike for that , of course transporting myself through the city and those longer rides , which do include mixed terrain , not that harsh , but the geometry looks that can take those paths without much of a hassle . <p> CONS Not the most equipped version of AWOLs , it would be the cheapest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 left in all Mexico . Sora groupset , which i 've understood its not The best , but also not the worst , still entry level it seems . But then again , i havent had a good decent bike in all of my riding days , so I think it would feel extremely fresh and comfortable for me . Another con : much heavier than it looks . Its a CroMo frame ( Reynolds tubing seems nice though ) but weighs around nearly 13kg , which is almost the weight of my current bike , but my bike does not have gears or brakes . I 'm not sure if that weight could work for my goal to " improve my performance " or maybe it will , considering how aluminum or carbon frames have not been around forever and ive seen people do magic on steel-not-so-light frames , -metaphorically speaking- ( or not ? ) but still , for the price and the " newness " of it , I was expecting a little weight difference . Going this route would mean , losing hope for me going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save up for a decent track bike ) but would mean also mean more comfort , and more chances of exploring . <p> My apparent second option is also from Specialized : <p> Specialized Langster 2016 <p> PROS Way more fast , meaning performance will be the objective set here , light as needed , not much additions needed , simple . I still think this bike could work for those longer than usual trips , maybe not that comfortable as the AWOL , or any other singlespeeded or road bike definitely , but way more challenging and fast . Possible entry to the local velodrome , and great for city riding i might assume . Have only participated in one alleycat on this city so far and definitely will be going to the following ones , this bike would be suitable for that . ( Really do n't want to brag but on that one I got way before lots of dudes who had good bikes , some of them might have been strictly posers but hopefully not the most of them , also the purpose of this apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me on achieving better places on these alleycats , which potentially means free stuff , hehe . ) <p> CONS No offroad riding . Not what i 'm super into at the moment but I do like going to trails sometimes , and there are some interesting places around here that would be cool to go and discover . Still not sure if track bikes work good for long distances , due to comfort and where to carry stuff , they 're simply not designed for it , unlike a road bike . But still , gears have not been at all times and even some Tour de France were all done on fixed gear bikes . <p> Of course there other ways to go on here , lots of options , one of those is simply just saving up for one of these bikes , without having to sell my motorcycle , or a cheaper bike , but , to be honest , that will happen in a much distant future considering how i 'm basically settling on this city , how impatient I am , and other interests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and since cycling is definitely a prioritized passion for me , I feel it as a necessity . Definitely there is a constant autorefutation to that , in which i 'm trapped on a consumist state , but sometimes , i daydream about it a lot it eventually bothers me . Still , I just want to take the better decision here , but i kind of need assistance on that . <p> 1st. you have to seriously cut down the blabbering . Your post would be 1/3 as long , even more comprehensible and much more inviting to read - as bicyclists tend to rather ride their bikes than read long posts ... <p> I think you 're facing a tough choice . When being such an all-round rider , it 's hard to boil it down to one specific choice . <p> It sounds like you have pretty strong legs when being able to push a 26lbs. conversion for 30-40km/h so i guess you would n't have a problem riding the Awol fast . I think , though , that you would benefit far more from finding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you should immediately strike belt-possibility and internal gears from your pros list . Not that those options are cons , they 're just not great . There is a reason , that since the belt-driven bike has been invented , it 's not been amazingly popular . And that 's because we have a pretty solid system going already ; the chain . Internal gears sucks in terms of power-transfer , and even though the rubber belt is great because of it 's ability to run unmaintained , just do n't do it . <p> Do you have a brake on your fixed gear ? <p> Even though I 'm personally very persistent when it comes to fixed gear bikes only being cool brakeless , I think in this situation it would be a good choice . That will allow you to do what I 'm suggesting next : <p> Buy a fixed gear bike - not necessarily the Langster - try to find a secondhand somewhere . I do n't know your bike sites where you 're located but there must exist some kind of community - especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the posers ' bikes for 1/2-1/3 of what he gave - let 's say a little less than the Langster but a bike twice the quality . That will furthermore ensure that you will be able to sell it for more than 1$ opposite the Langster , which will - as stock - be worth nothing when you 've ridden it for 3 years . <p> Then buy an extra wheelset . Preferably a strong flip flop kindathing . Then you can mount your strong wheels in the weekends and go sscx ( singlespeed-cross ) with a front brake or fixed gear cross or whatever you prefer . This will allow you to go see the countryside and also go fast in alleycats and 3rd look good while you 're doing it . <p> I have ridden my brakeless track bikes for up to 195kms. on a day w. an average around 27,5-28km/h. and have had no problems whatsoever . It 's definitely not a con to have gears but it 's more fun without - and you get hellamore street cred . <p> A fixed gear bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept properly , not give you too many unexpected unpleasant bills and repairs either , as there is only so much that can break . <p> The problem with belt drives are field repairs . No more just carrying a few spare links and you 're covered . If you break down on the Appalachian trail , and people are talking about how pretty your mouth is , you 're going to be glad to have a chain on you . Both in terms of striking tool and field repairs . <p> Next step is finding tires you can stow away whiskey with , or whatever your beverage of choice may be .

The last thing I want is for it to come apart while I 'm on the road . <p> Is there anyway I can test for cracks myself ? Or is it safer to just buy a new fork . ( Thinking about aluminium ) . <p> Most companies will do a visual inspection on it . Not sure if they will charge a fee but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dealer or reliable lbs . Carbon forks are stronger than steel when produced right so I would n't go and spend money unless you 're sure . <p> But we do n't live in a simple world , so depends on the crash .

Single-speed is cool and all , but I bought it with the goal of adding some gears . Ideally I want to turn it into a 1x10 . So I come to ya 'll looking for some recommendations on how best to set-up the drivetrain . My knowledge parts wise is pretty limited to track stuff , so any help with parts recommendations would be huge . Do 's and Don'ts would be helpful too , as I 'm kinda flying blind right now . <p> Hoping to do the conversion for $200 , but not really sure what parts are worth it to spend more on and where I can be cheap . So recommendations would be helpful . <p> do n't gots nothing ! Bike is set-up as a single speed , so I need to pick up a new rear wheel , rear derailler , shifter , new chain and new chainring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts . From browsing the sit I 'm seeing a lot of SRAM rival set-ups , but I 'm guessing that they just removed parts for their conversions . I 'm starting from nothing which is why I was curious what people who have done it before would recommend . <p> For instance , why a narrow wide chainring ? Does that eliminate the need for a chain guard/chain keeper ? <p> Another question . Would it just be easier to buy a new 105 wheel cassette &amp; derailluer , or are their used products that run cheaper and are comparable quality ? I 'm a noob with gears , so thanks a head of time for the help <p> It may be better/cheaper to buy a donar bike for the parts . You get all the parts you need . The shifter is it for a flat bar or road drops ? The dual control levers for drops are expensive . But check online . I have no idea on American prices . If using shimano , then 105 will be fine . Good quality . Even the step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next up from 105 but will cost more . Unless you find a great deal 2nd hand . I do n't know about sram except the spacing is the same as shimano . It 's good quality too . Because the bike will be a 1X10 you can use a short cage ( ? ) derailleur . Most road derailleurs are short . Which are easier to find . The long ones are for big spread clusters with 3 rings up front . Hope this helps you in the right direction . <p> The posts above lack a little detail and appear to be posted without much real world experience . <p> if you currently have a SS and need an affordable drive train then i 'd recommend apex shifter and a sram X7 RD and any narrow-wide ring . SRAM is really your best option for 1x. exact actuation compatibility between road shifters and mountain derailleurs make compatibility a no brainer . Also , Rival 1 ( the cx1 clutched RD , NOT rival 22 ) rear derailleusr can be had for not much more than the low end mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A 1x** setup with just a narrow-wide ring and no clutch RD should really have a chain guide . Shimano does n't have any clutched RD with road shifter compatible options ( besides XTR9070 Di2 ) .

I 've learned a lot just from checking out other peoples bikes . leaning towards just buying a new wheelset and starting out with some used stuff depending on price . that way I 'll be able to change the set up around as needed . <p> will the newer SRAM funtion well with a DT shifter or bar ends ? I 'm assuming yes but figured i 'd ask . I like to change my bars a bit which is why i 'm leaning towards DT shifter for the rear . <p> if your DT shifter is friction then it should work fine . If friction is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That being said , I like SRAM 's clutch a lot better . Keep in mine shifting on the downtube while riding off road though . More affordable , but with obvious ergonomic disadvantages . <p> bashguards are so chill for not replacing chainrings when riding rockier/taller conditions , and totally agree with the sram clutch it 's way ... clutch. downtube shifters off road give me the nervous sweats <p> DT shifters will not be permanent . Bike will mostly be an adventure/bad weather commuter/long distance bike for the winter , so DT shifters should suffice for now . Bar end shifters are also an option , but I agree that the DT shifter might make for a nice clean look . <p> So far it sounds like SRAM clutch RD is highly recommended and definitely some sort <p> Any wheel recommendations ?

My other option is to try and find some used CK hubs to some OP 's or similar rim for $100-$150 more than the Archtypes/Ultegra wheelset .

Since there is a larger contact area with the ground with 700x28 tires , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as opposed to 700x23 tires which have a smaller contact area . And the Gatorskins will last way longer than cheap tires . <p> Sorry to break it to everybody that says 28s last longer than 23s , but they will last the same amount of time . Area has no effect on friction . The force of friction ( F ) is equal to the coefficient of friction ( mu ) , multiplied by mass ( M ) and gravity ( g ) . The coefficient of friction of rubber on asphalt is roughly .9 ( when skidding , not rolling ) . There are no units for the CoF . Mass ( you and your bike ) is measured in kilograms and gravity is 9.8 meters/second2 . The units of force are Newtons . <p> So now you can figure out your specific force of friction while skidding . F= ( mu ) Mg <p> But anyway ... back to where I was . As you can see , there is no variable for area in the above equation , proving that area has no bearing on slowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man .

Ride that for a long distance and see how that feels . <p> A good start is to set your saddle 's forward postion ( fore/aft ) optimally " this would be based on the type of riding you 're doing on a particular bike .

I went clipless and have n't had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you could always try that if it 's bad . also try growing bigger as larger frames tend to have less overlap . <p> i love all the people that want super aggressive geo but no toe overlap . <p> as said : deal with it . unless you plan on getting a 50cm , cause crank overlap sounds awful . toe overlap is whatever , you learn to deal with it . do n't take granny turns and when you need to just think about where your feet are in relation to the tire , and whip those skids toward the side of your forward foot . poof ! no issues . <p> My kissena has hella overlap , but that never phased me , even went up to 170mm crank arms since 165mm were spinny so now I have another toe overlap . You 'll get used to it , true track bikes have toe overlap . You 'll get used to it to the point you wo n't notice it 's there , you 'll be ok . <p> Same here . My Giro has wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the overlap is not that pronounced . Using body English to shove the bike around helps quite a bit as well . That 's my 2-.

The Phil Wood is heavier than the Paul but the only reservation I may have with the Paul hubs is the rear hub has a 44mm fixed chain line which may be and issue ? Will that affect anything or make the chain noisy ? any insight would be much appreciated . <p> But as for the hubs ... You ca n't go wrong with either Phil or Paul . Or 7600 , for that matter .

@@22054782 @2054782/ <p> I would replace the crank set with the corresponding one on either bike . I 've been reading that the Veloce is comparable to a 105 , which shows the Campy tax ( I assume it 's comparable to the " Apple tax " , meaning I understand it 's worth paying more sometimes ) . My question is , what would I gain going with Campy ? Weight matters , but only after function . which shifts faster ? Which is more precise ? <p> My LBS does n't have either in stock for me to try . They just brought in Bianchi . <p> If I were you , I 'd try and see if they have one with 5800 before dropping another little chunk for 6800 . And I do n't recommend replacing the crankset so quickly until you put some miles on the bike and get a feel for other possible changes . Just my two cents <p> Also , shifting is different with campy in that there is a button where your thumb rests on the shifter to shift to a lower gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff is gon na have all shifting in the brake lever . Some say that campy shifting is awkward , but I think it 's awesome once you get used to it and the hoods are super comfy . Veloce is a lower tier groupset whereas 6800 is just behind their top tier ( DA ) . So 6800 would be above centaur . <p> I 've heard some people mention that concern , but I run chorus shifters with ergonovas and I have no issues reaching the thumb shifter . White is n't a bad color . And 5800 is a great value , especially now that it is 11 speed ... I feel like the bike as a whole would be a better buy than the veloce bike <p> I love Campagnolo 's thumb shifter , and its ability to dump a cassette . The rebuildable option is quite intriguing aswell . I 've never had to , but it is definitely a plus when you are spending a bit more dough on a group . <p> Anyways ... I 'd do 5800 ... due to cost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing about new 11 spd .... Shimano and Campagnolo can now work together . <p> Thanks guys . One more question ( for now ) ... I watched a YouTube vid of a guy comparing the Dura Ace shifting vs a higher end Campagnolo . The Shimano shifted on the second click ( when the lever came back to standard position ) , but the Campy shifted on the first click . Is this difference going to be the same between the Ultegra ( or 105 ) and the Veloce ? Unless there is something bad about the Veloce ( like mis shifts/sloppiness ) , this would be a decision maker ... 
@@22054783 @2054783/ <h> Ciocc frame authenticity <p> I bought a Ciocc frame from user Matango through the Marketplace forum ( thread : FS : FT Vintage CIOCC roadd bike ! !

I 've attached some pics below for review . In addition , I 'm also questioning the fork stamps . Everything else seems to check out . Thoughts ? <p> That missing C on the seat stay caps is hella weird . The bb cutout and the fork crown match my Designer 84 , but I find it hard to believe that something like that could make it out of the Ciocc workshop . <p> Hmm that is pretty strange .

It 's pretty glaring . <p> you know , this is all speculation on the part of a bunch of internet people who do n't know better . Pelizzoli obviously is still in the business , as is the Ciocc brand .

So I am looking to build my first fixie ( I am going to clases for bike building so I 'm not going to mess it up ! ) and I think I am going to get the Leader 721 . Now my question is what is the differece between the 2013 and the 2014 model . Is the newer model worth the extra $50 . Also it would be great if you guys also told me the main differences between the 721 and the 725 and whether I should get the 725 over the 721 . My uses for the bike will be commuting and traveling ( no track .. yet ) , about 10 miles a day nothing to much , but I do live in Oakland and there is alot of big hills to conquer . If you have any other suggestions for the frame feel fre to list it . My budget is about 1kish WITHOUT WHEELS OR TIRES OR TUBES I already got some as a gift . Thanks again guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be aware that you will have no resale value in your bike should you decide to sell it . I paid $350 for a fork last year and now the importer is dumping them on eBay for $275 ......... that 's just ONE example . Your best bet would be to look on eBay and see what the importer is dumping this week and get the best deal you can on it . <p> To actually answer your question ( as I did in your other thread ) , the 2013 Leader 721 was made of straight gauge 6000-series aluminum and the 2014 is made of double butted 7005 . Yes , it 's worth the extra 50 bucks . <p> thanks guys I think I am also going to go for a steel bike sonce oakland has some rough streets and I just rode my friends steel bike and it would very nice and handled great !

Yourself to ride or to please the masses and get lots of likes on FB . If it is for you to ride then build it and ride it . Do n't worry about weight . Really what 's a few hundred grams . Steel or alloy , you wo n't know the difference until you 've ridden both , a lot . Better components , there 's always better and then it 's down to brand preference . It does n't matter what you build now and how much you love it now because in time ( maybe 6 months ) you 'll want to change things around . But you do n't know until you start . So just build it and ride . You do n't have anything shite on your list if that 's what you 're worried about .

@@22054793 @2054793/ <h> Upcoming Pedal Room Marketplace Discussion <p> Hi all , It 's been a crazy past few months , but I 'm finally beginning to reign everything in with my life and get some stuff done . I 've been working on the marketplace off and on , but mostly I 've been working on stuff behind the scenes to get the site 's backend code up to date/good coding standards . That 's finally at a good spot , and I 'm going to be rolling out new stuff in the next few days . <p> As far as the marketplace , what would you guys like to see ? So far , it 's a forum-style marketplace with an integrated feedback system . User location is required to post , and there will be specific rules . <p> Specifically , I have a few questions : <p> 1 . What format works best for you guys ? A standard forum format for posting items for sale/wanted ? One idea I had was for users to check a checkbox if their bike is for sale and it shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure about that . I do n't like all the bikes with " for sale " in the title and would rather support a for-sale option ( that 's searchable ) . <p> 2 . How do you all feel we should control spam and people registering only to post their stuff in the marketplace ? I 'm particularly concerned about new people registering , selling things , and ripping members off . I also want to prevent commercial vendors from over-running the marketplace . Any good ideas here ? <p> 3 . Do you think prices should be required ? I hate seeing huge lists of parts for sale with " best offer " pricing , but maybe that 's just me . <p> If you 've got anything else to add , I 'd love to hear it . I 'm open to all ideas and will respond to everyone . I 'm excited to get this thing launched ! <p> Answer to Q2 : Do you have any friends or users in mind that are frequent user and you could make into a moderator to delete spam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the user needs to be a member for a certain amount of time ( like a month or something ) to sell . <p> Answer to Q3 : Prices should be required I hate making offers on parts unless it 's on ebay . <p> Just an idea you should have a disclaimer for the marketplace kind of like this " PedalRoom Management assumes no responsibility for any outcome resulting from the use of this service . " so users do n't hold you liable for botched transactions . You culd also encourage people to use paypal so both parties ( buyer and seller ) are protected . <p> 1 . I 'm personally not too educated in forum formats and all that stuff , but that checkbox idea sounds pretty cool and convenient . I was possibly thinking about a sub-forum for classifieds ( for sale ads ) ? just so there will be threads within this sub-forum for each item so that they 're separate and have their own respective discussions . just an idea though . oh ! and how about pages ? you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also feel that people should have to introduce themselves ! haha well , if more people agree about this ? and maybe a requirement of like 20 posts or something ? people should be coming in to join a community first , and not trying to find another place to make another dollar . I also agree on the moderators , just because there needs to be some clean up with some of the non-sense that comes up sometimes . and also to kind of keep the sense of community true within this site . <p> 3 . I personally feel that a price should be required . all someone really needs to do is say something like , " selling my giro atmos for $80 or shoot me an offer . " this gives people an idea of what they have to work with . whenever I see " make me an offer , " all I really wan na do is low ball them hard ... and I 'm sure this is in everyone 's mind too . <p> lastly , just wan na thank you on making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is one of my favorite and most visited sites . it 's a lot more interactive and aesthetically leasing compared o other cycling sites .

I 've used Grease before and noticed that my BB Cups will be loose after several weeks . Some people use Anti-Seize .

If you do n't have one , I 'm sure your local bike shop can provide you with that service . If it STILL loosens after being tightened to the correct specs , then you have a problem . <p> A thread locker may be used when the frame shell is steel and the cups are either aluminum or steel lockrings . A mild thread locking compound such as Loctite- #242 that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the parts are removable with normal tools , without taking extreme measures .

Even if lockrings are steel , use anti-seize . Anti-seize is available at some bicycle stores , hardware stores , or automotive parts stores . Grease can be used in place of anti-seize , but anti-seize is more durable and provides better lubrication during tightening . Apply this only to the threads . <p> So I guess the answer is if you have it ... might as well use it .

Oh and the blue dot caps will be under male caps , do n't get female caps for this kind of can . <p> Just some tips : this kind of artists paint is really really rich in pigment , this makes for really opaque well covering paint but the pigments settle to the bottom of the can over time , so when you get it , shake it really well for at least a couple minutes after you loosen up the rattle balls which will probably take a minute or so on top of that .

When you 're done with each coat hold the can upside down aimed away from anything important and spray until no color comes out to clear the cap and keep it from clogging , which is very possible with soft spraying caps like the blue dot , but since the minimum you can order is ten caps at a time and they 're only like thirty cents each it really wont be a big deal if you clog a couple . <p> And if you want the paint to stick even better , try and get some Belton brand primer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipping charges will probably be ridiculous if you can find any , being that it will probably be coming from Germany , but if you 're a serious perfectionist it 'll be worth it .

I 've been offered a Caad 10 in a trade and was curious what you thought it would be worth and if it was a good option for someone new to " pure " road biking . Last road bike that I road regularly was in college and had friction shifting , so new road bikes are completely new to me . Bike would basically become my full-time spandex bike for long/group/exercise/etc. rides . Currently my fixed gear has been pulling double duty . <p> It 's a Caad 10 frame with a 105 groupset .

I have no idea if the crankset is an upgrade vs stock Caad stuff , same with the wheelset . I like compact drops but never considered carbon worth the price , will i notice a difference ? Finally what do you think it 's worth ? I see Caad 10 's going for $800-$1200 on CL in SF , where on that spectrum do you think this would fall ? <p> Thanks for any info/advice/tips that ya 'll can provide . Trying to make a smart informed decision because I could use the cash but I do n't want to pass up a good trade possibility . <p> A CAAD10 is a GREAT bike all around , whether its for beginners or even full time racers .

I do n't  want to bored you with a long answer but overall , its a great bike and if you had to commit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thousands of miles , this would be the one ! <p> This is an opportunity for you to find a new type of cycling you enjoy ! Building up a road bike was super worth it for me , I love road cycling because of it , and have n't lost any interest in riding fixed , it 's a totally different experience . <p> 105 is a fantastic groupset , IMO the best bang for your buck road group on the market . I think modern shifting is miles more fun to ride with than friction shifting , less to think about = more brain power to spend on enjoying the ride and performing well on rides . It 's not at all unusual for shimano or sram groups to come with fsa cranks , brakes , etc especially oem , but you may be able to get them aftermarket , but if not it 's not a problem anyway , they 're comletely compatible and fsa makes great road cranks . I 've never ridden a caad but I hear great things . Overall this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were likely stock . most of the cannonades come with fsa cranks because shimano does n't make a bb/pf30 crank , and cannondale invented the 30mm standard so they wo n't compromise . also the FSA allows them to bring prices down . its not a bad crank , just heavy . it looks like this bike was pieced together ( besides the cranks ) . it has an older paint scheme but newer parts . definitely looks like a nice bike . if the frame is in good shape , its serviced , and things like chain , brakes , bearings , and tires are in good condition , its probably worth up toward 1200 , depending on where you 're selling and who 's buying . if its a trade , and you think that sounds fair than go for it ! i love my caad and they do n't have a cult-like following for nothing . <p> first off , thanks for all of the info and tips guys .

I asked for a little cash on top and he said he did n't want to go that far . Completely understandable . <p> the search for a local buyer continues .

If so , most companies apply decals after the carbon part has been removed from the mold and preped for the decals/paint , then clear coated uniformly so decal/paint is protected .

Depending on what kind of racing you are doing , I would say you would n't need a disk cover . <p> Disc covers are cool , and they are pretty aerodynamic , but do n't  expect to go from losing races to winning them just because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot and getting very strong and competitive , then you can think about it . Also , the cover has to fit well , if its not a flush fit to your rim and wheel , than its not helping . it could even be hurting . the aerojackets on wheel builder seem to be the most legit. theyve actually done testing . <p> I do n't  know what kind of discs you guys ride , but my HED is super stiff , just as my Zipp disc that I had was . The HED is basically a stinger or jet 9 with aero covers on it . You get the most performance from a heavier disc . Once you get that weight moving you just carry it through your passes . Its an ability to get that momentum that really pays off . I only race my disc on longer events where I can take advantage of the aero from it , and keep the momentum of the rear wheel . On shorter events and sprints I will run only my Stinger 9 in the front . It comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disc worth riding . If you have the ability to try the covers at a reasonable cheap cost , and your not throwing away money that you could be putting towards a better wheelset , the hell , go for it , try them out , let us know what you think . <p> Yes the hed is stiff because it is basically a normal spoked wheel with a cover . but in general , spokes make a stiffer wheel . And hed and Zipp are both very high quality discs , so they ride very well . We were just explaining to him how a disc is for an aero advantage not for any increased stiffness over a spoked wheel . <p> Gotcha , my bad man , I was n't meaning to step on any toes , just trying to figure what kind of discs you were referring to . Just a little food for thought . I rarely ride my disc , its great to have when you hit higher levels of CAT racing , kinda like a extra tool in your toolbox . A solid set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a lot more bang for your buck out of them . I run the campagnolo record pista hubs . They are buttery smooth , laced them up to a deep-v .

I do n't mean to be racist nor offensive here but I hope someone knows what point I 'm trying to get at . <p> I 've always wondered how they manage to afford such expensive nice builds as well . But in the end they 're actually riding it and having fun , so it does n't really matter .

I think everybody here has seen that profile of all the tarcking builds with the converted BMC time machine and the Merckx .. makes me want to blind myself . <p> The actuality is that they ( most people in asian countries ) do n't have the same living overhead we do in the US ( which compared to most of the rest of the world is too much ) .

Such as Cinelli 's distributor in CA charges roughly over $600 for a histo frame while they 're being sold for around 900 .

Then again , I keep flipping my bikes . So I have n't spent much money on a bike in a long time . If its a mom/pops thing , that 's cool .

I have this crack line on the side of the tri spoke , and its probably about 4 inches long , and like a millimeter in width . Should i be worried about this ? I 've bounced the wheel to hear if there was any noise but i do n't  hear anything . I 've rode the wheel for about 10 miles yesterday and it does n't  show any sign of damage , and the previous owner has been riding on rim before and he said it has n't  had any problems . So basically should i dispose of the rim , or continue using it and possibly getting it repaired later on ? <p> Wow ! That will fail , when ? Who knows . You have a tyre on the other side with 110psi or more forcing that rim open . That is if it 's a clincher . But what will you be doing when it fails ? Walking out the house , rolling down the drive . Maybe on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill . Are you prepared to take that risk ? If it goes at speed you 're going to have a big crash that you could have avoided . Or you could be pumping up your tyre and it let 's go then . Your call . <p> Yea i bought it with the crack already there . Honestly it was only 20 bucks -- . Aha i bought a carbon HED 60mm rim for 120 and i traded it away for this tri and 100 bucks on the buyers part . So it was a deal i couldnt pass . And YES ! ! ! I will get it repaired soon ! Do you guys know any shops in the bay area or anyone that could possibly do the repairs on this ? <p> Dude . I hate to say this but you got majorly ripped off . Yeah , you may have only payed $20 , but you 're probably going to pay as much as you bought the 60mm HED for , if not more ( not 100% sure on what it costs to fix carbon cracks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you $100 bucks on top of the wheel because it had that crack .

Ha ha ha . Guaranteed , as long as I do n't crack it open . That 's not a guarantee . Construction with CF is one thing but to repair it is another . A cracked frame is more simple in that you can wrap around with new sheets . But a rim , I do n't know . Fill the crack with resin , and that 's not doing anything . Put new layers on it . Then your wheel is not balanced anymore . It has more material ( CF and resin ) on one side . Do n't bother . Hang the wheel on the wall in the shed and put the money towards a new wheel .

Has anyone ordered from this website ? I 'm about to order from them and want to know if it 's legit and how long shipping usually takes ( US ) . <p> Thanks for the replies . Kinda bummed if it will truly take that long to ship though . It seems like everyone online is sold out of the gold medal pro cog . And if they do have it , it 's a little overpriced . If anyone has suggestions for sites with fair prices on higher end components , please share . <p> what will you need that gold eai cog for ? LOL that 's totally unnecessary . it 's only good for as long as the tini coating lasts , which is n't too long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since not a ton of mileage will go onto it . you 'd be much happier with a much less expensive stainless steel cog in the long run imo but it is your money so w/e .. just check at a nearby EAI dealer and they 'll be able to order a gold eai cog for you <p> I agree with you completely , but I 'm simply talking about the coating issue with the cog and nothing about strength validation of NJS products . I 'm not interested in the ceramic bb by the way ... I just wanted to know if anyone knew anything/has had experience with it . <p> How is the gold medal pro a waste of money though , honestly ? Even if it is for street use ? I mean , the coating is supposed to " double the life " of the cog ... so is n't that enough to justify the price ? <p> From the gold medal cog , you 'll get " perfect threads , roundness , concentricity , and tooth profiles " right off the bat , which generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has been worn down a bit . The coating does cause the cog to last longer than a standard cog , but at the price of $110 + shipping , it just does n't make any sense to get one for the street . With that price you could go with 3 Dura Ace cogs , which are also NJS stamped and would last longer than 2 of those gold medal cogs . Obviously if a $40 cog can work for NJS riders , i 'm sure that they can work for anyone else . It 's just , in my opinion , not worth the money . <p> I mean of course the cog will still be rideable after the coating wears , but the whole point of that cog is to have that coating on it to make a smoother drivetrain . Afterwards it just becomes like any other stainless steel cog . You want to preserve that coating for race situations only since on the street , it really wo n't do you any good . <p> Want smooth ? Go 3/32 : P To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a cog . Coating or no coating the chain will go before the cog . I 'd be more worried about getting a nicer chain that wont stretch out on you before a coated cog . <p> Mktng - That 's why I 'm looking into the Izumi V Brembilla - I see your point about the cog , and when it 's appropriate for use . But do n't you think it will take a lot time and mileage for the coat to wear off ? ( Hence , the " double " aspect ) <p> The Gold Medal is a Super Star with coating . I mean I 'm sure that it 'll take awhile to wear off , but like mktng said , even a non coated cog takes FOREVER to wear down . It seems that my DA cog is barely touched after being used for half a year . All I 'm saying is that you 'd be saving money to go with a cog that does n't have as much " premium " to it . You wo n't feel or see the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a few thousand miles . <p> Also , the problem with TiN coating is that because it is so hard , it will wear down your chain faster and cause a noisier drivetrain . The Super Star would be more refined since there is no coating on it , and in result would actually give you a longer lasting drivetrain since there 's no TiN eating your chain up . <p> Tracksupermarket is a great company . They ship fast and keep you up to date with your shipped item . It took me a week to receive an item from them , it came by air . Much faster than ordering anything state side . I personally suggest getting a regular bottom bracket . Ceramic tends to wear quickly .

Godzilla <p> Hello Everyone , <p> So i have been going over the idea of getting a steel frame and have decided to go with a EAI / Toyo Frame and its either going to be a Bareknuckle or Godzilla . Its a 100 dollar difference and cant decide whether or not to upgrade and get the godzilla . <p> As a certified EAI dealer , I can assure you the Godzilla does not come with a threaded fork . <p> I personally ride a Bare Knuckle and love it . The Godzilla is made of slightly nicer , smaller diameter tubing and is a little lighter but wo n't be as durable as the BK in the long run . The BK was basically designed to be the " street " version on the Godzilla and will withstand much more everyday abuse . <p> that gives me all the info i wanted to hear ... truly the main reason i wanted a Godzilla over a BK was because someone told be the paint on the BK was notorious for chipping and flaking instantly while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but considering paint is just paint and its going to be ridden on the street anyways might as well go with the BK . <p> heck it will be have to battle the elements of my closest until my leg heels , stupid drunk drivers .... <p> There are many different grades of cro-mo tubing and higher grade steel is n't necessarily " more durable " . The walls of the tubing used on the main triangle of Godzilla are much thinner than those on the BK - making it much more susceptible to dents and dings . <p> I ride my Bareknuckle almost every day to commute to school/ work . Even when I go on rides I 'm pushing with that bike . It has all of the basics when it comes to sizing and it 's very convenient when finding components . 1 1/8 head tube for most of the headset you can find , as well as 27.2 seat post diameter , drilled for brakes , and has an English threaded bottom bracket . There are other bikes that have the same measurements and what not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COM 12.5 double butted cro-moly and is grand all around . <p> Because who does n't like Italian bicycles ? Or anything that is Italian and bike related . <p> I would n't go so far as to say the BK is " better " than the Godzilla but - as posted by Rushing above - it 's everything you 'll ever need and nothing you do n't when it comes to a track frame you 'll be riding on the street . <p> Another thing to take into consideration is that the ' Zilla really is n't recommended for riders weighing more than 165-170 lbs ( if that even applies to you ) , which I heard directly from a source at EAI . <p> Because as I 've already said , the tubes are n't as big and the walls of that tubing is n't as thick . <p> NJS frames have rider weight limits as well so it 's not as preposterous as some people think ( Keirin racers are n't 230 lb cheeseburger-eating American kids beating the shit out of their bikes on the street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface in a controlled environment ) . <p> The BK has oversized down and top tubes and as far as I know , there is no rider weight limit .

@@22054828 @2054828/ <h> Chinese carbon tri spokes , 5 spokes and discs <p> There is definitely an issue before cyclists these days regarding the market for what are frequently referred to as " full carbon " wheels and wheelsets in other words wheels constructed of only carbon , without spokes . It 's becoming an issue because carbon wheels have been traditionally so expensive . For example the FFWDs , Mavics , Corimas et . al are priced into the stratosphere but today products are appearing from the far east that are filling the market as an economical alternative . Question is : what 's out there and how does it measure up ? I have experience with a few of these wheels and I 'm looking forward to trading information about the experience . <p> No one needs full carbon wheels , stems , bars , seatpost , if your going to be riding a fixed gear on the road . I do n't understand what the hype is on carbon , STEEL IS REAL imo . I wish I had money to blow on bike parts that cost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What I 'm trying to achieve here is a discussion among those of us who already own carbon from China not so much of a pros and cons of carbon . Sure money is an issue and if you love steel then cool . Fact is , some people still want carbon . It definitely behaves differently and IMO better . It looks cool , IMO cooler than spokes . It seems to make sense pairing carbon with carbon ... that 's all . Personally , I do n't see myself putting a lot of carbon on a steel frame anyway so I agree with that . <p> For starters I own a couple trispoke carbon wheelsets . Each manufacturer claims different materials and I feel that 's also reflected in the performance . Feel free to ask me what I have , what it 's like and what I 've found out . <p> I bought OEM profile design mold handlebars from out East . Perfectly matching my profile design cobra wings , at a fraction of cost . I prefer to find used carbon or damaged carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get pretty decent quality . Reading scrodzillas reply to that thread I would be cautious though . Carbon is way overpriced , but I still fancy it if the price is right . Also , makes no sense to spend a ton of money of high end bike equipment if you do n't ride seriously , IMO . <p> the cheap carbon wheels do n't really compare to the expensive stuff . The only real advantage i see is being able to run a deep carbon wheel in a tt application for pretty cheap . But as far as a comparison , the china wheels do n't have very innovative rim shapes , so your aerodynamics are a direct result of wheel depth ; in terms of weight , you might as well just get alloy clinchers cuz pretty much every china carbon wheel is heavy as shit ( even the tubulars ) ; Brake performance on the china carbon sucks in comparison to modern brand name carbon wheels . In summary , maybe a deep wheel for a tt , anything else , you might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stan 's Alpha wheels in any road race application . Rim weight is 385 grams , just throw some nice tires on and they work well . <p> Many people bring up the issue of product liability giving a sense that there is an ACTUAL issue with reliability and the Chinese products . In most cases , product failures are going to be discovered before downhill catastrophes . What needs to be established is whether there is in fact any serious quality issue at all . Some far east makers are offering 2 year warranties . I worry a lot more about hitting a dog than a wheel disintegration because at least I can probably spot or hear a defect on the equipment but I ca n't fully prevent bad luck . I understand , people feel " peace of mind " with an expensive product but what 's real and what 's illusory ? Anyway , what 's the difference between a Mavic ( mispoke Corima previously ) 5 spoke track front wheel for $5000 and a Karbona prototype for $400 ? Just how is it all justified ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports of carbon clincher rims blowing up under hard braking , but that 's neither here nor there . Over all build quality and performance are another , the difference is they use shittier carbon , so the wheel must be over built to withstand the same stresses , hence the LARGE weight disadvantage , and there rim profiles are very old school and offer far less aero dynamic advantage than modern wheels . in the case of the corima , we must start by reminding ourselves that the corima 4-spoke wheel is n't very popular . which as a starting point tell us , that aybe the 4-spoke design is not to be desired in the first place . however , if the china companies are making the exact same wheel shape ( which i doubt ) than there is no aerodynamic advantage to the corima vs the china . However , the china is heavier . <p> but if you 're looking for justification , look outside of the minuscule market for track front wheels . The majority of the people on this site with crazy front carbon wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even race . however , in terms of true performance and desirability and justification for spending huge amount on carbon wheels , go ride kungfupanda carbon clinchers , then go ride of comparabe depth enve see tubulars , and you 'll discover night and day differences . and the market for reasonable depth , spoked wheels is much larger than non-spoked aero front track wheels ; the corima in particular . Some pros ride it because they 're sponsored , other than that , fuck it . As a person that races , i 'd much rather save for a long time to buy something that i truly know is gon na give me better race day performance , than buy a cheap carbon wheels which has negligible performance advantages , without the reliability of my brand name alloy training wheels . <p> Never buy a Chinese disc ( i believe it was the matrix branded one ) ! I owned one and the disc flexed like a mother fu .... I can literally push the side of the disc to touch my seat stay on my old Cervelo T1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 900 instead . 
@@22054829 @2054829/ <h> Specialized Langster pro Vs Felt TK3 Help <p> Hey guys , I 'm pretty new to the bike community especially when it comes down to track bikes . I am making the move from road bike to track bike this spring and i have gone through i few options narrowing it down to two choices . One the Specialized Langster Pro 2014 , which i completely adore the other Felt TK3 and pretty nice bike to start of with . Now if you asked anyone to choose between the two it would be a easy vote for the Specialized(SLP) which is undoubtedly the better bike IMO . Here is where there the problem comes to play . I live in Brooklyn NYC not the friendliest place to ride a track bike . I will have to change the fork and front wheel on the SLP to add a front brake for safety adding another $500 or more . Where as the felt come with a fork drilled for brakes . I 'm estimating the total built for the SLP to be around $2200 where as the felt can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really worth an extra $1200 to get the SLP . Thanks for the help guys . <p> where are you getting your $500 figure from ? Is that the price for a new fork , brake , and wheel ? If so , maybe you would be better off finding a shop that can customize one of these frames in house . If you 're really up for swapping parts out you could always sell them and get some cash back . <p> thanks for the replies guys . sorry for posting in the wrong section new to the forum . I pretty much made up the $500 price , after a few hours on here and ebay i 've raised my limit a bit . looking into either some used zipp 404 , easton ec90 in the $350-500 range with maybe a leader I806 carbon fork . I 've also seen a few aero spokes around my area for $300 . What yould you all recommend . Dive on in to the sport full force with the langster pro which i 'm in love with or slowly build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For $350-500 you 'll find only a single wheel used EC90 or 404 . Unless you 're talking super ancient , 10-15 year old Zipps , the going rate for a nice set of used 404 tracks is $700-1200 ( I bought some nice used 404s and this is my experience . ) <p> If you 're going to spend over $2200 , do n't get a Specialized . Those do n't hold their value as well as some less ubiquitous brands . If you 're new to the track bike scene , do n't try to jump in with a huge high end build . Get something cheaper like the Felt and then when you realize that your tastes have changed 6 months or a year in , you wo n't have dropped $2500 on something that you no longer like . This was my strategy , and after having a $200 beater , $800 steel Bianchi Pista , and $2000 Bianchi Super Pista over the course of 2.5 years , I really know what I like and have no problem dropping the money for Zipps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for the help . I 'm really feeling the points you are making , and the sensible side of me completely agrees . Take the time spend a little cash , feel things out and then over a period of time take the dive on in once I am well read and knowledgeable . I can get the felt TK3 complete for $650 , the fork on it i already drilled and i 'm assuming if the company saw fit to sell it with fork pre drilled the wheels may actually be machined ready for breaks . If not I found some of EC90s of here for $400 and a new one on amazon for $522 have no issue spending that money for the front wheel . Now on to the mad side of me ; tracked down a few stores locally that still have the black on black SLP from 2013 hopefully when i go in since tey are having sale on 2013 models i can work something out maybe $200 off the SLP . The bike is perfect as is to me , but to add front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EC90s with matching fork adds $700 to the build also looking into 3T Scatto drop bars , going to spend might as well go all out . you guys know a lot , what 's your input on a mad mans ' plans <p> sounds like you have your mind made up . and the advice kinda went over your head . hah <p> good luck with whatever you go with . I do agree with Mitch though . I do n't suggest you drop a large amount of money on your first bike or whatever ... especially when it 's aesthetics . at the very least you should skip on the " aero " wheels and scatto bars . those are really expensive bars and you still do n't know what 's comfortable to you <p> Lol thanks a lot guys . I have two weeks before I can make the purchase so plenty of time to heed the advice you guys have given . It would be a lot easier if the shop around me had the tk3 built so I could ride it and feel the fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end idk what i will do but you guys will surely know what I end up doing only a few hours on this forum and I 'm liking the vibe here . <p> Scattos are more about the bling than anything else . I have only ever seen them on the track and still the people with them admit that they 're not any better than a good pair of Nittos or similar . But if it makes you happy ... <p> Especially with the bars , I have gone through a lot of them in order to determine what size I like . Over the last two years on my road and track bikes I 've used 165 , 170 , 172.5 , and 175 mm cranks , and 38 , 40 , 42 , and 44 cm bars . If I paid $200 for every set of bars and $300 for every set of cranks I 'd feel way worse about it than I do . So there 's something to be said for that also . In the end I run 170s on everything , 38 cm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know is to try and you 'll be super sad if your $300 Scattos are n't everything you want them to be . <p> I 'm sure you can just drill the Specialized fork . If it has an aluminum steerer , then the crown is also Al and the blades are carbon . You 'd be fine just drilling the fork , or having a shop do it for you ( drill press is best , not hand drill ) . The Specialized fork is n't worth millions so drilling it would n't be a crime really . <p> Just saw that EC90 you were talking about . Consider waiting for a set of EC90 TKOs for the track hubs if you want to go down that route . If you 're spending $400 for one wheel or $800 for a set , consider that I paid less for my Zipp 404 track set and that included tires ( $100 Conti tubulars ) and a DA cog . <p> Also , if you 're new to tubulars , have a long think about whether you 're ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having and carrying a spare tubular , and all that . I ended up buying a spare Conti Sprinter which was n't insignificant and the carbon brake pads ( Swisstop ) are are thing you need to get also . <p> I learned by lurking forums , watching videos , asking my friends with more mechanic and riding experience , and by owning a bunch of less expensive bikes and working on them . I slowly tackled learning about different parts of bikes , starting with things like tires , wheels , changing cranks , etc . The last things I really dug into to learn about how to work on them were bottom brackets , headsets , and hubs . Playing with loose ball bearings can be daunting at first but it 's a lot of fun . I just cleaned out my brother 's Suntour Superbe Pro track hubs today ( early model , 24h high flange loose ball cup-and-cone hubs ) . Took all of 30 mins to clean , regrease , and adjust them back to spinning like new . <p> A big thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unwillingness to progress . Everyone jumps straight to the most expensive aero looking stuff without starting off simple and researching/learning as you go . Bikes are amazing things to me , and I see them as an extension of myself ... so it 's bothersome to see some people not wanting to put in effort into them . <p> My advice : research ! Not trying to shy you away from the forum , but there already is a lot of rich information out there ... maybe better than you can find here . The way I go about it is : I look up whatever I 'm trying to figure out and read through at least 10-20 threads from various forums just so I can get all kinds of perspectives and then condense them into my mind . This is a lot quicker and a lot more fulfilling than having to wait for someone to respond to your question or having to witness arguments or sarcastic comments being posted all because you 're trying to learn a thing or two . <p> I understand how you feel bro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of time researching parts and materials , but I value others opinions . It 's a bike forum I expect people to be cool enough to kick some knowledge and bounce ideas , everyone was new at one point , went through a lot of the things I 'm dealing with so I like seeing how there journey went . As I said I 'm new to the track side and investing into my ride but I 'm not new to riding I love it and I 'm just getting started , my journey may just start a bit different than most and hopefully include a lot of you dudes from the forum . Bikes are a thing of passion , we do it because we love it , do what ever choices I make at the end of the day will be based on how I 'm feeling and not to have something expensive or cool looking etc .

@@22054835 @2054835/ <h> Am I the only one who thinks modern road bike frames are hidious ? <p> When ever i look at newer road bikes i think that the upwards slanting top tube and the bulbous shape is extremely ugly . Its a bigger reason than i 'd like to admit for riding track frames ( in addition to price , simplicity and cost effectiveness ) . <p> There are reasons why they are built the way they are . The whole point for having a massive head tube or tapered forks is to create some stiffness and more control . sloping top tube towards the rear sort of creates the same effect . It allows the bike to have a stiff wheel base . You will see this among some track bikes . Another reason as to why they are built the way they are is due to using light weight materials , but having to expand the range of them to make it work . This also applies to some track frames like the Cinelli Vigorelli . Made of aluminum and has certain sections shaped to allow it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.5-&gt;1.125 tapered steerer was AMAZING . It really does make a difference . Once you stiffen up the steering assembly ( fork , stem , bars ) , you need to reinforce the front end of the frame 's main triangle .

While you have to put the material there , a lot of companies take the opportunity to make that section more aerodynamic , further increasing surface area in the side profile . <p> some frame re just ruined by graphics .

Those Colossi frames are both about $1,200 MSRP and are both pretty aggressive and will be really uncomfortable for riding on the street . <p> If you 're just getting into riding fixed you should probably start with a steel frame , and keep it cheap cause you may not even end up liking it , Pake Rum Runner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cheap starter bikes that are going to be better for entry level riders . There 's no sense in blowing a bunch of money on an uncomfortable aluminum frame that you 're going to end up hating because it 's uncomfortable and therefore no fun to ride , and in three months you 'll figure out just how ridiculous it was to buy some burly aggressive frameset , that you built all wrong for what you actually use it for , and end up scrapping it for a more sensible steel frame build . <p> I agree on the steel frame . I have a Mercier Kilo TT and I love it . The steel is super durable and will easily last you long enough to figure out exactly what you want in a fixed gear/ single speed bike . I , too , would recommend the Kilo or the Pake Rum Runner . Depending on what size you ride , you can still find Kilo framesets for 199 or complete bikes for 399 . <p> i 'd much prefer to ride any of those steel frame he listed than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you have the know-how and tools to work on it . and even when you do , you still will be worried about something . those alloy frame are gon na dent on bike racks , and gon na ride like junk . also , knock around bikes are wayyyy more fun , and not any less fast . and i think they look way better too . the aero tubing snap-back age is awful . stay away from hype , its a waste of money . <p> If I were you I 'd sell the purefix on craiglist , and get a Kilo TT complete . If you like the way your purefix feels in terms of fit , measure the top-tube and get a Kilo with the same size top-tube or close to it from bikesdirect , they have the measurements near the bottom of the web page there . Then over time , upgrade components when you figure out what you need from them . <p> Steel is real ! haha IMO . I 've only had steel frames , the only problem with that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a near new Rum Runner frame off eBay for less than 2 hundred with a headset , I already had the parts others than a hubs , so I paid a little extra for a rear Hb7600 .

The main concern of mine for bcd would be because certain chain rings only come in a certain bcd , but both 75 's and omniums are both 144 so that is n't really a factor . The length of crank arm is also personal preference , but longer crank arms means more leverage , but it could also affect things like toe overlap , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit more because I have a smaller inseam for my legs and I feel I get a better aero position for my drops .

However , both cranksets are relatively similar and you wo n't notice the difference that much if you 're just riding on the street . Although the sealed bearings on the bb that comes with the omniums would require less maintenance if you 're planning on riding in the rain frequently . If you 're riding seriously on the track , then I 'd say go for the omniums or even the dura ace 7710 which are stiffer . <p> It really boils down to aesthetics and what looks better on your bike if you 're just riding around on the streets .

Du n no if that makes any sense ... hahaha <p> I have both cranks and two things that I 'd factor in are fit and ease of installation/maintenance . I found ( as others have ) that Omniums ( some , not all ) have had some quality control issues with spider size consistency and clearing the chainstay on certain frames . The spider on my set had clearance issues on the Kagero so I ended up using 75 's without any issues . I 'm no mechanic by any means and have limited tools on hand . That being said , Omnium install is a breeze . This also makes for easier maintenance when the time comes . Either way , they are both great performance and appearance-wise !

The stock Mercier Kilo fork has a 28mm rake , I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that 's going to cost more than a fork . Retrogression has affordable steel forks that work fine , as do a million other places on the web . A new fork is the safer , smarter way to go . <p> Because I have personally seen so many Kilo TT forks with varying ( you may need to look that one up too ) rake and clearance , you very well may end up with a fork that is n't even close to your original one . <p> Will you feel the difference ? Never in a million years but visually - which will probably keep you awake at night because you seem to be more into what your bike looks like than how it functions - it may end up being different . <p> scrod is right . your frame size will determine what fork to buy .

Help : ) <p> There you can look at the TT lengths and get an idea of what is a better fit . It seems that the 53cm Histo has a horziontal TT legnth ( T1 ) of 530mm . If you are saying 54cm is ideal for you , then the 53cm Histo looks like a good fit TT wise . Note that the STA will probably be higher on your NJS than the Mash , so perhaps expect to be set more forward on the bike than your NJS . There really does n't seem to be an evidence from the geo chart that Mash frames " run big " , but I have never ridden one - I have only researched them a lot because I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll only look pursuit , and not actually feel like one ( note this is different than just having an aggressive bike ) . <p> As for the comfort , the height of the ST should n't affect how tall your seatpost is . The height between the saddle and cranks should be the same on all bikes simply because your legs are a fixed length . However , BB drop will affect " how high " you feel off the ground when riding the bike . The Histo has a higher bb drop than some track frames ( E ) , so you may feel more bar-to-saddle drop , but the Histo headtube is also pretty big . A real pursuit frame would have a very short head tube so that the rider could get low and aerodynamic into the frame . This is n't the case with the Histo , so I do n't think you should be feeling any discomfort when riding this frame , but then again , I do n't know your body . If you still feel worried about the bar-to-saddle drop , get compact bars to mitigate the discomfort .

We all know what happens to loose ball when abused . TBH I think hubs are overrated and people get Phil 's to just have that " swag " on their bike . You could get Formula 's with sealed bearings and not be able to tell the difference between them and some Phil Woods . Once broken in , they all spin buttery . Plus , they save you tons of money since you do n't have to deal with all of the crap that PH hubs give you in the fact that they 're only compatible with certain cogs and you can only use their lock ring . <p> I am going to have to strongly disagree , I do n't care how long you spin your formulas they will never spin or feel the way phil woods do even after a year of use . I do notice that they are a bit heavy even laced to real light hoops but I almost can not stop my bike once it starts going . <p> " I think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend using Phil , it 's the lockrings that are proprietary . " <p> I remember reading that off of their website , but I have seen someone selling a rear wheel with a EAI cog on a Phil hub with the lock ring . I 'm not too sure if I trust it or not , but we 'll see . <p> Also , does have two different flange size hubs in a wheelset really effect riding and sturdiness ? I figure that it wo n't be a big difference , since some road wheelsets have a larger rear hub and a small one in the front . Larger for the cassette . <p> Flange size should n't affect the feel in any noticeable way , smaller flange will sacrifice a bit of lateral stiffness but it 's trivial at best for normal riding . <p> Phil Wood hubs/cogs have a different thread pitch than most hubs/cogs , you can get most any cog to fit onto a Phill Wood hub but it shaves away at the threads on the shell , this can potentially strip the threads completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EAI cog on it 's too late to worry about that . Most of the time it will be okay , it just raises the risk of stripping . If you 're in the same area as the seller ask to check them out and take a look at the threads to make sure they are n't stripped , or ask for a close photo of the threads if they 're somewhere else . If you ever buy Phil Wood hubs new be sure to invest in the cog as well , there 's no sense in dishing out a hundreds on a hubset and then cheaping out and using a cog that could damage the hub . Second hand , if you 're getting a good deal it 's probably worth it to buy , and you can always use this info to haggle and get a lower price too , on account of the potentially damaged threads . <p> Phil Wood cogs do not have a different pitch than other English-threaded cogs . Their lockrings , however , are Italian-threaded . <p> The reason Phil Wood recommends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the thread pitch but rather because those cogs are thicker than most other cogs , resulting in less lockring threads engaged and ( supposedly ) increasing the chance of stripped cog threads . <p> FWIW , I 've used EAI cogs on my Phil hub without any trouble whatsoever . <p> Hmm , I 've read in a few places that the thread pitch is different . And when I tried to screw my Soma cog on it binded up so I figured it was true . But it 's interesting to hear otherwise from a trusted source . Do n't know why my Soma would n't screw on , but I 'd believe it , most of it could be marketing schemes on Phil Wood 's behalf trying to push more of their product . <p> I read about it thoroughly before thinking to buying Phil hubs and what not . I just wanted to know if anyone else had other opinions about it . For a while I thought about trying to build a bike that is mostly American made stuff , but in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read that it was mostly the thickness , but did n't know s much about the threading of the cog . I would think since they are an American company that try to follow up on more modern criteria when it comes to making something ( ex : 1 1/8 headsets , English B.B. , etc. ) , that they would follow through on that . Unless there 's good reasoning behind using Italian threading on hubs . But I have no clue or care that much anymore . <p> They 're definitely standard thread pitch , the source I read that from was very likely misinformed . And yeah , Paul 's are a good choice for American made if you ever follow through on that build , better looking than Phil 's imo.

Very fast hubs on these , spin up really nice . Stiff , too . Plus , they 're Campy/Fulcrum designed , so you know they 're bomb-proof . These would make great crit and/or back up wheels . I 'm including the official write-up on these below . Please feel free to schedule a viewing as well as ask me any questions . The price is absolutely firm . Thanks for looking ! <p> LONG ...

Not only are these wheels aero but Fulcrum have managed to keep the weight of the wheelset down to just 1725g , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quattros come with straight pull aero spokes and anodised nipples coupled with stealth decals to finish off an impressive wheelset . Offering everything from an aero profile to Fulcrum 's legendary durability and a competitive weight these are a leading all-round road and triathlon wheelset . <p> The Racing Quattro LG represents the family 's aluminium version and despite its wider stance of 17C ( 24mm external ) the Fulcrum engineers were able to produce a complete wheel that comes in at the exact same weight as the previous model . Increased stiffness , reactivity and greater stability along with a wider stance and housing for larger tyres all with no weight penalty make this aluminium wheel perfect for long days in the saddle . <p> Dynamic Balance : The concept is simple and elegant : balance the weight of the gasket , with an item of similar weight placed on the exact opposite side . For top models , this is obtained by a special operation on the section of the rim opposite the rim joint . <p> Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation Treatment : A process made thanks to electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This process is an advanced oxidation process of light alloys of aluminium , magnesium and titanium . This special project was developed a few decades ago in the Russian laboratories to improve characteristics of the lightweight materials used in the field of space and military .

This is possible thanks to a very fine and compact matrix of alpha and microcrystalline gamma alumina and amorphous alumina embedded on the surface .

@@22054875 @2054875/ <h> fastest aluminium track frame <p> hey guys , <p> I 've been looking for an aluminium track frame for quite a while now and although i have a few frames in mind i might be missing out on some of them so I could definitly use some help on choosing the right one . I 'm basically looking for the fastest and most aerodynamic aluminium track frame that i could use mostly on the streets and on the velodrome . I do n't really know if the aerodynamics factor has a great impact on the speed while on the streets though . <p> if you feel the need for speed , as many do , why do n't you source out some better components like a good wheelset and crankset rather than fretting over which aero aluminum frame is true grease lightnin ' . <p> Yeah , +1 to that , and be sure to dress it with some ENVE 8.9s for extra aero-ness . Just do n't ride it outside , because if you have to ask what the fastest aluminum frame is on an Internet forum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a feather in a crosswind . <p> I think the fact that Merckx rode almost 50k 's ( 30,7mi ) on this in 1 hour at an altitude of 2300m ( 7500ft ) says it all . I get why you want the best possible chance of being super fast but if you invest in something nice it wont matter too much . Like the guys say - hubs , bearings and wheels in general are much more important to consider if you want a faster bike . If you 're crazy into aerodynamics get carbon . <p> honestly , track racing is n't popular enough to find any comprehensive testing on which bikes are the most aero . The felt posted above is probably the most aero but it also costs like 18k or something ridiculous . just get whatever you think looks cool . I race on a steel bike . its fun , and i do pretty well . <p> Pedals and shoes being the same , what it will boil down to is frame geometry and position . So when shopping , riders like steep seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there adjusting to suit their needs . That 's why fixies/track bikes are all about geometry . Also , riders like a short wheelbase ( fascination w/ toe overlap ! ) <p> As far as bikes advantages go , does n't matter what frame you get but for whatever frame you get make sure that it 's make out of a 7005 aluminum blend . The 7005 aluminum blend makes the frame stronger , lighter , and stiffer . Make sure that the frame is sized correctly for your body frame . There are some frames where the top tube has a slight slant on the top tube which is a pursuit geometry . A couple examples with this frame geometry is the leader kagero , low pursuit , and brakebrake 17 karma . The slant on the top tube allows the rider to stay in a lower , tighter , aero position - that means your body is in a position to cut thought the wind most efficiently and the tight geometry engages the right muscles for the most power output . A couple more upgrade advantages you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now for your body you need to do interval training both on the road and bike rollers , ride with people that are faster than you and eat right , with that combo you should be smashing it on your bike . <p> Lol dude what are you talking about . The 6061 is actually lighter than 7005 aluminum . 6061 is easier to form , therefore easier to reduce wall thickness and forming larger tubes , which makes it both lighter and drives cost down . 7005 is stronger , but we , as humans , are n't  strong enough to exert forces that matter on either 6061 or 7005 . <p> Also ceramic bearings are a gimmick . They start to save watts between 10,000-20,000 rpm . Can you spin that fast ? They are harder and lighter than steel bearings , so technically more durable .

How does one know precisely where the crank/chainring should sit on a square taper BB ? <p> When my chainline is precise , there is no better feeling . Whisper-quiet and a smooth purr . When it 's slightly off , though I realize it 's perfectly acceptable , I 'm still always chasing that whisper-quiet dragon of a perfect chainline . <p> Advice for knowing when it 's " there " on a square taper that allows for variation ? <p> Square Taper is pressfit and pressfited once only per fitting to minimise material stress . A skilled hand knows how much torque is appropriate . It 's not a matter of adjusting chainline : for that one can use an adjustable bottom bracket like Phil Wood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the chainline . <p> A " skilled hand " is n't quantitative enough . I consider myself fairly adept with tools/bicycles , and am a machinist by trade . Hence my geeking out on the perfect chainline . It seems that taper-crank are intended to be set at a very specific compression , however there is no mechanical ' stop ' to indicate that you are short , or long of ' the mark ' . I 'm sure this is because once cranks are removed a few times , the taper actually changes sizes slightly and ' the mark/sweet spot ' would move . One should n't need an adjustable BB if the rear hub/cog , BB and crank are milled to create a specific chainline . <p> I 'd like to differ on the " grease issue " .

There 's also those who 'd argue that for instance aluminium will flex , given that one does n't re-tighten once pressfitted : and that the aluminium will keep on flexing enough at each new fitting and not " change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the crank will be seated more evenly . <p> Noise is n't my issue , though it certainly is an indicator that things might not be in precise alignment . It is a feel . I have 2 track bikes with an absolute perfect chainline . Digital calipers say so . And it feels gooood . The result is noticeable . I have another that is technically within acceptable tolerance , it feels different . They are all Dura Ace components , so not a compatibility issue . Since there is a ' stop ' on the cog threads , and the chainring also has a fixed position on the crank , the only place for variation is the crank 's placement on the spindle . Whether greased or ungreased , I think we can all agree that there is room for micro-variation on crank placement on the spindle .

Two parts ( bb and crank ) from the same manufacturer could get close to a " perfect limit " , but on the other hand ; would maybe cost a lot - Too much for most to accept and to be profitable for any manufacturer . Moreover , would someone want to install cranks with a microscope to find the " perfect tolerance " ? In any other case , a torque spec range is perhaps as close as one might get . Another variable one might include , if comparing microscopic differences , the fit between bb and frame . Furthermore , why not microscopic play in the axle vs the bearings . Lastly , what about flex in the frame ? <p> even if you were to adjust it to the most perfect chainline. after couple rides it wont be perfect anymore . over time " perfect " would not be achievable . so like most people say . get it the best you can and ride it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up . it 'll be quiet then <p> I do ride .

I was asking how . <p> Slightly off topic : Ideally a bottom bracket spacer should be able to space out the cog , given enough threads left for the cog .

@@22054912 @2054912/ <p> bike mechanic here . with low flange hubs , the spokes exert high torque on the hub due to their proximity to the axle . with high flanges , the torque exerted by the spokes is lower since the spokes connect to the hub farther out . so to put it simply , the smaller the flange , the higher the torque and therefore the more likely that you will have a failure of a hub or spoke . also , higher flanges do help with faster accelerations. but there comes a point when super high flanges just add up to more weight for you to drag around and become more of a hinderance than help . and remember , adding one pound to the wheels is like adding two to the frame . if you have your heart set on a chub , go for it , but IMHO you would be better off spending your money on a high quality set of hubs ( phil wood , dura ace , white industries , or if money is an issue , formula/origin8 are great for the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fashion . do n't  believe me about adding weight to the wheels ?

@@22054917 @2054917/ <h> need some opinions/advice on my build . <p> Hey everyone , thank 's for chiming in on this , <p> Stem Stack Height ... now I know that the stem stack height subject has been done to death but I 'm not really asking how many spacers I should have but rather does the amount of spacers and stem height on my bike look odd ? I 'm so used to seeing track and urban bikes with little to no stack height ... I just want the right mix of form and function . <p> Before purchasing the frame I used several frame size calculators , did all the measurements and spoke to several shop owners that cary the frame so I 'm pretty confident that I 'm using the correct size , Here 's the catch though .... I have issues with my neck and upper back so I like a slightly more upright position , hence the tall stack height . <p> I 'm 5 ' 7 with an average proportionate build , the bike is a Pake Rum Runner , 51cm , here 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looks like a nice chill ride . For a more upright position , you can start with leveling your saddle out and maybe lowering the seat post as well . &amp; 5 ' 7 " on a 51cm frame seems kind of odd to begin with , but that 's just me . Hope this helps . <p> That stem height is screaming " I bought a frame that is too small ! " and the whole point of the VO Tall Stack stem is to be able to use it without spacers underneath for a comfortable height and clean aesthetic . <p> I spoke with you on the phone several times before you bought the frame and definitely recall suggesting you get a 53cm based on your measurements - after you originally said you wanted 49cm because you were used to riding BMX bikes . As I said on the phone , BMX and road bikes are extremely different things and riding a road bike you are cramped on may very well make any neck and upper back problems you have feel worse . <p> Also , are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Based on your leg measurements and knowing how small a 51cm Rum Runner is , it looks like it may be a little low . <p> While I 'm not a doctor ( or have any knowledge of any long-term condition you may have ) , I do know about bike fit . <p> Well if you 're 5 ' 7 " running a 51cm frame , it already sounds like your frame is too small for you . I 'm just 5 ' 5 " running a 52cm frame . IMO I think your stem is fine to ride around with knowing that pedestrians will find it so shiny and clean . Other cyclist may not think so but oh well . And to add on about the BMX part , BMX sizes typically go by top tube length , which is way different from these bikes that go by seat tube . ( Top tube length is still important though ) <p> Yeah , found that out the hard way when I ordered my cockpit from you a while back . My top tube was n't the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted , a 110mm . Haha feels great though <p> As I said above , I told you over the phone not to get a 49cm ( as you were originally planning ) and said that if it were me , I 'd get the 53 . You kept saying " I do n't know , man ... I want a small bike " and insisting that you would be more comfortable on a smaller frame , so I told to get the 51 and that you may need to make up the difference by using a longer stem depending on what bars you 'd be using . I also recall you originally telling me you would be using a Nitto B302 handlebar , which also had to do with my original advice of getting the 53 because the swept back hand position of those bars would really cramp you up on anything smaller ( unless you were using a really long stem ) . <p> I also told you to steer clear from the Competitive Fit and aim for the Eddy Fit , as you had said you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't noticed , your FitCalc results are pretty close to the size you ended up buying . <p> There 's no real need to put on a show and get all defensive here . Nobody is swearing at you or insulting you . For the record , you did n't seem too keen on actually listening to me when I was making suggestions about frame size and bike fit . I gave you my advice but it was ultimately up to you to choose a frame . <p> the way I see it the only show playing out here is you trying to back pedal your way out of a plain as day " put your foot in your mouth comment " ... back peddle your shit all you want man , go back through your email , you told me if those measurements were yours you would go with a 51cm , with absolutely no mention of bars , stem or any other part voiced with in your consideration . <p> I 'm not back-pedaling at all . You were insistent on buying a small frame and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you must have said " I want a small bike " about 20 times . <p> Your bike really does n't look like a horrible fit , it just looks like a few things need to be dialed in , which is to be expected considering it 's your first road bike . <p> FYI Scrod , the eddy and competitive fit are exactly the same on my results , maybe you did n't even look at the results I sent you .... do you have any other excuses to make me look like I made a bad decision based on your recommendation ? <p> Yes , I saw that the first time and responded appropriately . Again , nobody is " flaming " you , calling you names or swearing at you . <p> Relax and read back through this thread . <p> Once again , your FitCalc results match what your bike has , it just looks a little wonky because usually when you see a stem that high , it 's a sign that the frame is much too small . Only you can tell if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm just looking at a picture . <p> I understand Scrod , Can you see why I would be a little upset here though ? If you had said " that looks like shit take the spacers out " I 'd be just fine with that , but you did n't say that , you told me that I purchased the wrong size against your recommendation , but you told me to buy that frame . <p> Thank you for your recommendations , I will make some changes and dial a few things in . <p> You 're welcome but you seem to fly off the handle a little too easily . <p> Thanks a ton for publicly dragging me through shit ( after I helped you much more than anyone else you 'd buy a frame from online ever would ) and freaking out on me for no reason , though . I definitely deserved it . <p> obviously we see this from completely different sides , I have not written anything that is n't 100% true and it 's all on the table for whomever cares to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just having a hard time understanding how you feel that telling a customer to buy a certain size based on measurement results and then posting in a public forum , telling them that they purchased the wrong size against your recommendation is okay and not grounds for some bitching . <p> The facts are all very cut and dry here , but somehow you feel like I 'm doing you wrong for calling you out on your contradictory post ... ? <p> Dude , what the fuck is wrong with your brain ? You 're not " calling me out " on anything , you 're just being a bi-polar jackass at this point . <p> You 're not seeing the forest for the trees here , which is understandable considering your head is planted firmly in your ass .

I still maintain that if it were my bike and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the 53cm ( which I told you during our first phone conversation ) but you insisted you wanted a small frame and the 51 was still within your range of measurements .

Aside from your insecurity , what 's the problem ? <p> Because you 're STILL NOT GETTING IT , all I said was that when a bike has such a huge rise on the stem , it usually means the frame is too small . In this case , it 's obvious you just do n't know how to set up your bike . Quit your whining , dial your bike in correctly and ride the damn thing . <p> Dude , do what is comfortable .

Granted you can always get a positive angle stem and/or ride shallow drop bars or bullhorns ( or dare I say riser bars ) . <p> Thank you everyone for all the help and input . It was definitely a factor in the bike I chose . <p> As you can see from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am extremely happy with the purchase , and with the head tube being 4 cm longer with the spacers than on my 725 . It is a very comfortable ride . And still extremely responsive cause of the steep head tube angle and higher bottom bracket . I have drops on it now , but on occasion will throw some low rise risers on it for those slower group rides .

I work at a shop so price is n't really an issue . I 've been looking at the Corsa SC 's , so anything in their league is game . However , I 'm open to all types of tires . <p> Next question ; which bike to put them on , if any at all ? Aesthetics are the whole reason why I 'm looking at gum/tan sidewalls so I do want to choose the right bike . I 'll be using these tires AFTER I wear through my current tires ( which wo n't be very long since Bontrager R3/R4 tires have no longevity whatsoever ) . <p> IMO gum walls are great on any bike regardless of frame color , so it would depend on which wheels you put them on . If you put them on your race wheels it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would might want to take those off . They would also look great with your training wheels , but you might want something more durable than the Corsa SC 's . <p> I have n't used the Corsa SC 's but I think my roommate has . They are fast , but puncture like no other . I would personally go for those , but keep those on the aeolus wheels for race day only . Or even the open corsa cx tires . <p> If you decide to put them on your training wheels , then I would go for something like the rubino , if you were to stick with Vittoria . I do n't know much about other brands with good durable tires that come in gumwall . <p> His roommate did have some , still races vittoria cx , they ride like a dream , but flat like a nightmare ( for high mileage at least ) . I also heard that vittoria stopped making the sc clincher this year ? do n't know if this is true , but yeah ......... <p> Get panracer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for racing though : / . <p> The Pasela seem like they are thick enough to last a while .

Chris King is by a super close second , i have ridden all three extensively and to be honest the ride quality is so minor i doubt most could tell the difference . Hawk being the most economical it was still a great obb but noticeably not as good as the two aforementioned . <p> But take this with a grain of salt , i am just one person giving my humble opinion and know/respect that others will have other opposing views that will contradict what i believe .
