@@78818168 @318168/ <h> About Vacuum Packing <p> Vacuum packing is a method of storing and preserving food in an airless environment , usually in air-tight pouches to prevent the growth of micro-organisms . Tangible advantages can be gained in the kitchen through vacuum packing , such as products being stored for several days longer without any deterioration in quality . <p> Sous vide cookery is not hard or only for the realm of the professional cook . With a little reading everyone can enjoy the benefits of sous vide cookery . Please click the link below to learn a little more about this process , and have a look around our site that is devoted to giving everyone the right tools to begin the sous vide journey with the confidence to succeed . <p> We are a specialist supplier of sous vide and vacuum packing equipment for the professional chef and home foodie .

We 're also an authorised distributor of a great range of domestic sous vide equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of packaging , storing , presenting and then cooking food <p> Some food types need to be stored in an airless environment , usually in air-tight packaging to reduce the growth of microorganisms . When vacuum packing most of the bacteria is expelled from the bag as the air is removed , providing a very safe and hygienic method of storage . <p> Vacuum packing also helps maintain the product quality and size . For example , in meat items such as steaks , the blood cant leak out and the meat does n't  dry out so the product weight is maintained . Vacuum packing food can extend its life by three to five times . <h> What Benefits Does A Vacuum Packing Machine Provide ? <p> Chefs and caterers find many benefits when using vacuum packing machines including : <p> Advanced food preparation <p> Portion control <p> Spreading workload <p> Reduced food wastage <p> Lower food costs <p> Safer food storage <p> Higher standards of food hygiene when used together with sous vide cooking <p> Pre-prepared foods such as fresh or sliced meats , fish , poultry , vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several days without reduced quality . By pre-portioning soups , sauces and completed dishes you can reduce food wastage . <p> All these benefits help increase efficiency in the kitchen . Cooked and raw food can be hygienically stocked in vacuum pouches for storage in the fridge or easily transported between locations with minimal risks of cross-contamination . <h> Benefits of sealing food under vacuum <h> Eliminating Oxidisation <p> Vacuum packing helps preserve food by removing air from the bag it is stored in . This gets rid of oxygen which affects food in various ways including odour , colour , taste &amp; texture and allows for longer storage . Certain types of bacteria can not grow without oxygen . Once food is in contact with air it begins to lose its natural flavour and its appearance starts to change . This reaction affects all fresh foods even if the effects are not immediately obvious . <h> Preserving Delicate Flavours &amp; Oils <p> In todays world a lot of emphasis is placed on eliminating salt and fat from our diets and increasing natural oils . More of us are trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these lower blood levels of triglycerides , which have been linked to cardiovascular disease . <p> Fish oils do deteriorate faster than the fat found in meat such as beef , chicken and pork . You can keep fish well wrapped in a fridge for two days and in a freezer for two months . By vacuum packing these foods you can preserve all the natural goodness and taste for four to six days in the fridge or frozen for two years . <h> Preventing Freezer Burn <p> When foods are frozen without preparation , freezer burn can occur . It happens when the surface of the food is dehydrated and this causes a dried and leathery appearance . The flavour and texture of foods can also be ruined , vacuum packing reduces freezer burn as it protects the food from exposure to the cold , dry air . <h> Maintaining Natural Moisture <p> Air causes moisture to evaporate . One of the reasons we package or wrap food is to keep it from drying out . How many of us reach a few slices down into the loaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a much better way to pack food because the air removal keeps the food moist . <h> Sous Vide Cooking <p> Over the years vacuum packing has advanced and it is no longer just a way of extending shelf life and improving portion control . Today it is an innovative cooking technique . Sous vide cooking involves sealing ingredients in a pouch under vacuum . These are then cooked at a precisely defined temperature to reach a desired result . <p> This gentle cooking style has proven to be a popular method for more and more leading chefs . And the numbers using it are growing . The technique is one of the most important culinary innovations of today as it keeps meat tender and fish succulent no matter how long it has been cooked .

@@78818260 @318260/ <h> About Sousvide <p> The French word ' Sous Vide ' translates as ' under vacuum ' . It was originally used in the early 1970s to minimise product loss when cooking " foie gras " . Now it is loved by chefs worldwide for the preparation of many dishes . <p> Vacuum packing is a method of storing and preserving food in an airless environment , usually in air-tight pouches to prevent the growth of micro-organisms . Tangible advantages can be gained in the kitchen through vacuum packing , such as products being stored for several days longer without any deterioration in quality . <p> We are a specialist supplier of sous vide and vacuum packing equipment for the professional chef and home foodie . We are the sole UK importer of sous vide and vacuum packing equipment from Swiss manufacturer Vac-Star and Italian manufacturer Foodtek . We 're also an authorised distributor of a great range of domestic sous vide equipment by SousVide Supreme . <h> The Basics <p> Food is vacuumsealed in a pouch and then cooked slowly at low temperatures . The food becomes tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This technique involves heating foods to the right temperature , for the right length of time . Temperature depends on the kind of food and would vary for meat , fish and vegetables , but also depends on personal taste . For example whether a customer prefers it cooked rare or medium . <h> Sous Vide Versus Conventional Methods <p> With all cooking techniques heat penetrates the outside of the food until the centre gets to the right temperature . If you wanted a rare piece of beef you would cook the centre to 54C . To do this you may roast it in an oven at around 280C . By the time the centre of the beef is at 54C the outside of the beef is way overdone . In fact most of the joint would be well done and grey . <p> But if you roasted it at 54C , none of the meat would get overdone , but it takes so long for the centre to get to the right temperature the meat would dry out . If you stopped roasting too early so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw . <p> With the sous vide technique ; you cook food at the temperature you want the whole joint to be at . By sealing it in a vacuumed bag none of it is overdone and the meat does n't  dry out , lose nutrients or flavour . <h> Why Is Precise Temperature Control Important ? <p> The art of sous vide cooking is finding the perfect core temperature to achieve the desired taste and textures . Think of a dish that features an egg with a creamy , custardlike texture . One chef might cook that egg to a core temperature of 61.7C , while another may prefer cooking it to 63.3C . The finished eggs will be very different from each other . It makes each chefs dish unique . <h> The Science Bit <p> When cooking , the heat induces chemical reactions with different effects at different temperatures . For example , the different proteins in the albumen of eggs coagulate at specific temperatures . Just a few degrees difference in cooking temperature will affect just how much the egg white solidifies . <p> Temperature affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content , such as a pork belly , should be cooked for longer and at higher temperatures . This will break down the tough connective tissue . Meat with little connective tissue , like fillet steak , would get tough if cooked at those temperatures . Just a few degrees can make a difference in an expensive cut of meat . <h> Can I Not Just Use A Pan Of Water Or Slow Cooker ? <p> The right equipment is a vital part of the sous vide technique . Unlike slow cookers or simmering pans of water , sous vide equipment offers precise temperature control along with set it and forget it convenience . Basically you set it to cook food to a precise core temperature , within a fraction of a degree , with just one single adjustment . <p> Maintaining a slow cooker or pan of simmering water at just the right temperature is practically impossible , and it is much harder for results to be consistent . Also , because they do n't  circulate the cooking liquid , these methods can develop hot and cool zones that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vary ? <p> Cooking at low temperatures for long periods of time is what creates the delicious results of sous vide . However , it does take testing and experience to determine the right amount of time needed to cook a dish exactly how the customer wants . The sousvidetools.com team can help with this . <p> In general , cooking time is affected by three factors : <p> The core temperature you wish to cook the dish to <p> The heat transfer characteristics of the food <p> The amount of food that will be cooked at one time <p> Food will reach the core temperate quicker with a greater cooking liquid to food ratio . When cooking sous vide , the pouches must be completely covered with liquid and you should allow enough room for the pouches and liquid to circulate freely . <p> One advantage of sous vide cooking is that it is much harder to overcook a dish by leaving it too long . Once a dish reaches the desired temperature , it takes more time to keep cooking the food . This means you can keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drying out or becoming tough . This is a great benefit when cooking expensive cuts of meat . <h> How Does The Sous Vide Technique Improve Presentation ? <p> The enjoyment of food is a very personal experience and it must please all our senses . We 've all had our expectations raised by the sight of a well-presented dish , the aroma from the plate , or the sizzling sound of a hot meat . <p> To complement and enhance the melt in the mouth tenderness , many chefs finish sous vide meat dishes by briefly grilling or pan/blowtorch searing . It creates a browning reaction and then the familiar aromas and flavours that come with highheat cooking . <p> The main difference with food cooked using the sous vide technique and finished in this way is that the inside remains tender and moist . <h> How To Cook Using The Sous Vide Technique ? <p> The sous vide cooking process is very simple : <p> Set the thermal circulator or water bath to the desired cooking temperature . <p> Vacuum seal the food <p> Place the vacuum sealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water bath will maintain the water or oil at the desired temperature . <p> Note : While you cant overcook a dish with the sous vide method , you can undercook it if you remove it from the heated liquid before it reaches the right temperature .

@@78818277 @318277/ <h> why cook sous vide ? <p> Many top chefs use sous vide in their restaurant kitchens and now an increasing number of home cooks are also making use of the technique , which involves cooking vacuum-packed food in a water bath . But what are the benefits of this innovative method ? Join us as we investigate . <p> Sous vide has been used in professional kitchens since the 1970s but affordable equipment designed for the home has only hit the market in recent years . Now that the kit is available to amateurs , there is one question that many home cooks are asking : what does this futuristic method have to offer ? The answer is a stress-free cooking experience . With sous vide , you are guaranteed consistent , high-quality results and there is almost no danger of overcooking . Providing new and exciting ways of cooking familiar ingredients , the technique also allows you to be more adventurous and creative in the kitchen . In this guide , we consider some of the foods that benefit most from sous vide cooking and look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What to cook <p> Although sous vide equipment can used to cook almost anything , you 'll find that some ingredients particularly benefit from the technique . Here are a few examples . <h> Steak <p> Frying steak is very difficult because there is an extremely narrow window between the meat being done to your liking and being overdone . However , with sous vide , you simply set the water bath to the temperature needed for rare , medium-rare or medium , then sit back and relax . Since the heat of the water stays constant , the steak can not rise above the desired temperature , making overcooking a thing of the past . When you are ready to serve , quickly sear the steak in a hot pan to give it a delicious brown crust , then tuck in ! <h> Eggs <p> We all know that there are countless ways of cooking eggs but , when it comes to this humble ingredient , sous vide unlocks a whole new dimension . With a water bath and a vacuum sealer , you can make beautifully creamy scrambled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delights . <h> Fish <p> When pan-frying fish , there is a high risk that it will dry out , lose flavour or flake apart . Sous vide offers a much better alternative as the vacuum bag and the low cooking temperature work together to preserve moisture and flavour . This means that fillets stay firm , meaty and delicious . Salmon fillets also retain their intense pink colour , making for a really show-stopping result . <h> Tough cuts of meat <p> Cuts such as pork shoulder and brisket are good value but , unless cooked very slowly , they are extremely tough . Traditional techniques for slow-cooking these joints cause the meat to fall apart , which is delicious but somewhat messy . In contrast , sous vide tenderizes the meat while preserving its shape , so the joint can be sliced and carved . <h> The benefits <p> Chefs and amateurs are attracted to sous vide because it is more precise and reliable than other cooking techniques and produces better quality results . <p> At its best , food that has been fried , roasted or baked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the outside . However , when using these methods , even the slightest miscalculation in the cooking time or the temperature will cause things to go wrong . You could end up with something dry and overdone or with a burnt crust and an undercooked middle . The precision of sous vide makes such mistakes virtually impossible . The water bath heats the food to the exact temperature you want and then keeps it at that temperature , meaning it is no longer necessary to keep a careful eye on the clock . When the food comes out of the bath , it will lack the golden crust produced by frying or baking but one can be added by quickly searing the food in a hot pan just before serving . <p> Sous vide is also a great alternative to poaching , boiling and steaming . When these methods are used , flavour often leeches out into the cooking water . By contrast , in sous vide , the vacuum bag protects the food from direct contact with the water , locking in taste . <p> However , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life easier . Since ingredients can be vacuum-sealed and popped in the water bath hours or even days in advance , sous vide takes away the stress and the time-pressure of getting a meal ready on time . The preparation work is done well ahead and the food will be cooked to perfection at whatever time you want to eat . All that remains to be done before serving is to crisp up the food in a hot pan . <p> If you are really keen on saving time , you can chill or freeze vacuum bags after they have been cooked sous vide for reheating at a later date . Just make sure that you rapidly cool the bags in ice water as soon as they come out of the water bath . <h> Healthy eating <p> Sous vide not only produces better quality , more flavoursome food than most conventional techniques ; it also gives healthier results . The nutrients in fruit and veg are often lost during cooking but , thanks to the use of vacuum-sealing , sous vide prevents this from happening , preserving all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to use smaller quantities of oil and fat , as you only need a dash in the vacuum bag . <p> There is also plenty to be gained from sous vide in terms of food safety and preservation . Some foods will have a longer shelf-life if they are sealed inside a vacuum bag and , when it comes to pasteurising eggs and poultry , a water bath provides a low temperature alternative to traditional methods . This means that you can produce chicken that is safe to eat but still tender and juicy and raw egg that can be used in mayonnaise , meringues and cocktails without risking food poisoning .

@@78818297 @318297/ <h> Sous Vide Equipment for Home Cooking <p> If you 're a fan of modern cooking shows like Masterchef and Great British Menu you 've probably seen the Sous Vide technique in action . Its a cooking method that requires food to be vacuum sealed in pouches and heated at a controlled temperature over a period of time . This method can perfectly cook meat , fish , poultry , vegetables and fruit . The pouches contain the natural juices , moisture and flavours to keep food tender without overcooking . In a pan , on a grill or in a oven you 're cooking with temperatures that are much higher than you ever want your food to reach . If you turn your back for a moment too long , your steak can end up as a tough as old boots . And , even if you do achieve a medium-rare interior , the high heat environment of traditional cooking creates bands of overcooked areas around the outside .

@@78818399 @318399/ <h> Ceramic BBQ 's <p> One of the drawbacks of sous vide cooking is that you never achieve that brown crust full of delicious flavour that traditional roasting or grilling achieves . These brown bits of goodness occur because of the maillard reaction and can only develop at extremely high heats not used in sous vide cooking . There is , however , an easy solution to this problem using a BBQ . By using high heat , you 're able to brown the outside of the meat before the heat has time to penetrate very far into the interior . This yields a steak that 's perfectly cooked from edge-to-edge , with a thin but delicious browned crust on the outside . Ceramic BBQ 's are the ultimate solution . The ceramic shell produces high temperatures for searing , roasting and grilling but also allows for low-temperature smoking . Constructed for a uniform heat circulation resulting in fast and consistent cooking .

@@78818446 @318446/ <h> How to Finish Sous Vide Dishes <p> Cooking sous vide has many advantages , including precision , reliability and consistency : it will always produce an evenly cooked , tender and moist result . However , when meat or fish is cooked sous vide , it lacks the distinctive colour and aroma that it would have if it had been fried or roasted . This is because the Maillard reaction " the chemical reaction behind the delicious flavour of browned food " does not occur in sous-vide cooking .

@@78818495 @318495/ <h> Vacuum Packing Machines <p> The Sous Vide cooking method often calls for the removal of air from pouches of food and then securely sealing them . That two-step vacuum sealing process helps heat food more efficient by providing it with a better connection to water baths set at precisely controlled temperatures . The removal of air also creates great storage environments by minimizing oxidation to save flavor , color and aroma without the need for added preservatives . In commercial kitchens , air removal for Sous Vide cooking is usually accomplished using chamber vacuum sealers , which create low pressure environments in and around food pouches throughout the processes . A key benefit of a chamber sealer is the prevention of liquids being pulled from pouches during sealing . Alternatively , external vacuum sealers create low pressure zones only at the pouch openings when sealing . We now offer high quality chamber vacuum sealers for all business levels .

@@78818536 @318536/ <h> Should I Invest In A Food Dehydrator ? <p> Whilst they 've been a staple piece of equipment in professional kitchens for a number of years , food dehydrators are gaining popularity as an extremely useful aid for healthy cooking at home . <p> For aspiring foodies , this is an essential piece of kit in the home kitchen and a key tool in the battle to eat healthy with nutritious food . <p> But what exactly is a food dehydrator , and how does it work ? We take a closer look at its uses , and assess whether you could benefit from one . <h> What is a food dehydrator ? <p> As the name suggests , a dehydrator removes all the water from a wide variety of foods , including meats and produce . This is achieved by a gentle heating system , which dries out all the moisture without cooking the food . <p> Dehydrators are used to concentrate the natural flavours , sweetness and aromas of food , without damaging or removing any of the nutritional content .

Some foods need to be dried at a higher temperature than others , and you need to ensure you do n't cook the food whilst drying . <p> Similarly , those dehydrators with just a single temperature can often appear to be cooking food on the outside , whilst the inside is still moist . In these instances , the food will spoil well before the usual shelf life . <p> Timer <p> Having a timer is what makes dehydrators so easy to use . Removing water from some foods can take a number of hours , and a timer gives you the flexibility to leave the dehydrator running whilst you carry out other tasks . <h> The benefits of Excalibur <p> At Sous Vide Tools we recommend the Excalibur food dehydrators for both professional chefs and amateur foodies , as they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the core features needed . <p> The square shape provides lots of space for dehydrating a large amount of food , and the design offers superior drying as air flow is n't obstructed .

It might not sound like much , but having the electrics on the side prevents any kind of short circuiting from the drips off juicy food . <p> Finally , but perhaps most importantly , the drying trays are easily removable so you can clean them as and when required . They 're all suitable for washing , and offer great longevity to your dehydrator . <h> Are dehydrators worth it ? <p> For anyone who is a fan of dried fruits , sweet snacks and tasty treats that have good nutritional value , a dehydrator is a great little investment . <p> Compared with drying in an oven , dehydrators save on both time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work for hours on end .

We did n't want to undermine the whole point of sous vide perfection in these areas in search of smoke . <p> So the question was how ? - Hot or cold ? Before or after ? Let 's take a look at the possibilities . <h> Hot Smoking <p> Hot smoking is a traditional method of slowly cooking food over an indirect fire . Pretty much all great Southern barbecue is slow cooked in hot smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 120C ) range for varying amounts of time per pound . - In the hands of an experienced pit master , it can be sublime and each one has his ( or her ) own secrets to attain perfection . The meat or fish so handled often reaches internal temperatures of 185F/85C or more , which , in the hands of lesser pit mortals , because they 're well above the rare to medium rare range we might like for , say , a hunk of prime rib or tri-tip roast , could result in an outcome less sublime . <p> With great care in timing , however , you can impart some smoke with a brief visit to a hot smoker ( say maybe 10 to 20 minutes depending on the thickness of what you 're smoking ) but this will only give time for the smoke to permeate the very outer parts of the meat surface and might be too long for fish . <p> This kind of hot smoking technique is one done in a dedicated hot smoker with an offset firebox , like the set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a pan of wood chips on the flame and the food kept well away from the direct heat . Or , if you have a smaller budget or not much space , you can even do it in a small stovetop smoking set up .

The benefit here is that you can pre-cook a variety of foods from steaks and chops and roasts to even salmon or trout or corn each at its preferred temp , quick chill in the pouch , and store in the refrigerator for a couple of days , if needed . Then when ready to finish , remove the food from its pouch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expose it to the hot smoke for about 10 to 20 minutes before moving on to finishing with a sear with a torch or under the broiler or on the hot part of the grill . - This will give a more prominent smoky flavour to the finished product . - And if you 're cooking a mixed grill , if you precook , you can smoke and finish all the various types of food at once . <h> Cold Smoking <p> Cold smoking , a traditional method of food preservation that 's been practiced by cultures all over the globe for many centuries , does not actually cook the food . And because it does n't , you can leave the food in the smoke for a couple of hours and give it time to deeply penetrate , without risk either of overcooking and drying out the meat or fish or of raising an army of unfriendly food-borne bacteria .

The experts recommend applying about 40 minutes of cold smoke to steaks and chops and up to 2 or 3 hours for roasts or thicker cuts . Then either refrigerating below 40F/5C or immediately cooking . <p> There are several types of devices you can use for cold smoking , depending on how much smoking you do and how often , from the Cadillac for the serious smoking afficianado , such as a- Bradley Cold Smoker , to the entry level models , such as - inexpensive pellet smokers- you can use with your closed-lid grill . <h> Other Smoking Methods <p> Another alternative for quick application of smoke would be to go high tech and use the- Smoking Gun , which since it just adds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after sous vide cooking and just before searing . <p> One last alternative , the cheapest and easiest to use , is to add a little bit of- Powdered Smoke- to your dry rub or seasoning mixture , applied before you put the food into the pouch for sous vide cooking . - In our experience , even with long cooking of short ribs or tri-tip , the smoky aroma is still quite pronounced , though the flavour , while nice , is somewhat fainter .

That happened to us recently with Damian Brown , Owner and Head Chef at The Chesil Rectory in Winchester , Hampshire . He has spent many years shunning the idea of investing in a Sousvidetools.com FoodtekG Thermal Circulator .

People like to visit this place in winter because they get the fires going and offer homely cooked food . The meat dishes are just delicious and the game is particularly popular here . <h> Choosing the right tool for the job <p> A few months ago Damian admitted he had been curious about the effect of water bath cookery for some time . However his approach to cooking had always been old school so he had shunned the idea .

Before , the emphasis was on getting the meat cooked and then focusing on the garnishes . But the water baths free up more time which has enabled Damian to be so much more creative . Another change is that the whole team really enjoy cooking fish , which Damian did n't do before . He admits he is still learning every day and is regularly trying different things he can do with his new products . <h> Looking to the future <p> Over the next few months Damian wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roast whole joints over a 48-hour period , rather than cooking individual portions as they do currently for their Sunday lunches .

@@78818698 @318698/ <h> Sous vide " the essential guide by Tom Shingler <p> What do you need to start cooking sous vide ? This guide takes you through the basic equipment and processes involved in cooking ingredients under vacuum . <p> Meaning under vacuum ' in French , sous vide ( pronounced soo veed ) is a culinary process used in top restaurant kitchens around the world . It involves vacuum-sealing food inside plastic bags , which are then slow-cooked in a heated water bath . Simple , stress-free and capable of producing perfect results time after time , it is easy to see why chefs love this technique . <p> In the past , the use of sous vide was confined to the professional kitchens because the necessary equipment was too big and too expensive for home use . However , affordable , domestic versions of the vacuum sealers and water baths involved in sous vide cooking have recently become available , enabling enthusiastic amateurs to start enjoying the benefits of this innovative technique . For newcomers to sous vide , we have put together a handy guide to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Hot water <p> The ability to heat water to a precise temperature is absolutely crucial when it comes to sous vide cooking . There are two types of device that can be used for this : water ovens and thermal circulators . Both types function as heaters to warm the water and then as thermostats to maintain the desired temperature . <p> Water ovens are self-contained units , small enough to fit on a kitchen worktop . You fill the container inside the unit with water , then heating elements in the base modify and control the water temperature . <p> Thermal circulators attach to a separate container . Using motors , they heat and circulate the water inside the container , ensuring that the temperature stays constant . <p> The two types of device have different advantages . Water ovens are quiet to run and always ready to use , which is great if you planning on making regular use of sous vide techniques . However , on the downside , they take up more space than compact thermal circulators . The latter are good for occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up before cooking , they are easy to store when not in use . <h> Under pressure <p> Before cooking food in the water bath , you will need to seal it inside a plastic pouch using a vacuum . This makes it possible to completely submerge the food in the heated water , which in turn ensures that it cooks evenly . Sealing bags under vacuum will also keep the food inside fresher for longer because it is not exposed to the air . To extract the air from bag , you will need to use either a bar sealer or a chamber vacuum packer . <p> Bar sealers clamp onto the open end of the vacuum bag and suck out the air inside the pouch . A heating element then lightly melts the plastic at top of the bag to create an airtight seal . <p> Chamber vacuum packers work differently . You place the entire vacuum bag inside the machine 's inner chamber and close the lid . The packer then extracts all the air from the chamber , forcing the air out of the bag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are serious about sous vide , the investment is worthwhile . Compared to bar sealers , they offer greater speed , reliability and power . They are also safer to use with liquids . With a bar sealer , there is a danger that any liquid inside the vacuum bag will be sucked out with air whereas , with a chamber sealer , this is not a problem . <h> Going further <p> A water bath , vacuum sealer and food-grade plastic pouches are the only elements you need to start sous vide cooking but other accessories can also be used to achieve even better results . <p> For absolute precision , you can use a good quality thermometer and some special foam tape to monitor the temperature of the food inside the vacuum bag . This way , you know exactly when it reaches the perfect temperature . Simply insert the thermometer probe into the food through a strip of tape stuck onto the outside of the plastic pouch . The tape will ensure that the bag does not lose pressure when punctured . <p> A vacuum canister is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Attach one of these reusable food containers to your vacuum sealer and it will extract the air inside . This can be used to speed up processes such as marinating , pickling and infusing , which can take days to complete using traditional methods . Placing a canister full of meat and marinade or vegetables and pickling liquor under vacuum will force the liquid into the food , producing the desired result in a matter of hours . <p> You will soon find out that there are countless other possibilities when it comes to sous vide . The important thing is to keep experimenting with new ingredients and new methods . Sous vide cooking is really exciting because the technique is a recent innovation and we have yet to discover its full potential . Professional chefs are constantly finding new ways of using sous vide and , thanks to the availability of domestic kit , you can start making your own discoveries at home .

@@78818722 @318722/ <h> Cocktails , stock and perfect cheese : the future of sous vide <p> Join us as we explore the current frontiers of sous-vide cooking . Professional chefs and amateur cooks are continually discovering new and unexpected uses for vacuum bags and water baths . If you think you know everything that sous vide can offer , be prepared to think again . <p> For many ingredients , the benefits of cooking sous vide are already widely known . As you may have discovered for yourself , it is a great way to cook perfect poached eggs , tender meat , vibrant veg and delicate fish . However , this highly versatile technique has so much more potential . New uses for vacuum bags and water baths are being identified all the time by professionals in state-of-art development kitchens and by enterprising amateurs at home . It is hard to keep up with the constant stream of innovations but , to give you a flavour , we have brought together a selection of the most exciting developments . <h> Mixology <p> Spirits can be flavoured using five different methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit ) ; <p> introducing flavour during distillation ; <p> infusion ( immersing another ingredient in the spirit ) ; <p> maceration ( like infusion but the added ingredient is broken up ) ; <p> percolation ( heating the spirit and another ingredient together ) . <p> The last of these methods is the quickest and most convenient but it also has a major drawback . The alcohol often evaporates during cooking , leaving you with a flavoursome but teetotal spirit " not necessarily what you want if you are planning a cocktail party ! For this reason , traditional recipes usually recommend using an infusion method to make drinks such as sloe gin and plum brandy , which means waiting months and months for small amounts of spirit to mature in large jars of fruit . <p> However , there is now another way . Cooking the spirit and flavourings sous vide offers a solution to the problem of percolation because the sealed vacuum bag prevents the alcohol from escaping as vapour . This not only saves time compared to infusion but it also produces spirits with fuller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To see for yourself , try our easy sous-vide sloe gin recipe . <h> Dairy <p> The perceived hassle of making cheese and yoghurt from scratch is off-putting for many dairy lovers but sous vide makes the process so easy that there is no excuse for not giving it go . The most basic recipes involve little more than sealing some milk in a vacuum bag and heating it slowly in a water bath . One of the easiest cheeses to make sous vide is fresh ricotta , which is ready in less than two hours and uses only three ingredients : milk , salt and distilled vinegar . <p> It is not only fresh cheeses that can be prepared using a sous vide method . Adventurous amateur cheesemakers can produce aged varieties by heating the milk , culture and rennet together in a water bath , then straining , salting and aging the curds in the usual manner . You can even make cr+me fra+che sous vide . Simply combine double cream and buttermilk in a vacuum bag and cook in a water bath for a few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jars of milk into homemade yoghurt . This is because the bacteria responsible for this transformation need to be kept at a constant and precisely controlled temperature in order to grow . If they are allowed to cool down , they will become dormant ; if they become too hot , they will die off . Using a water bath , these disastrous outcomes can be easily avoided , producing perfect yoghurt every time . <h> Stocks , soups and broths <p> Depending on the type of water bath you own , you might be able to use your equipment to make flavoursome stock . Unfortunately , this method will not work with an immersion circulator but , if you own a water oven , all you need to do is fill it with fresh water , add bones and roasted vegetables and cook slowly for twenty-four hours . Essentially , you are creating an incredibly precise stockpot . Since there is no need for vacuum bags , this technique is wonderfully simple and the water bath only needs a brief clean afterwards and then it is ready to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin soups and broths . At his Michelin-starred restaurant , Sat Bains has even been known to rest meat in a water bath filled with melted butter ! <p> As you can see , water baths and vacuum bags can be put to a diverse array of uses and the examples described here are only the tip of the iceberg . The possibilities seem almost endless and , as long as chefs and amateurs keep experimenting , there is no telling how far the sous-vide revolution will change the way we think about cooking .
