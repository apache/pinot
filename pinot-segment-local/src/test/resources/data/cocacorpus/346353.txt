This settlement cycle is known as " T+3 " " shorthand for " trade date plus three days . " <p> For many years , markets operated on a " T+5 " settlement cycle . In 1995 , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reduced the settlement cycle from five business days to three business days , " T+3 " , which in turn lessened the amount of money that needs to be collected at any one time and strengthened our financial markets for times of stress . <p> Countdown to T+2 on Sept. 5 , 2017 : - <p> Days <p> Hours <p> Minutes <p> Seconds <h> T+3 Settlement Cycle <p> Trade Date ( T ) The post-trade clearance and settlement cycle begins on the date the trade is executed . On this date , trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronically transmitted by participants to the National Securities Clearing Corporation ( NSCC ) for processing , the majority of which are in real-time . NSCC is a subsidiary of the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation ( DTCC ) . NSCC sends to participants automated reports , which are legally binding documents that show trade details " including share quantity , price and security . These reports confirm that transactions have entered the clearance and settlement processing stream.T+1 NSCC 's guarantee of settlement generally begins at midnight between T+1 and T+2 . At this point , NSCC assumes the role of central counterparty , taking on the buyer 's credit risk and the seller 's delivery risk . This guarantee eliminates uncertainty for market participants and inspires public confidence.T+2 NSCC issues broker/dealers summaries of all compared ( i.e. " cleared " ) trades , including information on the net positions of each security due or owed for settlement.T+3 T+3 is settlement " the delivery of securities to net buyers and payments of money to net sellers . Broker/dealers instruct their settling banks to send or receive funds ( through the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) as NSCC 's agent . Securities generally do not change hands physically . DTC transfers ownership between broker/dealers ' accounts by book-entry electronic movements . <h> Position <p> SIFMA supports a move to shorten the settlement cycle for U.S equities , corporate bonds and municipal bonds to trade date plus two days ( T+2 ) from the current T+3 in the third quarter of 2017 . SIFMA believes that shortening the settlement cycle will meaningfully benefit investors and reduce counterparty risk , decrease clearing capital requirements , reduce pro-cyclical margin and liquidity demands , and increase global settlement harmonization . <p> SIFMA notes that shortening the settlement cycle is a fundamental change to existing market practices that must be implemented with great care to avoid any operational disruptions that could negatively impact investors . SIFMA believes the best path forward is a measured approach that recognizes the challenges to diverse market participants , including individual investors and products . <p> T+2 Industry Steering Committee The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation ( DTCC ) is leading a Shorter Settlement Cycle ( SSC ) initiative to prepare the industry for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee ( ISC ) , which is made up of a broad range of firms and trade associations and is co-chaired by SIFMA and the Investment Company Institute ( ICI ) . The ISC oversees the Industry Working Group ( IWG ) , and Sub-Working Groups ( SWGs ) . These groups were responsible for assessing the scope , requirements , and changes needed to facilitate the implementation of T+2. - <p> In June 2015 , the ISC released a white paper outlining the timeline and industry-level actions required to move to a two-day settlement cycle in the U.S. by the end of Q3 2017 . The ISC is currently focused on the compression of timeframes for clearing and settling , specific regulatory rule changes , as well as changes to the trade processing , asset servicing and other systems and process changes . <p> Regulatory SupportThe Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) strongly supports the industry 's move to a shorter settlement cycle and Chair White directed the industry in September 2015 to provide a detailed implementation schedule , including interim milestones and dependencies . Further , Chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely with impacted SROs to develop detailed schedules to consider the necessary rule amendments for a move to a shorter settlement cycle. - Impacted SROs are supportive of the industry 's move , and are scheduled to publish rule change packages for public comment throughout late 2015 and 2016 . <p> Implementation PlaybookIn response to Chair White 's request , on December 21 , 2015 , the T+2 Industry Steering Committee ( ISC ) published an T+2 Industry Implementation Playbook- ( the " Playbook " ) , which includes a detailed timeline , milestones , and dependencies to achieve a shortened settlement cycle for equities , corporate and municipal bonds , unit investment trusts , and financial instruments composed of these products traded on the secondary market by the third quarter of 2017 . The Playbook builds on the work published in the June 2015 industry white paper , and documents the results of an extensive industry analysis , facilitated by Deloitte Advisory LLC , that engaged participants from across the industry , including buy-side firms , sell-side firms , small and large firms , retail and institutional firms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer agents , and others . <p> Note : In 2012 , DTCC released a business case developed by The Boston Consulting Group ( BCG ) studying the impacts of potentially shortening the trade settlement cycle in the U.S. financial markets for equities , corporate and municipal bonds and unit investment trust ( UIT ) . The business case examines the costs and benefits of shortening the trade settlement cycle for these instruments in the U.S. financial markets from T+3 to T+2 or T+1 , but does not make a recommendation for any change , and was carried out with the guidance of SIFMA. - View Study- ( PDF ) . 52635 @qwx252635

Crane called for modernizing oversight of the Treasury market , praised TRACE , and said that Treasuries should be traded like securities in other large , standardized , liquid markets . <p> In his testimony , Snook said that while banking is a driver of economic growth , the country 's capital markets are an incredibly important source of funding for businesses and economic growth , but that fixed income markets face challenges in providing deep liquidity from capital regulations and other rules . Snook called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets are " as efficient as possible " and for this review to also explore capital regulations , including the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ( CCAR ) in addition to trading rules , like the Volcker Rule .

Snook said that SIFMA supports the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine ( TRACE ) reporting which began last week , but said that public reporting of Treasury trading should not be undertaken until regulators have carefully studied the issue to determine the benefits of additional disclosure . Snook said that this is necessary to ensure no harm is done to the Treasury security market . <p> Rep.

Snook also noted that secondary market trading has not kept pace with the growth of the market for corporate bonds , and that the growth in the market has been concentrated in large cap companies while the issuance of small cap companies has fallen dramatically . Snook also said that there is concern that in a higher-volatility , higher-interest rate environment than exists today , that market liquidity could be harmed by trading restrictions . <p> Rep. Ted Budd ( R-N.C. ) asked Sedgwick if he agreed that the Volcker Rule specifically , the Dodd-Frank Act generally , and the Basel III agreement have hurt market liquidity for fixed-income products . Sedgwick agreed that these all disincentive dealers from engaging in secondary trading .

Andresen endorsed the idea , noting that municipal bonds have the EMMA system that discloses trade and price information to investors . Huizenga said that he is looking for " industry consensus " on the topic . <p> Hultgren asked Andresen if he had any insights on the evolution of electronic trading in equity markets that could be applied to fixed-income markets , and for his views on the proper role of government in encouraging the transition .

Snook said that these platforms should be developed in an organic manner , and that external factors should not determine how to organize electronic trading . Snook noted that different fixed-income securities trade on electronic platforms in markedly different proportions . <p> Rep. Luke Messer ( R-Ind. ) asked the panel about the impact on cities and towns of banking regulators reclassifying certain municipal bonds as high-quality liquid assets ( HQLA ) at either the 2B or 2A level . Snook said that banks should be encouraged to hold high-quality municipal obligations on their balance sheets , and noted if these obligations were classified as HQLA it would reduce the borrowing costs for municipalities . <p> Rep.

Snook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ municipal bonds the impact , especially on small issuers , could be " devastating .

Trey Hollingsworth ( R-Ind. ) asked if it made sense to have the Department of Labor 's ( DOL 's ) fiduciary rule become effective while it is still under review . American Action Forum 's Holtz-Eakin stated that it does not make sense in this situation , and also questioned why the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has not acted in implementing its own rule . Subcommittee Chairman Bill Huizenga ( R-Mich. ) asked the panel if they support a delay in the fiduciary rule 's January 1 implementation date , and all but American Association of Retired Persons ' ( AARP 's ) Firvida replied yes . <p> Rep. Wagner 's Discussion Draft : - Rep. Ann Wagner ( R-Mo. ) asked the panel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of the suitability standard . 1st- Global 's Knoch noted that it requires a broker dealer to disclose a conflict of interest . Lombard added that it also asks to uphold a duty of loyalty and care , a higher standard than suitability , and is applicable to all accounts , not just retirement accounts . Wagner then asked if her draft provides a more comprehensive best interest standard than the DOL rule , and all of the panel except Firvida replied yes . <p> Nevada Fiduciary Rule : - Rep. French Hill ( R-Ark. ) cited the Nevada fiduciary rule going into effect on July 1 and noted his concern that it will create additional conflict due to states creating their own standard while a uniform standard is being created . Transamerica 's Halloran agreed that " having 50 states doing 50 different things " is counterproductive . <p> In his opening statement , Subcommittee Chairman Bill Huizenga ( R-Mich. ) said sound financial advice is critical for retirement savers , and millions of Americans are working to achieve financial independence . Huizenga stated that the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not only fails to protect customers , but harms them by driving up costs . Huizenga stated the DOL is denying American savers access to advice and limiting their choice , pricing out those that would benefit the most from financial advice - low- and middle-income savers . <p> In her opening statement , Subcommittee Ranking Member Carolyn Maloney ( D-N.Y. ) stated she is a supporter of the DOL fiduciary rule because it provides " critical protections " for Americans saving for retirement . Maloney stated that many financial advisors already believe the fiduciary standard is the law , and the DOL rule serves to codify this belief . Maloney stated that delaying the rule would be costly for investors , and encouraged her colleagues on the committee to engage with the DOL for " reasonable changes . " <p> In his opening statement , Rep. Randy Hultgren ( R-Ill. ) expressed concern about the regulatory framework for retirement accounts , stating that the DOL fiduciary rule is not workable . Hultgren cited that savers with low account balances can not afford for the rule to go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SEC ) should act first in its capacity as the primary investor protection agency. - <p> In her opening statement , Rep. Ann Wagner ( R-Mo. ) stated that America is in a " retirement savings crisis " and Congress needs to empower retirement savers , not limit access . Wagner highlighted her discussion draft- for consideration by the committee that would repeal the DOL fiduciary rule and apply a " workable best interest standard " for broker-dealers that would not result in savers losing access to financial advice . Wagner said that the draft would keep the issue under the jurisdiction of that SEC . <p> Testimony <p> David C. Knoch , President , 1st- GlobalIn his testimony , Knoch , on behalf of the Financial Services Institute , stated that although they are strong supporters of a uniform fiduciary standard , the DOL fiduciary rule adds unnecessary complexity to the regulatory environment and raises new barriers for investors . Knoch said that investors with small account balances are losing access to investment advice , and cited multiple areas where the rule has already impacted investors . Knoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly with mutual fund companies has dropped 10 percent since 2016 , and new accounts have dropped 19 percent in the first six months of 2017 . Knoch also said advisors are challenged to find viable , cost-effective solutions to small-employer retirement plans , particularly Simple IRAs where account balances can be as low as 100 dollars . Knoch highlighted how compliance requirements are confusing for investors , who now receive more than 100 pages of paperwork , 70 of which are disclosures . Knoch stated the significant new disclosure requirements are cumbersome , expensive , and unnecessary , and the regulatory burden should be reduced to help financial advisors serve more clients , serve them better , and serve them more completely.Mark Halloran , Senior Director , Head of Industry and Regulatory Strategy , TransamericaIn his testimony , Halloran , on behalf of the American Council of Life Insurers ( ACLI ) , stated that rules impacting retirement savings should be appropriately tailored , effective , straightforward , and consistent to ensure savers have access to a full range of financial advice and services . Halloran stated that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop a best interest standard and are the appropriate authorities for oversight of financial professionals . Halloran indicated the DOL rule harms middle income savers and limits consumer choice , making it harder for the average American family to access financial advice and save for retirement . Halloran said the fee-based advice model is not always the right choice for consumers , especially small and medium account holders and purchasers of annuity products designed for long-term retirement goals . Halloran said Wagner 's draft " ensures savers have more access to advice and more choices about how to pay for advice . " - <p> JeromeLombard , President , Private Client Group , Janney Montgomery Scott LLCIn his testimony , Lombard , on behalf of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) , expressed support for the committee 's consideration of legislation to allow the SEC to develop a best interest standard for broker dealers . Lombard stated the industry has already seen the harmful effects of the DOL rule , including limited product choice , limited access to advice , and rising costs . Lombard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new regulation , and upwards of 10,000 of their customer retirement accounts will be moved to a " no advice service " desk from a full-service advisor . Lombard expressed SIFMA 's support for " establishing a best interest standard for broker dealers that mirrors the elements of the Impartial Conduct Standard under the DOL Rule , but unlike the DOL Rule , would apply across all broker dealer accounts , not just retirement accounts . " Lombard said the DOL should at a minimum delay the January1 , 2018 applicability date to allow the SEC to lead the effort to put in place a standard that works for all accounts. - - <p> Christina B. Martin Firvida , Director , Financial Security and Consumer Affairs , AARPIn her testimony , Firvida stated that the AARP " enthusiastically supports " the DOL fiduciary rule . Firvida stated that because of the DOL rule , firms have developed new products and services to meet consumer demand , and that the AARP is confident firms will continue to innovate and compete . Firvida stated that firms have incurred compliance costs due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen prices increase for investors served by those companies . " Firvida said that the SEC should act in addition to , but not in lieu of , the DOL on this matter . Firvida stated that the Wagner draft does not define a best interest standard as a fiduciary standard , and that AARP remains committed to the " strongest possible fiduciary standard for retirement investment advice . " - <p> Douglas Holtz-Eakin , President , American Action ForumIn his testimony , Holtz-Eakin said there is a consensus regarding the desirability for a standard of conduct to protect small retirement savers , but that the DOL fiduciary rule is not workable . Holtz-Eakin stated the high cost of the DOL rule derives from changes in business practices the rule will force on the financial services industry , which will be most harmful to small savers . Holtz-Eakin cited an American Action Forum study- that concluded the DOL rule was the most expensive regulation in 2016 , and the second most expensive non-environmental regulation since 2005 , and will cost an estimated $31.5 billion plus an additional $2 billion annually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing a standard of conduct. - <p> Question &amp; Answer <p> Best Interest Standard Draft Legislation <p> Huizenga asked if the panel supports the best interest standard in Wagner 's draft bill , and all but Firvida replied yes . <p> - <p> Maloney asked Firvida to talk about the differences in the DOL 's fiduciary rule and Wagner 's draft bill to replace the rule with a best interest standard for brokers giving retail investment advice . Firvida responded in saying that the draft bill is " too vague , " and that FINRA 's suitability standard could possibly already satisfy the standard as currently drafted. - <p> Maloney also pointed out that the draft bill would not take affect for 18 months after it was made law but that the DOL rule would immediately be repealed , and asked how this would impact customers . Firvida agreed with Maloney that brokers would not have to act in the client 's best interest those 18 months and that it would be " very significant on the nest eggs " of those saving for retirement. - <p> Rep. David Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow additional obligations related to the standard of care by broker dealers to be added on top of the one in the draft , and criticized it for undermining the SEC 's rulemaking. - <p> Wagner- asked the panel to discuss how her best interest standard would build on top of the suitability standard . Knoch answered that it requires a broker dealer to disclose a conflict of interest . Lombard added that it also asks to uphold a duty of loyalty and care , a higher standard than suitability , and is applicable to all accounts , not just retirement accounts. - <p> Wagner then asked if her draft provides a more comprehensive best interest standard than the DOL rule , and all of the panel except Firvida replied yes. - <p> Rep. Stephen Lynch ( D-Mass. ) criticized Wagner 's draft , explaining that an advisor could recommend whatever product offers the highest commission if it is suitable , arguing that it is a " loose " standard. - <p> Huizenga asked the panel if they support a delay in the fiduciary rule 's January 1 implementation date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trey Hollingsworth ( R-Ind. ) asked if it made sense to have the DOL 's rule become effective while it is still under review . Holtz-Eakin stated that it does not make sense in this situation , and questioned why the SEC has not acted in implementing their own rule. - <p> Small Business Owners and Investors <p> Huizenga and Rep. Warren Davidson ( R-Ohio ) asked how the fiduciary rule has impacted Simple IRAs and other small business plans . Knoch replied that so far that has been the largest impact of the rule , with the number of Simple IRA accounts dropping 20 percent already , and expected to drop to over 40 percent. - - <p> Rep. Steve Stivers ( R-Ohio ) inquired whether the panel thought that the current DOL fiduciary rule disadvantages annuities . Halloran argued that it " absolutely " does because the wealthy do not have as much of a need for this product as lower earners do , creating a disadvantage for a tool that lower- and middle-income people use for their retirement. - <p> When Stivers asked the panel to expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower-class Americans , Holtz-Eaken claimed that while the rule is intended to provide high-quality advice , it will not work if the advice can not be reached . He explained the DOL 's rule will make it too expensive for middle and low-income earners to access financial advice. - <p> Hollingsworth asked about the unintended consequences that the panel may see that limit small banks from providing IRAs and other opportunities . Firvida explained that small account holders are going to gain more money in the situation so it is mostly beneficial . Holtz-Eaken highlighted that investment advice is going to be less available to small investors which is a bigger problem , adding that approximately 42 percent of people will not qualify for minimum balance IRAs at his company. - <p> Rep. Bruce Poliquin ( R-Maine ) asked if there has been an increase in the minimum account size due to the fiduciary rule , and who will advise the smaller investors . Knoch replied that he has seen financial advisors discontinuing their services due to the rule. - <p> Rep. Brad Sherman ( D-Calif ) criticized the bifurcated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and asked if there are unintended consequences for smaller institutions when it comes to IRA rollovers and other savings opportunities . Firvida replied that the biggest concern with the rule is that there will be disruptions in the marketplace , but claimed that many of them will be " beneficial " for retirement savers . Holtz-Eakin argued that the combination of fee-based accounts and litigation costs make investment advice unavailable to small account holders. - <p> SEC 's Role <p> Huizenga inquired if the panel agreed that the SEC should hold the responsibility in regulating fiduciary standards and Firvida was the only panelist to reply no , as she believes both the SEC and DOL should. - <p> Hultgren asked if the SEC would better be able to weigh the costs and benefits of the fiduciary rule , to which Holtz-Eakin replied that they are the primary regulator and " perfect to do this . " - <p> Hultgren asked what would happen if the DOL 's rule goes into effect prior to the SEC finalizing their rule . Knoch cautioned that there would be a decline in utilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small account balances. - <p> Scott noted that Dodd-Frank gave the SEC authority to create a fiduciary rule years ago and was critical of the Commission for failing to create the rule . He argued that since both the SEC and DOL have jurisdiction , they should harmonize in creating a rule but that it has not been done yet. - <p> Stivers asked about the differences between the expertise in the DOL and SEC . Lombard answered that the SEC has been the primary regulator of broker dealers for a long time , and that throughout his career , he has seen the SEC auditing advisory activities , but has never dealt with the DOL. - <p> Rep. Thomas MacArthur ( R-N.J. ) echoed Scott 's comments on the SEC and asked what current rules apply differently depending on the type of investor . Lombard explained that there are suitability rules that apply to broker dealer activities , an SEC fiduciary standard for investment advisory activities , and an Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) fiduciary rule applying to the retirement space . <p> MacArthur then asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients . Lombard explained that even career advisors are " just now coming to grips " with the regulations. - <p> Robo Advice <p> Huizenga questioned the panel if they believe robo advisors are better than in-person advice . While Firvida replied that " it is not wrong " to get advice from robo advisors and new technologies , the rest of the panel answered no. - <p> MacArthur asked if robo advisors are better or equal to live advice . Firvida answered that many traditional firms are adopting the practice , and that robo advisors may add a lot of value to financial services. - <p> Hollingsworth asked if there is a concern that robo advice would not fulfill the requirement of financial advice for those who do not have access to internet . Holtz-Eakin replied that the concern is not the availability of robo advice , but rather the choice of live versus robo advice. - <p> Rep. John Delaney ( D-Md. ) asked why the entrepreneurial economy can not react to the change and start new businesses for lower- and middle-income investors . Lombard replied that firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining that his firm has decreased minimum advisory fees . Holtz-Eakin questioned how long it may take for such innovation to be created and what will happen to low- and middle-income investors in the meantime . Firvida argued that innovation is already serving small accounts. - <p> MacArthur asked Firvida if robo advisors are better than live advice , to which Firvida explained that many products and services are being offered in a technological manner , and that many traditional firms have adopted robo services. - <p> Sherman asked if investors will be subject to robo advice , to which Holtz-Eakin replied that it depends on the size of the account . Firvida replied that she believes the future will offer a combination of robo and live advice. - - <p> Class Action LawsuitsRep . Tom Emmer ( R-Minn. ) asked if the ability to sue advisors and firms is the biggest flaw with the fiduciary rule , to which Halloran replied , " if not the biggest , among the biggest . " Halloran added that applying such an ability to IRA accounts will expose financial advisors to class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the rule being over a thousand pages with little guidance , there is " more concern about what we do not know than what we do know . " - <p> In response to questions about class action lawsuits , Firvida argued that there are two things to remember : 1 ) there must be a systemic problem prior to bringing on a class action ; and 2 ) it is " extremely difficult " to certify a class. - <p> Cost-Benefit AnalysisHultgren asked about what the most significant flaws of the previous administration 's cost-benefit analysis of the fiduciary rule . Holtz-Eakin replied that the DOL significantly underestimated the cost of litigation , and that the rate of return was not risk weighted in the study , adding that " if you poke hardyou will not find $17 billion in loss . " <p> UK Retail Distribution ReviewMooney referenced the UK 's Retail Distribution Review from Holtz-Eakin 's testimony , and asked what caused the Financial Conduct Authority to initiate a review of the rule . Holtz-Eakin replied that it was due to the decision to ban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 percent of advisors left the industry , almost 45 percent of firms no longer provided advice to small accounts , and minimum balances increased . He added that the U.S. is beginning to experience what happened in the UK. - <p> Nevada- Fiduciary RuleRep . French Hill ( R-Ark. ) cited the Nevada fiduciary rule going into effect on July 1 and expressed concern that it will create additional conflict due to states creating their own standard while a uniform standard is being created . Halloran agreed that " having 50 states doing 50 different things " is counterproductive . <p> Impacts of the Fiduciary Rule <p> Emmer asked about a survey conducted by SIFMA of the impacts of the fiduciary rule on its members . Lombard replied that surveys have shown there is already a disruption , and that there have been limits on product selection in certain areas , specifically fixed income . He added that some members have stopped selling mutual funds and others have stopped offering commission-based accounts , adding that costs are increasing for customers as they move into fee-based accounts . Davidson stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the advice of a professional make errors costing $114 billion a year , and asked if DOL has factored that statistic into their economic analysis . Knoch replied that he does not believe so , and that it is the " biggest flaw in the calculation . " <p> Rep. Alexander Mooney ( R-W.Va. ) asked if the fiduciary rule will harm investors , which Halloran replied that it will take away choices from investors . Lombard added that the DOL chose one business model over the traditional brokerage account " even though it does not work for every client . " - <h> July 13 - SBC Hearing with Fed Chair Yellen <p> Housing Finance : - - Chairman Crapo asked Yellen if she agreed with the principles for housing finance reform that Federal Reserve Governor Jay Powell outlined in remarks he gave on July 6 . Yellen said she agreed with those principles , which were : 1 ) reduce the possibility of future bailouts ; 2 ) make any government guarantee explicit and transparent ; 3 ) increase competition in securitization ; 4 ) use existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build on areas of bipartisan support . Yellen agreed with Crapo that Congress needs to act to end the receiverships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . <p> Orderly Liquidation Authority : - Sen. Van Hollen asked Yellen about the importance of preserving the Orderly Liquidation Authority ( OLA ) . Yellen said that it is " essential " that an orderly liquidation mechanism exist , saying that the inability of regulators to quickly resolve non-depository institutions during the financial crisis increased the severity of the crisis . Yellen did concede that bankruptcy should be the preferred route for resolution , but argued that OLA is an important safeguard due to the inability of regulators to predict the circumstances around the collapse of a major financial institution . Yellen also stressed the importance of living wills as a supplement to any resolution process . <p> Volcker Rule : - - Crapo noted that Fed Governor Powell recently said the Fed was reviewing the Volcker Rule , and asked Yellen to elaborate on the Fed 's review of the rule . Yellen said that any review of the Volcker Rule should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce the rule 's complexity . Crapo asked Yellen if she supported having a lead regulator appointed to deal with this issue , and Yellen said that Congress should consider the question. - <p> Chairman Mike Crapo ( R-Idaho ) began his opening remarks by stating that economic growth is the top priority for the Senate Banking Committee and for Congress . He explained that the committee has received thousands of letters from many different communities in the United States regarding the economy . He then listed some issues that he believes need to be addressed , such as the systemically important financial institution ( SIFI ) threshold , the Volcker Rule , and the rules on capital for small banks . Crapo then stressed the difficulty of his constituents in accessing business loans and stated that it hinders job creation and economic growth . Next , Crapo expressed the need for changing the $50 billion SIFI threshold , and then continued to list the many qualified people in agreement with him , including acting chairman of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) Keith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current housing finance system and how it fails to serve in the best interest of " consumers , tax payers , lenders , and the broader economy . " Lastly , Crapo raised concern for the continuously growing interest rates produced by the Federal Reserve. - <p> Ranking Member Sherrod Brown ( D-Ohio ) began by mentioning the Federal Reserve 's plans to sell the last of its securities purchased during the financial crisis . Consequently , he stressed the fact that banks made " record profits " this year , and passed the most recent stress tests . However , he explained that the rules and regulations put in place after the crisis should not be forgotten just because of the recent Wall Street success . He brought attention to the middle- and lower-class families that still feel the effects of the financial crisis today , and how they should not be ignored . Additionally , he raised concern for the direction the Trump administration is going regarding the recent pro-Wall Street nominations . Lastly , Brown expressed the importance of achieving long-term economic growth that " lifts up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yellen said that since her last testimony before the committee , the labor market has strengthened , job gains have averaged 18,000 per month , the unemployment rate has fallen a quarter percentage , and the labor force participation rate has not significantly changed . She stated that going forward , favorable financial conditions coupled with the prospect of continued foreign and domestic spending gains should continue to support business investment , and the economy will " continue to expand at a moderate pace over the next couple of years , with the job market strengthening somewhat further and inflation rising to two percent . " - <p> Yellen addressed current monetary policy , stating that the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) will continue to foster maximum employment and price stability as required by law . Yellen said the FOMC will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate in response to changes in the economic outlook and to their judgments of the associated risks . Addressing the Fed balance sheet , Yellen highlighted that the FOMC provided additional details on the process the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet , including reducing the Federal Reserve 's security holdings by decreasing its reinvestment of the principal payments it receives from the securities held in the System Open Market Account . Yellen highlighted that the committee intends to change the target range for the federal funds rate as a primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy , and does not intend to use the balance sheet as an active tool for monetary policy . Yellen stated they are committed to using the " full range of tools " at their disposal , however , if future economic conditions warrant a more accommodative monetary policy . <p> Crapo asked Yellen if she agreed with the principles for housing finance reform that Federal Reserve Governor Jay Powell outlined in remarks he gave on July 6 . Yellen said she agreed with those principles , which were : 1 ) reduce the possibility of future bailouts ; 2 ) make any government guarantee explicit and transparent ; 3 ) increase competition in securitization ; 4 ) use existing regulatory and market infrastructure ; and 5 ) Congress should build on areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to act to end the receiverships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. - <p> Federal Reserve Balance Sheet <p> Crapo noted that the last time Yellen appeared before the Senate Banking Committee , she said she wanted to reduce the Fed 's balance sheet and make it primarily Treasury securities . Crapo asked if the Treasury security holdings would be wound down faster than the mortgage-backed securities ( MBS ) holdings . Yellen confirmed this , saying that the Fed will wind down MBS but at a slower rate than Treasuries . Yellen reaffirmed her commitment to moving the balance sheet to be based mainly on Treasuries. - <p> Sen. Tim Scott ( R-S.C. ) asked Yellen if she could provide a timeline for winding down the balance sheet and if there is a target number for its size . Yellen declined to provide a specific timeline , and repeated her previous statements that the unwinding would be slow , gradual , and predictable . Yellen said that the Fed 's priority is to not disrupt financial markets , and that the balance sheet would not be shrunk down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R-Ga. ) also asked about the Fed 's plans for its balance sheet after winding down assets , and Yellen said that while the balance sheet will shrink " considerably , " it remains to be seen what the final size of the balance sheet will be. - <p> Crapo noted that Fed Governor Powell recently said the Fed was reviewing the Volcker Rule , and asked Yellen to elaborate on the Fed 's review of the rule . Yellen said that any review of the Volcker Rule should be a multi-agency effort and that steps should be taken to reduce the rule 's complexity . Crapo asked Yellen if she supported having a lead regulator appointed to deal with this issue , and Yellen said that Congress should consider the question. - <p> Financial Regulatory Reform <p> Crapo asked Yellen if she agreed that Congress should take action to change the $50 billion SIFI threshold and the Volcker Rule , exempt some companies from stress tests , and reduce the burdens on community banks and credit unions . Yellen thought it would be appropriate for Congress to act in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banking Committee with any ideas for legislation the Federal Reserve has. - <p> Sen. John Kennedy ( R-La. ) asked about the efficiency of the Volcker Rule . Yellen said that she supports the general idea behind the rule , but explained that there are many flaws . She stated that community banks should be exempt entirely and that the implementation has been far too complex . - - - <p> Sen. Mike Rounds ( R-S.D. ) asked Yellen about enhanced supplemental leverage ratio ( SLR ) and if she could provide a timeframe for when it may be done . Yellen replied that the Fed is aware of issues faced by custody banks and is why they are looking at appropriately calibrating enhanced SLR for them , adding that other countries have taken different approaches . She would not commit to a timeframe but stressed that they are " looking at it carefully . " - <p> Capital and Liquidity Requirements <p> Brown asked Yellen if she thought the post-2008 regulatory architecture is necessary to prevent another financial crisis. - Yellen said that the post-crisis financial reforms have increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this does not mean another crisis will never happen . Yellen said that stronger capital and liquidity requirements and stress testing have decreased risk in the financial sector and increased the chance that , even in a significant economic downturn , banks will be able to function and provide for the credit needs of the economy . Yellen said it is important to keep in place these post-crisis reforms and that she is not in favor of reducing the capital requirements " for the most systemic banks . " Yellen said , " there are many things in the Treasury report that she agrees with " and that the Fed is working to tailor regulations for certain financial institutions , but for systemically important banks it is " critically important " to maintain the existing capital standards. - <p> Brown asked if the Fed is on track to finish changes to adding additional capital surcharge under the large bank stress tests . Yellen replied that the Fed is " working hard on them " but would not guarantee that they will be in place for next year 's stress tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some have proposed eliminating the leverage ratio or capital buffer , while others have agreed that maintaining both ensures safety in the financial system . Yellen agreed with the latter , explaining that both need to be in place and calibrated appropriately . <p> Sen. Mark Warner ( D-Va. ) asked if there is value in keeping the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ( CCAR ) in place for the largest institutions . Yellen replied that stress tests and CCAR have " substantially " strengthened the largest firms , and that the Fed is looking at CCAR carefully to determine if changes are needed. - <p> Productivity Growth <p> Sen. Bob Corker ( R-Tenn. ) raised concern about the low productivity growth in the United States . He asked Yellen if she thought tax reform would be a proper solution to the issue . She answered that yes , tax reform could have a positive effect on the economy but it depends on the detail of the plan . She expressed that the " distortions " in the tax code have a significant impact on productivity growth. - <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be a top priority and stated that growth would help solve the issue . He mentioned that the Trump administration was hoping to raise the gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth to three percent , and asked Yellen if this was even possible . Yellen responded by stating that it is possible , but extremely difficult. - <p> Sen. Heidi Heitkamp ( D-N.D. ) echoed Corker 's question of the uncertainty of the projected GDP growth by the Trump administration . Additionally , she stressed the importance of working together with Yellen to create a thoughtful strategy to achieve the three percent growth goal. - <p> Kennedy asked Yellen how she would attempt to raise the GDP growth from two percent to three percent . She responded by stating that Congress is responsible for making those decisions , not the Federal Reserve . However , her advice was to focus on all the factors that determine productivity growth . Some examples she mentioned were tax reform , education , public and private investment , and attention to technological change. - <p> Trade Policy <p> Heitkamp stressed concern for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , North Dakota relies heavily on commodity trading. - She asked Yellen if she believed that trade policy is critical to economic growth. - Yellen said it has been in the past , but gave no further comment on the subject. - <p> Financial Crisis <p> Kennedy asked Yellen if moving away from the Glass-Steagall Act was a mistake . She answered that she did not believe Glass-Steagall was responsible for the financial crisis , and does not see it as a major issue at all. - - <p> Consequently , Kennedy asked if she believed it contributed at all in the crisis , or if it was irrelevant. - Yellen agreed that the biggest contributor to the crash was the stand-alone investment banks , but stated that the regulations that followed the crisis are effective in ensuring safety and security. - - <p> Shadow BankingWarner stated that many financial transactions have moved into the shadow banking system and asked where vulnerabilities may be . Yel , as risk can " move outside " the regulatory perimeter , but that she did not have anything specific to highlight. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Orderly Liquidation Authority ( OLA ) . Yellen said that it is " essential " that an orderly liquidation mechanism exist , saying that the inability of regulators to quickly resolve non-depository institutions during the financial crisis increased the severity of the crisis . Yellen did concede that bankruptcy should be the preferred route for resolution , but argued that OLA is an important safeguard due to the inability of regulators to predict the circumstances around the collapse of a major financial institution . Yellen also stressed the importance of living wills as a supplement to any resolution process . <p> Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act ( TIFIA ) : The main topic of discussion during the hearing was the TIFIA credit assistance program , ways that it could be improved , and how TIFIA has helped local governments build and finance infrastructure projects . There was also a substantial amount of discussion on how to improve TIFIA 's attractiveness as a financing option for small projects , especially in rural areas . <p> Other Financing Mechanisms : Numerous Senators discussed the importance of direct federal spending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other programs that leverage private capital ) and its ability to finance infrastructure projects . Witnesses were also asked repeatedly by Senators about the need to preserve direct federal spending for infrastructure projects , and in each case the witnesses noted that while TIFIA was an attractive tool , it could not fully replace direct federal spending. - - There was also a brief discussion about private-activity bonds . <p> In his opening statement , Chairman John Barrasso ( R-Wyo. ) said that the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act ( TIFIA ) has mostly supported large projects that help urban areas by increasing the range of financing options available for infrastructure projects . Barrasso strongly supported leveraging public funding for infrastructure to attract as much private capital as possible . Barrasso also called for changes to TIFIA that will increase its attractiveness to smaller projects and rural areas. - <p> In his opening statement , Ranking Member Tom Carper ( D-Del. ) noted that TIFIA is an important source of low-cost financing for many projects , and said there is bipartisan support for improving the law . Carper also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIFIA . Carper qualified his praise for TIFIA by noting that the program is " not the solution " for all project financing needs , and said that Congress should make changes to TIFIA to encourage more private capital to finance infrastructure . <p> In her testimony , Mayer described in detail how TIFIA helped Riverside county attract financing for an interstate project . Mayer then pivoted to discuss her concern that the change in administration will impact the approval process for TIFIA ( and other ) programs . Mayer closed by providing recommendations for Congress for TIFIA , which were : 1 ) continue to fund the TIFIA program ; 2 ) maintain mode neutrality for TIFIA ; 3 ) continue the rolling application process ; 4 ) maintain a high bar for financial feasibility of TIFIA projects ; 5 ) allow projects to take advantage of the 49 percent project cost allowance , instead of the lower 33 percent allowance ; 6 ) improve the project approval and permitting process ; 7 ) encourage the integration of TIFIA requirements into other approval processes ; and 8 ) streamline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aument introduced Transurban and its business operations and discussed the company 's flagship project in Virginia - the management of the 495 and 95 Express Lanes . Aument said that Virginia 's return on investment for the Express Lane projects has been substantially higher than other similar projects , and noted the Lanes serve many car and bus trips every day . Aument praised TIFIA for making the project possible , but said that administrative and policy changes are necessary to help TIFIA meet its " full potential . " Aument called for consistent loan terms and conditions across projects , and said that there should be more " certainty and speed " in the approval process . Aument also called on Congress to expand Private-Activity Bonds ( PABs ) to make brownfield projects eligible for this financing as well. - <p> In his testimony , Coes discussed the importance of " transit-oriented development " and the benefits that can arise from public transportation infrastructure , such as transit systems . Coes noted that these projects have high upfront costs . Coes also discussed the reduction in overall project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has improved TIFIA 's viability for smaller projects . Coes said that TIFIA could be improved by the Department of Transportation ( DOT ) providing policy guidance on transit-oriented development project eligibility for TIFIA , and by reducing the upfront costs for TIFIA applicants . Coes noted specifically that acquiring an investment-grade credit rating on senior TIFIA obligations is an onerous step for small and rural projects. - Coes also called for TIFIA to be expanded to include broadband deployment and green infrastructure. - <p> Carper noted that TIFIA approximately two-thirds of TIFIA financing goes to highway projects , and asked witnesses how TIFIA could be used to support more multimodal and intermodal projects . Coes recommended that DOT acquire more staff expertise for these projects , noting that the Department has lots of experience reviewing highway transportation projects. - - <p> Carper asked witnesses about non-compete clauses in TIFIA agreements and their potential to hamstring new transportation infrastructure development . Mayer and Aument said that non-compete clauses are no longer typical in public-private infrastructure projects , and said that states should be given the flexibility to build new infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America Bureau should consider performance metrics when awarding TIFIA financing . Coes agreed and argued that all TIFIA projects should be sustainable in the long term. - <p> Carper closed by asking witnesses for their view on the correct level of capitalization for the TIFIA fund . Witnesses declined to endorse a given level , though all encouraged Congress to take steps to encourage the TIFIA pipeline of projects to be as full as possible. - <p> Carper asked the witnesses for their thoughts on how to make TIFIA a more attractive financing option for rural areas . Mayer noted that TIFIA contains a master agreement provision that allows a bundle of small projects to share an application , which could allow for the development of a suite of projects to receive funding simultaneously . Mayer did note that a key challenge to bundling projects is to find dedicated revenue streams to fund the entire package. - <p> Sen. John Boozman ( R-Ark. ) asked witnesses for ways to improve DOT outreach about TIFIA to localities and smaller government entities . Coes suggested that a DOT-Department of Agriculture ( USDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a large field staff in rural areas ( the same areas that would be the target of any enhanced outreach. - <p> Sen. Ben Cardin ( D-Md. ) asked witnesses for suggestions on how to improve TIFIA 's attractiveness for local governments and smaller projects . Coes said that it is helpful that the FAST Act lowered the threshold for TIFIA financing to $10 million , but noted that the program still only provides gap financing . Coes said that if TIFIA could provide a larger amount of project cost , it will become more attractive to smaller governments . Coes also noted that local governments and small projects have relatively high upfront costs to acquiring TIFIA financing , such as the cost of acquiring an investment-grade credit rating on senior debt. - <p> Cardin noted that high underwriting costs can be fatal to smaller projects , and asked witnesses to send the Committee their ideas on how to reduce transaction costs for local governments that seek out TIFIA financing. - <p> Sen. Jim Inhofe ( R-Okla. ) asked witnesses for their thoughts on possible solutions to the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects . Aument said that while individual projects may be difficult to finance , bundling multiple projects together or designing regional infrastructure projects could succeed in attracting private capital. - <p> Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D-R.I. ) declined to ask a question with his time , but did note in his remarks that smaller entities can be deterred from applying for TIFIA financing due to associated overhead costs. - - <p> TIFIA Program Changes <p> Barrasso asked Mayer to outline the programmatic hurdles that Riverside County encountered when it applied for TIFIA financing . Mayer said that the rolling application process sped up approval of her county 's project , but recommended that Congress require a deadline for DOT response to any Letter of Interest filed as part of a TIFIA application . Mayer noted that if the Letter of Interest process has a clearer timeline , planners and private sponsors would be able to plan projects better. - <p> Boozman asked witnesses if direct federal funding is needed in any infrastructure package . Mayer gave an unequivocal " yes " to this question , noting that many parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tammy Duckworth ( D-Ill. ) criticized President Trump 's FY18 budget for proposing cuts to infrastructure grant programs , and asked the witnesses for how those cuts would impact infrastructure development . Mayer said that a loss of direct federal grant funding would severely handicap the ability of states to meet their infrastructure needs , even those that have dedicated revenue streams for infrastructure projects . Mayer noted that many projects are ineligible for TIFIA , including repair and maintenance projects. - <p> Sen. Roger Wicker ( R-Miss. ) asked witnesses for their thoughts on the limitations on PAB-eligible projects . Aument said that restrictions on PABs are " handicapping the market " and that PABs should be allowed on brownfield projects in addition to greenfield ones. - <p> Permitting Reform <p> Inhofe asked witnesses for their thoughts on permit streamlining . Mayer noted that the speed and efficiency of permitting projects can be critical . Mayer noted that there are several government grant programs that speed the approval process by providing a resource center for applicants that helps them navigate the approval process. - - <h> July 12 - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheet : - Committee members addressed a number of issues regarding the Fed balance sheet . Yellen explained ways the Fed plans to reduce the balance sheet , including diminishing reinvestments as the Fed receives principle payments on treasuries . Yellen indicated timing is very important , and reducing the balance sheet must be done in a " gradual and predictable way . " <p> Regulatory Burden : - Yellen stated that the Volcker Rule and incentive compensation regulations should not be applied to smaller community banks , and that regarding Basel III , she believes a simplified capital regime should be in place for community banks . <p> Audit the Fed : - Yellen stated she is " strongly opposed " to the legislation as it removes the Fed 's exemption from reviews by the U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) of monetary policy decisions , which is the " essence of Fed independence . " <p> In his opening statement , Chairman Jeb Hensarling ( R-Texas ) said that economic confidence is up and unemployment and inflation are low since Chair Yellen 's last testimony before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too heavily on a low labor participation rate and high disability payment participation rates , and that paychecks and savings for working Americans still have " considerable room to grow . " Hensarling highlighted that monetary policy must " do its part " and continue on its path to normalization . Hensarling encouraged the Fed to " set out an easily discernible and transparent policy strategy to achieve its mandate , " commence a wind-down of its balance sheet , and allow short-term rates to be set by market forces. - <p> In her opening statement , Ranking Member Maxine Waters ( D-N.Y. ) expressed concern about the progress of the economy under the Trump administration , including the reversal of a planned cut to Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance premiums , executive actions to begin to dismantle Wall Street reform , and support for the CHOICE Act . Waters said that while the economy has made " substantial progress " since the height of the financial crisis , key aspects of the economy " have yet to fully recover . " <p> In his opening statement , Rep. Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a 40-year low , wages are stagnant , and economic growth has not yet exceeded three percent . Barr said the Federal Reserve is " paying banks not to lend " by paying interest on excess reserves in order to fund its $4.5 trillion balance sheet . Barr expressed his support for the Fed shrinking the balance sheet and following a " well-grounded strategy . " <p> In her opening statement , Rep. Gwen Moore ( D-Wis. ) expressed her concern about disparities in labor markets for minority communities . Moore stated that while the disparities are clear among minorities , it is increasing for all working Americans . Moore said Congress should use fiscal policy to address income and wealth inequality in ways monetary policy can not . <p> In her testimony , Yellen said that since her last testimony before the committee , the labor market has strengthened , job gains have averaged 18,000 per month , the unemployment rate has fallen a quarter percentage , and the labor force participation rate has not significantly changed . She stated that going forward , favorable financial conditions coupled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should continue to support business investment , and the economy will " continue to expand at a moderate pace over the next couple of years , with the job market strengthening somewhat further and inflation rising to two percent . " - <p> Yellen addressed current monetary policy , stating that the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) will continue to foster maximum employment and price stability as required by law . Yellen said the FOMC will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate in response to changes in the economic outlook and to their judgments of the associated risks . Addressing the Fed balance sheet , Yellen highlighted that the FOMC provided additional details on the process the Fed will follow to normalize the size of the balance sheet , including reducing the Federal Reserve 's security holdings by decreasing its reinvestment of the principal payments it receives from the securities held in the System Open Market Account . Yellen highlighted that the committee intends to change the target range for the federal funds rate as a primary means of adjusting the stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balance sheet as an active tool for monetary policy . Yellen stated they are committed to using the " full range of tools " at their disposal , however , if future economic conditions warrant a more accommodative monetary policy . <p> Question &amp; Answer <p> Inflation TargetHensarling asked Yellen if she or members of the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) are pursuing an increase in the two percent inflation target , to which she replied no. - <p> Waters asked if the Fed should allow inflation to continue to rise to the two percent objective before additional interest rate increases , and Rep. Brad Sherman ( D-Calif. ) also inquired about the objective . Yellen replied that the two percent objective " is not a ceiling , " and is instead a " symmetric objective . " She explained that the " unusually low " inflation readings are partly due to temporary factors , and that until those factors " move out , " inflation rates will remain low. - <p> Credit AllocationHensarling noted his concern over the " blurring between the lines " of monetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocation , as it can hinder the Fed 's independence . Yellen replied that the FOMC intends to return to a " primarily Treasury-only portfolio " so credit allocation is not influenced. - <p> Fed Balance SheetHensarling stated that reducing the Fed 's balance sheet will enable the Fed to make the primary policy instrument the federal funds rate rather than interest on reserves . Yellen explained that interest on excess reserves is a " key tool " for setting the federal funds rate , and a " key instrument of monetary policy . " <p> Barr asked why the Fed 's plan to decrease their balance sheet includes Treasury securities at a faster pace than mortgage bonds . Yellen explained that there are slight differences between the two , but that she expects the caps on mortgage-backed securities ( MBS ) reinvestment to not be binding , and instead " only come into play in exceptional circumstances . " - <p> Rep. Carolyn Maloney ( D-N.Y. ) asked if the Fed should wait for inflation to improve prior to normalizing the balance sheet . Yellen replied that " exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are working to normalize the balance sheet in a " gradual , predictable way . " - <p> Maloney then asked if increasing interest rates and balance sheet normalization are on separate tracks , or if rates will be impacted by the normalization process . Yellen explained that the FOMC has not made a decision about whether the two will happen at the same time , but that it was agreed to at the June meeting that one additional increase in the federal funds rate this year is appropriate based on the economy. - <p> Rep. David Kustoff ( R-Tenn. ) asked about the timeline and procedure to shrink the balance sheet . Yellen stated the Fed will shrink the balance sheet by diminishing reinvestments as the Fed receives principle payments on treasuries , only reinvesting to the extent the receipt of principle reaches a cap. - <p> Taylor RuleRep . Gwen Moore ( D-Wis. ) asked Yellen to explain her criticism of the Taylor Rule . Yellen replied that the FOMC looks at multiple rules , to include the Taylor Rule , to decide appropriate policy stances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> Financial CHOICE ActMoore asked Yellen about the rules-based monetary policy approach found in the CHOICE Act . Yellen replied that she is opposed to the requirements found in the bill , including subjecting the Fed to the appropriations process and inhibiting their independence. - <p> Fed VacanciesMaloney and Kustoff asked Yellen if she is open to serving an additional term if President Trump were to re-nominate her . Yellen replied that she has not given further thought to it , but that she intends to finish her current term. - <p> Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer ( R-Mo. ) requested that the Fed hold off on any new regulations prior to the confirmation of the Vice Chair for Supervision nominee . Yellen noted her pleasure in the nomination and how she is looking forward to the nominee 's input should they be confirmed , adding that the Fed currently has a " relatively light regulatory agenda . " - <p> Treasury ReportLuetkemeyer asked about the recent Treasury report- in response to the Executive Order on Core Principles Regulating the U.S. , noting his support for several of the inclusions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has considered when it comes to tailoring regulations and reducing the burdens on community banks , and that the Volcker Rule recommendations " are useful , " but that she has a different view on some of the other inclusions. - <p> Rep. Claudia Tenney ( R-N.Y. ) asked what recommendations Yellen would support to reduce the regulatory burden on community banks . Yellen replied that the Volcker Rule and incentive compensation regulations should not be applied to smaller community banks , and that there is much bank regulators can do to reduce the complexities of capital regulations. - <p> Rep. Trey Hollingsworth ( R-Ind. ) asked Yellen for her stance on Basel III , to which Yellen replied she believes it should be finalized and other countries should put into place appropriate capital regulation to " level the playing field , " but supports a simplified capital regime for community banks. - <p> Non-Bank SIFIsRep . Tom MacArthur ( R-N.J. ) asked Yellen about state insurance departments doing the regulatory work of a group insurer , and how it impacts the way FSOC looks at non-bank systemically important financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met with state regulators and that their focus is on protecting policy holders , while FSOC 's focus is on the systemic risk of a company on the financial system. - <p> G-SIBs <p> Hollingsworth asked if Yellen agrees or disagrees that U.S. rules implementing international standards should be revisited , including the global systemically important banks ( GSIB ) risk-based surcharge . Yellen stated that she participated in the review and recent finalization of the rule and believes it to be appropriate. - <p> Hollingsworth asked if Yellen is supportive in revisiting the calibration of the supplemental leverage ratio ( SLR ) for G-SIBs . Yellen replied that it is " something we should look at " as possibly having unintended consequences. - <p> Fixed Income <p> Rep. Bill Huizenga ( R-Mich. ) asked if there are problems in the fixed income markets . Yellen responded that though the inventories of bonds held by some of the largest banks and market makers have declined , bid-ask spreads are low , corporate bond issuance has been healthy , and the market has done well. - <p> Role of the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R.-Wis. ) asked about the role of the Federal Reserve in corporate board rooms at financial institutions , stating that " virtually anything can fall under the umbrella of safety and soundness , " highlighting that the Fed does not have liability . Yellen responded that the Fed has a supervisory role , but does not have civil or criminal liability. - <p> Rep. Bill Posey ( R-Fla. ) highlighted that Audit the Fed was a widely cosponsored and bipartisan legislation , and asked what would justify not auditing the Fed similar to other agencies . Yellen responded that she is " strongly opposed " to the legislation because it removes the Fed 's exemption from reviews by the U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) of monetary policy decisions , which is the " essence of Fed independence " and keeping politics out of decisions that " should be technical , professional , and non-partisan . " <p> Stephen Oliner , Resident Scholar and Codirector of AEI 's International Center on Housing Risk <p> Governor Powell 's Remarks <p> Governor Jay Powell opened his remarks by describing the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , calling this the " great unfinished business " of post-crisis financial reform . Powell provided an overview of the current state of the housing finance system , with a highly concentrated securitization market and a widely provided government guarantee for investors in mortgage-backed securities ( MBS ) that leaves taxpayers with liability and systemic risk . <p> Powell then described the development of the pre-crisis system , from the creation of the government-sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , their eventual dominance of the housing finance system , the spread of alt-A and no-doc loans in the 2000s , and the collapse of the housing finance system in 2007-2008 . Powell also discussed the issues that the implicit government guarantee created . <p> Powell then discussed how the Housing and Economic Recovery Act ( HERA ) of 2008 and regulator- led actions , such as the creation of a market for credit risk transfer ( CRT ) , the creation of a common securitization platform ( CSP ) and the Ability-to-Repay ( ATR ) and Qualified Mortgage ( QM ) rules improved liquidity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MBS . <p> Turning to what a future housing finance system might look like , Powell said it is important that any reform package ensure that mortgage credit is available to as broad a credit box as possible , and that new standards , such as the QM rule , ensure that the loans made have low credit risk . Powell also said that prudential regulation for banks could provide some guideposts for restructuring the GSEs , specifically noting the improvement in stability created by higher capital levels , stress tests , and living wills . Powell also said that private capital could come from a variety of sources , but that any system should have an ample amount in loss-taking positions to protect taxpayers . Powell also noted that the GSEs have been unable to offload any of their catastrophic risk to private sources . <p> Powell closed his remarks by outlining five principles for reform , which were : <p> Any housing finance reform package should reduce or eliminate the possibility of future bailouts . Powell noted that drawing private capital in to absorb credit risk could help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to backstop the mortgage market , this guarantee should be " explicit and transparent " and a guarantee for securities only , not for institutions . <p> There should be more competition in securitization <p> Any reform plan should try to reform and repurpose existing regulatory and market infrastructure as much as possible , to avoid having to build new agencies and programs . This will also make any transition less jarring . <p> Congress should build on areas of bipartisan agreement and take the " best feasible plan " instead of holding out for a " perfect deal . " <p> Question and Answer <p> Oliner began the discussion by asking Powell why Congress and regulators should pursue housing finance reform now . Powell said that the GSE 's oversized role in the securitization of mortgages creates a financial stability issue , which should be dealt with while the economy and the housing sector are relatively strong and stable . Powell also said that continued conservatorship was an untenable option that the timing seems favorable for a new housing finance legislative package . Powell said it is important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourage future action . <p> Oliner then asked Powell for his thoughts on the role of the Federal Reserve in reforming the housing finance system . Powell said that the Federal Reserve 's staff resources could help craft the details of policy , and that the central bank could provide insights on creating stability in the MBS market . <p> An audience member asked Powell to explain why a security-level guarantee is better than an entity-level guarantee . Powell said it is important that any government guarantee for catastrophic risk be as narrow as possible , and that a security-level guarantee will protect investors from major credit risks , while keeping the government out of the business of saving individual institutions. - <p> Powell closed his remarks by praising recent Senate Banking Committee hearings on reforming the housing finance sector and the bipartisan approach that is being taken in that chamber on the subject . Powell noted that many of the plans in circulation today have broad agreement on involving private capital , among other similarities , and was optimistic that the emerging consensus could lead to reform . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and most panelists expressed the view that some type of government backstop would be needed in any future U.S. housing system <p> Housing Finance Reform : Sen. Crapo stated that he hopes the Senate Banking Committee can get housing finance reform legislation out of the committee this year. - <p> Credit Score Models : - Panelists discussed the merits of alternative credit scoring models which account for trends and data points not found in the more traditional credit scoring models . <p> Affordable Housing : Sen. Brown stated that main street must be the point of focus for housing finance reform . Much of the discussion at the hearing was on the topic of how to expand credit access to all credit worthy borrowers . <p> In his opening statement- Committee Chairman Mike Crapo ( R-Idaho ) stated that housing finance reform is one of his key priorities this Congress . Crapo expressed a need to preserve not only the TBA market , but also the 30-year fixed rate mortgage . Crapo stated , " We need multiple levels of taxpayer protection standing in front of any government guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial , robust , loss-absorbing private capital at guarantors comparable to the amount of capital maintained by global systemically important banks . " Crapo also made mention of the idea to securitize conventional mortgages with a Ginnie Mae wrap . <p> In his opening statement , ranking member Sherrod Brown ( D-Ohio ) stated that " main street " must be the point of focus for housing finance reform . Brown stated , " Some proposals to reform the housing finance system focus more on how to allow private capital or financial institutions to take over for or stand in front of the GSEs than on the cost of that additional private capital to borrowers. - Underrepresenting those costs will have consequences for access to credit and could reduce home values if new borrowers can not access mortgages at affordable rates . " - - <p> Testimony <p> In hisopening statement , President and CEO of MBA David H. Stevens stated that the GSE business models were flawed and that there is a need for comprehensive reform . Stevens highlighted three priorities for housing finance reform : 1 ) taxpayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer cost and access to credit . <p> In hisopening statement , President of the Housing Policy Council of the Financial Services Roundtable Edward DeMarco echoed the need for housing finance reform already stated by the others . DeMarco stated that any reform system needs a private guarantee and behind that guarantee there should be a government guarantee . This backstop should include a system to prefund future losses such that a mechanism would be in place to ensure any losses paid by tax power support are fully refunded . DeMarco also listed five principles for reform , where were : <p> Fix what is broken and preserve what works in support of consumers and the market . <p> The transition from the old system to the new one should avoid disrupting consumers and markets . <p> Private capital should bear all but catastrophic mortgage credit risk so that market discipline contains risk . The government should provide an explicit , full faith and credit guarantee on mortgage-backed securities ( MBS ) but with a pre-set mechanism to ensure any catastrophic losses that call upon taxpayer support will be repaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear and equitable across all participating companies and ensures that participants in the housing finance system operate in a safe and sound manner . <p> The government-protected GSE duopoly should be replaced with a structure that serves consumers by promoting competition , affordability , transparency , innovation , market efficiency , and broad consumer access to a range of mortgage products . <p> - <p> In hisopening statement , Michael Calhoun , the President of the Center for Responsible Lending , noted that housing finance reform should take into consideration underserved markets , such as rural areas . Calhoun also stated that community banks and other small lenders must be supported in housing finance reform . Calhoun noted that the GSEs are the largest providers of funding in rural areas and that community banks are the primary lenders in those areas as well . Calhoun also stated that the GSE credit risk sharing programs are the types of efforts that should be expanded upon and continued . <p> Sen. Corker ( R-Tenn. ) began the question and answer by stating that he hopes the committee can work together to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also stated that any reform will need an explicit government guarantee and that an implicit guarantee does not put tax payers in a very good place . Coker expanded on this thought by stating that there should be a prefunded fund to help with failed mortgages and not " failed companies . " <p> Sen. Reed ( D-RI ) asked questions regarding servicers and stated that many of the problems from 2008 - 2009 were the direct result of servicer behavior . In response , Calhoun stated that FHFA has implemented various reforms which have improved servicing . DeMarco stated that progress has been made but that the job is not done , and added that more is needed than just a national servicing standard . While on the topic of regulation , Stevens expressed support for the role of FHFA as an independent regulator . Stevens also noted that the direction of housing finance reform is largely dependent on the person serving the role of director of the FHFA which , in his view , only highlights the need for reform legislation . <p> Sen. Cotton ( R-AR ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect taxpayers while also promoting liquidity . DeMarco stated that there needs to be a single security where private capital bears all but the tail end risk . <p> Sen. Heitkamp ( D-ND ) asked for views on possible expanding the role of the Federal Home Loan Banks . Stevens expressed concern with potential execution inefficiencies if only aggregating through home loan bank . Calhoun added that FHLBs need a workable cash window for such an endeavor to be successful . <p> Sen. Scott ( R-SC ) asked for panelist to describe the potential benefits of updating credit score models . Stevens began by stating that the current models are antiquated whereas the newer models can find ways to score outlier demographics that might otherwise be overlooked or unable to be assessed through the more traditional models . Stevens concluded by stating that these credit score models need to be considered further to better access the risks . <p> Sen. Perdue ( R-GA ) asked for views on recent fintech developments in the underwriting space . Calhoun , like Stevens , expressed support for alternative credit scoring models . Calhoun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that that data is useful for assessing creditworthiness . <p> Sen. Brown ( D-OH ) asked panelists to provide views on what can be learned from the current GSE programs which accept 3% down payment loans . Calhoun noted that subprime loans were not the only contributing factor to the financial crisis and that prime loans played a large role as well . Calhoun said that poor documentation played a major role in the crisis and that careful underwriting and documentation could help ensure greater credit access for borrowers . Brown also asked Calhoun how affordable housing goals should be considered during housing finance reform . Calhoun noted the success of the credit risk transfer programs and highlighted the ability of those programs to pool risk such that smaller players can also participate . <p> Sen. Cortez Masto ( D-NV ) asked for views on how to ensure that all market participants offer sustainable fair access to all credit worthy borrowers . Calhoun said any housing finance reform package should preserve requirements for loans to be sustainable and to preserve the important tools now at FHFA to advance affordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that should be looked at . <p> Sen. Warren ( D-MA ) asked for thoughts on affordable housing . Calhoun stated that the GSEs are transferring risk on a pool basis which means they buy risk and sell to a diverse group of guarantors which helps ensure more than just big firms can participate . Calhoun expressed concern that front-end risk sharing , opposed to backend , would push pricing in favor of larger institutions . <p> Small Lenders and the Cash Window <p> Sen. Menendez ( D-NJ ) asked for panelist to provide further details regarding why access to small lenders is so important . Stevens stated that the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac cash window is extremely active today , with thousands of customers . Stevens went on to say that this customer diversity prevents concentration risk while also limiting the potential pricing advantage for certain institutions . Calhoun stressed that the cash window can only work well when the pricing for it is competitive with the pricing for securitizing . <p> Sen. Schatz ( D-HI ) asked panelists for views on how finance reform should account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate prices can outpace the income for many living there . Calhoun noted that one example of finding a compromise to this dilemma was the willingness of the GSEs to increase the debt-to-income ratios . DeMarco stated that the question gets to the point of community lenders . Specifically , community lenders have insight into borrowers that others do not , which enables them to make better informed lending decisions in these types of communities . 52635 @qwx252635

The letter was announced this morning by Kenneth E. Bentsen , Jr. , SIFMA president and CEO , at SIFMA 's 2016 Brexit Symposium in New York in his opening remarks. - <p> We , the undersigned associations , wish to offer you our support as you work with the European Union ( EU ) , the United Kingdom ( UK ) and other G20 partners in ensuring that the global economy is resilient to the UK 's expected exit from the EU ( " Brexit " ) . - <p> Brexit will have a major global impact . To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments of the UK and the EU. - Because of the size and importance of the UK and EU markets , our member firms are monitoring events closely . Indeed , they have substantial investments in the UK and EU and rely upon the single passport to service customers and clients across the EU. - <p> Before formal negotiations begin , we ask you to convey to your UK and EU counterparts the importance of maintaining market stability throughout the process . In particular , it is critical to carry out negotiations in as open and transparent manner as possible and to avoid disruption and uncertainty for market participants . To facilitate a smooth Brexit transition , we ask you to encourage UK and EU policymakers to ensure the process includes a transition period that will provide firms with ample time to navigate and adapt to any institutional or legal changes underpinning well- established inter-EU/UK trade and investment relationships . Establishing such a guaranteed provisional period to ensure continuity of service to customers and clients is the best way to limit the potential negative impact on financial stability. - <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial services industry- - <p> The UK is of huge importance to the international financial system . The contribution of London , in particular , can not be underestimated and not easily replicated elsewhere . Indeed , more than three-quarters of EU capital markets transactions are conducted in the UK while over one-third of EU wholesale activity in financial services occurs in London . Over 40 per cent of United States ( U.S. ) exports of financial services destined for the EU go to the UK . The U.S. financial services industry therefore derives much value from the UK 's existing relationship with the EU , including the millions of jobs in the U.S. created directly and indirectly by UK and EU firms with substantial U.S. operations . <p> At the same time , the EU represents an economic area comparable in size to the U.S. and of vital importance to the global economy . The relationship between the EU and the UK therefore is of critical importance to the U.S. which has a significant vested interest in how the future relationship is redefined and in the certainty , stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade and investment relationship. - <p> Ensuring U.S. and global growth are resilient to Brexit- - <p> Brexit , if not managed effectively , represents a significant risk to the financial markets and global economy . U.S. and internationally headquartered firms have invested substantially in the UK . In particular , the fact that U.S. and internationally headquartered firms are so heavily concentrated in the UK , most notably within the City of London , is heavily influenced by the existence of passporting rights between the UK and the rest of the EU , allowing financial firms based in the UK to operate freely , and to contribute to European economic growth . UK and EU banks similarly make an important contribution to the U.S. financial system and economy through their substantial presence in the U.S. We therefore strongly agree with your aspiration to see " an outcome that produces a highly integrated relationship between the EU and the UK " and wholeheartedly concur that such an outcome " is in the best interests of Europe , the United States and the global economy . " - <p> In getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. and world economies that uncertainty is kept to a minimum and that existing trading relationships are disrupted as little as possible . As the negotiations between the UK and EU begin , we would strongly support you urging your counterparts to ensuring the process include a number of important features . It would be optimal if : - <p> Brexit negotiations are conducted in as transparent a fashion as possible and all sides work together to deliver a functioning solution for all parties ; <p> stakeholders from the business community - including both U.S. and internationally headquartered financial services firms - with a presence in the UK and the EU as well as UK and EU firms with significant U.S. operations are actively consulted about the issues to be addressed and the potential impact of solutions under consideration ; <p> both sides seek to embed future arrangements in global standard setting ( e.g. those initiated by the Bank of International Settlements , Financial Stability Board and the International Organization of Securities Commissions ) ; <p> to minimize uncertainty , as early as possible in the Brexit negotiation process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial services firms to navigate and adapt to any institutional or legal changes underpinning inter-EU/UK trade and investment relationships . Such an arrangement should be flexible to allow it to be extended , if necessary , to avoid market disruption and financial stability risks. - <p> Conclusion- - <p> While Brexit is fundamentally about the UK 's relationship with the EU , its consequences are likely to be significant and far-reaching . U.S. policymakers have a legitimate stake in how the process is managed and the outcome to which it leads . Our members therefore stand ready to share with you their expertise about the functions of the markets and the potential effects of policy choices under consideration as well as other support that you identify as needed to ensure economic growth and stability. - <p> The financial services industry seeks to continue to play a full-role in the economies of the EU and the UK .

We believe that procyclicality concerns should be taken into account holistically across all types of financial resource categories . We further believe CCPs should be expressly excluded from risk managing on the basis of a presumption that the CCP will be able to use the margin of non-defaulting customers to cover credit or liquidity shortfalls . Customer collateral should never be used as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agree with the regulatory imperative of avoiding a future tax payer bailout of a CCP , we believe that the most appropriate way to do so is to incentivize CCPs , who generate revenue by clearing trades with margin and risk management requirements , to risk manage appropriately and put their own assets at stake rather than jeopardize the assets of pension funds , U.S. mutual funds , UCITS and other investors who have no control over how CCPs calculate margin and accept new products for clearing . AMG further believes that public disclosures and CCP recovery tools should be improved , as detailed in our comment letter . <p> Regarding CCP recovery , SIFMA AMG believes that a CCP 's return to a matched book would be aided by an open auction and mechanisms to continue the payment of variation margin to and from the customers of a defunct clearing member . SIFMA AMG does not believe that extraordinary measures , including mutualisation of losses to non-defaulting customers , tear-up of contracts and forced allocations , should be available for the CCP 's use in recovery . Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only after full write-down of equity positions , which may incentivize equity holders or other parties to recapitalize , and after change of control to the resolution authority should such measures be deployed and , even then , they should be used only if no better means are available to return to a matched book or to wind up the CCP . <p> Regarding CCP resolution , a pre-designated regulatory authority should have constrained flexibility to initiate resolution .

In 1991 , SIFMA established a Market Index Subcommittee to analyze the need for such an index , and and that Subcommittee developed the SIFMA Municipal Swap Index . In 2014 SIFMA amended the Index criteria such that reset rates that comprise the Index must have been reported to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board 's Short-Term Obligation Rate Transparency ( SHORT ) System . <h> HOW IS THE INDEX USED ? <p> One of the most critical elements of a swap transaction is the Index on which the floating rate is based . ( In a swap , two counterparties " swap " fixed rate interest payments for floating rate payments or vice versa ) . The Index serves as a benchmark floating rate in the swap transaction . Industry-wide acceptance of the Index naturally increases liquidity and thus the attractiveness of the transaction . <h> HOW WERE THE INDEX CRITERIA SELECTED ? <p> Extensive historical correlation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of variables .

@@25449402 @5449402/ <h> Volcker Rule Resource Center 52634 @qwx252634 <h> Overview <p> As part of the Dodd-Frank Act , Congress adopted a ban on proprietary trading and restricted investment in hedge funds and private equity by commercial banks and their affiliates , the so-called " Volcker Rule . " <p> The Volcker Rule included in the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks from proprietary trading and restricts investment in hedge funds and private equity by commercial banks and their affiliates . Further , the Act directed the Federal Reserve to impose enhanced prudential requirements on systemically identified non-bank institutions engaged in such activities . Congress did exempt certain permitted activities of banks , their affiliates , and non-bank institutions identified as systemically important , such as market making , hedging , securitization , and underwriting . The Rule also capped bank ownership in hedge funds and private equity funds at three percent . Institutions were given a seven year timeframe to become compliant with the final regulations . <p> After an initial proposal in the Fall of 2011 , final Volcker Rule regulations were released and adopted by the agencies on December 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> engaging in short-term proprietary trading of securities , derivatives , commodity futures and options on these instruments for their own account . <p> owning , sponsoring , or having certain relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds , referred to as ' covered funds . ' <p> The Rule contains a number of significant asset class exemptions. - In addition to an exemption for U.S. Treasury securities , municipal securities are exempt from the Volcker Rule . A municipal security is defined as " a security that is a direct obligation of or issued by , or an obligation guaranteed as to principal or interest by , a State or any political subdivision thereof , or any agency or instrumentality of a State or any political subdivision thereof , or any municipal corporate instrumentality of one or more States or political subdivisions thereof .

Although SIFMA does not believe that the Volcker Rule addresses the root causes of the financial crisis , we- continue to- work with regulators to ensure it is implemented in a way that does not inadvertently limit market making and , in turn , reduce liquidity which would increase volatility and risk in markets . <p> Most firms , even prior to the publication of the final regulations eliminated their proprietary trading activities and reduced positions in entities that are clearly a private equity or hedge fund . Our primary concern with the implementation process is that there is limited - negative impact on market liquidity and that overall compliance by the industry is efficient .
