It takes a multitude of people with interdisciplinary talents to imagine the line , bring it to fruition , and then present it to you in the best possible light . But as diverse are the talents of these very special people , what binds them together is a common love for dance and the dance community . Many of them are dancers themselves , or they were at one time in their lives . They understand what it means to practice and they know the thrill of the curtain rising . In short , they understand their audience . They understand you . Perhaps that 's the magic ingredient that makes this 2018 Collection so special . It 's filled with new ideas and fresh innovations that we know you 're going to love . So turn the page and start imagining . We ca n't wait to see what you will do ! 97192 @qwx957192
