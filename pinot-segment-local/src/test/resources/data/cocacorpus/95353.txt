Now , as an adult , you can still appreciate a good body-based feat , but you 're more discriminating . Take that tickle in your throat ; it 's not worth gagging over . Here 's a better way to scratch your itch : " When the nerves in the ear are stimulated , it creates a reflex in the throat that can cause a muscle spasm , " says Scott Schaffer , M.D. , president of an ear , nose and throat specialty center in Gibbsboro , New Jersey . " This spasm relieves the tickle . " <p> 2 . Experience supersonic hearing ! <p> If you 're stuck chatting up a mumbler at a cocktail party , lean in with your right ear . It 's better than your left at following the rapid rhythms of speech , according to researchers at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine . If , on the other hand , you 're trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your left ear toward the sound . The left ear is better at picking up music tones . <p> 3 . Overcome your most primal urge ! <p> Need to pee ? No bathroom nearby ? Fantasize about Jessica Simpson . Thinking about sex preoccupies your brain , so you wo n't feel as much discomfort , says Larry Lipshultz , M.D. , chief of male reproductive medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine . For best results , try Simpson 's " These Boots Are Made for Walking " video . <p> 4 . Feel no pain ! <p> German researchers have discovered that coughing during an injection can lessen the pain of the needle stick . According to Taras Usichenko , author of a study on the phenomenon , the trick causes a sudden , temporary rise in pressure in the chest and spinal canal , inhibiting the pain-conducting structures of the spinal cord . <p> 5 . Clear your stuffed nose ! <p> Forget Sudafed . An easier , quicker , and cheaper way to relieve sinus pressure is by alternately thrusting your tongue against the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one finger . This causes the vomer bone , which runs through the nasal passages to the mouth , to rock back and forth , says Lisa DeStefano , D.O. , an assistant professor at the Michigan State University college of osteopathic medicine . The motion loosens congestion ; after 20 seconds , you 'll feel your sinuses start to drain . <p> 6 . Fight fire without water ! <p> Worried those wings will repeat on you tonight ? " Sleep on your left side , " says Anthony A. Star-poli , M.D. , a New York City gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at New York Medical College . Studies have shown that patients who sleep on their left sides are less likely to suffer from acid reflux . The esophagus and stomach connect at an angle . When you sleep on your right , the stomach is higher than the esophagus , allowing food and stomach acid to slide up your throat . When you 're on your left , the stomach is lower than the esophagus , so gravity 's in your favor . <p> 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just rub ice on the back of your hand , on the V-shaped webbed area between your thumb and index finger . A Canadian study found that this technique reduces toothache pain by as much as 50 percent compared with using no ice . The nerve pathways at the base of that V stimulate an area of the brain that blocks pain signals from the face and hands . <p> 8 . Make burns disappear ! <p> When you accidentally singe your finger on the stove , clean the skin and apply light pressure with the finger pads of your unmarred hand . Ice will relieve your pain more quickly , Dr. DeStefano says , but since the natural method brings the burned skin back to a normal temperature , the skin is less likely to blister . <p> 9 . Stop the world from spinning ! <p> One too many drinks left you dizzy ? Put your hand on something stable . The part of your ear responsible for balancen++the cupulan++floats in a fluid of the same density as blood . " As alcohol dilutes blood in the cupula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Dr. Schaffer . This confuses your brain . The tactile input from a stable object gives the brain a second opinion , and you feel more in balance . Because the nerves in the hand are so sensitive , this works better than the conventional foot-on-the-floor wisdom . <p> 10 . Unstitch your side ! <p> If you 're like most people , when you run , you exhale as your right foot hits the ground . This puts downward pressure on your liver ( which lives on your right side ) , which then tugs at the diaphragm and creates a side stitch , according to The Doctors Book of Home Remedies for Men . The fix : Exhale as your left foot strikes the ground . <p> 11 . Stanch blood with a single finger ! <p> Pinching your nose and leaning back is a great way to stop a nosebleedn++if you do n't mind choking on your own O positive . A more civil approach : Put some cotton on your upper gumsn++just behind that small dent below your nosen++and press against it , hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cartilage wall that divides the nose , " says Peter Desmarais , M.D. , an ear , nose , and throat specialist at Entabeni Hospital , in Durban , South Africa . " Pressing here helps stop them . " <p> 12 . Make your heart stand still ! <p> Trying to quell first-date jitters ? Blow on your thumb . The vagus nerve , which governs heart rate , can be controlled through breathing , says Ben Abo , an emergency medical-services specialist at the University of Pittsburgh . It 'll get your heart rate back to normal . <p> 13 . Thaw your brain ! <p> Too much Chipwich too fast will freeze the brains of lesser men . As for you , press your tongue flat against the roof of your mouth , covering as much as you can . " Since the nerves in the roof of your mouth get extremely cold , your body thinks your brain is freezing , too , " says Abo . " In compensating , it overheats , causing an ice-cream headache . " The more pressure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your headache will subside . <p> 14 . Prevent near-sightedness ! <p> Poor distance vision is rarely caused by genetics , says Anne Barber , O.D. , an optometrist in Tacoma , Washington . " It 's usually caused by near-point stress . " In other words , staring at your computer screen for too long . So flex your way to 20/20 vision . Every few hours during the day , close your eyes , tense your body , take a deep breath , and , after a few seconds , release your breath and muscles at the same time . Tightening and releasing muscles such as the biceps and glutes can trick involuntary musclesn++like the eyesn++into relaxing as well . <p> 15 . Wake the dead ! <p> If your hand falls asleep while you 're driving or sitting in an odd position , rock your head from side to side . It 'll painlessly banish your pins and needles in less than a minute , says Dr. DeStefano . A tingly hand or arm is often the result of compression in the bundle of nerves in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compressed nerves lower in the body govern the feet , so do n't let your sleeping dogs lie . Stand up and walk around . <p> 16 . Impress your friends ! <p> Next time you 're at a party , try this trick : Have a person hold one arm straight out to the side , palm down , and instruct him to maintain this position . Then place two fingers on his wrist and push down . He 'll resist . Now have him put one foot on a surface that 's a half inch higher ( a few magazines ) and repeat . This time his arm will cave like the French . By misaligning his hips , you 've offset his spine , says Rachel Cosgrove , C.S.C.S. , co-owner of Results Fitness , in Santa Clarita , California . Your brain senses that the spine is vulnerable , so it shuts down the body 's ability to resist . <p> 17 . Breathe underwater ! <p> If you 're dying to retrieve that quarter from the bottom of the pool , take several short breaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a lack of oxygen that makes you desperate for a breath ; it 's the buildup of carbon dioxide , which makes your blood acidic , which signals your brain that somethin ' ai n't right . " When you hyperventilate , the influx of oxygen lowers blood acidity , " says Jonathan Armbruster , Ph.D. , an associate professor of biology at Auburn University . " This tricks your brain into thinking it has more oxygen . " It 'll buy you up to 10 seconds . <p> 18 . Read minds ! <p> Your own ! " If you 're giving a speech the next day , review it before falling asleep , " says Candi Heimgartner , an instructor of biological sciences at the University of Idaho .

@@21840945 @1840945/ <p> If we were to list only a few men of God that have had the most influence upon the Christian Adoption ministry , the life and example of George Mueller would have to appear in that list . <p> Of course--our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is the perfect example for us to follow and to imitate . <p> George Mueller was a man of faith and miracles . Certainly he was one of the greatest prayer warriors of the past century . His ministry was prospered because he trusted fully in God and he started a work that was born in his heart . During his ministry of 63 years , he supported missionaries , established the Scriptural Knowledge Institute in England , taught Sunday schools as well as day schools where teachers were Christian , distributed Bibles and religious tracts , and cared for orphans . He was directly involved in the Christian instruction of 121,683 pupils . He distributed 281,652 Bibles , 1,448,662 New Testaments , 21,343 copies of the Book of Psalms , and 222,196 other portions of the Holy Scriptures . He financially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 111,489,067 **25;30;TOOLONG , and was directly involved in the conversion of 2,813 orphans . He mastered 6 languages : French , German , Hebrew , Latin , Greek , and English . <p> Mr. Mueller was a native of Prussia , born in Kroppenstaedt , on September 27 , 1805 . He looked , after the shadow of God 's glory rested upon him , beyond time and saw God . He realized that God alone was able , and in that realization the puny supplies of man dwarfed beside the reservoirs of God 's grace which he tapped by faith . He learned the secret of getting things from God , the simple expedient of boldly coming to the throne to receive . He practiced this daily for 73 years , and in coming he never found the throne vacant nor the supplies exhausted . He learned not to bind God by the limits of his own faith . He asked , knowing that God , Who heard , was able . <p> Near the end of his life he affirmed that he had read the Bible through approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He found God 's promises in the Bible and experienced the truth of them in his everyday life . He learned to believe what he read and to act accordingly . He learned to tell not man but God his needs and to believe God would supply them . Mueller had mastered the lesson of outlooks--for he lived by the heavenly uplook , and not the earthly outlook ! <p> " The Lord pours in , while we seek to pour out . " This was always his plan of operation . He sought God to pour in the supplies , and he diligently furnished sources through which they might be distributed . As long as Mueller saw to the careful distribution of money and supplies , God never failed in pouring in the needed materials . <p> Mr. Mueller testified that in his lifetime 50,000 specific prayers were answered . Years before he died , about the middle of his career , he affirmed that up to that time 5000 of his definite prayers had been answered on the day of asking . He made it a habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page he gave the petition and the date , and on the opposite page he entered the date of the answer . In this manner he was able to keep record of definite petitions , and their specific answers . He recommended this form to believers who desired specific results to their prayers . Thus there is no guesswork as to when God answers prayers . <p> " I live in the spirit of prayer . I pray as I walk about , when I lie down and when I rise up . And the answers are always coming . Thousands and tens of thousands of times have my prayers been answered . When once I am persuaded that a thing is right and for the glory of God , I go on praying for it until the answer comes . George Mueller never gives up ! " <p> " Let not Satan deceive you , " writes Mr. Mueller during those faith-wrenching days , " in making you think you could not have the same faith , but that is only for persons situated as I am . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask the Lord to direct me to it , and I look for an answer to my prayer ; when a person with whom I have an appointment does not comeI ask the Lord to be pleased to hasten him to me , and I look for an answerThus in all my temporal and spiritual concerns I pray to the Lord and expect an answer to my request ; and may not you do the same dear believing reader ? " <p> In giving advice gained through daily trials of his faith , this father of the orphans laid down rules for a Christian to follow by which they might also strengthen their faith . These rules are : <p> 1 . Read the Bible and meditate upon it . God has become known to us through prayer and meditation upon His own Word . <p> 2 . Seek to maintain an upright heart and a good conscience . <p> 3 . If we desire our faith to be strengthened , we should not shrink from opportunities where our faith may be tried , and therefore , through trial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthening of our faith is that we let God work for us , when the hour of trial of our faith comes , and do not work a deliverance of our own . Would the believer therefore have his faith strengthened , he must give God time to work . <p> There was no detail too insignificant to take to the Lord in prayer . He lived literally according to the passage , " In all things by prayer and supplication , with thanksgiving , let your requests be made known unto God . " " Real trust in God is above circumstances and appearances , " he affirmed . <p> the Mueller 's set off for the United States in August 1877 aboard the SardianOff Newfoundland the weather turned cold and the ship 's progress was seriously retarded by fog . The captain had been on the bridge for 24 hours when something happened which was to revolutionize his life .

" <p> It was prayer that swept his soul free of doubt , distemper , and the after-effects of a trial by the incoming tide of peace . For this reason he could make such remarks as this entry on March 9 , 1847 , " The greater the difficulties , the easier for faith . " And a later one , " The greater the trial , the sweeter the victory .

Most frequently we fail in not continuing in prayer until the blessing is obtained , and in not expecting the blessing . " <p> During the last year of Mr. Mueller 's life , among the gifts ( for the feeding of the orphans ) recorded were 7 , 203 loaves of bread ; 5,222 buns ; 20 boxes of soap ; 9 tons of coal ; 26 haunches of venison ; 112 rabbits ; 312 pheasants ; 5 bags of oatmeal ; 26 cases of oranges ; 5 boxes of dates and 4,013 pounds of meat along with hundreds of other items .

The use of restraints on residents is a sensitive area that must be discussed by the instructor covering this chapter . Many facilities have made a commitment to making their facilities restraint-free . An emphasis should be placed on restraint alternatives.Intake and output should be discussed at length , and the students can practice measuring with a graduate and recording the results . Practicing conversions is a good idea . Collection of specimens is also covered in this chapter .

For , this CD is a stellar example of phenomenal vocal talent , skilled musical and lyrical creativity , inspirational dynamics and the ability to let one 's faith in the Lord shine throughout the music presented ; characteristics which are very much present in this uplifting collection of songs . <p> Let 's Talk about the Vocals ....... <p> It is very much evident that the Lord has truly blessed Micah Stampley with some very special gifts , which are showcased in this collection of songs . The most outstanding characteristic of these songs which grabs hold of the listener , is the quality and creative versatility of the lead vocals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Micah Stampley 's vocal abilities are truly stunning . Micah not only has the ability and breath control to dynamically express vocally with emotional umph the songs presented ( I BELIEVE * FERVENT PRAYER * NEVER LET YOU GO ) but he has the ability to use his multi-octave voice to effortlessly slide up octaves ( UNFAILING LOVE ) , smoothly making difficult note intervals , sometimes holding the note a few measures at full throttle volume or being poignantly soft , making it all sound so easy ! ( CALL TO THE NATION * HOLY VISITATION ) <p> The lead vocals are wonderfully supported by a talented vocal ensemble who not only stay on key , know their harmony parts / required singing style , understand dynamics and breath control , but also sing with feeling and conviction , getting into the spirit of the song and letting their own faith flow through their performances . ( WE LIFT YOU UP * YOU ARE LORD &amp; MARVELOUS * NO COMPROMISE ) <p> It can be said by this reviewer that Micah Stampley and his backup vocal ensemble truly bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uplifting and encouraging the spirit and soul , while offering a high standard of vocal quality and musical enjoyment . <p> Let 's talk about the compositions and lyrical messages presented ........ <p> Like the vocals , the musical and lyrical content of these " songs of the Lord " are also varied and musically interesting ; offering a delightful choice of compositions which fit perfectly with the lyrics and theme of each song presented , ranging from poignant piano ballads to stirring anthems of faith ( UNFAILING LOVE * ANOTHER PLACE *FERVENT PRAYER ) to Micah Stampley 's version of contemporary Christian worship songs ( YOU ARE LORD * I BELIEVE ) , sometimes blending in elements of Gospel , rhythmic urban and soul ( NO COMPROMISE ) , to rip-roaring , energetic praise and worship anthems ( MARVELOUS - SOVEREIGN GOD ) . <p> The gospel influence is strongly felt in the call to worship and praise anthems ( WE LIFT YOU UP * HOLY VISITATION * CALL TO THE NATIONS ) , in the VAMPS in most of the songs , and is an underlying influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been broadened to meet the musical tastes of a wider audience without loosing any of its endearing qualities ! <p> The musical talent is also flowing and on fire in the musicians who brought the compositions roaringly to life , adding so much to the accompaniment and energy and spirit found in these songs . Rhythms are sharp , syncopation flows , dynamics are well-played and support -counter melodies are tight and effective . At some point , smoke I 'm sure was coming out of the recording studio on some songs . Melodies played were hauntingly beautiful in the more poignant songs . Kudos to the studio musicians ! ! <p> Micah Stampley and the song writing team of Micah and his talented wife , Heidi , have paired the perfect music vehicles for each spiritual message presented in each cut on the album . Well-written , memorable lyrical messages bring home to the listener spiritual themes which encourage the listener to celebrate , worship and praise our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , and seek a relationship with Him . <p> There are songs of praise and thanksgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Lord , and heartfelt prayer anthems , exploring our need of Him ( FERVENT PRAYER ) , and what it would feel like not to have a relationship with the Lord ; Emptyness ( NEVER LET YOU GO ) . Other songs encourage the listener to seek the Lord in worship in all circumstances and to walk the narrow path of discipleship , living for Christ . <p> The resulting music offers musical gems which can inspire the listener in their faith walk , whether in meaningful prayer and worship time , a straighter walk with the Lord or even to sing with enthusiasm along with the vocals presented , perhaps dancing around the room as well while praising and worshiping the Lord . <p> These " songs of the Lord " offer music that has wide audience appeal , sure to bless many people , because of the high standards found in these songs . The combination of inspiring vocals and backup voices , memorable and infectious melodies and rhythms supported by solid compositions , and compelling and uplifting lyrical themes encourage the listener to be an enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praises our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . <p> A FRESH WIND : The Second Sound is a MUST for anyone 's Christian music collection , offering high quality / inspirational music which is not only " outside the Christian music genre box , " but is also refreshingly creative , most enjoyable and a delightful tool to help keep the listener focused on the Lord . <p> Musical Notes : A high energy praise and worship song with a moving beat , propelled along by a tight ensemble sound of horns , well done electric guitar ( intro jig &amp; support counter melody ) , synthesizer / keyboard and great drum work , which add a fire and spirit to the song which is infectious , and sticks in one 's memory . Musical accompaniment provides great support to equally energetic lead vocals and choral support . A great musical transitional segue at the end flows right into the next worship song , SOVEREIGN GOD . <p> Musical Notes : Calmer than MARVELOUS , but still in a joyous , grateful mood , which leaves the listener feeling gratitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the tight sound of the horns , piano , guitar , drums , with some well-done key modulations . <p> Musical Notes : A fiery beginning to start the album with a bang !

@@21841308 @1841308/ <p> Briefly stated , the doctrine of " The Trinity " declares that God , theSupreme Being consists of three persons : The Father , The Son andThe Holy Spirit who are each co-equal and co-eternal . <p> Down through the centuries many brilliant theologians havelabored to establish the Trinitarian doctrine as the foundationaltruth of Christianity . However , There are two unimpeachablewitnesses whose quiet testimony proves beyond a shadow of doubtthat the doctrine of The Trinity is a fraud : <p> 1 . The Biblical Witness : <p> The three-in-one God doctrine is not presented anywhere in the Bible . The Trinity was not taught by the prophets or the apostles , and more importantly , it was not taught by Jesus . <p> 2 . The Historical Witness : <p> There is no record of the co-equal , co-eternal , three-in-one God being taught by a single one of the early church fathers . It was not a part of Christian teaching until it was formulated by the Second Ecumenical Council at Constantinople in 381 . A.D. <p> Jesus did not teach the Trinity , the apostles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church leaders for three hundred years after thedeath of Christ . It seems to me that knowing these facts , noreasonable person could possibly believe that the Trinity is the keydoctrine of Christendom . And yet most theologians and churchleaders continue to ignore the eloquent silence of these witnessesand insist that the 3-in-1 God is the God of the Bible . Why ? <p> For sixteen hundred years Trinitarian churches have cast out andeven murdered those who refused to believe in their definition ofGod . Today , an adulterer or murderer who says he loves Jesus isaccepted by their churches - but , they say , the one who refuses tobelieve in the Trinity can not be saved . That is the great tragedy ofTrinitarianism ; it has become the test of faith . <p> The true test of a believer is given by the apostle John : <p> " He that saith , I know Him , and keepeth not His commandments is a liar , " ( 1 John 2:4 ) <p> On the contrary , the Trinitarians would say : <p> " He that saith , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liar , " <p> Through the doctrine of the Trinity , Satan has managed to shift thefocus from obedience to the commandments of God as the test oforthodoxy , to belief in a type of God invented by a few theologians ofthe fourth century . <p> The foundation of Trinitarian doctrine is the fifth century AthanasianCreed which says this of the Trinity : <p> " ... And the catholic faith is this , that we worship one God inTrinity and Trinity in Unity ... the whole three persons co-eternaland co-equal ... He therefore that will be saved &gt;MUST THINKTHUS&lt; of the Trinity . " I ask you , Where is THAT found in theBible ? <p> The answer is of course , that it is not found in the word of God , rather , it comes from deductions and suppositions about the wordof God . Trinitarians offer forced interpretations of ambiguousverses , while ignoring clear statements of Jesus and the apostleswhich contradict their doctrine . For example : <p> " The Father is greater than I. " ( John 14:28 ) <p> " ... the head of every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( 1 Cor 11:3 ) <p> I hope my Trinitarian brethren will look at those verses with anopen mind for just a few moments . Think about it ... If the head ofChrist is God then how could they be co-equal ? The word " co " means - in the same way . If Jesus is not equal in authority , he isnot co-equal . Remember , Paul was talking about Jesus after Hisresurrection , not when he was on earth as man . <p> In 1 Corinthians 15:27 , Paul wrote : <p> " For He God the Father has put all things in subjection under His Jesus feet . But when it says , ' All things are put in subjection under Him ' it is plain that He is excepted who put all things under Him . " <p> If Jesus was co-equal with the Father , why would there be a need toput all things in subjection under Him ? Daniel wrote : <p> " ... and he Jesus came to the Ancient of days and was presented before Him . And to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dan 7:13 ) <p> I do not understand how Trinitarians can read those words " wasgiven dominion " and believe that Jesus is co-equal with the Father . How could Jesus be given anything if He really was eternal God ? <p> I hope all who read this message will search their hearts and theirBibles for the reason why some Christians should reject those ofus who love Jesus and give our lives to serve him , just because wehave different views concerning the Father , Son and Holy Spirit.The question I would ask you is : Where did Jesus or the apostlesever teach that we should judge our brethren by the doctrine of theTrinity ? I can not find one . Can you ?

@@21841322 @1841322/ <p> I 've been accused of trying to create/perpetuate a hoax in rec.games.board by frequently mentioning the game Skitgubbe as ' The best 7 player card game ' and ' An ideal 3 player game when you do n't have Titan ' . Well , I posted the rules a couple of years back , but things have changed ( yes , the game has evolved slightly ) , so I decided to post the rules again ... <p> Thanks to Ake Knutsson of Lund , Sweden who corrected my spelling of Skitgubbe . It 's actually quite a wonder that Ake recognized the spelling at all . When we first learned the game , we thought it was ' Wheat Cue-Bah ' , but that 's all part of the lore . Oh yes , the lore is important . Never forget where the game came from , lest you be a perpetual goat . So , in ( roughly ) chronological order , here is the lore ( as I know it ) : <p> Late ' 70s : <p> Etan Savir travels to Greece where , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Sweden . Peo attracts Etan 's attention by using watermelons to practice his harpoon gunnery . Peo and Etan get very drunk and Peo teaches Etan a Swedish card game which Etan brings back to the USA ( North Carolina , if you must know ) . <p> The game prospers through the ' 80s , but never gains more than a small devoted following ( kind of like Cosmic Wimpout or Indian Oh Hell ) . At any rate , two of Etan 's friends , Adger Williams and myself end up at UCLA together where we meet a Swedish major who has never heard of the game but knows how ( more or less ) to spell it . Somehow , she manages to turn ' Wheat Cue-Bah ' into ' Skitgubbe ' which literally means ' Shit-Old Man ' . Ake has since reminded me of the spelling ( and I wo n't forget it ) . I 'd like to go to Sweden some day to thank him , but since Skitgubbe is the only Swedish I know , I wo n't get far once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game has begun to spread and variants have sprung up . The game is also known as ' Snarf and Barf at CalTech ' , ' The Evil Game ' , and ' Lead Goat ! ' ( that 's lead in verb form , not the element ) . Anyhow , the game continues to delight and amaze audiences everywhere . Some specific variants will be discussed after the main rules are divulged . <p> Consider yourself lucky to have this game explained to you . Traditionally ( and this is , perhaps , the most tradition laid of games ) a novice must try to infer the rules by watching - almost impossible , by the way . <p> Warning - this game is addictive . You may THINK you understand , but it is a Zen experience , in that there are games within the game . If you do n't believe me , ask Scott ( srt@cs.ucla.edu ) , Ronen ( ronen@gg.caltech.edu ) or even Adger ( adgerw@hope.bitnet ) . <p> The game has been carried farther than any of it 's Nordic designers ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written an X-windows interface to the game that allows play across the Internet ! At one point , we had a game going that involved players at UCLA , CalTech , Cornell and Hawaii ! <p> Enjoy ! And remember : ' Du luktar som en get ' ( thanks again , Ake ) . <p> Mail questions to matthew@cs.ucla.edu <h> The Rules : <p> Do n't think too much . Skitgubbe is an easy game if you count cards religiously . Do n't . That 's not the point . Just try to rely on your card ' sense ' . My mother can probably play faster than you . Remember : " Play fast , or we get to hit you " <p> Use a standard ( 52 card ) deck of cards , well shuffled . Any number can play , although more than 6 is absurd and fewer than 3 is dumb . For more than 6 players , the Double Deck Variant adds spice . The cards are ranked - Ace ( high ) , King , Queen , Jack , 10 , ... , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two parts to the game , the first part and the second part . You collect cards by trick taking in the first part . This will form your hand for the second part where you will try to get rid of your cards . <p> Strategy Tip : The number of cards you obtain in the first part is not as important as their ranking . A few low cards will lose you the game , while you can hold half the deck and win ( or , more correctly , not lose ) easily . <h> The First Part <p> Each player is dealt three cards . At all times ( during the first part ) you must maintain a three card hand by drawing from the deck ( until there is no more deck to draw from ) . <p> A series of rounds are played until at least one person is entirely out of cards ( and , of course , the deck is exhausted ) . A round consists of each player making exactly 1 play and ( optionally ) any legal sloughs ( sluffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout these rules - I alternate in all my writing , and today is ' male ' day . <p> The initial leader is the Goat , or loser of the previous game . From then on , he who wins a trick leads for the next trick . At the start of a session , someone must volunteer to be goat ( I particularly enjoy this , since I seldom Goat yes , it 's a verb too and I never get to start the game otherwise ) . <p> Here 's the structure of a round : <p> The leader makes a play by either playing a card from his hand or turning over the top card of the deck . <p> On his turn , each player makes a single play in a similar fashion ( a card from hand or the top card of the deck ) with one important restriction : <p> IF you have a card of the same rank as the highest card played thusfar , then you must play that card ( if you have two , then one will do ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to playing , a player may sluff any matching card into the pile played thusfar . That is , IF you hold a card of matching rank with what 's in the pile so far , you can sluff in your card . There are two exceptions to this rule : <p> YOU may not sluff a card matching the top card played so far if you have not played yet . That is , if you have a King , and an Ace and someone plays a King before you , you ca n't sluff your King and play your Ace unless someone else before you plays an Ace first . Your King matches the high card so far and must be your play . After your play , you can sluff anything you want . <p> . You can not sluff on what will be the last trick until it is determined that you wo n't be getting it . This rule keeps people from sluffing like mad to avoid losing the last trick ( you 'll understand later , until then : NO SLUFFING ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> After one round of this playing and sluffing madness , the player who played the highest ranking card wins ( sluffs do n't count ) . In the case of a tie ( here 's the kicker ) , there is a war ( dubbed ' Fargin War ' ) . A war is just like a mini-trick between all players who played the highest rank . Other players do n't get to play , but can sluff anything they like . The leader for the war is the player who made the first high-card play before ( i.e. the nearest to the original leader 's left ) . Further ties must be resolved by wars until there is one winner . Cards played before may be sluffed ( by either player ) and have no bearing on the winner of the trick . That is , even if the original war was about a tie of Aces , a 7 could win the war . <p> EXAMPLE : In the 3 player game , the following hands a dealt : <p> Player 1 8D 3D 5C <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2H <p> Player 1 was Goat from the last game ( or took the previous trick ) and leads the 3D ( suit is irrelevant in the first half , except that there are four of them ) . Now , player 2 does n't want this trick , but must play one of his 3s because it is the highest card played thusfar . He could ( if he wished ) sluff the other three ( which he does ) , and get two new cards for his hand . At this point , Player 1 has drawn 1 new card ( to replace the 3D ) and player 2 has drawn 2 new cards ( to replace his 3s ) . Player 3 does n't want the 3s , so he plays his 2H ( and replinishes his hand ) . Now , this trick is over , except that two players ( 1 &amp; 2 ) tie for top play . There is now a war between 1 &amp; 2 . Player 3 can sluff anything into this trick that matches rank .

This is legal , even though Player 1 might have a 2 . If this were the final trick , however , such a sluff would be illegal ( you have to guess if it might be the final trick - nobody can be too sure ) . He replinishes from the deck with the 9H . It looks bad for him . Now , since player 1 played first in the original trick , he must lead to the war . Not wanting the trick , he leads his 5C . Player 3 can immediately sluff , but decides to hold off . Player 2 , holding 3 winning cards is cursing his sluffing of the 2D and 3S earlier . Rather than take the trick outright , he flips the top card of the deck and gets ... the 4C - low enough to give the trick to Player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player 3 sluffs in the 5H and replinishes his hand . <p> Now player 1 takes his winnings and puts them face down in front of him ( for use in the second half of the game ) .

Some may also have cards left in their hand from the first part . These are combined to form your hand for the second half , and you 'll want to get rid of this stuff . <p> Trump is announced for the second half . Remember that last card from the stock that someone left face-down in front of them ? Well , that player tells everyone the suit of that card and adds that card to their hand . Trump is valuable stuff , which is why everyone always tries to sluff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If there are players holding fewer than 6 ( six ) cards at this point , then ALL players ( including those with too few cards ) dump the 2-5 of each suit and the 6 of trump into a pile in the middle . This pile ( 17 cards ) is shuffled and distributed to those who lacked 6 cards . Note that you do n't have to ( get to ) take part in the distribution of ' dreck ' if your contribution put you under the 6 card limit . That is , only players holding fewer than 6 BEFORE dumping are included in the division . Thus , a winning hand for the second round is : a bunch of 2s , 3s , 4s , and 5s ( at least 6 total ) and someone else not having 6 . You get to dump your entire hand ( and therefore go out ) . <p> 17 does n't divide by 2 , 3 , or any other number ( other than 1 and 17 ) , so , if more than 1 person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) player will get slightly more cards . That is , if three players divide the dreck ( not unlikely in the 7 player game ) , one will get 5 cards , while the others get 6 each . Usually players volunteer for extra cards ( might be trump , after all ) . In our game , the person sitting behind the strongest hand from part 1 usually gets first choice ( or denial ) . We take it from there as needed . <h> The Second Part <p> Everyone now has a hand . Sort it by suit ( and by rank within suit ) . The only player who might be out of cards is the player in the Intermission example who managed to give away all his cards . <p> The object of this part is to get rid of all your cards . There is no winner in that it does n't matter when you go out , there is instead a single loser ( or Goat ) . To this loser , who is sheepishly trying to hide his remaining cards , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means ' You smell like a Goat ' . Then , the pack is shuffled , dealt out ( three to a player ) and the Goat leads for the next game ( ' Lead , Goat ! ' ) <p> This part of the game has a very simple rule - Beat it or Eat it . <p> The cards retain their original ordering ( Ace high ) except that trumps are higher than anything else ( the 2 of trumps is higher than any other Ace ) . <p> Two ( or more ) cards of the same suit which touch ( have adjacent rank ) MAY be considered a single logical card . Thus , if you have the 5-6-7 of diamonds , that 's only one logical card ( if you choose to play it that way ) . <p> The play proceeds as follows : <p> One player leads . Initially , this is the person taking the last trick in part 1 of the game . After that , it depends on the play ( keep reading ) . <p> In order ( around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hemisphere ) each player must either : <p> play a higher card ( or cards , if they touch ) than the highest card on the table , OR <p> pick up the lowest card ( or cards , if they touch ) from the table . <p> A higher card is either a trump or a card in the suit lead . That is , if diamonds are lead you may not play anything to this trick other than diamonds or trump . <p> EXAMPLE ( in a 4 player game ) : <p> Player <p> Move <p> 1 <p> leads 2-3 of clubs <p> 2 <p> plays 7-8-9 of clubs <p> 3 <p> does n't want to ( or ca n't ) play above 9C so picks up 2-3 <p> 4 <p> plays 10-J of clubs <p> 1 <p> does n't want to ( or ca n't ) play above the JC so picks up 7-8-9-10-J of clubs ( notice how they all touch ) . <p> The trick is over when either : <p> All the cards have been picked up ( the table is bare ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the player after the last picker-upper ) gets to lead for the next trick . OR <p> There are N plays on the table where N is the number of players who were still playing at the start of the trick ( some may have gone out during the trick - that 's OK , N is still the same ) . This is called a KILL . The cards are all removed from play ( they 're gone for this game - back for the next ) and the player who made the killing play gets to lead for the next trick . <p> SIMILAR EXAMPLE ( in a 4 player game ) : <p> Player <p> Move <p> 1 <p> leads 2-3 of clubs ( 1 play on table ) <p> 2 <p> plays 7-8-9 of clubs ( 2 plays on table ) <p> 3 <p> does n't want to ( or ca n't ) play above 9C so picks up 2-3 ( 1 play left on table ) <p> 4 <p> plays 10-J of clubs ( 1 card on table , but 2 plays on table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and goes out ( 3 plays on table ; N still = 4 ) <p> 2 <p> picks up 7-8-9-10-J of clubs ( 1 play on table ) <p> 3 <p> plays 5 of diamonds ( 2 plays on table ) <p> 4 <p> plays 7-8 of diamonds ( 3 plays on table ) <p> 1 <p> Has gone out - smiles <p> 2 <p> plays A of diamonds ( 4 = N plays on table ) <p> This kills the trick , the 2,5,7-8 , A of diamonds are removed ( ouch ! ) and player 2 gets to lead . Now , and only now is N reduced ( to 3 players left ) . <p> That 's it . He who is left is Goat . <p> Strategy Tip : Do n't use up all your trump too early , unless you 're in the 5 player game , where the rule might be ' Trump early , trump often ' . There are definite different approaches to the game . Try them all . If you have an overpowering hand ( 10-12 trumps ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try using your power to make the person on your RIGHT Goat . <p> Learning Tip : The first half is much harder to understand than the second half . If you want to learn the game , it 's easier to arbitrarily deal each player part of the deck and run through the second half a couple of times . Remember to choose trump ( see variation 1 , below ) . <h> Variations ( some good , some ? ? ? ) <p> determining trump <p> The mad scramble for the bottom card at the end of the first part has left people crippled for life . Instead , we like to set the bottom card aside after dealing . Then , when the first part is done , we look at the card , it determines trump , and we DISCARD IT ! That has several effects : <p> A. No hustling for that last card B. One less trump in the game ( makes it more fun ) C. Nobody gets an extra trump automatically <p> Note that the card may be in the 2-6 range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , they are out of luck . There will only be 16 cards to divide instead of 17 . <p> Use this rule , it vastly improves the game . <p> high trump rule <p> This rule , stated simply , is : ' The Highest Trump left in the game can only be used to kill a trick ' <p> Initially , the high trump is the Ace , unless it determined trump in Variant 1 above . That can not be used , except to kill a trick ( ca n't be played unless it 's play N on an N player trick ) . <p> After the Ace kills the trick , the King , if it 's still around , is high , and so on down . <p> This rule is not necessary in games with MORE than 4 players . It makes the 4 player game flow more unevenly ( which is good ) and also improves the 3 player game . The only problem is remembering what the current high trump is . Generally someone at the table knows . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the high trump ' if you think it is and all players must confirm/deny your suspicion . Skitgubbe is a gentle game and requires honesty and truth . <p> One important note . It 's just possible ( likely , actually ) , that someone will be stuck on lead with only the highest trump left . In that case , the lead moves TO THE RIGHT ( backward ) one player . The player to the right of high-trump man leads ( and , unless it 's a 2 player trick ) the high-trump man must pick up the lead ( exercise left to the reader ) . <p> Again , I suggest using this rule , although you might play a few rounds before introducing it . It adds enormous flair to the game . <p> double deck <p> This variant uses multiple decks of cards ( two decks usually suffices ) . The rules are the same as the normal game with the additions : <p> A. You need 12 cards ( not 6 ) to avoid splitting the garbage B. You can only play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you have both 6s of clubs , you 'll have to play them seperately . Of course , if you have both 5s and 7s , then you still only need 2 plays ( one set on each play ) . What 's bad is when you have a 6-7-8 and the player before you plays the 5-6-7 . You must split your group and play the 8 ( or play something higher ) . <p> Double Deck is a great 7-8 player game <p> Scoring <p> Some have devised scoring rules to encourage attempts at going out early . This is a questionable variant , but they might be : First : 5 Second : 3 Third : 1 Goat : -5 Everyone Else : 0 <p> I actually prefer a scoring system where Second pays more than First . Keeps players in the game - greed is definitely a downfall for even the heartiest Skitgubbe player . <p> Unless you 're bored , do n't score . <p> kitty <p> At CalTech , some 3 player games involve a rotating kitty . Send mail to Ronen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Aces are low in the first half <p> We 've gotten tired of having some guy hold two aces and a king in the first half and just wait until eventually he wins a massive trick . To even things up , we 've decided that aces are now LOW in the first half of the game ( they rank below 2 's ) . This is a marvelous improvement , and ranks with #1 ( pull a trump out ) and #2 ( the high trump rule ) as prefered modifications . <p> - Matthew forgot to mention that , in part 2 , when eating the low card , all touching cards MUST be eaten as a unit . I.e. if player A plays a 2C , then player B plays 3C 4C , and player C eats , player C must eat the 2C , 3C , and 4C . <p> - Also , Matthew forgot to mention the goat 's obligation to bleat . <p> - The rules can be summarized by two mantras , that new players do well to chant as needed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " -- Meaning that you MUST match the high card if you can , and you MAY match ( sluff ) other cards if you can . <p> Part 2 mantra : " Beat it or eat it " -- like Matthew said . <p> - Here at Caltech , the game is generally known as " Hurtenflurst " or , more commonly , just " Flurst " . Also called Flurst at Cornell , hence Ben 's " xflurst " program . ( " Hurtenflurst " was coined by John Platt , proxsvl ! synaptx ! platt@ames.jpl.nasa.gov , who spends much of his time these days bemoaning the dearth of flurst players near him . ) <p> - I do n't know about any " rotating kitty " variant #5 that Matthew claimed I could explain . <p> - Our version of variant #1 we called " restaurant rules " , since it was designed to keep water glasses from getting knocked over during the scramble for the trump card at the end of part 1 : <p> The final card may be used to replenish a play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #1 , but does n't eliminate a trump from play . <p> - 3-player " confusion " variant : 3 players , 6 hands . Each player is dealt two hands . Play is in the order " player A right " , " player B right " , " player C right " , " player A left " , " player B left " , " player C left " . ( subsitute the players ' names as appropriate , and chant it out loud as needed during play . ) Your right and left hands play as a partnership . Yes , they may look at each others ' cards , or rather , you may look at both hands simultaneously . Yes , through adroit play , it 's possible to " pass " cards from one hand to the other . No , we 've never tried 4 player 8 hand double-deck. 
@@21841323 @1841323/ 70209 @qwx270209 70208 @qwx270208 70204 @qwx270204 70203 @qwx270203 70205 @qwx270205 <p> I must start by addressing a question : Against what yardstick or standard is it fair to draw a comparison ? What , in other words , makes a " campsite " . A campsite is a provision of a composite set of facilities in exchange for a fee . The facilities on offer vary between campsites , as does the fee . At one extreme , all that you may get is a farmer 's field , a source of drinking water , and a latrine , for which the fee would be correspondingly modest . At the other extreme , in addition to those basics you may get additional facilities , such as showers , hot water for washing up cooking/eating utensils , clothes washing/drying facilities , electricity hookups , a shop that sells basic commodities ( possibly a cafe selling hot prepared food ) , refridgeration of perishable foods , pre-installed tents , mobile homes or similar accommodation , a swimming pool , a club house with bar and evening entertainment laid on , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost . I have attempted to list these items in decreasing order of priority , but that ordering is subjective and will vary in the opinions of others . The availability of some of the more sophisticated facilities such as a club house would be an active disadvantage for some customers , as they might attract to the site a " louder " customer profile than that which is desired by the customer ( even if he would not personally avail himself of the facility provided ) . <p> As mentioned above , the charge varies according to the facilities provided . But there are other factors also affecting the charge : The desirability of the location is one , and the concentration of competing sites is another . These affect supply and demand , and the basic principles of economics prevail . In many cases the additional site charge for the provision of additional facilities may be modest , because the cost of provision of those facilities may in part be recouped by additional charges for their specific use . In many campsites , there is an additional coin-operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price of which may exceed the marginal cost for the provision of the hot water , with the excess contributing to the capital cost of providing the facility . Certainly this would be the case with clothes laundering facilities , and as the current UK tax regime would typically allow a 100% write-off of the capital cost of equipment against taxable income the immediate cost to the landlord is to some extent mitigated . <p> With all that said , this particular consumer was somewhat baffled by some of the arrangements at this campsite , wherein the customer is regulated by a bewildering array of restrictions at considerable inconvenience to the customer , earning the landlord the soubriquet " Kommandant " . Comparisons with Basil Faulty were drawn . The first indication of what lay ahead is in the variety of signs plastered over the reception office as you approach the site : <p> So , before going into detail , the reader has to be aware of the costs involved . I was in a party of 4 ( 2 adults + 2 children ) in a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had originally booked for a third child ( total party of 5 , single tent ) but one child , a friend of the family , fell ill just before embarking and was left behind . The basic charge for a family of 5 was 20 per night for which we had to pay 60 deposit up front . For a party of 4 we should have been charged 17 per night . We were offered no discount for the fact that we only arrived as a party of 4 , and we were charged full whack for a party of 5 despite that we made the circumstances clear to the management on booking in . This factor alone gave me a negative opinion of the campsite which would require a lot of compensatory factors to overcome . We were somewhat held to ransom by the fact that we were meeting several friends who were independently booked into this campsite . Otherwise I would have been sorely tempted to surrender the deposit and go elsewhere . The nearby Hill End campsite required no prior booking , although that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was certainly not an attitude calculated to encourage a return visit . <p> Contrasted with this site , the the Hill End campsite levies a single charge per tent , independent of the number of occupants . It also affords greater transparency of its pricing structure by providing full details on its web page , where the Llanmadoc site only invites you to call for details . The Hill End home page is here <p> It is reasonable to use the Hill End campsite as a focus for comparison , because although the charging structure is slightly different the bottom line works out about the same , and the locations are very similar in attractiveness from a geographical standpoint . <p> One group of friends with whom we were meeting up was a party of 2 who required an electric hook-up . They were charged 140 for 7 nights . You can not book a hook-up pitch for fewer than 7 nights : <p> Presumably this is designed to minimise occasions of empty hook-up pitches . I can not comment on the reasonableness or otherwise of this policy - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as a consumer if you do not like the terms there is no need to contract . The restriction is not evident from the web site but presumably would become so at the point of booking . The Hill End site does not provide a hook-up option at all , so Llanmadoc can effectively set its own terms . <p> The basic location is extraordinarily good , and this is its major selling point . It is within easy walking distance of a beach comprising a vast expanse of sand and is a reasonable launchpad for headland walks . The Hill End site is even closer to the beach . Both provide a shop/cafe , but these facilities at the Hill End site are considerably more comprehensive . Furthermore , if your party is into surfing or bodyboarding , the angle of the beach to the ocean affords better waves at the Hill End area of Rhossili bay . <p> The Hill End site does does provide launderette facilities , which the Llanmadoc site does not . The importance of such facilities is subjective , but must carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rains 25 hours per day , 8 days per week . Given that such facilities normally also pay for themselves through contributions received at the point of supply ( ie coin-operated machines ) one can not help but feel that Llanmadoc misses a trick here . Launderette facilities do require housing , and if such under-cover space is simply not available without a bespoke building project then it is understandable that this may have delayed , perhaps permanently , the provision of this facility . <p> Having booked in , the next immediate source of discontent was the state of the pitch itself . I may be spoiled , but I am accustomed to using campsites that pay lip-service to keeping the grass to a reasonable length . Here we had what can best be described as a meadow ; the typical " farmer 's field " . This could be a boon if you happen to have turned up without a Karrymat or inflatable mattress , with nothing but the grass to cushion your delicate body from the hard earth . To the rest it is a positive pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is inconvenient to arrange your sleeping arrangements so as to minimise the inevitable discomfort associated with this effect , but to be fair it is rare to find a campsite that is immune to this problem , and it was not a major issue for me . Possibly the incline may have provided drainage advantages as a shield to ward off the incessant rain . <p> At least the tent pegs went into the ground without problem ( contrast my recollection of an Italian campsite in the shadow of Mont Blanc : half an inch of rotting vegetation followed by solid bedrock ) . <p> All in all I have known better and worse pitches . This was grudgingly among the better , the irritation ( grass length ) being felt particularly acutely only because it is so easily correctable , at negligible cost to the landlord ( hell , the grass may even be worth something in an agricultural industry ) , and neglected purely out of laziness . <p> Carpe Diem <p> Moving on to the restrictions imposed upon the timing of the availability of facilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a customer , you are restricted severely on the times of day within which certain critical activities may be performed . <p> 1 ) movement of vehicles <p> I only have a few weeks ' holiday per year , so it is very much a matter of " seize the day " when they crop up . In the summer it gets light early and gets dark late . I am up by 07:00 , breakfasted by 07:30 and then vroom ! I want to be off site and doing whatever I plan . At the other end of the day I can well imaging wishing to return to the camp site after 22:00 . The gates used to be closed from 21:30 to 08:30 , and the heavy black " 10 " in the photo opposite , obscuring the previous " 9:30 " , is at least a minor acknowledgement of the deep discontent with the previous restriction . We are advised that the restriction is " for security " . It is hard to imagine what security objective is furthered by this restriction - site access is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move your vehicle . <p> I venture to suggest that the hidden agenda behind this restriction has less to do with the security wellbeing of the customer than it has to do with the prevention of " freeloaders " turning up late at night , leaving early in the morning without paying . Whilst one must sympathise with the landlord 's plight on this issue , let us be in no doubt that the adopted solution is at the cost of the convenience of the paying customer . " For security " , it may be , at one extreme distortion of the meaning of the term , but for the protection of the landlord 's revenue stream , not the camper 's possessions or person . <p> The suggestion that in the event of an emergency during the hours of curfew , an ambulance will be called for the distressed camper ( no instructions about how this is to be achieved are provided ) is particularly amusing . What if the emergency is off-site , say I get a call to the effect that my house has been burgled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'll ? How , then , can I leave in the middle of the night ? <p> The timing restrictions on the ( recommended ) car park are even more onerous . <p> 2 ) Showers etc <p> The shower and washing facilities have in one sense a welcome change from trends in other campsites : The hot water is free of additional charges . You do n't have to hoard your 20p coins ( but the sting in the tail comes later ) . <p> We are advised that the restrictions on hours is ( if believable ) because non-residents to the campsite used to take advantage of these facilities . Once again , the paying camper is penalised in order to protect the landlord from freeloaders the presence of which would present minimal inconvenience to the camper but a loss of revenue to the landlord . The photo is of rather poor quality - apologies for that : The permitted showering times are between 08:30 to 11:00 and between 16:30 and 20:00 . Sheesh ! <p> Personally , if I had to pay the odd 20p for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal site fee ) and in consequence were permitted to shower whenever I liked , I would regard this as preferable . Others may disagree , but consider : such a solution would ensure also that the landlord is revenue-protected should the facilities be used by non-residents , so there is the potential for everyone to be happy . <p> Incidentally , if you are confused by what is meant by " children under age " who must be accompanied to the showers or toilets by an adult , the " age " is 8 years . This is only apparent from the website . Otherwise you might be misled into thinking that the normal legal age of majority applies ( 18 years ) ! <p> 3 ) Dish washing facilities <p> Dish washing facilities are so dire that they deserve special mention under their own dedicated heading . <p> For the entire camp site there are only two sinks provided for dish washing , only one of which has a hot water outlet . ( The other sink has what appears to be a hot water outlet but is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I was not prepared to pay 50p to find out for certain ) . <p> Before discussing the hot water , I am reminded of an exercise in fluid mechanics that kept me occupied in a state of confusion for many hours once as a young child , the solution to which I was never enlightened . It may not work every time , but I had found that if you take a cold water faucet and turn it on verrrry slowly until just a thin dribble of water ensues ( marginally faster than individual drips ) , and then stop and wait , then after a brief delay the dribble will dry up . Once it has stopped running , repeat the process by turning the faucet very slightly more until the dribble continues , and then stop turning . Lo ! the dribble dries up again . You can continue this iteration for quite a long time until you eventually get a dribble of water which never dries up . If you measure the total angle through which the faucet has been turned in the entire process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you had turned it to this angle in one go from the outset ( or even slightly less ) you would have received a gush of water far stronger than any of the preceding dribbles and which would never diminish . Well , I never did understand what gave rise to these inconsistent observations , but I was reminded of the exercise by the cold water faucet in the dish washing facility at this camp site . You could turn the faucet on full whack and never get more than the dribble of water that I achieved in my youthful experiment . Indeed , if both sinks were in use at the same time , no water whatsoever would emit from one of them . <p> As regards the hot water , for washing dishes this is not free of charge ( contrast showers and other washing facilities - why the inconsistency ? ) . For washing dishes the hot water comes via a coin-operated dispenser , at 0.50 per throw . Only 50p coins are accepted ( so you are not exempted the bind of hoarding those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50p purchase ? Well , it is certainly not a fixed quantity of hot water . No sirreee . It buys you the right to draw on hot water for a fixed period of time . And that period is about 3 minutes with no breaks . Use it or lose it . The cost to the landlord , meanwhile , is in direct proportion to the quantity of hot water drawn down . So this is simply a cash cow for the landlord , and an extortionate one at that . Hence a tip for those of you still inclined to go to this campsite after reading this review : When washing up , fill up every available receptacle with hot water while the clock is ticking , and leave them standing on the side while you wash the other items . <p> If that were n't bad enough , you 've guessed it : right of access to the dish washing facilities is limited to the same times as the showering facilities ! <p> Back to the sinks ! <p> Is n't " ubiquitous " a wonderful word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sachets that you get in pubs to accompany the food order . Designed ( supposedly ) to reduce consumption of the sauce for which the customer was not paying and so represented pure overhead to the publican , in practice they in no way reduce consumption , you just use about a dozen of the blighters when a healthy squirt from the squeegy bottle would have had the same effect ( and possibly lower cost to the publican in fact , given the packaging involved ) , and avoiding the problem of ever greasier fingers as you work through the sachets rendering that much more of a challenge the opening of the next . <p> Ubiquitous is also the adjective to describe " Prestex " faucets in camp sites and similar establishments . This is that wretched invention that parcels out water in discrete quantities as though you were living on Dune ( Frank Herbert fans will know whereof I speak ) . On this site the dreaded Prestex faucets are everywhere - showers and sinks . The motivation is obvious : Water consumption is an overhead for the landlord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be metered by now ) . No campsites have yet introduced a pay-as-you-go water metering system for individual campers ( maybe those which charge for showers include a water component and a heating component ) . So , while a camp site will wish to advertise that it provides running drinkable water , in practice it will put in place every obstacle imaginable to prevent the camper from taking advantage of that facility . <p> Now , the Prestex faucets come in various guises . The most diabolical ones are those which do not release the water until you let go of the faucet having depressed it . At that point water is released until the faucet returns to its original state . This is a very clever design and the one who invented it should suffer the same fate as that of Miles Bennett Dyson ( inventor of Skynet 's wonder-chip in Terminator 2 ) . These successfully overcome a potential threat to the classic Prestex faucet ( which release water as the faucet is depressed ) in the form of a portable screw attachment that could in theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . That such a threat has hitherto only been a figment of my imagination , and yet to be encountered in the wild , only adds to my respect for whoever pre-empted my world-beating invention . <p> Thankfully , this campsite has yet to upgrade to the Machiavellian super-Prestex version , but of the two remaining versions in common use it does use the more irritating one : <p> Some Prestex faucets , in an almost apologetic tip-of-the-hat to the end consumer who actually wants to use the water , have a time delay between releasing the faucet and the subsequent expiry of flow of water . Not so , in this camp site , except in the showers , where anything less would simply not be tolerated . As far as sinks go ; you let go , you no get water . Release the faucet and the flow ceases instantly . <p> So if you actually want a flow of water for whatever ablution or function takes your fancy , you had better be able to do it with just one hand , while the other holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , two hands are not enough ( one to operate the Prestex , one supposedly free ) : <p> If you tour South America - you are expected to take with you , on your travels , a sink plug , which follows you throughout your tour . It is a universal expectation in that area of the world . Even in a respectable hotel , you should not expect there to be a plug in the bath or sink of the hotel suite bathroom . Possibly this trend may come our way eventually , and some seasoned campers may already have acquired the habit of travelling with a universal-fitting plug . Well , it would have done you no good in this camp site . <p> They go one better here : Plugs are provided . In fact you can not avoid them . They are permanently affixed in a manner that requires constant hands-on attention in order simply to allow the water to drain : <p> The perma-plug in this image is shown as " open " , but rest assured that any flow of water will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves you with one hand on the " hair-trigger " Prestex faucet , one hand on the plug , and , er , no hands left to do what you actually wanted to do in the first place . I confess that I find it mildly ironic that water should be regarded as such a precious commodity in Wales , of all places . <p> There is illumination provided for the toilet facilities . They get switched off at 23:00 . There is no switch provided to the campers to switch them on after that time , even on a time-delay auto-shutoff as is common . So keep that head-torch with you . <p> I suppose that at least I have to accept that the facilities are kept clean . <p> Closing thoughts <p> I will say that the paid staff are extremely helpful and courteous , and I think conscious of the moans that I have expressed in this page ( as I am not the only one by any means to have these observations ) . The staff who independently operate the shop/cafe are also very helpful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get an item that they do not stock . The site 's policy of barring individual campers who fail to qualify as a " family " is beyond my comprehension ( how much of a ruckus will one individual create ? ) but of course within their rights . <p> Some of the restrictions are made clear in the site rules as published on the campsite 's home page , but certainly not all . The locking of the gates at 22:00 is mentioned but not the opening up time . The restrictions on showering times and washing up times is not mentioned . and you can hardly expect them to advertise the abysmal washing up facilities or blatent profiteering on the hot water supply therein . <p> I was going to close with the observation that no camper would return to this site for a second visit who has ever experienced an alternative , but that stretches it a bit . I expect that some do return regularly and put up with the Faulty Towers attitude . Indeed , if your daily routine happens to coincide with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not appear too relevant . <p> For me , however , I think that the advertising slogan on the site 's home web page says it all : " The best kept secret on Gower " - perhaps it would do well to stay that way . 70199 @qwx270199 70210 @qwx270210

@@21841342 @1841342/ <p> I 'm beginning to really enjoy the sport of target shooting . It is very challenging to be accurate while one is standing up . Most of my shots today were taken from a sitting position with the rifle resting on a support . Those are the easiest shots to make . Next are those shot from lying down , then from those sitting on the ground . My hope is to eventually become accurate in all those positions . Then to be quick and accurate . <p> A month ago I bought my second rifle . A Ruger 10/22 .22 Rifle ( on sale for $200 ) . Why did I buy a .22 ? Because my .223 bullets are 20 cents apiece which are cheap for high velocity rifles but still expensive if you shoot 200+ at a time . .22 bullets are only 2 cents a piece . Several friends have told me the best way to become a good shooter is to shoot a lot ( even with a .22 ) and I believe them . <p> I added on the Tasco Buck sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . It 's not a .22 scope ( it 's better than a .22 scope ) but it works fine on the .22 . Yes , it 's a cheap scope , but for my .22 that 's all I need . Using a scope is the best way to learn about them . It was no trouble sighting in the scope since the Ruger 10/22 came with pre-drilled holes <p> After having my new Ruger .22 Rifle for over a month I finally went out shooting ( by myself - my friends were busy or they thought it was going to rain ) at the Sacramento Valley Shooting Center ( only $10 for all day ) . It 's 35 minutes from home . <p> My shooting table is the one under the orange arrow . See the yellow line ( it does n't look very yellow in this photo ) running down the cement path ? Every 15 minutes they stop the firing by requiring everyone to open the bolts of their rifles and put a plastic yellow flag in the chamber and then stand behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line they give the all clear and you can go to your target and look at your shots ( each person gets one target stand ) and put up new targets . I was there from 1pm to 4:30 pm ( closing time ) . <p> The red rifle resting block was very effective at keeping your rifle steady . <p> Note the yellow flag in my .223 chamber . My Tasco 20x-60x 60mm <p> spotting scope worked great at allowing me to review the placement of <p> my shots . <p> The targets can be put at 25 , 50 , and 100 yards . <p> In this picture they 're only at the 50 and 100 yards <p> Here is a zoomed in photo of the 50 and 100 yard targets taken at the same <p> time as the photo above . My target stand is in the middle . <p> .223 shots at 50 yards ( no rifle scope ) . <p> 2 " circles so the outer circle is 6 inches . <p> 9 out of 11 shots in a 4 " circle . <p> .22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " circles . <p> 7 out of 10 in a 3 " circle . <p> Since you can only go up to your target stand every 15 minutes I put multiple targets up . <p> Here 's the pistol shooting range . Their ranges are much shorter . <p> All these shots are taken with the red resting block . Circle #1 is the 10 .223 shots I took at 100 yards . The first group of 5 are the ones on the right . It was a 3 inch circle ! Then I adjusted my aim and the second 5 ( the ones on the left ) were in a 5 inch circle . <p> Circle #2 are the 10 .22 shots I took while aiming at the .223 bullet hole that is circled in #1 . Using my .22 scope at power 9 I could see the .223 holes at 100 yards . Notice how much the .22 shots drop at 100 yards . While my .223 bullets did n't drop at all , my .22 dropped 4.5 inches . My 10 shots were in a 5 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for taking 3 .22 shots <p> at each circle . <p> These target stickers turn yellow when you hit them . <p> They give instant feedback . <p> The rifle range is the part of the structure to the <p> left of the small building in the middle . The orange <p> arrow is where I shot from . <p> Here 's the pistol range . It 's just to the right of the <p> rifle range . <p> There are many other ranges , including one up to <p> 1,000 yards ! But only members can use them . <p> The red highlighted area is the rifle range where I shot at . The other rifle ranges are members only .
