Are there any downsides ? <p> Twincharging is where both a supercharger and a turbo are fitted to an engine . <p> The merits of superchargers lie in the fact that they produce linear power gains in relation to the RPM of the engine , mimicking a large capacity engine . <p> Superchargers can run out of steam at higher RPM levels which is where a turbo charger comes into its own . <p> A turbocharger takes a while to get going as it needs a good flow of exhaust gases but when it does it can make large power gains from mid range right up to the high end of the RPM range . <p> When you have both fitted you quite literally have the best of both worlds , lots of low down power and plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this is that in applications where you need loads of boost and not a lot of air flow like in diesel engines ( due to lack of revs ) and small petrol engines you need forced induction . <p> No turbo will flow 30 lbs/min at 40 psi . So you use 2 to make it up and keep both of the turbos or supercharger and turbo operating efficiently . <p> You have the smaller of the 2 making loads of boost pressure and the bigger being able to flow the total volume of air not just half , it needs to flow all of it . So put the larger/better flowing unit nearest the engine and leave the smaller compressor near the air intake . <p> Thanks to compounding , the effect of two stages of compression will actually mean the air compression is much higher than that just adding the two compressors boost amounts together . For this reason you can get a substantial boost increase from relatively low cost components . ( 10psi Turbo + 10psi supercharger = just under 30psi of boost ! ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air that has already been compressed . <p> Most Twincharging applications will follow a few common routes . <p> Asynchronous or Series , where both work together simultaneously . This is probably one of the easiest set ups to build . <p> Then we have the inline or Parallel setups , as used by the VAG group where the supercharger provides boost at low RPM and the turbo takes over at a set point into the higher end of the RPM range . A diverter or electronic relay is used to cut between the supercharger and turbocharger . <p> Twincharging allows you to get high boost levels from relatively low cost components . It is a great way to increase the power of a small engine with a high RPM range . <p> Cheap superchargers and turbos can be found in your local breakers yard . The trick is getting them plumbed into your engine and working effectively . If engine bay space is limited this may restrict your options , although relocating the battery to the rear can free up some vital room . <p> So how do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have played around with various set ups and Claymores Turbo volvo is a good example of what can be achieved quite easily . His set up takes the output of compressed air from the turbo and then uses the supercharger to compress this further . <p> Obviously there is quite a large heat build up issue so a larger intercooler is a pre-requisite . Some set ups use a twin intercooler at each stage , others stick with a larger capacity intercooler and these can always be sprayed with water or nitrous to further reduce the intake temperatures . <p> Roots superchargers work best in this set up according to our members so it is worth sourcing an old Roots charger from your breakers yards and finding a mounting point for it in the engine . <p> A screw supercharger would work as you just need a positive displacement but there will be issues present that you do n't get on a Roots setup . <p> You could argue that having 2 compressors in the intake will impede flow rate . <p> However the key is that the compressed air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making up for any restrictions introduced . Inline setups use separate paths for each charger so they are not flowing through one another and this avoids the " restriction " debate altogether . <p> The trick after you have plumbed in the second compressor is getting the mapping and air fuel ratios right . Failure to get this right can lead to over fueling and/or detonation in the engine . A twin charged engine is best set up on a rolling road with proper diagnostic equipment and most cars will need an aftermarket ECU to cope with the extra mapping requirements . <p> A small word of caution on Twincharging relating to throttle body placement : It needs to go between the Turbo and supercharger if used in compound charging or the back pressure when the throttle is closed at high revs can destroy the supercharger . <p> You will also need to lower the compression ratio of the engine if you want to run high boost and the overall principles of adding a turbo to a non turbo engine apply to situations where a second charger is added . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the market for popular turbo engines . A kit will usually provide all the mechanical components you need to get a Twincharger set up and working correctly . <p> You will still have to get the engine mapping sorted out for best results .

Nissan in 1988 made the Nissan march super turbo which was twincharged. they produced 10,000 of the cars which were 930cc to meet the rally regulation .. produced about 110bhp. 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Oil - Get the correct grade - see your cars instruction book and note that sports ( thin ) oil can actually cause damage in an old or low performance engine just as too thick an oil can clog up the fuel pump and fail to lubricate the engine . Use a funnel if you have shaky hands - you do n't want oil on the engine . <p> Oil should be changed every 6-9000 miles and certainly at least once per year . Because oil degrades over time it should be regularly replaced and is the best way to guarantee a long engine life . We do not like using long life oil without changing it , they still pick up impurities and degrade . <p> Oil Filter - I prefer to avoid non brand makes as the filtration is sometimes much worse . A magnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stops engine wear is worth getting if you can source one .

Always ensure that you have sufficient antifreeze to cope with a -20 degree temperature below your expected lowest temperature . Antifreeze acts as a coolant so it has a benefit in the summer as well . <p> Washers - top up washers with a screen cleaner and clean water - cold pre boiled water will reduce bodywork streaking as does filtered water ( Do not use washing up liquid ! ) <p> Spark plugs - remove the old plugs and check them for pitting , oil fouling etc .

This is the goal that many set out to achieve when modifying their car . <p> Although professional drag racing cars can do the quarter mile in less than half that time , 10 seconds remains a reasonable goal for serious car tuners . Having a 10 second car puts you in a rather exclusive set of road legal cars . <p> Find out what it takes to build a 10 second car . <p> What does it take to make a 10 second car ?

Remember to adjust the revs if your car is producing a lot of power as a loss of traction can easily rob you of valuable time . <p> You need to balance the traction with the amount of power unleashed . Some drag racers rev high to get wheel-spin and then pull back of the throttle as they launch and when the tyres bite they put on the power again . <p> In a very powerful car you need to keep a careful control on the accelerator and reign in some of the tendency to wheel-spin . <p> 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line and certainly perform well but you can break a 4 wheel drive car if you ask too much of it so use the clutch to control the amount of power you are putting down . <p> 2 wheel drive cars will always suffer from wheel-spin , FWD more than RWD so you need to determine how much you can allow for the best launch possible . Riding the clutch at launch will help control the wheel-spin and you will eventually be able to feel the point of most grip as you feather the clutch and accelerator pedals ( use the clutch more than the accelerator at launch to control the power going to the tires because you want to get the engine into its power band ) . <p> Manufacturers pressures are designed to give even pressure across the whole tread .

Due to the conservative settings used by manufacturers and low cost production methods and techniques there are plenty of opportunities to improve your engine . <p> People are often told to tune their car but what does a tune up involve and how do you go about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of popular engine types . <p> Most of TorqueCars members are interested in maximizing the performance of their cars . But these methods can also be used to maximize economy by pushing the engine into it 's most efficient range . <p> Your first step is to ensure that the engine is running as it was intended . Change the oil and filter , fit new spark plugs and perform a full service if the leads are old they will also need replacing . <p> Get the engine compression tested and rectify any major issues like worn piston rings and broken or worn valves . ( Checking the valve clearance is also a very good idea as this can lose a fair bit of power . ) <h> How to tune a Carburetor engines <p> These typically rely on a breaker to distribute the spark with a crude mechanical advance as the RPM rises . By timing the spark to occur a fraction earlier you can extract a more complete burn cycle and more efficiently convert the fuel and air mix into power . Too much advance is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Generally speaking a trial and error approach can often be used , if you gradually turn up the advance until the engine starts knocking and then back it off a bit you will have a good setup . <p> Getting the right timing and spark duration will help improve power and economy as the engine is running more efficiently . <p> Using a strobe light connected to the spark plug pulse you can effectively freeze the engine and see the timing mark . The timing mark is located at the bottom of the cambelt on the pulley , there is typically a small groove and a little notch marked on the engine . <p> If you mark the groove and white notch with some white paint it will show up when the strobe light hits it . This will enable you to better adjust the engine timing . <p> By rotating the distributor housing you can adjust the timing by advancing it or retarding it . Adjustment should be done gradually and the engine will need to be tested under load at the full rpm range . A rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make adjustments live . <p> If you want to increase the fuel to match the intake air you will need to a larger jet ( some wrongly refer to jets as needles ! ) . Carb setup can be a real art and if you have twin carbs then the job gets even harder . Most carbs come with the correct jet sizes and you should only uprate them if you want to make dramatic alterations to the engine and increase the intake air charge significantly . <p> The key is matching the fuel to air delivery and with modern fuel injection engines this is becoming a dying art . <h> How to tune a fuel injection engine <p> Fuel injected engines are much more sophisticated , both the amount of fuel and the timing of the spark is delivered and is adjusted . <p> The old mechanical spark distribution was far from ideal and meant that most of the time the engine was not running at peak efficiency . Spark timing needs to vary a lot more than a simple linear curve will allow . So to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stores a fuel and timing map across varying loads and intake conditions to provide optimum running . <p> Most modern engines operate on a closed loop which basically means that the parameters for the next combustion cycle are set by the previous one . The exhaust is sniffed for oxygen to determine if the car is running rich or lean and the intake fueling is adjusted to match . <p> Many popular engines learn over time the optimum settings and every 200 miles or so adjust the ideal map to keep the engine running efficiently . This takes into account driving style , seasonal temperature adjustments and varying grades of fuel . <p> As the fuel delivery and timing map is stored and controlled on computer there is little a home tuner can do other than replace the chip or add a piggy back device . ( See ECU tuning . ) <p> On a naturally aspirated engine you can probably wring another 10% power out of the engine by tightening up the fuel delivery and timing maps . Manufacturers tend to set the engine conservatively . <h> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel delivery and timing the spark are just as essential in a turbo engine . All of the above point apply to turbo engines but the gains are much more noticable due to the effect of the turbo . As the turbo is pushing more air into the engine and is making more power you have a lot more to gain . <p> The turbo is the heart of the engine so we also need to pay attention to this . Matching the exhaust and intake compression impellers to your air needs can make dramatic alterations to the power band . You can hybridize the turbo using a stock OEM turbo casing and uprating the internals . Another option is to fit a second turbo or just replace the existing turbo with a larger unit . <p> It all depends what your power requirements are . See our turbo tuning articles to get more of an idea on what is involved in a tuned turbo engine . <p> Pre 2000 engines are typically very hard to remap so you are stuck with piggy back devices or a risky chip change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar and these allow a relatively easy way to upload and reflash the cars computer . <p> On a modern turbo engine the computer will typically control the boost and waste gate in addition to the fueling and timing so you have much more scope for power gains . <p> A modern turbo engine can often make a power gain of 40% quite easily on stock parts with a simple remap . <h> Other ways to tune an engine . <p> Further modifications and links to more information on them . Once you know about the characteristics of timing it is worth looking at the many other options and seeing what extra mods can be done to your cars engine . <p> We have mainly looked at timing so far . There are a large number of other modifications you can do to an engine to increase it 's state of tune . Balancing your engine allows an engine to run at higher RPM , adding a sports camshaft will further raise the power band and alter the timing and duration of the engines induction , compression , bang and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also a priority and a set of performance headers a sports exhaust , sport catalyst and some head work such as porting and polishing will further increase the power band . <p> If you have a turbo then you also have some additional options open to you .

You could also uprate your turbo by fitting a larger turbo or get your existing turbo hybridized with uprated internals . Wastegate and blow off control can also be altered to increase the power produced by the engine . <p> Diesel engine tuning is covered in this diesel tuning article .

Although sticking a propeller in the exhaust flow will reduce the exhaust efficiency the power gains on offer more than make up for this . <p> So who invented the the turbo ?

It is the power gains that TorqueCars members are most interested in , although the economy is nice to have . <p> Turbos allow small and light engines to produce the same power as a large engine twice its size but with lower fuel consumption . <p> The potential for turbo tuning power gains is massive .

With a remap you can overcome this limitation . <p> Fuel delivery also needs to matched to avoid running a lean mixture so the computer controls the timing and quantities of fuel delivery . Please review the articles on Remaps , BOVs , Boost controllers for more detailed information . <p> Are there any drawbacks to turbo engines ? Until the exhaust gases start to flow quickly enough there is little the turbo can do . <p> This is manifest in what is referred to as lag where the engine seems lifeless until the turbo kicks in . The bigger the turbo the greater the lag problem . <p> Also when you compress air you heat it up and as we all know hot air carries less oxygen than colder air . This is easily solved with an intercooler . <p> No longer are we limited to a single turbo . Many cars now come equipped with Twin Turbos such as the GTO and Nissan 300zx . Big turbos are also on offer and this is the usual path an upgrader will take . We also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each turbo as exhaust flow increases for a steady power delivery . <p> So now we know how a turbo works and what they are we can look at tuning them and getting more power from one . <h> Uprating turbos . <p> Adding a turbo to a standard engine is another option . <p> There are quite a few considerations to uprating a turbo so read our turbo uprating article for a brief overview of some of the obstacles you will encounter . <p> Turbos are one of the best innovations in automotive engine technology . <p> They allow a small engine to produce similar power to much larger engines . <p> This enables the engine to be more efficient and with the move away from large V6 and V8 engines the turbo enables a manufacturer to build a car which has both economy and performance . <p> Your main aim in tuning a turbo is to enhance the airflow through the turbo . This applies equally well on the exhaust and intake side . Enlarging the intake channel and polishing the internal surfaces will dramatically reduce internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the casting process leaves seams and pits which dramatically affect air flow . <p> Using ball bearings instead of thrust bearings will allow the turbo to spool up more quickly . Ball bearings also last longer than trust bearings . Ceramic bearings have also been used for their heat resistant properties . <p> We should add that the larger capacity engines including the V6 and lazy V8 's will produce phenomenal power gains if they were turbocharged as some of our serious drag racing members have discovered . <p> A 2.5 litre engine in NASP form will usually produce around 200-260 bhp . When the same engine is setup for a turbo we see power figures from 400 to 1000bhp . <p> Just a word of warning from TorqueCars - the turbo is spinning at 100,000 's of RPM so be cautious when you switch off it needs oil if it is going to survive . If you switch off the engine whilst the turbo is hot you will burn off the oil inside the turbo causing excessive friction and wear . <p> Switching off the engine also stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cool down by slowing up towards the end of your journey . Sadly people are generally ignorant of the oil and heat problem and will just switch off their engine after a spirited run . <p> To discuss all aspects of Turbo tuning and turbo engines with our enthusiastic and friendly car modding community please join our free forum .

You need to follow our tips to make your conversion run smoothly . <p> This is sadly not just a " bolt on and hope it works " conversion , there are many considerations especially if you are keen to get the most power you can and want a smooth power delivery . <p> A supercharger offers linear power gains as it is driven by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increase in compressed air . <p> As long as you are serious about this project and have 50 hours of qualified mechanics time to commit then go ahead . <p> Things are a little easier with a full aftermarket kit as all the flaws have been worked out but it still takes a lot of time , and these kits are not cheap . <h> Why supercharge ? <p> Your typical NASP engine is only 60% efficient and even a highly tuned performance engine will only reach the low to mid 80% when looking at its volumetric efficiency . This is why a small engined car with a supercharger can produce similar power to a NASP engine nearly twice it 's size ! <p> A small supercharged 1.4 engine could produce 230bhp easily whereas a 2.0 NASP engine would struggle to get above 200BHP . Most tuners accept a theoretical ceiling of 100bhp per liter on a NASP engine . With a supercharger you can push way beyond this . <p> With more power you will hit the issue of reliability . Thankfully most modern engines are over engineered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock form . Larger gains are on offer if you are prepared to strengthen your engine and lower the compression ratio . <h> Problems encountered when supercharging an engine . <p> Without direct injection or water cooling you will run into problems supercharging an engine with a compression ratio over 7:1 . Most standard NASP engines are around 10:1 which will only tolerate low boost and it is vital that you get the fueling and mapping spot on . <p> It is worth noting at this point that the ideal CR ( compression ratio ) and boost levels vary greatly from engine to engine so a little research is highly recommended . Some engines such as the GM Ecotec 2.2 as fitted to the Saturn Ion and Chevrolet Cobalt , is reportedly best at a CR of 10:1 and no lower than 9:1 for a supercharger conversion . Operating RPM and torque bands also come into play here along with the fuel delivery method . <p> Detonation or premature ignition is the biggest problem you will face adding a supercharger to your car . If the engine pressure is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with potentially catastrophic effects . <p> You may also find the car running rich or lean , neither of which are particularly desirable . The air flow sensor will often need to be upgraded and you must get the car fully mapped so the fuel delivery matches the delivered air . <p> You may also find the fuel injectors and fuel pump can not keep up with the engines need for more fuel so these will probably need to be uprated . <p> You will also need to find space in your engine bay . The supercharger is driven by a belt from the crank which in most cars will also wrap around the alternator . This restricts you to citing the supercharger so the pulley is in line with this belt . It will also need to be linked to your induction piping . <p> You may find that relocating your battery and moving your air intake box will provide you with enough space . Some drivers place the supercharger on top of the engine and have it poking out of the front of the car . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run a double pulley and place a belt around this new outer pulley on the crank to drive your supercharger . <h> Supercharging solutions <p> Reducing the engine compression with lower compression pistons , and do some head and piston work etc which will allow you to run higher boost levels . <p> If you just want to add a supercharger and avoid internal engine work then you 'll have to be content with a low boost setting . <p> The amount of boost from the supercharger can be controlled with a different size drive pulley . Simple gearing kicks in here and you just change the pulley size to alter the speed the supercharger runs at . <p> You can also avoid detonation with direct fuel injection . This helps cool the air charge and the fuel can be added much later in the squish cycle . Alternatively water injection can help dampen down and cool the air charge . <p> Higher octane fuel is also more resistant to knock so you should expect to switch to the highest octane fuels to protect your engine and keep everything running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowed , and a 3 or 5 angle valve job to maximise the air flow into the engine . big valve conversion can also make a difference and there is a big chance that your stock air box is now a restriction so you 'll need to look at the induction filter and upgrade this along with the exhaust . <p> A professional remap is essential . Many cars ECU 's will just go into a limp home mode when it detects the unusual amount of extra air coming into the engine . This should be set up on a rolling road . <p> Be careful with aftermarket ECU 's as some of these do not have knock sensors and on a project like this is not a risk we at TorqueCars would be willing to take . <p> Your clutch and gearbox may also need to be uprated to cope with the extra power . In extreme cases where you significantly move the power band you may also need to alter the gearing to take full advantage of this . <p> Our top tip is to get a supercharger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your project , a new supercharger costs a fortune . <p> We are starting to see some of our members adding superchargers to turbo charged engines with very impressive results , this is known as twin charging . 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

" <p> So what exactly is engine knock and how dangerous is it ? What causes engine knock and how can it be avoided ? <p> You may notice a knocking or rattling noise from your engine or a sudden loss of power under full throttle . <p> Immediately back off the throttle and only use low rpm engine speeds until you can get the engine investigated . <p> The chances are that you are suffering from a condition known as " engine knock " . <p> Engine knock is a condition where the fuel in the engine ignites prematurely . It can cause serious damage to an engine . How does this damage occur ? <p> A knock at the door means the arrival of a friend - a knock in your engine indicates the arrival of an enemy ! <p> Firstly if the piston has not achieved its top dead centre position you risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of stress on the crank and other pistons as everything effectively seizes up . <p> Secondly if the intake valve has not closed the flame front will move through the intake of your engine causing damage . <p> Thankfully engines are fitted with a knock sensor that detects this as it happens and backs off the fueling causing the engine to run lean and avoid knock . The knock sensor will not save an engine from the effects of a serious knock and should not be viewed as a safety valve . It is an emergency only option and will only work effectively in mild situations . <p> The causes of engine knock are many and varied . Generally it is caused by high pressure inside the engine . As fuel is compressed it gets hot and this can cause it to ignite prematurely . Occasionally it may be caused by a misfire of the spark or even a hotspot inside the cylinder . <p> Over tuning an engine to a very high compression ratio will often cause this problem . Running a high pressure forced induction setting will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other causes of premature ignition include hot spots inside the engine . If the carbon build up is allowed to continue you will potentially have deposits of carbon glowing red hot igniting the fuel as it enters the engine . <p> The octane rating of fuel describes the fuels resistance to engine knock . In a lot of cases simply switching to a higher octane fuel will solve your engine knock problem . A lot of Japanese cars run high compression ratios and the manufacturers demand high octane fuel be used . <p> You may have filled up with a bad batch of fuel . In some countries the octanes of standard fuels can be lower than you expect so it is worth checking the octane before filling up . If you have no choice but to buy a poor quality or low octane fuel back off the throttle and run with low rpm engine speeds . <p> Avoiding engine knock . All engines are fitted with sensors which detect knock and retard the fueling to prevent engine damage . <p> Lowering the compression ratio of the engine . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuilt the engine with a suitable stroker kit to alter the compression ration . Thicker gaskets make very little difference to the compression ratio and are generally much less reliable than standard gasket widths . <p> In turbo application where you need to wring out the maximum power you will find the solution in water injection . We have a detailed article on water injection if you need more information . Basically water is injected into the engine via the air/fuel intake . The water suppresses the ignition point of the engine allowing a more complete burn . Water has the benefit of vaporising on combustion and produces Hydrogen and Oxygen which will further help the burn of the engine . <p> Turn down the boost . If you are running a turbo and experience fuel cut off or the engine runs lean at wide open throttle you should suspect that the knock sensor is kicking in . This indicates that you are running just beyond the maximum and the pressure in the cylinder is causing the fuel to pre-ignite . Do not ignore this situation otherwise you risk serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boost via a programmable boost controller . You may be able to modify the wastegate control also to achieve the ideal boost parameters . <p> ( Restore the engine to a lower boost/compression ratio setting before doing this . ) The engine may be suffering from a build up of carbon deposits and these cause hotspots in the engine . Clean out the engine to remove this build up . Ideally the engine should be stripped down and rebuilt , but this is not a cheap answer . <p> There are a number of effective engine cleaning methods that do not require a rebuild . Firstly add some injector cleaner such as Redex or better still some BG44k to the fuel tank and take the car on a long run with the engine rpms at motorway speeds . A couple of hours will suffice .

@@24423343 @4423343/ <h> Lowering the compression ratio <p> " Feeling under pressure ? " <p> The compression ratio in short is the amount of air that an engine can squish ready for the bang phase of combustion . A 9:1 compression ratio simply means that 9 units of air will be compressed into the space of just 1 unit . <p> The compression ratio has a dramatic effect on an engines performance and the problem of knock , ( where the air fuel mix prematurely ignites ) is controlled to a large degree by the compression ratio . Using higher octane fuel will also minimise the issues here as will adding water injection , but the real solution is simply to reduce the compression ratio . <p> To calculate your compression ratio you simply divide the swept volume ( which will not change unless the engine is bored out and/or the crankshaft is replaced with one of longer throw ) into the combustion chamber volume . Compression ratio is worked out by dividing the volume above the piston when it is at TDC into the volume above the piston when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bigger margin of error you have to play with which makes tuning much easier . If you have a high compression ratio there is not much margin for error and detonation and knock are real problems . <p> We look at the best ways of lowering an engines compression ratio . <p> While you are reducing the compression ratio it would make sense to strengthen the internal engine parts . <p> This makes even more sense if you using forced induction to increase the power of your engine . <p> *Do n't make the mistake of thinking that compression ratios determine the maximum boost you can safely run . This is only a small part of the equation . The critical thing is your fueling , the fuel air mixture , and ignition timing are the key ingredients here . A lower compression ratio will give you more of a margin for error and in the main allows you to run higher boost than you could otherwise . We have heard of some engines running 15psi or more boost on a 10:1 compression ratio , and these usually have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A few notes when working out your final compression ratio . When you replace the head on your engine it will typically have needed to be skimmed and this increases the compression ratio , so will need to be taken into account with your calculations . The thickness of a new gasket will also be slightly more than it will be when the head is torqued down onto it , so take a gasket thickness measurement from the old gasket . <p> Methods of reducing the compression ratio <p> Low compression pistons . This seems to be the way to go . The pistons are much shorter than conventional ones . A small plus is that they are also often lighter so the engine will rev a little more freely . We would recommend combining low compression pistons with a shorter stroke to get the most benefit . The shape of the piston crown will also have a bearing on the amount of compression that takes place in the engine . This will require a strip down of the engine and whilst the engine is apart you may just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Shorter rods &amp; reducing the stroke . A shorter stroke will have a dramatic effect on the compression ratio . By combining this method with low compression pistons one can start to think about running very high boost pressures when adding a turbo . The crank will also have some impact on the throw of the engine and the crank , piston crowns and rods should ideally all be matched up . <p> Head work , again increases the volume of the cylinder but the effectiveness depends a lot on how the intake and exhaust valves are sited , and how much space there is for you to work with . Removing the head is relatively simple and does not require as much effort as other compression lowering mods , but it requires great skill to do a proper job on the head and achieve the lower compression ratio you are seeking . <p> Thicker head gaskets . This option is a bit of a bodge , but we should mention it as a lot of people do run thicker gaskets to achieve a lower compression ratio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ) to achieve a lower compression ratio ! Using multiple gaskets is certainly not recommended and introduces a major weak spot in an engine . A thicker gasket will reduce the compression ratio by a small fraction , probably only by .1 or .2 . This is by far the easiest method of reducing compression but the risk is gasket failure and the gains in lower compression are minimal . <p> Decompression plates are essentially an extension to the head and can be very effective at reducing the compression ratio . The block side needs a conventional gasket seal but the head side generally only requires a non setting high temperature sealant ( in the case of aluminium decompression plates ) . Plates can be made of a variety of metals and we suggest you talk to a specialist about your options here .

If your using cans , then lots of thin layers . Anytime your layering the paint to build a thickness it needs to cure enough to hold the weight of the next layer without rolling down . <p> The ideal time to recoat is when the paint is tacky like the back of a stamp but not really wet but if its totally dry remove the shine with a fine scotch cloth and apply a dust like gripper coat before adding any more paint . <p> If I was painting a full car I 'd put half of my paint on in a day , over a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then applying the rest the next day , 3 days would n't be unusual .

First I remove runs and bumps that are in the paint using 400 grit wet and dry fixed to a lollypop stick with double sided tape and I take my time . Once all those problems are gone I start the main part of the flatting . <p> I use sanding blocks covered in 10mm soft neoprene rubber to ensure the wet and dry paper moulds to the shape of the body . I start with 800 grit , working methodically so that I do n't miss bits and sponge the area down with clean water . I repeat this until the paint is free of any visible texture which normally takes a full day . I then repeat the process with 1200 grit and fresh clean water . <p> The water needs to be clean because it will have abrasive grit in it from the rougher paper if not and the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it needs to . You can use machines for this but you do n't need them and its safer not to because the paint will be relatively soft and you can easily pick up a bit of something and scratch the finish without realising its happening . I then repeat this with 2000 grit and then 3000 grit and its all done wet . The flatting process normally takes 3-4 full days . <p> The finish should at this stage look like a milky haze if you look at it square on but shiny from any sort of angle . The final process is applying swirl remover which is a very fine abrasive paste ( polish on polish off ) and that will reveal a fabulous finish and it can be done with patients but very basic facilities . <p> Before applying the coloured paint you should use primer and sand it back meticulously using the lollypop stick and 400 then 600 or 800 grit and if you do n't prime the whole area at the very least it needs to be dulled with a scotch pad .

@@24423345 @4423345/ <h> All you need to know about remote turbo kits <p> If you have limited engine bay space or just want an easy retrofit turbo option you will do well to consider a remote turbo kit . <p> What are the advantages and disadvantages of remote turbos and how do they work ? <p> Usually the turbo is mounted on the engine exhaust manifold , if there is space and it can cope with the heat . <p> This is where a remote turbo differs as it is fitted much further down the exhaust pipe . <p> Usually a remote turbo will be fitted at the rear of the vehicle just before the rear silencer , or sometimes on the underside of the car if there is sufficient clearance . We have seen these on the side of a car or just under the gearbox behind the engine . <p> A remote turbo follows the same operational principles as a conventional turbo , but is just further away from the engine bay . <p> Temperatures are lower as the exhaust has dissipated much of the heat , the longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spool rates are lower . It can make mapping the turbo easier and offers a simple low boost turbo solution where engine bay space is limited . <p> The intake air is then channeled back from the turbo compressor to the front of the car and into the engine . Despite the length of the run the delivery is to all practical purposes instantaneous with only a minor loss in boost pressure if the pipe work is in good condition . <h> To fit a remote turbo kit <p> You will need to cut into the exhaust and direct the exhaust flow into the turbo intake . A heat shield may also be required , especially if the turbo is going to be mounted near the fuel tank . <p> You 'll also need to reroute the engine intake through the remote turbo and we strongly recommend good quality pipes are used , preferably metal but high quality silicone hoses can also work and are easier to fit . It does mean the air intake can be near the rear of the car to avoid the hot engine bay temperatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the turbo and back again . <p> Unless you opt for an oilless turbo it will need a supply of oil , either it 's own pumped supply with cooler or taking a feed from the engine oil . <p> Next you will need to adjust the fueling and timing , a specialist job . A remap on a rolling road is your only option if you want to avoid blowing up the engine and want to extract the maximum amount of power from your mods . Injectors will also need to be uprated and most standard air filters will be unable to flow enough air where a turbo has been added . <p> Safety systems will need to be added . If the turbo runs too hot or the oil line cuts out it would be detrimental to the turbo to keep the engine running . <p> Depending on the boost provided and your vehicles mapping , you will also need to factor in some further modifications to control the exhaust flow through the turbo in the form of a waste gate control and a diverter valve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you are running high boost levels you should either reduce the engines compression ratio or introduce other measures against detonation like direct injection or adding water injection and using higher octane fuel . <p> Thankfully the remote turbo is relatively simple in it 's setup and tolerates a wide range of varying conditions compared to a conventional turbo . <h> What are the advantages of a remote turbo ? <p> They are generally easier to fit than a standard turbo ( easier to map and installation space is normally more accessible ) and due to lower temperatures they require less lubrication and cooling . Due to the length of the run back to the engine intake there is little need for an intercooler . <p> Their lower boost characteristics avoids many problems with detonation associated with adding a turbo to a conventional engine . <h> So what are the disadvantages of remote turbos ? <p> They do not provide as much power as a traditionally mounted turbo would . It can reduce your ground clearance and may require additional heat shielding depending on where it is located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and impacts under the car or on the side so adding a guard is generally a good idea . A a sturdy mesh or aluminum shield is a good idea but ensure it would still allow plenty of airflow around the turbo housing . <p> You can source a cheap turbo unit from a breakers yard , then it 's just a matter of fabricating the piping and exhaust flow yourself and setting up the timing/fuelling . ( TorqueCars would not recommend using a diesel turbo unit on a petrol engine as these are setup for much lower exhaust flow rates and lower temperatures . ) Remote turbos work really well on large block V6 and V8 engines but we have seen applications and kits that will work on lesser cars . <p> We would recommend starting off with a very low boost setting and running the car on a rolling road with diagnostic equipment to monitor the air to fuel ratio and measure the risk of detonation . Gradually tweak the boost and mapping until you reach the optimum setting for the vehicle and then for safety and reliability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 38234 @qwx238234

In the real world things are very different . <p> Put a turbo on an engine with an 10:1 compression ratio and watch it go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding a turbo to a NASP engine . <p> Put a turbo on an engine with an 10:1 compression ratio and watch it go bang ! ( Direct injection helps to avoid premature ignition- issues , and has been effectively used on modern petrol engines , something they borrowed from diesels. ) - There are a lot of considerations to make when adding a turbo to a NASP engine . <p> Things to take into account when adding a turbo to a non turbo car ( NASP or naturally aspirated engine ) . <p> If you are thinking of adding a turbo to your car we suggest you join our friendly forum and- get some specific tips and advice for your- car model . <p> When a naturally aspirated engine sucks air in , it can only draw so much in before the intake valve closes and seals the cylinder . <p> The average N/A engine will pull in around 60% of its potential volume , so as a result is only 60% volumetrically efficient. - <p> The- more highly tuned an- engine is the more efficient it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and effort tuning their NASP engines but will still struggle to get anything approaching 85% efficiency . <p> The best way to improve this is to force the air/fuel mixture into the cylinders ( forced induction ) thus filling them more . The average forced induction engine runs- from 110% to 150% volumetric efficiency . <p> Some- examples of the this to help provide context on the benefits of adding a turbo . A 2- liter NASP motor will use effectively around 1200-1300cc of its capacity and will typically produce up to an optimum 200bhp ( based on 100bhp per 1000cc ) . A turbocharged or supercharged 2.0 liter engine- will use much more of it 's capacity , producing more power as it is now able to burn more fuel . ( This gives a turbo engine an optimum power figure far in excess of 100bhp per cylinder . ) <p> For example a turbo charged 1.6 engine in a formula 1 application produced well over 1000bhp . We frequently see 2.0 litre turbo cars hitting 600bhp and more with relative ease providing daily use whilst maintaining reliability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ components to work from . <p> The more boost you run , the more efficient the engine , hence we have 1.4 litre turbo engines producing as much power as large- V6 's . But the main benefit from increasing boost is to increase the final compression ratio and getting a better bang from an increased air/fuel charge mix in your cylinders ( the actual engines compression ratio stays the same but as there is more air coming into the engine it will become more compressed ) . <p> If you increase the amount of air/fuel in the cylinders , then as a result you will increase the compression , which could be too much . In order to keep the final running compression the same , the initial compression ( without boost ) has to be dropped to compensate . <p> More air will enable more oxygen to be available for burning and with the addition of additional fuel the engine will release more power . Turbo charging is the best way to increase the efficiency of an engine . When adding a turbo to an engine which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complications to take into account . <p> Pre-ignition or knock - this is where the fuel ignites under pressure before the spark happens . This will cause a piston to move in the opposite direction if it has not reached the top dead center and will have disastrous consequences for the engine . <p> To avoid detonation ( premature ignition ) you will need to lower the compression ratio of the engine , and/or restrict the turbo to a lower boost threshold . ( Low compression engines plus a turbo will also avoid some of- the turbo lag problems inherent in most turbo applications . ) The best turbos to add to a non turbo NASP ( Naturally aspirated ) engine are small units with low boost levels . Another option you have is to fit a water injection kit to dampen the air charge and prevent detonation . <p> To lower the compression you can go with a- re-bore and fit lower compression pistons , you can add a stroker kit to alter the compression ratio or for minor adjustments you could get a larger head and thicker head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio . <p> You need to aim for around a- 7:1 compression ratio if you are adding a turbo , anything above 9:1 and you will have problems . In all cases you should use the highest octane fuel that you can find as the higher the octane the more resistant the fuel is to engine knock . With the right fueling though we have seen people running 25psi of boost on a 10:1 compression ratio but we should add that the aftermarket ECU and fueling mods were of a very high specification on this application . <p> If you can reduce the boost pressure to 5-7psi ( as opposed to 25-35psi ) , and use the higher octane fuels available ( e.g. Shell Optimax ) you should be able to run a turbo on a standard engine with around the 9:1 compression ratio . For- information on Octane and its effect on engine knock read our octane article . <p> Direct injection as pioneered on Diesel engines is finding it 's way into petrol engines and because the fuel is inject later into the intake charge it reduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is why FSi - and Di turbo engines can run very high compression ratios . <p> When adding a turbo , for maximum performance gains , - you should also get the head flowed , increase the port size , fit bigger valves and go with a larger exhaust header and system as there will be a much larger volume of air flowing through the engine . <p> Fitting an adjustable- boost controller will allow you to experiment on a rolling road while attached to diagnostic equipment to find the optimum boost pressure and timing advance . <p> Particular attention should be paid to fueling . More air requires more fuel or you risk the danger of burning too lean . You also want- to avoid overfueling when the boost from the turbo drops as this can destroy the engine . <p> On most aftermarket turbo applications it is unlikely that the cars existing fuel delivery system will be able to deliver sufficient fuel so you will need to uprate the fuel pressure with a new pump and fuel pressure regulator , the injectors will also need uprating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account the new fueling requirements of a turbo , especially with regard to throttle position and wastegate control and rapidly changing fuel requirements between on and off boost conditions . <p> We strongly recommend a good aftermarket ECU to allow you to create a custom map for your new turbocharged engine . <p> Most kits contain only the necessary parts to physically get the turbo onto the engine such as an exhaust header and the necessary intake plumbing to the air filter . <p> Turbos are expensive but will add the most power for your money . You should allow about 40 hours for fitting , you really do need to know what you are doing and will require the ability to create a custom ECU map . Generally speaking though it will usually be easier to source a turbocharged engine and do a engine transplant to this- than add a turbo to a NASP engine .

@@24423347 @4423347/ <h> Adding a supercharger - the advantages and disadvantages . <p> Superchargers offer the promise of substantial power gains with very few drawbacks . So let 's look at the growing popularity of supercharger kits and see what its all about . <p> A supercharger is quite simply an air compressor which helps push more air into an engine . <p> These are driven by a belt from the engine effectively creating pull on the engine sapping up to 30% of the engines power . <p> For this reason superchargers are not as efficient as turbo chargers , which are driven from ' spare ' energy taken from waste exhaust gases . <p> For tips on adding a supercharger to your car you 'll need this article . <p> The big advantage for superchargers is that they produce additional power from much lower engine speeds and do not suffer from the inherent lag of turbos . <p> There are two main types of supercharger , a positive displacement supercharger , which gives a fairly constant level of boost making tuning a much simpler process , and dynamic compressors , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any compression of air will raise the air temperature , so add an intercooler to keep the air charge cool . <p> It is better to fit a supercharger to a Naturally aspirated engine than going for a turbo because you will have much more control over the power and it will be delivered in a more consistent manner establishing a good base for ECU tuning to take full advantage of the power . <p> This is where pressure in the engine causes the air/fuel to prematurely ignite causing extensive engine damage . <p> Just as with a turbo you would need to lower the compression ratio of the engine in relation to the amount of boost you are putting into the engine . <p> Ideally you want to lower the compression of an engine to around 8:1 to allow a reasonable level of boost , although this varies from application to application and with water injection this can be safely exceeded . Using higher octane fuel will also help to reduce the risk of detonation . <p> Typically superchargers are more expensive to make than turbo chargers . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels and after market kits will be available for most popular engines . <p> The other advantage of a supercharger is that the charge temperature is substantially lower than an equivalent turbo application and cooler air carries more oxygen which means more fuel can be burned therefore releasing more power . <p> Any form of compression of air creates a temperature rise so an intercooler is still a good idea on a supercharged engine . You will also need to uprate your fueling . <p> Manufacturers are now producing dual forced induction systems . These give a good compromise between low down boost and top end power . Offerings such as Volkswagens 1.4 twincharger engine can produce a massive 168hp and 177 lb-ft torque , and still return fuel consumption around 40mpg . A smaller engine is also lighter and smaller so fairly small cars can be fitted with these engines and offer very good performance . <p> As modern engines are so well built there is a lot of scope for the addition of forced air induction without dramatically impairing reliability . <p> The supercharger is also an easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are also some interesting projects around where superchargers are being added to turbo engined cars to provide the best of both worlds . <p> Join us in our forum to see which mods our members rate and swap ideas and plans for your tuning project .

DMF are subject to wear and if the sprung link goes will seriously hamper the smooth running nature of the engine . <h> Benefits of solid flywheels <p> They do not wear out , and as such will not need to be replaced or repaired . They are also cheaper to buy . <p> They do not break up when they fail .

A DMF will also protect an engine as well as the gearbox from shock and vibration . <h> Should you replace a DMF with a solid flywheel ? <p> It is our considered opinion that unless a car is used extensively for competition or off road you should stick with a DMF . The additional torque caused by tuning an engine or heavy competition use can quickly destroy a DMF , without which these issues are passed on to the gearbox and drivetrain . The solution would be to fit a stronger , higher performance DMF but the aftermarket industry seems geared up to offer solid ones as the upgrade option . <p> A solid flywheel replacement is often regretted by it 's owner .

Flip paint is not actually 2 layers of different colour paint but a single colour which is refracted at certain angles . <p> It is a very special paint finish which is actually a complex and fully patented process . There are a few ways to achieve it but it certainly is not an easy finish you can get on a DIY basis unless you invest in quality equipment . <p> Colour is actually a frequency of light ( to oversimplify matters somewhat ) . High frequencies and low frequencies produce colours from Infra Red to Ultraviolet . <p> When you use a polarising filter you will actually filter out light coming from a certain angle . To illustrate this you may be photographing a car and the reflections on the paint are too strong . Adding a polarizer will stop the reflected light effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a polarising effect is seen which actually changes the frequency of the reflected light depending upon the angle it is view from . <p> This will restrict the colour flip effect to those of similar frequencies . This is technically known as an interference phenomenon where the reflected wavelengths are restricted to those resulting from the liquid crystal . <p> Flip paint looks best on cars with curvaceous surfaces . It is far from a DIY job though . <p> So how is this polarisation achieved ? The answer lies in liquid crystal . These are used in LCD displays from digital watches to computer screens . The beauty of liquid crystal is that a chain of liquid crystal polymers will line up in certain conditions . In the screens and displays a current is used . <p> The LCD crystal polymers are blended with the carrier . This carrier which we will simply refer to as a paint blend , also contains an additive to slow the drying time and allow the crystal polymers to re-orient themselves . <p> In the case of applying paint to a curved vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of predetermined layers . The base coat sets the range of colour with darker colours producing a stronger flip effect . After the base coat the liquid crystal blended paint is applied very very carefully at a specific spray rate and angle . The paint droplets each need to be an optimum size and density . <p> Application of heat will allow the crystals to line themselves up but if the paint dries too quickly it will become set in a chaos pattern and become more like a candy coat . The heat is very carefully controlled and balanced . Some applications require a number of heat and cooling phases with varying paint thicknesses . <p> A clear coat is applied over the top to protect the paint and assist with that illusive showroom shine . <p> Other methods involve applying a charge to the vehicle which aligns the paint as it hit the metal surface .

Other cleaners are available but BG244 is in our opinion the most effective on the market . <h> How to avoid a blocked DPF . <p> Use good quality fuel . High Cetane fuel from major brands is laden with additives which help burn off the particles . Cheap fuel usually adds to the problem . TorqueCars recommend Shell fuel , our tests have shown that this burns cleaner and leaves less deposits in your engine . <p> Avoid short journeys where the engine does not warm up fully and trips where the car is not able to maintain 2000rpm for 5 mins . <p> Use a good quality fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Can the DPF be removed ? <p> Yes it can but this this not generally legal in most countries and territories .

This is best checked with the engine running . <p> An electric water pump can also increase the flow rate of coolant around the engine and will offer additional performance benefits . <p> An oil cooler also makes sense if you are experiencing overheating . <p> All the oil is circulated through a radiator which lowers the oil temperatures and aids with engine cooling . You 'll need to top up with slightly more oil now as the oil cooler will act as a store for the oil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one if fitted then look to get a higher flowing one ( fit this on the engine side of the radiator so it pulls cold air through the radiator ) . For a proper job , also fit a shroud around the fan to help pull air right through the radiator . <p> This improves efficiency and cooling as the fan pulls all of the air through the radiator rather then just that that is in front of the blades . Adding a lower temperature sensor to your fan circuit will force the fan to kick in sooner and help prevent heat build up . <p> Look at ways of improving the escape routes for hot air out of the engine bay ( this is n't as easy as it first looks , as you need to know where the high and low pressure areas are in order to do it properly ) Adding some vents to the top of the engine bay and at the sides of the arches can help reduce the engine bay temperatures and increase the rate of cold air flow around the engine . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiator will dramatically cool it , but you will need to manage the delivery of coolant very carefully and will need to recharge the gas bottle or reservoir . 38243 @qwx238243 38233 @qwx238233 <h> Feedback 38237 @qwx238237 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234 
@@24423352 @4423352/ <h> Is running a car on LPG the cheaper option ? <p> " Something to Gas about " <p> The price of fuel in the UK seems to be getting ever higher , so how can I reduce my fuel bills ? <p> With fuel tax on the constant rise UK drivers face the highest fuel bills around . Prices quoted in this article are based on UK fuel pump prices and were correct at the time of writing ( June 2010 ) but will obviously change over time . <p> So what does the beleagured motorist do to save money on fuel prices ? <p> The most obvious way is switching to Diesel , Diesel is around 50% more efficient than petrol , with very little difference in price , maybe a penny or two a litre more . Diesel cars are common and many new ones come in under 120 Grams of CO2 reducing you vehicle excise duty to only 35 per year , or even free if it manages 99 grams of CO2 or less . <p> But is there an even cheaper way ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to petrol , yet offers two real advantages , firstly it is a lot cheaper being only about 52% of the cost of petrol , and secondly it is a lot cleaner than petrol , thus reducing your CO2 emissions for the green minded ones among TorqueCars members and readers . <p> So how would LPG compare in running cost to a diesel , well to work this out we need a test car or two . Let 's take a small car the Fiat 500 and a larger car a Ford Mondeo . First the Fiat . <p> So how many miles do you have to do to save money by converting to LPG . <p> The fiat 500 1.2 base model starts at 8,300 for the petrol or 9,700 for the diesel . Once you have taken into account the cost of the LPG conversion , I received a quote for 1500 for the Fiat , although they can be cheaper ranging from around 1,200+ , that brings the price of both cars to within 100 the LPG car costing a little more . <p> Below is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Purchase price <p> Av.MPG <p> Miles per Year <p> Cost of fuel per ltr <p> Annual Fuel Cost <p> 500LPG <p> 9,800 <p> 52.5 <p> 12,000 <p> 62.9 <p> 652 <p> 500 Diesel <p> 9.700 <p> 67.3 <p> 12,000 <p> 121.9 <p> 986 <p> LPG is around 5% less efficient than petrol so I have reduced the cars MPG from 55.4 to 52.5 to reflect this . Even bearing this in mind though the LPG car would give an annual saving of 334 in fuel , obviously the more miles you do the more this would add up . <p> What about the Ford ? <p> Car <p> Purchase price <p> Av.MPG <p> Miles per year <p> Cost of fuel per ltr <p> Annual Fuel Cost <p> Mondeo 1.6 <p> Edge with LPG <p> 18,895 <p> 37.2 <p> 15,000 <p> 62.9 <p> 1,151 <p> Mondeo 1.8TDCI <p> 18,895 <p> 49.6 <p> 15,000 <p> 121.9 <p> 1,673 <p> With the Ford you would save 522 per annum doing 15,000 miles per year . The bigger the car , the more you will save in fuel costs because the more fuel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear in mind is the warranty of the car . I asked the Fiat dealer if converting the 500 to LPG would affect the warranty , he answered yes . Even if the wing mirror was faulty and was not related to the LPG conversion it would not be covered once the car had been converted . Of course if you buy a car over three years old and convert it the warranty would have expired anyway . <p> Does converting to LPG affect insurance ? I did a quick quote on a major comparison website for a 40 year old male with 5 years no claims , with the conversion 230 without 195 . Some insurance companies wont accept cars with any modifications , and so it does limit who you can use . Vauxhall built a " Duelfuel " car , and Volvo a " Bifuel " car so these do not count as modified . But all things taken into account , even converted running costs would be cheaper . <p> Check out the car classifieds and search for LPG cars , there are many for sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their petrol counterparts so buying one already converted could save you the conversion cost . <p> With 1,400 LPG fuel stations around the nation you should always be able to top up , failing that you can always simply switch back to petrol as all cars keep their original tank and system , some have an internal switch to change from LPG to petrol and vice versa , others are automatic . Should you go the LPG route ? The choice is yours but should be dependant on your annual mileage , your MPG and how long you intend to keep the car . <p> This entry was @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

" <p> NB : NoS is a brand name of a company but many confuse this with the name of the gas Dinitrous Monoxide AKA Nitrous Oxide N20 , Dinitrous Monoxide , Dinitrogen oxide also referred to as Nitrous or giggle gas ( from its medical usage as an anesthetic . <p> It was used in wartime to boost the engines in aircraft and later became a big hit in drag racing in the Pro Mod class . Not a flammable gas in itself it is injected into the intake manifold where it mixes with air &amp; fuel . The main benefit of Nitrous comes as it burns and becomes an oxidizer releasing more oxygen into the engine . <p> An interesting side benefit of using Nitrous is the cooling effect it has . It rapidly changes from a liquid to a gas and produces a cooling effect . <p> When you get out of the bath the water starts to evaporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your body . <p> This cooling effect reduces the temperature of the air taken in by 60 degrees F. Colder air carries more oxygen which is required for combustion to take place - more oxygen means you can burn more fuel . <p> As the Nitrous gas is heated up in the combustion process it breaks down releasing additional oxygen and increases the burn rate allowing more fuel to enter the combustion chamber . Different size nozzle jets offer larger boosts to the power ranging from 20bhp more to over 200bhp more . <p> As well as sending Nitrous to the engine you will also need to supply additional fuel ( Nitrous provides a cooler denser air charge , more oxygen , so will run Lean if more fuel is not delivered . ) Obviously the engine has to be able to cope with this increased pressure and power so the jets are matched to the application . <p> Most standard engines can cope with a 20 - 40 bhp shot . Forged pistons , forged steel rods and a heavy-duty cylinder head with up rated gasket and performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major power increase . <p> A full range of Nitrous delivery systems are available for all applications of vehicles and engine types and can be matched to each cylinder in the engine . The common delivery systems are : - <p> WET ( The fuel and Nitrous are mixed and introduced together to the primary part of the intake . This system produces slightly more power than dry but can not be applied to an engine with a dry intake typically most fuel injected engines . ) DRY ( The extra fuel required to maintain the burn balance from Lean to Rich is delivered by the injectors of the car . The primary part of the intake is kept dry of fuel . ) FOGGER ( Named after the Fogger Nozzle mixes the fuel and Nitrous mixture and sprays it directly into the cylinder . Each cylinder can be set up separately and additional foggers can be added creating a dual stage kit . Foggers generally produce the most significant power gains . ) <p> A bottle warmer can assist with maintaining bottle pressure and delivering smooth power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle you need to weigh it as the pressure gauge just indicates the pressure in the bottle and this can vary depending on temperature . <p> Adding Nitrous is a very easy high power modification . The refills can be a hidden cost though . <p> It is fairly easy to fit Nitrous to a vehicle within 4 to 6 hours although most insurance companies will not provide cover for road use . ( As with all modifications your insurers must be notified . ) <p> A 10 lb bottle of Nitrous is good for about 3 minutes of boost ( 7-10 + miles runs ) but should n't really be operated for more than 10-15 seconds at a time if you do n't  want to blow up your engine . <p> Nitrous can also be applied to diesel engines a 130ps Golf TDI got almost double the power - but boy racers do n't  buy diesels well not until recently . <p> Medical grade NoS does not have a smell added like automotive grade Nitrous ( incidentally the smell added to car grade Nitrous is Hydrogen Sulfide , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissues and nerve endings if deliberately inhaled for recreation ! ) So you can use medical grade Nitrous in a car but not vice versa ! ! ! <p> When to press the Nitrous boost button At or over 2500 RPM with the throttle fully depressed you can buy a progressive boost system which matches the Nitrous shot to the throttle position and regulates the flow . You will receive an enormous increase of torque and this can result in a loss of traction so be careful at speed as a loss of traction usually equals an impressive spin and crash . <p> Pressing the Nitrous button and then starting the engine can cause catastrophic engine damage . If the button is accidentally pressed - disengage the coil and turn the engine over a few times to clear the cylinders . <p> very informative especially for a first time modifier like myself . excellent good news about the the NO2 , I set myself a limit of 50bhp boost gain so I was n't far wrong and no mager engine mods either ! ! happy days 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

How does this method work and is it better than a single clutch gear change on a modern car fitted with a synchromesh ? Does it still have a place in modern driving techniques . <h> How to double de-clutch . <p> For example on the up change 1st Gear to 2nd gear - <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in neutral <p> Match transmission speed to engine rpm by pausing , RPM is a little lower when changing up <p> Clutch down then select second gear . <p> Changing down from 4th to 3rd gear . <p> Clutch down gear to neutral , <p> Clutch up still in neutral <p> Match transmission speed to engine rpm by pressing the throttle , RPM is higher when changing down <p> Clutch down then select second gear . <p> On cars with lightened flywheels a double de-clutch still has merit as the engine revs will dip quickly and may need to be increased . It really depends on the engine and the amount of revs involved at the time of the gear change . <p> Double clutch gear shifts comes into its own really when down shifting . <p> Some may blip the throttle with their heel while braking with their toe to achieve this , particularly down changing on a track coming into a corner . <p> Try this with a standard single clutch gear change first matching the engine speed with the new gear speed with the clutch depressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double de clutch moving the gearbox into neutral . <p> When cornering at high speed a rough gear change upsets the balance of the car so a double clutch avoids this . <p> TorqueCars were told of one site which recommended practicing the double clutch gear change in a stationary car with the engine switched off which kind of defeats the whole object of matching the engine speed with the next selected gear speed . <p> When perfected , this method takes as much time as a conventional gear change but maintains very smooth and progressive power delivery essential on track days or even in icy or slippery conditions . Other gear change techniques including keeping the throttle fully down during the gear change ( power change ) to keep the turbo spooling and power up . <p> Finally the method most drivers use , is depressing the clutch , changing gear and using the cars synchromesh to match the engine speed to gear speed .

It will reduce wear in the gearbox and transmission and keeps things smooth . <p> Why do it - its much smoother - when cornering at 100mph+ on a track a typical rough gear change could upset the balance of a car . It keeps the engine revs up on down changes , so on a tight bend you do not lose traction or power and the engine is already pulling in the next gear through the apex of the bend . <p> On a drag strip where you just want to get the car to the top speed then the power change has a place but you still risk wheel spin and loss of traction with this brutal method . <p> We 're really interested in the overall debate as to whether this method still has value today in the modern car .

In most countries you will need to hire/use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Preparation is 65% of the job , painting is 25% and flatting/polishing is 10% . Ensure that the area you paint in is completely dust free . It also helps if you are respraying your car on a warm day or have access to a low bake oven . <p> If you are after a flip paint or special effect you must ensure that you buy the right paint ! One of our members provided a paint guide when he re-sprayed his Megane at home with matt silk paint . <p> A professional respray can only be achieved by a professional sprayer in a filtered booth with good quality spray tools . But a patient DIY'er can still do a good job with a tin of spray paint . <p> Paints all behave in very different ways and come in the following main types base or acrylic , and then there are all sorts of effects and finishes to choose from such as metallic , pearlescent , translucent and chrome . The techniques for application of these paints are not the same . We are assuming a standard base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not healthy to breathe in . A decorators dust mask will not protect you . You need good filtration to take out paint particles and you need to ensure that the area you are painting in has a good supply of fresh air and is well ventilated . <p> Equipment . Spray paint cans will never give a professional finish and are actually extremely expensive when compared with the cost of hiring a good quality spray gun and the paint . Check how much area the tin of paint covers to see what I mean and remember that you want to be doing 5-9 thin mist coats of paint . This could take 16-20 tins of spray paint easily . <p> Step 1 : Preparation . Wash down the area to be painted thoroughly . Ensure that all sanding and filling has been done before you get to this stage . <p> The slightest bump or uneven surface will really stand out when the car is sprayed . So take time and view the panel from different angles to ensure that there are no flaws that remain . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show any imperfections that you may have missed . You can also test for imperfections by rubbing your hand over the area , it needs to be glass smooth for a decent finish ( you 'll then need to key the surface with a fine grit wet and dry paper if there is a shine ) . <p> If you have not stripped off the old paint with a good paint remover and sanded the metal and prepared it with a rust inhibitor you need to ensure that all grit , dust and road film is removed by using a good quality car cleaning fluid WITHOUT a wax additive and that the paint surface is lightly sanded to allow good adhesion from the new paint . Washing up liquid does a good job as this strips most of the wax , oil and bug residue from the car . <p> Step 2 : Clinical cleansing . Using a paper towel or preferably a screen wipe and solvent cleaner such as IPA or similar spirit wipe over and buff off the surface to a smear free finish . Any oils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flakes . <p> Step 3 : Masking . Any exposed area of the car is going to get painted - if you are just a few mm out with the masking you will have really annoying over-spray lines . <p> Masking is even more important if you are changing the colour of the car , and you should pay attention to all of the seams i.e. open the doors , bonnet etc. and take out the glass ( when the windscreen goes and is replaced you do not want a small patch of the old paint showing through . ) <p> In a perfect world the car will just be a shell with all plastic and interior removed . The more plastic you can remove from the car the better and if you can remove the glass as well you will make the job easier and not have to touch up the edges when glass is replaced later as the seals rarely sit exactly where they were . <p> Step 4 : Spraying . Ensure that you have a good flow of paint so test on a scrap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splatters . Do not aim to completely cover the metal just spray a fine mist over the surface - a load of thin coats of paint is much better than a couple of thick coats . <p> Keep the spray gun moving at a regular pace from left to right on the first coat then up and down on the next coat . Try to view the car as a whole rather than just painting a panel at a time ( if you are respraying just one panel you need to blend the paint in to the surrounding panels as most if not all paints fade over time . ) <p> Ideally leave at least 1 hour between coats of paint . For many paints you need to finish with a final lacquer coat . The final lacquer coat will be the last you apply and even this can be applied in a couple of thin layers . <p> Step 5 : Leave the lacquer to ' go off ' before waxing ideally for 2-3 days . Finish off with a fine grit of wet and dry paper then polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality wax - this protects the car when you are refitting the parts you stripped off it . If you want a matt ( non reflective finish ) ignore step 5 . <p> If lacquer peeling/chipped , it has to be buffed until smooth edges of old lacquer . Use a course grit to start with and Finish with 600 grit . You will then need to apply new basecoat to repair , overlapping onto existing , then lacquer over all . It does depend whether just a couple small bits or is the whole car peeling ? but No , you do not need to rub back to bare metal . <p> Hi I am attempting my first respray , its an old morris minor , I have rubbed down the paintwork , and come up against rust , can someone help me with the following please ?

@@24423356 @4423356/ <h> Remapped engines - ECU remaps <p> Back in the good old days , the task of timing the ignition spark was performed by the mechanical distributor . The greater the RPM , the more the timing would advance . <p> It was clunky and mechanical but seemed to work reasonably well . <p> This did a sufficiently good job , but for the most effective power you would need to vary the timing to a greater degree than a fixed ratio advance curve . The electronic ignition system was born giving much finer control over fuel delivery and spark timing . You ended up with a perfect spark timing only in a limited RPM band . <p> A complete map of variables was entered into the ignition program and the preset timing would be read from a table . <p> Now air temperature , engine speed , engine load and even control over turbo/wastegate control &amp; fuel delivery rates means that precise management of the engine ignition timing is possible and you can achieve the maximum power output throughout the rev range . <h> So what does ECU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine tune economy at popular road speeds such as 30mph , 56mph and 70mph where most cars spend a large proportion of their time . ( Some manufacturers in the 2016 cheat software scandal have even created code to detect test conditions and run super lean to pass emissions limits . ) <p> It is now possible to advance the timing if the throttle is wide open to give greater power or back off the timing when cruising at constant speed for improved economy . <p> When a manufacturer creates a timing map they build into it a big margin of error to cope with : adverse temperature ranges , minor faults &amp; bad conditions . In some countries emissions targets vary as measured by CO2 , HC , NOx and these usually require a fudging of the one setup for all approach . <p> Manufacturers do not want people breaking down , suffering premature parts failure or to get a reputation for uneconomical cars so they build in a wide margin of tolerance . Different countries use different grades of fuel and have varying degrees of extreme weather conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done to keep all the cars working well across the globe . <p> Each car that leaves the production line is also unique , some achieve 20bhp less and others can be 20bhp up on standard specs , depending on how well the components are machined and put together . So rather than put each car through a unique assessment and get a bespoke timing map , they adopt a standard one map fits all philosophy . <p> It is also a fact that manufacturers use the remap to produce different power versions of the same engine and get lower insurance cover ratings and better fuel consumption . You start to see the fantastic scope for improvement , when you add into the mix the fact that the average TorqueCars reader will be adding better performing components to the car , you have a really strong case for a remap . <p> Other things that the manufacturer builds in to their map equation is the possibility of user neglect i.e. infrequent servicing with items struggling like dirty plugs , bad leads , clogged air filter , partially blocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should remap ? <p> Anyone who has added performance parts to their engine should consider a remap . If your car is a turbo model &amp; has electronically controlled fuel injection , there are massive power gains on offer and TorqueCars would strongly recommend a remap . <p> What are the hidden costs or drawbacks ? You will need to be prepared to keep the car serviced more frequently , and , sometimes decreasing the service interval by half . When you fill up you are also restricting yourself to high quality fuel and even high octane fuel if this was what the map was optimized for , and you must be prepared to replace components that fail due to the extra work they are doing . <p> When an engine is tuned to produce more power , you are also creating more stress and strain , so things will start to fail such as air flow sensors . Any weak spots in an engine usually show up a couple of months after a remap has been done . Generally the turbo/clutch weaknesses will manifest themselves clearly at this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like pistons and bearings will need care and attention and you will find that the clutch lasts a shorter time . <p> If you do not have a turbo there 's very little to be gained by a remap alone - perhaps only a few BHP so TorqueCars ' recommendation for non turbo cars is to modify everything else first ( cams , pistons , increase compression , engine balance , air intake , exhaust , head work , bigger valves etc ... ) after these things have been done you can then consider a remap which will help you get the full benefit from them . <p> On the subject of turbos , ( briefly though as we have a comprehensive article on turbos in the forced induction section ) , a remap will often introduce boost from lower down the rev range and because of this the turbo is running faster and hotter . In this situation you must let the turbo cool down a little before shutting off the engine , otherwise the oil will degrade and you will have an expensive turbo repair on your hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem and keeps the engine ticking over . <p> Of course the amount of power you choose has a bearing on the reliability and cost of running the car . Many people go for an off the shelf remap which are on offer all over the country and typically cost around 200-500 . <p> This is better than the manufacturers map in that it uses tighter parameters but it is still a one size fits all job . If you are after big power gains and have changed major components like the turbo , waste gate and have done extensive engine work then a custom remap is the best option . <h> Switchable remaps . <p> Things have moved on and it is now possible to have a few maps stored which you can select from . It is typical to have a valet mode to stop the boy racers at the garage thrashing your pride and joy on the " test run " to bed in the new wiper blades they have fitted . Then there is often an economy option to give very frugal fuel consumption , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the ' sport ' or ' power ' modes which give lots of power and often require high octane fuel . TorqueCars strongly recommend that you get a switchable remap - it may cost a little more at the outset but you will avoid many of the pitfalls of running a high power remap all of the time by doing this and get the best of both worlds . <p> Some maps use the cruise control to choose a map , other companies offer handheld flash devices which allow you to choose a range of maps and upload these . It typically takes about 3 minutes to flash a car through the OBD port so is not an on the fly option . <p> Most people will run an economy map through the weekly commute and then go for a performance map at the weekend or a race map for track days . <p> Please do not confuse a remap with the little " tuning boxes " you can buy for 50 which generally contain little more than a 3 resistor and often do little more than fool the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it was really this easy to get more power from a car then the manufacturers would have already done that themselves . <p> Some cars are not easy to remap , I remember that the Rover MEMS &amp; Toyota ECU 's are a case in point . The Manufacturer holds the key to the ECU and locks their Map into their firmware . Some ECU 's are simply not reprogrammable . So what can you do ? Is there an option ? Well thankfully there is and they are called piggy back ECU 's or aftermarket ECU 's . <h> Piggy back &amp; Aftermarket ECUs : <p> Piggy back ECUs connect between your existing ECU and the engine sensor inputs and outputs . All work slightly differently and apply some or all of the following combinations . <p> Some will adjust the sensor readings such as air temp , engine speed , crank position and effectively lie to the standard ECU forcing a more aggressive timing . Some will actually perform their own calculations and take over control of some aspects of engine management like turbo waste gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ECU output and modify the signals sent to change timing and learn to guess the next output a split second before it is needed using the base ECU map and just enhancing it a little . <p> Tuning boxes are relatively new and these alter readings going to and from the ECU giving extra power or economy . <p> Aftermarket ECUs are often direct replacements for the car 's ECU and will take over all the functions associated with it . They are generally faster and able to cope with a wide variety of additional factors such as water/methanol injection and a turbo timer . <p> Be wary though , as some piggy back ECUs and aftermarket ECUs do not include knock protection . If this is the case then set your timing conservatively and use high octane fuel . <p> As with all ECU upgrades you are still dependant on having the car in top condition as you are removing the tolerances built in for dirty plugs , cheap fuel , or minor electrical faults .

@@24423357 @4423357/ <h> Using Vernier pulleys <p> How to adjust the cam timing easily with vernier pulleys and setting them up . <p> It is essential to ensure that you line up the cam pulleys correctly with the cambelt . On standard cams and engines there is little need for adjustment or fine tuning . <p> A vernier pulley has a set of bolts around it that allow you to turn the pulley slightly so it is in line with a fraction of a tooth on the belt . <p> Why would you want to do this ? Very small adjustments in the cam timing can alter the power band in your engine quite dramatically . <p> With the fine tuning on offer from vernier pulleys the power band can be raised , lowered and depending on where you move it to it may also have widened or shortened . <p> Your fast road cam may be introducing an annoying flat spot or raising the power band too high . A vernier pulley allows fine control over cam timing . ( Duration is still controlled by the cam profile . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow you to see the fine adjustment you are making . Generally each 1mm mark you move the pulley you change the cam timing by 2 degrees . <p> You are only controlling the time the inlet and exhaust ports open and close by doing this . Ignition timing is down to the ECU and the cam profile sets the duration of lift . <p> This varies from engine to engine , pulley size and other factors so we ca n't make a rule of thumb here . <p> With the cams removed from the head you 'll need the TDC position . <p> To start determine the TDC position of the engine with a piston top center tool . You 'll also need a degree wheel bolted to the crank and a pointer to read the degree wheel . <p> Rotate the crank until it stops on the Piston Top Center Tool . Note the marker position . <p> Reverse the crank again until you hit a dead stop and note the marker position . <p> Fit the cam and lock this in the TDC position but leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the gap , which is usually the zero degree point ! <p> Fit and tension the belt and recheck the crank and cam are both at TDC , if they are then you can tighten the vernier bolts . <p> Rotate the engine a couple of times and stop at the TDC mark ( reading off the degree wheel on the crank ) . Hopefully the cams are still at TDC . <p> Now you can start to make those tiny adjustments on the vernier pulley . Loosen off the bolts and turn it in your chosen direction just 0.5 to 1 mm at a time . <p> NB : If you turn the pulley clockwise you will Retard the cam timing which you would do to improve top end power . Alternatively turn it anti clockwise to Advance the cam timing and moves the power band down the rev range . <p> Having spoken to many people it would seem that most people run upto 3 degrees difference . Again this depends on the cam profile chosen and engine type . Please avoid making large changes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting this wrong . Some engines are more forgiving than others . <p> Make a small adjustment , test it out thoroughly and use this as a baseline for further adjustment . <p> Vernier pulleys fine tune the power band which can be raised or lowered and may also have widened or shortened . <p> Getting the right settings is quite easy on a rolling road as adjustments can be done almost on the fly and a dyno reading will show where the power band is . <p> You 'll need to take into account your gear ratio 's and the cars natural power band . <p> For example in a high revving engine where there is a lot of top end power you wo n't see much gain advancing the timing to move the power band down . <p> Each type of engine has it 's particular sweet spot . <p> Sometimes an adjustment works well on a hot engine but will lead to cold start issues . Expect to make some additional fine tuning adjustments the following day . <p> Most modern performance engines have twin cams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This allows a much finer degree of control and power optimization .

@@24423358 @4423358/ <h> Remapping a diesel engine . <p> Our members frequently talk about their latest mods and power figures and we see trends and popular mods on Diesel engines . <p> Many of our members have remapped their diesel engines and boast of more power , better economy and unchanged reliability . <p> But do the claims live up to reality ? What sort of power figures can you get from a diesel remap ? Is it possible to get more power and better fuel economy ? <p> Diesels have really come so far in a very short time . Back in the 1980 's they were associated with being noisy , smelly and smoky . Now the Turbo diesel engine is a refined beast and offers massive amounts of torque . <p> We are seeing our members swayed away from petrol due to the huge amounts of torque on offer from a well tuned diesel engine . <p> As engine technology has improved , the diesel revolution has begun . As soon as manufacturers started adding turbos to their engines we started to see massive power figures . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legendary diesel fuel economy has remained or in many cases improves after a remap . <p> More BHP , oodles of Torque and better MPG . It almost seems to be too good to be true . <p> The average power gains from a remap on a diesel engine are in the order of 30% more power . The costs vary from provider to provider but you are looking at between 200 and 500 ( around us$400 ) . <p> How do remaps work ? The engine is controlled by computer . The computer determines how much fuel and air to push into the engine and controls the turbo and fueling to control this . Manufacturers need to make their cars reliable and meet the stringent emissions regulations . <p> It is fair to say that there is a great deal of variation from one engine to the next so a general compromise is made when the computer is programmed . This compromise allows the car to run smoothly if it has been neglected or has sub standard components through everyday wear and tear . <p> A remap will change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine . In its simplest form it will raise the " safety " limits and force more fuel/air into the engine and alter the turbo spool up rates to give the maximum power gains . <p> Many tuners will ramp up the fuel rail pressure earlier in the RPM range and inject the fuel slightly earlier but still keep peak pressure within the factory defined maximum limits giving a good mid range power boost and improving the pick up under acceleration . <p> Regarding fueling , they do also play with the injection timing , which is crucial on all diesel engines . All common rail systems use at least 2 injection phases , a pilot phase to get the fire going and a primary phase which provides the vast majority of the power . It 's the pilot phase which gets rid of the characteristic DI ( direct injection ) diesel rattle and knock . <p> CR ( common rail ) diesels do respond very well to remapping , I think many car makers have purposely detuned their diesel engines simply to leave some room in the market for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Century ( first 5-6 years , say ) diesel received loads of R&amp;D cash , whilst petrol engines barely evolved at all in that time . Things are back on a more even keel now and we 're seeing more and more DI petrol units and some very innovative turbocharging technologies being applied . <p> What are the drawbacks of remapping your diesel engine ? Generally there are no drawbacks if your car is in good condition . <p> We would advise shorter service intervals and it is fair to say that any weak parts will generally fail sooner . There have been reports of clutches failing due to the extra torque but in fairness these are usually old worn clutches anyway . <p> So what are the benefits ? You will get more Torque and the engine will rev more freely although still not as high as its petrol counterpart . As the ignition timing is advanced you will usually get a more efficient burn and this will mean more economy although most remapped diesel driver will use the extra power on offer and have a heavy right foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , you can only remap the later diesel engines . From around 2001 the computer interfaces were standardized and allow the uploading of a remap through the diagnostic port . Some remaps are available in the form of a replacement chip and there are various piggy back devices and tuning boxes offered where a true remap is not possible . <p> Some manufacturers produced locked ECU 's to prevent mapping but these can usually be bench flashed , or chipped and after a while most tuning companies find a way to unlock these ECU 's and flash them via the OBD port . <p> It is not worth remapping a naturally aspirated ( non turbo ) diesel engine . The power gains are not worth the expense . However if you are driving a turbo diesel that accepts a remap then you will probably see power gains of 30% or more . <p> There are two types of remap open to you . <p> The first is an off the shelf remap . These will be a best compromise , much like the one the manufacturer offers but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the custom remap . This is where a map is devised and tailor made to suit your car . <p> The car will usually be mapped on a rolling road or taken for a series of test drives with a data logger running so the optimum settings can be reached . A custom remap will also take into account any other modifications you have done such as fueling increases , sports air filters and the uprating of the intercooler . A professional remap specialist will be able to offer a map to your specification . For example some drivers ask for better economy under 3000 rpm and want the power band between 3 and 4000rpm . <p> TorqueCars recommend a full custom remap , especially if you have done any other modifications . The off the shelf remap is the best option if your car has a high mileage or you have not done any other modifications . Many modern engines will adjust or trim their settings to account for poor quality fuel or your driving style . <p> Make sure your brakes are in good condition and that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slip then it may be time to consider a slightly better quality clutch . <p> Always notify your insurers if you get your car remapped otherwise you may find yourself without cover in the event of an accident .

Expect a power increase of around 20-30% from a remap and around 10% better fuel economy under careful driving conditions . <p> Research your mapping company well , there are lots of small operators out there who do not fully understand the complexities of each engine leaving you with flat spots , and running problems under certain conditions . <p> Peak power claims should really be ignored , you want a nice wide torque band and zero wheelspin at certain points of the ECU . <p> Induction kits and exhausts should theoretically offer a slight increase in power as you still require an efficient delivery of lots of cold air and a way to expel them as efficiently as possible . <p> In reality though OEM air flow is designed to more than adequately cope with the cars requirements with some spare capacity . But adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may require that you revisit this and upgrade . <p> The bore size of Diesel exhausts are typically much larger than a similar powered petrol car especially on Turbo Diesel models so gains from larger exhausts are minimal . But removing the particulate filter usually gives a good boost in power ( but this is now outlawed in many annual inspection tests around the world ) . <p> Initially I would recommend just adding a good quality ( washable ) high flow panel air filter to the standard air box . <p> As for internal mods for sophisticated diesel engines , typically the rewards obey the law of diminishing returns . With forced induction there 's only so far you can go with cam/valve lift and air ( gas ) flow . Especially with a diesel engine , given the limited rev range there 's not that much reward from tuning a head in the traditional way . Diesel burns very slowly ( hence the 4000rpm peak BHP most achieve , even if they will spin to over 5000rpm ) . <p> Getting the flame front inside the combustion chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real option , and this is to some degree achieved by allow small amount of fuel to be injected during the expansion phase of the engine 's cycle.Too much of this and you get smoke and soot , and burn a load of fuel . <p> Increasing the BMEP ( brake mean effective pressure ) by means such as increased boost can assist . This , too , is a double edged sword as the biggest fraction of the atmosphere is nitrogen , which , although good for cooling , is still incombustible . <p> That 's where nitrous comes in , in the same way it does in a petrol powered vehicle . The gains achieved in this way can be absolutely silly , but given the cost and legal position with regard to road usage it 's a bit of a white elephant . <p> Increasing the cetane rating of diesel fuel is quite effective in increasing the release of ' free ' power . With a diesel engine , the key is getting the fuel to burn more rapidly , as opposed to a petrol engine where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more slowly and resist pre-ignition better than low octane fuels . Pre warming the fuel and direct injection into the combustion chamber all help to improve the speed and efficiency of combustion . <p> Good results can be obtained with cetane improvers . Sadly , these can prove expensive and should not be used in engines that are Euro Iv ( 2004 ) compliant . Strangely , the 2.2HDi 2001 model is 2004 compliant . The particle filter ( a whole subject in itself ) can become blocked or excessively obstructed by use of such products . <p> Weight reduction is very very sensible . Not only does less weight mean better performance for free , it also puts less load on tires , which allows braking and handling to be optimized . It also reduces the load on the environment as less fuel is required , thereby the release of exhaust gases is reduced . <p> Downsides of Diesels:Engine mass/weight is a standard problem with diesel cars ( especially FWD ones ) . That heavy engine can upset the handling balance of a car . Diesel units are heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torque figures . As such , the bearings are larger in diameter , the gearboxes belong in lorries and tractors even if the change quality is good . <p> Clutches are getting on for 12 " diameter and require fluid operation and servo assistance to make the things pleasant to drive , often a standard clutch will suffer from slip when a remap yields a massive torque figure so you may need to uprate the clutch . <p> We now have a dedicated diesel forum where you will meet our resident diesel enthusiasts and discuss tuning options for your car . <p> This entry was <h> Feedback 38237 @qwx238237 <p> There is very little restriction in the standard 407 exhaust even at 220bhp so there is little to be gained by fitting one .

So the whole turbo system would be under pressure and cause either split pipes or cause damage to the turbo itself as air tries to rush backwards through the turbo . <p> This makes a clattering noise known as compressor surge , sometimes causing the turbine to spin in reverse and this is a massive strain on the bearings . <p> A release valve is needed and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster response . <p> Nearly all turbo cars are fitted with some kind of simple relief valve to avoid these problems . The standard valve usually releases the pressure into the intake before the turbo which is not pressurized and if the throttle is reapplied the partially pressurized air is efficiently sucked back in . <p> The BOV or blow off valve also referred to as a dump valve or vent valve quite simply vents the excess pressure into the atmosphere with a pfsssst sound , a whistle , a clatter or similar noise . <p> A wide variety of BOV types are available from leading car part suppliers , ask around in our forum to see which ones perform the best on your particular vehicle . <p> Some ECU 's in a closed loop engine system fitted with a mass air flow sensor are confused by this sudden missing pressure which has vanished and the engine can briefly run rich causing hesitancy , juddering or stalling .

@@24423367 @4423367/ 38227 @qwx238227 <h> Dry Sump <p> Proper lubrication of the engine is the single most essential ingredient to an internal combustion engine - without it everything would seize up completely . <p> It is a factor that is essential in the high performance tuning and racing worlds . Tuners are looking for engines that provide more horsepower and constantly pushing the engineering boundaries and require efficient lubrication . <p> Keeping a good flow of cool oil is an essential if you want to maintain reliability and maximize your power output . <p> What Is a Dry Sump ? <p> A conventional sump is a reservoir at the bottom of the engine from where oil is pumped around the engine . The dry sump relocates this reservoir and offers more efficient lubrication . <p> The dry sump engine uses a set of additional pumps , and an extra tank is provided for holding the oil . <p> The oil is cooled deaereated and stored in the reservoir where it can be pumped around the engine as required . <p> You can also implement a dry sump by using a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling and pushing the oil in and out of the engine . In a dry sump engine , a pressure relief valve is required to regulate the negative pressure inside the engine , thereby making sure that the seals will not get inverted . <p> The engine gets cooled and lubricated by oil circulating inside all its components , feeding bearings and all the other moving parts , before getting drained by gravity to the sump at the engine base . <p> Dry sumps offer many advantages and are viewed as essential mods in some motorsport fields . <p> In all dry sump installations , you will find that the dry sumps are intended mount to mount pressure on the pump which is at the same level as the common shaft . This means that the pulley in the combustion engine system is capable of running several pumps at the same time . <p> Standard practice allows a single scavenge pump for each crankcase section . For V-type engines , an additional scavenge pump is required so as to remove the oil that has been fed into the gear valve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a minimum of four scavenge pumps , and a pressure pump situated in the pump stack . <h> Dry Sump Benefits <p> A dry sump offers many advantages including : <p> Increased Oil Capacity ( potentially but depending on system design ) the additional reservoir helps increase the amount of oil available at any one given moment . <p> A dry sump makes it possible for you to mount your engine at a much lower level , thanks to the low profile of the pump , which in turn helps lower the center of gravity . <p> It is possible to move the external reservoir to another part of the car thus improving the overall weight distribution of the car and increasing the oil capacity through the use of a large external tank . <p> The dry sump design is not susceptible to oil movement problems that emanate from the high cornering forces ( causing the oil pump to run dry where oil would run away from the pickup in a wet sump ) . <p> Scavenge pumps are mounted with their intake at the lowest point in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravity it will naturally flow into the pump intake ( rather than having to be sucked up ) which avoids any risk of cavitation . <p> Replacement and maintenance of the pumps is easy given that they are all mounted external to the engine . <p> Additional cooling of the oil as it is stored away from the hot engine . <p> The crank and bottom end components are not splashing through oil . <p> Even though the dry sump comes with many advantages , there are a few dry sump problems that can be expected as well . <h> Disadvantages of a Dry Sump <p> These are some of the problems associated with the dry sump . <p> It costs a lot of money for you to install and run in your car <p> Drive Belt this refers to both positioning and the kind of impact that it has on the other belts . The dry sump should have a dedicated belt , which is fine with RWD installations , but can be problematic with FWD installations due to lack of space at the crank . <p> The pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be difficult in some car configurations as the low positions are occupied by the driveshaft and the alternator or other engine parts , which means that you may need to move them higher or relocate them . <p> The reservoir tank takes up valuable engine bay space . <p> The oil lines and pump itself will require maintenance . <h> Why Convert to a Dry Sump <p> Even though the dry sump has a few sets of problems , it is still the best performance option compared to the conventional wet sump . <p> The primary advantage of a dry sump is the fact that it can create more power by generating extra crankcase vacuum with a dry sump pump . It improves the ring seal and keeps the rotating assembly free of any wind , thus allowing it to spin freely . <p> The dry sump also comes with increased capacity and remote coolers in addition to consistent and adjustable oil pressure . <p> The fact that there is no oil in the pan allows it to be shallow , improving weight handling and distribution . <p> NB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil will drain into the crankcase overnight .

Drawbacks it takes effort to get the wheel rotating and stops the engines revs increasing or slowing down quickly . A lighter wheel takes strain off the engine and allows the engine to rev more freely , as a bonus as there is less weight the engine is able to release more power . <p> You 'll notice a race-tuned engine increases and decreases revs a lot more quickly than a standard engine . The big downside to a lighter flywheel is that engine momentum or inertial spin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter the flywheel the faster engine revs will rise and fall but you will lose momentum on a hill more quickly . <p> Whereas the momentum in the engine is maintained with a heavy flywheel the momentum is reduced and the hill has a much more direct effect on the engine output .

Yes it is something that can be picked up from trial and error , more error than trial . YES diesel can and will detonate like a petrol engine and just as quickly self destruct . <p> The mapping process ideally will be studying 3D maps understanding what they mean and how to read load points . You may not have ignition timing but you have injector timing . Get that wrong and kiss your engine goodby . Too much fuel and you will have a melt down with big holes in pistons . <p> I have seen many tweeks from " re-mappers " that rely on increasing the fuel pressure to increase power . Not highly recommended . That will increase fuel from idle to full load . Alter injector pulse width were required is the better way to go .

You will gain more from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . <p> A diesel engine will benefit from the same mods that you would perform on petrol engine ie exhaust , cold air , porting and cams then remap and see the difference . Another thing to be aware of when you have a vehicle dyno tuned , some of the less reputable operators can fudge figures to make it look like they have gained more power than they actually did . <p> This can be done by altering the inputs to the program like humidity and ambient temps . That will alter the readings . When I ran my own dyno centre I made sure all the information was printed on the sheets so you could compare apples with apples . <p> To attempt that whole DIY remapping thing , well , the thought would not even enter my head . So many things could go wrong , plus the natural failsafe/warnings that the ECU would normally give you may no longer happen . So expect a bang without the opportunity to prevent it first . I do however admire the OP for even asking the question

@@24423376 @4423376/ <h> Rebores increase the engine displacement <p> " Boreing stuff " <p> You can increase the power of an engine by increasing its capacity . This is a fairly involved process and requires a good deal of research and preparation . Unless you want to have to retrace your steps and go a different route midway in to the job . <p> Some of TorqueCars.com members have had their engines rebored , and this does seem a good way to increase power . However there are a few things we should take into account . <p> The cylinders are the main part of any engine and is where compression and combustion takes place . A 1 litre engine has a cylinder capacity equal in volume to 1 litre ( 0.25 liters per cylinder in a 4 cylinder engine - this is filled with fuel and air ) . The mixture is then compressed ready for ignition and combustion within the cylinder . <p> The ratio of compression is another key element in an engine and if it is too high you can create engine knock also known as detonation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cylinder capacity of an engine . <p> Increase the cylinder capacity &amp; Power output of your engine with a re-bore . <p> A cylinder comprises usually a cast iron block but in some engines constructed of aluminium there is a steel liner fitted such as those pioneered by Alfa Romeo . <p> In this article we are talking primarily of cast iron blocks as these have more scope for cylinder capacity increasing . Essentially the more you start with the bigger the power gain will be . <p> If you have an aluminium block you may be able to fit a slightly thinner liner and your only other option would be a stroker kit which is something torquecars will cover in a future article in more detail . <p> Drilling out the cast iron block to a wider dimension will increase the cylinder capacity . Obviously with a larger diameter cylinder you will need to match this to a larger diameter piston . <p> While this sounds like a simple job you must drill out maintaining concentricity ensuring they are machined parallel to the crank centre line and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross hatch pattern into the cylinder wall to assist with bedding in the piston rings and maintaining a good compression ratio . <p> Do not attempt to do a rebore yourself with a mill as you will not get a good enough finish - it will create chatter marks whereas a proper jig borer will be accurate to within a thousandth and then finished with a precise honing . <p> Blocks are often similar 1600,1800 and even 2000 engines have the same block but the internal cylinder dimension is different . In the case of these engines a rebore to a larger size and the fitting of pistons from the larger sized engine will effectively increase the engine cylinder capacity . <p> In some rare cases the only difference between the larger sized engine is the shape , size and profile of the pistons . <p> After the cylinder rebore get the chamber volume measurements and machine the heads to balance these as well removing any material necessary to get the Compression Ratio right . Do n't be surprised if you ca n't get pistons to match your chosen rebore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A proper machine shop will tell you what cylinder dimensions work best with which piston and they will also take stress tests to determine the maximum amount or reboring that the block can handle . <p> The other way of increasing the engine size is by using a stroker kit . The crank in a stroker kit allows a much longer stroke in the engine thereby increasing the cylinder capacity . ( A lower compression piston will also increase the combustion chamber at TDC , but needs other modification for there to be a power gain . ) Common kits increase the 2.0 Subaru or skyline engine to 2.5 litres . Combining a stroker kit with a rebore will maximise the power increase available if done properly . <p> FYI : The cc'c of the motor are governed by bore x stroke x # of cylinders <p> If your engine suffers from a scored cylinder and is suffering from low compression you may look at reboring the engine and while you are at it you may just as well bore it out to a greater capacity and fit new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down an engine always replace the cylinder head bolts and rod bolts . There is no need to replace the main bearing cap bolts with new ones . It is also worth replacing the core plugs ( which pop out when the engine freezes ) . <p> When you have the engine out of the car you should take the opportunity to replace these with new parts . ( When engines are left without coolant and engine oil for more than a few days corrosion can be a real problem ) . <p> Even when buying an engine from a scrap yard or doing an engine swap TorqueCars would recommend stripping it down first , replacing worn parts , and rebuilding it to save problems later on . <p> At least replace the core plugs , the head gasket and cylinder head bolts and while these are off you get an opportunity to inspect the engine for damage and can decide in advance whether a rebore , re machined crank and new pistons would be cost effective - for the extra cost involved you will save yourself a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With a stripped down engine you have a fantastic opportunity for tuning and can save a small fortune if you get all of the engine modifications done at the same time so look into engine balancing , fitting larger valves , gas flowed machined head , crank lightening and even a lighter flywheel and clutch as most of these will involve a great deal of man hours stripping and rebuilding the engine again . <p> Run in the engine afterwards with low rev &amp; high stress driving such as hills and acceleration , changing the oil and filter after 200 miles and then after 500 miles and 3000 miles to get rid of the metal fragments that will collect in the oil and prematurely wear the engine .

@@24423377 @4423377/ <h> Care of your air conditioning system <p> We all take air conditioning for granted but this is a fairly complex system . <p> The compressor will compress the gas then as this gas is pumped into the heat exchanger matrix and is allowed to expand it will take heat from the air running though the matrix . <p> The gas though will often escape , albeit gradually over time , so you should have your air conditioning system checked and re-gassed at regular intervals . <p> A typical air conditioning service will involve replacement of the pollen filters and a re-gas . Old gas needs to be disposed of in accordance with regulations so this is certainly a job for a specialist . <p> There are two main types : air conditioning and climate control . The first filters and cools the air at a fixed amount in a similar way to a hairdryer heats the air at a set temperature , the other filters and cools the air sufficiently to maintain a preset temperature . Climate control is therefore far more advanced and this will take into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimum amount of cooling to apply at any set time . <p> Look after your cars air conditioning service and it will take care of you . <p> The best way of killing your air conditioning compressor is by not using it . Even in winter TorqueCars recommend that you should periodically turn on your air conditioning and this will keep it ticking over and in tip top condition . In winter the air conditioning will take the moisture out of the air in the car and clear windows faster and stop them from misting up . <p> A common mistake of air conditioning users in summer is to turn the temperature setting right down on their climate control system . This will require a great deal of effort to cool the air and when you finally get out of the car and step into the warm air you will notice the heat a great deal more and this can often be a very uncomfortable experience . TorqueCars recommend that you set the air conditioning climate control to only be 1 or 2 degrees cooler than the outside air as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power out of the engine , will help the air conditioning system to last longer and will not make you feel like you are stepping into an oven when you get out of your car . <p> Round town at speeds of up to 30 mph you should rely on open windows to cool the car and when you increase speed above this use the air conditioning instead . Turning the car air conditioning into recirculate mode will also reduce the load on the engine and maintain a comfortable temperature . <p> If you notice a smell when your air conditioning turns on or after you have turned it off it may well indicate the presence of bacteria in the filters and you should get it serviced immediately , particularly if you suffer from a respiratory problem . When your air conditioning is struggling to cool the air in the car during summertime you should also get the gas checked as it may have degraded or pressure may have been lost . <p> Be warned : - a man got frost bite from having his air conditioning turned down too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot wells and had to get his toe amputated ! 38242 @qwx238242 38233 @qwx238233 <h> Feedback 38237 @qwx238237 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234 
@@24423378 @4423378/ <h> What is the difference between stage 1 , 2 and 3 tuning ? <p> " The tuning world often refers to stages " <p> You will often hear tuning companies and car tuners going on about stage 1 , 2 and 3 mods . What are these different stages and what do they mean ? <p> We hate to shatter the illusion but they are , in the main , fairly meaningless terms if applied to power gains and can not reliably be used to explain how much power a modification adds . There is no consistent difference in part makers between their classifications of stage 1 stage 2 and stage 3 mods . <p> There are however some points that one should bear in mind that differentiate between a " typical " mod in each stage . <p> De-mystifying the Stage 1,2 and 3 tuning mods . The tuning industry use these terms but what do they mean and what can you expect from each of them ? <h> Stage 1 modifications . <p> A stage 1 modification can be added in isolation . This means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other engine modifications to get it to work . Whilst other mods can help to raise the power gains and realize the full potential of the mod they are not mandatory . These are at the bottom end of the tuning scene in terms of the overall benefits you will get . <p> Stage 1 mods are generally a straightforward DIY fit and should work on a standard engine that is in good condition . <h> Stage 2 modifications <p> These stage 2 mods offer larger power gains than stage one but will usually require additional work or other parts if you want them to work reliably . Some of the examples listed in stage 1 can also be regarded as stage 2 mods if they are extreme in their ambition . <p> A stage 2 mod is usually a DIY fit but many will require specialist knowledge and tools . Addition of a larger or hybrid turbo ( requires a remap and fueling upgrades as well as potential engine strengthening ) , fast road cams ( need some engine dismantling and will need to be fitted with followers/lifters etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Supercharger kits ( these need air intake , exhaust and mapping modifications before they can work at all . ) <h> Stage 3 modifications <p> A stage 3 modification is regarded by most as a track day modification . Like stage 2 mods they will also need other mods to support them but they are usually far from ideal for road use as we will explain . <p> Take racing brakes for example . These can tolerate extremely high temperatures but they are pretty useless whilst cool . On the road you ca n't afford to have to wait for the brakes to warm up before they operate effectively . On the track they will run hot through each lap . An aggressive cam profile will also move the power band right up the rev range and cause a very lumpy tick over making the car hard to drive in day to day traffic . Heavy duty clutches can be off or on in their nature and make driving in slow traffic nearly impossible . <p> A stage 3 race modified car will also need to be regularly overhauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine will result in premature engine wear and if a car is used on a daily basis it will become very unreliable . <p> So to summarize stage 3 mods are the most aggressive and not the sort of thing you want to do on a road car . You will also need to bear in mind that some tuning companies will just box their parts in packs labeled stage 1,2 and 3 and maybe even 4 or 5 . <p> Such labeling is as helpful as a product number and should not be taken as any sort of guarantee of the power gains or suitability for your car . 38243 @qwx238243 38233 @qwx238233 <h> Feedback 38237 @qwx238237 <p> Very interesting .

Actual date is very difficult , if not impossible , to get from tyre manufacturers . <p> In order to achieve a 10 second 1/4 mile run ( as stated in the thread title ) you will need around 750bhp and 650ft/lbs ( 10.98 at 137mph ) in a car weighing this much . <p> I stress , before I get taken apart with real data , that this is very rough as too many variables are unknown .

" <p> Matt finishes seem to be making a comeback and we 've seen a few ways to achieve a matt finish from the application of film and vinyl wraps , to tins of spray paint . <p> Here is the DIY approach using tins of paint , one of our members fancied having a go and here is an opportunity to learn from his experience . <p> A TorqueCars member has taken his Megane , hired an industrial unit and spray painted his car . <p> When we asked him why , he told us that he was bored and wanted something to do . <p> Those who maintain that you can not get a professional finish from a can will find it hard to fault his effort , who it must be noted has never spray painted a car before in his life . <p> The finish is actually a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matt . <p> A silk finish is fairly flat but will reflect a little light . <p> A matt finish is similar but pretty much non reflective . <p> The overall method for a matt finish is the same as shown here for silk paint only you will buy a specific matt paint . <p> To achieve a matt or silk finish you need the right paint . Always use a good quality paint or you risk it flaking away . Good preparation is the key to a good finish . <p> Paint application works best on dry hot days and inside . Ensure that your work area is dust free as there is nothing more frustrating than a layer of dust embedded in your new paint . Sweep the area with water , including the walls . Then lay sheets of plastic , or paper over the floor and walls to help keep the dust out . ( You will also avoid painting your work area as well ! ) <p> Have a practise run first . A front wing is usually the best . If this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build the paint up in very fine layers . You will also need to avoid using the end of a tin as the last bit of paint is usually a bit globby and with the pressure drop in the tin you will suffer from splatters of paint . <p> Step 1 ) Preparing the car for paint . <p> Take your time and ensure that the surface to be painted is clean . You will need to remove the clear coat from the car , otherwise you will get a reflective finish and that is not what we are aiming at . <p> Using a 400 grit paper go over the entire car and remove the clear coat . Go over the car with white spirit to remove the dust and any grease ( the no 1 enemy of a car painter ! ) <p> Step 2 ) Remove bumpers/panels <p> For most cars the job will be easier if you remove the bumpers and panels . It will also help you to avoid over spray marks and seams which show the original colour through . <p> Removing the bonnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the seams around the side of the bonnet . The underside of the bonnet should also be sprayed and this will necessitate the removal of the sound deadening material . <p> The inside of the boot will also need to be painted to match . You might get away with this if you are not making a major colour change but left undone it can look rather unsightly . <p> Step3 ) Masking off the car . <p> Take your time here , and use a good thick covering of newspapers , the last thing you want is for the paint to seep through the paper . Using newspaper , plastic bags , cling film and a heavy duty tape cover over the inner wheel arches/wheels , the windows and any parts of the door handles/locks that are not to be colour coded . <p> Step 4 ) Spraying the car . <p> Moving the tin over the panel at a distance of about 6 inches spray a fine mist of paint over the panel . <p> Allow an hour or so for this to dry and then apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original paint colour is completely covered by the new paint . <p> ( Rather than wait an hour move on to a different panel or bumper , that way you will spray almost continually and not lose time waiting for the paint to dry . ) Be very fussy and sand a panel back and spray it again if you are not happy with the coverage . <p> Step 5 ) Finishing the car . <p> For a silk finish or matt finish go over the car with a fine grit of wet and dry . This will remove paint bobbles and specs that may have formed . You will not apply a clear coat and you must not under any circumstances wax the car . <p> Wash the car periodically with nothing other than a solution of washing up liquid . A matt or silk finish can be a challenge to keep clean as dirt will adhere more readily to it but it is certainly worth persevering with . <p> Notes from this Megane project owner , in total it took about 16 tins of paint to cover my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty nice even coverage so there was no need for a final sanding off . <p> To ask questions on this project or get some more paint tips join us in our friendly forum . 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

A cotton bud will also come in handy . <p> Firstly vacuum the inside of the car as this will remove the particles that are most likely to become airborne . The dash should be the last thing you clean . Many times I have dislodged dirt or dripped cleaner on the dash whilst cleaning the interior or windscreen and had to do the dash again . <p> Use the soft sponge after dampening it with the water . This will remove most of the dirt and grime from the surface of the dashboard . <p> The CD cleaner will contain IPA ( Isopropyl Alcohol ) and this mild solvent will remove stubborn stains without affecting the condition of the plastic .

They dipped as low as 145hp with some versions during the 1970 's . <p> Even now when U.S. aftermarket companies make claims , their dyno figures are anything up to 20% higher than Europe and most of the rest of the planet . One reason for this is when engine dyno tests are conducted the engines are run without any ancilliaries , no intake filter/system and usually with tubular exhaust manifolds ( headers ) and open collecters ( no mufflers ) . <p> Another reason is the most popular U.S. chassis dynos ( Dyno-Jet ) work on a different principle to measure torque compared to what most of us in the EU , and rest are used to , which are usually of the Eddie-current dynamometer type . <p> Only the Mustang Dynamometer ( trade name ) works on the Eddie-current system which is available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comparison .

For our take on the best cleaning products click here . <p> Even the hottest car on the street looks rough when it is dirty . Here are some top cleaning tips from www.torquecars.com members gathered from hundreds of Bucket &amp; Sponge sessions and with tips from showrooms and car exhibitors . <p> The following tips contain a quick ( going out with parents ) and showroom ( car needs to look perfect ) guide to cleaning your car . <p> TIP : Do n't clean the car on a hot sunny day - wait for the evening otherwise you will have smears all over the body work as the water dries . <p> The key here whilst cleaning is to avoid adding scratches to the paint work , make sure that anything that touches the paint work is free of grit and is rinsed thoroughly each time it is reapplied to the bodywork . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the car and work down to the grittiest parts last . Most light swirls and scratches in a cars paint work are caused by careless cleaning , typically where a cleaning cloth is used near the wheels and it picks up grit and then it is wiped over the paint work . <h> So to get that showroom shine follow these steps . <p> Step 1 : Rinse &amp; wet the car ( with standard tap water ) - DO NOT USE A SPONGE because it will pick up grit and you 'll be rubbing the grit around and it 'll act like sandpaper . A high pressure hose is best for this but a hose pipe with a strong jet will help . <p> Once you have removed the loose grit and the car is wet the rest of the dirt will start to loosen as the water gets into it . ( To allow time for the water to start dissolving the dirt it 's a good time to clean out the inside of the car . ) <p> Step 2 : inside of the car : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park stickers . Remove removable mats and vacuum them then move on to the rest of the interior with the Hoover . Wipe down the dashboard , console and all other plastic with a damp ( not wet ) cloth . ( for soiled areas use a mild detergent but wipe off thoroughly ) . <p> Avoid using products with Silicone in as they leave a greasy residue &amp; over spray onto the pedals can be lethal . Do not polish the dashboard because this can cause glare on sunny days . Carpet &amp; upholstery stains can be easily removed with CAR PLAN interior valet ( this is the only product I have found that could remove dark engine grease stains on a light grey interior . ) <p> Finally wipe over the sills , boot ( USA Trunk ) seams ( the internal bits you only see when the door is open with a damp sponge. ) - Read our dashboard cleaning article for more tips on this . <p> Step 3 : Back to the outside - the car should still be wet - hose over one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft fluffy wool mitt , and very gently wipe over the entire car the aim is to remove all grit particles . ( Do not scrub tar or mud deposits at this stage ) Start at the top of the car and work round it in circles like peeling an orange making the sills and bumpers the last thing you touch overall - these are generally the dirtiest and most gritty items . <p> Step 4 : Pre wash . Using a bucket of clean ( for perfection use filtered ) water and a car pre wash product - choose something that does not foam up or cause lots of bubbles . ( Autoglym car shampoo is very good and conditions the water to avoid streaks for that showroom finish . ) <p> Do n't use a shampoo with built in polish this would effectively seal the dirt and stains under a thin layer of wax and makes the cleaning job 100 times harder and makes the windows go hazy every time you use your wipers . <p> Like last time work in circles using the orange peel method . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only on areas of paint work hardened like the sills and lower front bumper . You want to avoid creating those wheel mark scratches caused mainly by bad cleaning methods or automatic car washes . <p> Step 6 : Wheels and tires - clean off with a brush first , then use a hard sponge or scrub pad . ( If your wheels have a special chrome or paint finish then the same rules apply as for paint work and you should use a lambswool wash mitt ) . <p> Do not use anything you 'll use to clean the wheels on your bodywork next time or it will be full of grit and scratch your paint work . Brake dust is hard to remove and you 'll usually require a chemical brake dust and alloy wheel cleaner . <p> These usually need brushing on leaving for a while then sponging off . As fairly nasty chemicals are used in most of these products wear gloves and avoid contact with your skin . ( Read more in our alloy wheel cleaning article . ) <p> Step 7 : Rinse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watering can filled with water ( again for perfection filtered ) is the easiest method of rinsing off the car . <p> TIP : Work on one panel at a time starting with the roof , next for UK people do the bonnet ( but if your in the USA do the hood ) ! Also use two buckets - one with clean water for rinsing to avoid grit contamination . <p> Step 8 : Dry the car off using a Chamois leather . They need to be slightly damp to work best and you are buffing the water into small droplets , a mist then a haze then the water is gone . <p> Most people expect the Chamois to work like a towel and soak up the water but it works more like a wiper blade - creating a thin film of water and letting it evaporate itself . Patience is the key . <p> Step 9 : Glass - using a glass cleaning product go over the windows inside and out in a circular motion . Very good results can be obtained using a slightly damp micro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure its a proper automotive glass cleaner . This is also the time to fix the stone chips ( You 'll have to wait for the paint to dry before moving on to the polishing stage . ) We are doing an article on stone chip removal so check back soon ! <p> Tip : The best cloth to use on glass is a piece of Hessian which has been hot washed to remove the colour and shrunk . ( Window cleaners swear by it . ) It 's handy to keep in the car for cold morning when the windows mist up . We also recommend the use of micro fibre cloths for paint work , chrome and other areas this leaves a streak free finish . <p> Step 10 : Wax or polish . ( Only use polish if your paint work has small scratches in it , each time you polish a car you remove a small layer of paint . Wax is just a protective coating you apply to give a high shine finish on polished paint . ) Generally you rub it on ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then buff off . An electronic buffer ( with a random action ) can really cut the polishing time but be careful . IE : If you used an electric buffer to clean your face it would be quick but hurt . <p> Car paint work is also delicate and pressure should not be applied and only soft cloths should be used . Use one cloth to apply the polish , another to buff it off and then with a really soft cloth buff up the polish to a showroom finish . Two mist &amp; buff off coats are far better than gobbing on as much polish as you can ( the extra is just rubbed off and less shiny residue is left behind . ) <p> The quick method . Jet wash the car down and rub it over . Add your polish to a liter of water and rub it into the paint work only - do n't do the windows . Jet wash to rinse off . <p> Then with a fine sponge rub the car all over with clean water . Squirt your windscreen washer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dry the car off . Buff off the damp polish residue with a chamois leather and &amp;shiny within 15 minutes . <p> So what are the BEST products for a showroom shine &amp; what do we recommend ? Autoglym - This is a very extensive range of car cleaning products and in our opinion is very good value for money . <p> The car shampoo by Autoglym works very well and we strongly suggest you also investigate the wonders of " Snow foam " . The Autoglym range is available from most good car part shops - see our shop link page for details . Meguiars Tech wax gives a superb finish on slightly scratched paint without resorting to the use of abrasives and is really easy to apply . <p> Interior Cleaner - Car plan interior valet spray - in our test was the best budget buy mass market product available and did just seem to dissolve the dirt . <p> We recommend using a stiff brush because the included plastic brush is a little to harsh .

Do you wait for green before you go or do you proceed on flashing amber if there is no-one crossing ?

Just because you are able to anchor up from 30mph in four yards does n't make it sensible to do so . If nothing else it 's bloody uncomfortable for your passengers . <p> I wonder how the Police panda car driver behind me would react if I stood on the brakes in response to an amber and he ran into the back of my car ?

If a policeman was having a bad day or did n't like the look of us he could get us under the letter of the law . I am going to slightly revise my own attitude to Amber , especially with all of the cameras that are being installed . <p> In London the lights change really quickly , down here Amber seems to last for ages . 
@@24423389 @4423389/ <p> No reason not to do this at all . It will generally be fine the other way around too . Diesel engines do n't take anywhere near as much cranking as is commonly thought . Despite the higher compression ratio you have to remember that when pushing up one piston there 's another one moving down which is helped by cylinder pressure . <p> It 's the glow plugs which beat the battery hard long before it has a chance to turn the engine over so this might have something to do with this train of thought . <p> as long as both vehicles are 12v no probs , have done many times , i make sure though that i use an earth point not the -ve terminal on both batteries . i think what your dad was meaning is that alot of early vehicles read before the 1960 's , especially diesels were 6v that i remember anyways , so could do major damage to the wiring . modern diesels i have found , do need a higher cranking power battery than petrol cars but my experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that i ahve still managed to jump start my son in law 's toyota prado 3L 4cyl from my 84 daihatsu which puts out max 45 amps at the alternator , much to his disgust <p> Quite agree . Some European cars in the 1960 's were positive earth so care required there . As we this is a frequent problem ! The biggest thing with jump starting is having cables that can carry the necessary current . The donor car can always be used as a surrogate charger , just wire it to the patient with the engine running for 5 minutes or so to dump some charge into the patient 's battery . This is usually a signal that the patient battery is on it 's way out . Diesels do batter batteries at startup , not so much due to higher compression as is commonly thought but due to the fact that glow plugs need a few seconds of high current delivery before the starter motor is even engaged . <p> Quite agree .

That presents another problem . Between electric cars and increased commercial and industrial automation , the demand for electricity is liable to increase . And between the electrical and economic math , ' clean ' energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electric cars do n't reduce energy demand , they shift it somewhere else . <p> DOH ! You started something now . Jumps up on soapbox Since Three-mile Island , there has been an increasing fear of nuclear energy , particularly in North America where it has been fomented and encouraged by the press . The Chernobyl catastrophe gave this fear deep roots , such that the most developed nuclear nations began chasing after much cleaner and safer , though less puissant , sources of electricity . Two new developments in the field of nuclear engineering have produced a design that has gone largely unrecognized and unused . The combination of graphite-encased spheres as fuel elements with inert gas cooling ( Nitrogen , Argon , and Helium are most favorable ) , have bern combined to produce a design that is INCAPABLE OF MELTDOWN DUE TO COOLANT FAILURE . Without technical detail , the phenomenon of doppler broadening allows a reactor of this design that experiences loss of coolant flow to reduce its reaction rate as it heats up , stabilizing at around 870 C ( 1600 F ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to melt structural steel . Gets down off of soapbox . Why does this matter ? It matters because , from my Yankee point of view anyway , fear and fanatacism are blinding the civilized peoples of the world and their governments to avenues of real progress . <p> " Why does this matter ? It matters because , from my Yankee point of view anyway , fear and fanatacism are blinding the civilized peoples of the world and their governments to avenues of real progress . " <p> You are absolutely correct . Progress is essential . Without it we 'd not have cars , antibiotics etc . I am in favour of nuclear energy . There are some who think that nuclear derived electricity is somehow different from mineral derived electricity . <p> Others state that nuclear power stations are obvious terrorist targets . This is odd because the reactor core is very very heavily armored . The biggest problem with a Nuclear power station being bombed is not to do with radiation . It 's to do with electricity supply being interrupted . <p> Going further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would n't bother with power stations , I 'd just chuck chemical/bio ' bombs ' into the water reservoirs . <p> Let 's also consider that nuclear facilities have improved too . 1950 's technology is long gone . <p> Let me first respond to that by saying I have to agree with the perception that 21st century Americans are quite daft ; I get more respect from foreigners than from my own fellow citizens . To add some clarity , nuclear reactor cores are shielded , not armored . Lead and concrete are dense , but concrete will shatter under enough explosive force , and elemental lead has a low melting point even for a metal . Still , as military targets they are tough nuts . The attraction as terror targets lies in the fact that people are frightened by " newcleer wessels " , and even an unsuccesful attack can incite fear and panic , which is what terrorists are all about - disrupting the normal operation of civilization . If you watch ' Enemy of the State ' ( a movie that came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion is telling : " If we become so afraid we start acting like them , they win . " Which brings us around to progress . ... Progress is not a linear journey along a road . Progress is a quest . Before we can make progress we must decide how to measure it . The question posed to Alice by the Cheshire cat was " Where are you trying to go ? " " I suppose I do n't know . " " Well then any road will take you there . " Progress is more than ' more ' and ' better . ' Electric cars are , in themselves good things . So were petrol engines , until there were so many of them . Look at Los Angeles . If indeed , " politics is medicine for a sick state " as C.S. Lewis has said , I tend to think that either each of our respective states are either gravely i 'll , or are being quite overperscribed . <p> Can you imagine the situation if the electric car had been invented first ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a an additional lever between the seats , a hugely complex pile of mechanical components at the front and 14 gallons of noxious explosive liquid in a tank at the back ? <p> Well indeed - as I 've always said , electric cars are not simply " green " - the electricity needs to be generated somehow . Yes , they do move pollution away from the cities and arguably to more efficient generating methods than the internal combustion engine , but until all our power comes from 0% CO2 generation you 're still only moving the problem . <p> Completely agree . It 's not a perfect solution . But once charging high current fast charging facilities are reasonably available I will convert .

@@24423392 @4423392/ <h> Debadged grills <p> The single most obvious feature of a car is the shape of the grill and the badge on it . <p> Simply by removing the badge you anonymise the car giving it a crisp fresh clean look . <p> We shall now look at the options open to you for debadging your cars grill and see which option will work the best for you . <p> For a true Euro or Stealth look you should consider debadging your grill . <p> The manufacturers grills and badges come in a few primary types . Some have the badge shape pre moulded into the grill and then have a chrome insert added to them forming the actual badge , whereas a few have the badge actually moulded into the grill itself . Other makers badges are simply stuck on to the grill . <p> You can usually determine the type of badge you have by looking behind the grill and poking around with your finger . <p> In the case of badges affixed to the grill , you can simply remove these . A few will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be filled and painted to cover this up . <p> Where there is a large moulding in the grill for the badge things start to get complicated . To make the look complete you really need to replace the horizontal slats of the grill and cut out the badge mounting area . <p> It is far easier to just buy a replacement badgeless grill and you will find many auto part suppliers selling these online and in popular auction websites . They are a simple drop in replacement and are a very effective way of creating a smooth look . <p> Another option is to cut out the entire interior of the grill , and then filling in the resulting hole with a mesh of some description . The mesh will need to be weather proof , we see some pretty nasty rusting on some chrome effect meshes . It will also need to be quite firmly and tightly mounted as it will look awful if it sags . <p> Another easy option to get a " debadged look " is to spray your grill and badge black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge . When the whole thing is painted black it can look very effective indeed . A fact noticed by Audi and produced to a small degree in the " Black editions " of their cars . <p> If you are good at bodywork or know a good bodyshop then you could always bring the top of the bonnet down to close up the gap ( but ensure the engine bay area has sufficient ventilation . ) <p> It will also look good if you remove all the badges and decals from the car . Euro style cars are typified by the removal of trims , badges and all hard edges and creases are smoothed out .

@@24423394 @4423394/ 38227 @qwx238227 <h> Basic drifting techniques for beginners . <p> " A slideways glance " <p> Drifting is an art . Getting a car to go sideways requires a delicate balancing act involving skill and concentration . The basic starting point is a suitably equipped and tuned RWD car with a locked rear diff . <p> TorqueCars will cover the most popular drift techniques which generally combine and link together to create the other more advanced techniques . Once you have learnt a few methods you can combine them and find your personal style . With experience you will also be able to take into consideration the car setup and the track and apex conditions to get the perfect drift . The better you get the faster you can drift and the more fluid your drift will be . <p> Some techniques only really become effective at higher speeds . These techniques should not be attempted until you have attained a solid level of drift control at slower speeds and can control the car 's direction during a drift . <p> Smooth , confident steady steering movements and careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all times and feel the balance of the car moving as you steer . <p> Power over - Using a burst of throttle to cause a power surge making the rear wheels lose traction . Hard acceleration will cause the rear wheels to spin faster than the speed of the car and this loss of traction effectively causes the rear of the car to go light and slide . If you are steering into a bend the back will go wide , if you are traveling straight a steering motion will start the drift in the desired direction . <p> Feint - Steering into a corner then , as the car is just about to settle into the bend , a flick of the steering in the other direction will upset the car 's traction causing the rear to break free . The Scandinavian flick , as popularized in the world of rally , is a very similar technique . This feint technique makes it possible to drift a front wheel drive car provided you have enough speed . It is also possible to drift a car by using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Feint known as lift off oversteer but this is not technically a drift at all . <p> Clutch Kick - Dipping the clutch to disengage the engine then reapplying it suddenly . The aim here is to use the different engine to road speed ( either higher or sometimes lower ) to initiate an over steer skid which can be held in a drift . You will need a heavy duty clutch and driveshaft for this or the strain is likely to cause the drivetrain , gearbox or diff to fail prematurely . <p> Handbrake - Depending on your speed and the apex of the bend , you can use the handbrake to initiate a drift . It is a useful way to break the rear traction , saving wear on the clutch and drivetrain . You can combine this with the other methods to catch and continue a drift otherwise the car will slow up or spin out . This is also what kids with FWD cars do in supermarket car parks - not cool and definitely not drifting - the aim is for a sustained controlled drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the car balanced . Gentle and progressive control is key . Steering motions must be fluid not jerky . Your throttle application also needs to be progressive and steady . <p> This is what distinguishes a pro from an amateur . Having this kind of feel for the balance of your car comes from hours of practice but gradually it will become second nature . <p> To stop an over steer skid you steer into the direction of the rear skid , so if the rear slides out to the left , you have steer to the left in order to catch this and prevent a spin . To make an over steer skid worse you steer in the opposite direction to the rear skid , so if the rear slides out to the left , steer to the right to make it worse and create a spin ! In drifting you want to maintain the delicate balance between over steer and running straight . <p> What if you overcook it and the car spins ? Do n't panic ! The car will usually complete a 180 degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the car has lost its speed apply the brake to prevent the car rolling into a barrier or worse still another driver . <p> The holy grail of drifting is a long " driftlock " - being able to hold a steady drift vector for as long as possible at a fast pace . The greater the angle and faster the drift the more points are awarded . In-car GPS measures the angle and speed of drift and allows an easily judgeable benchmark for practice runs . Most competitions have judges who award points on speed , style and angle of drift . <p> Feel free to join us in our tuningforum and discuss drifting techniques ( if you are a serious drifter ) , read up on drift events and all aspects of drift car setup with our resident drifting fanatics and fans . <p> This entry was @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Squirt the fluid down the elements from the outside while holding the filter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the dirt being washed out of the bottom of the filter . <p> Do n't be tempted to re-ditribute the detergent that 's collected in the bucket through the filter again , all you 'll do is re-introduce the dirt to the clean side of the filter . <p> Once you covered the whole filter &amp; you 've used all your detergent leave the filter to stand for ten minutes to allow the detergent to break down the old oil in the filter . <p> While your waiting you can wash the outer case . <p> Step 4 , Rinsing &amp; repeat . <p> Rinse out your bucket . Using another bucket/jug or even a slow running tap/hose and rinse filter until no more debris collects and the bottom of the bucket . Again , do n't reuse the contaminated water on the filter . <p> Step 5 , Drying : <p> Pat your filter dry and place somewhere with good air flow &amp; allow the filter to dry naturally . Do not use a hair dryer or place in a very warm area as this could damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good 24 hours to dry just to be sure . <p> Step 6 , Oiling the filter : <p> Here I had a problem , the BMC instructions were for a flat element &amp; call for the filter to be doped on both sides . The CDA filter is a cylindrical design this makes applying the oil a little tricky with the supplied bottle . The other kit comes with an aerosol can of oil &amp; this would make application easier but it would still be very messy &amp; it would not get the oil into all the nooks &amp; crannies . <p> So I made this up using a small length of cane &amp; some old fuel line from a Nitro RC truck ( see , this is why we never throw anything away ! ) <p> This allowed me to evenly distribute the oil around the inside of the filter . <p> Once you have applied two coats of oil along the pleats hold the filter the light &amp; ensure the filter is an even red colour . I used about half a bottle of oil the saturate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once your satisfied the filter is evenly coated leave it stand for 30 minutes . I turned mine about quarter of a turn every 5 minutes or so , to ensure the oil did n't collect in one place . <p> Carefully pat the excess off the filter with paper towels &amp; move on to step 7 . <p> Step 7 , Refitting : <p> Pretty straight forward , rebuild your filter taking care that the screw holes match up , I found mine were n't all exactly in line &amp; the base would line up one way . Fit back in the car . : amuse : <p> I have today cleaned my CDA fitted to my Jaguar XK8 ( after 30k miles ! ) and have a few tips : <p> 1 ) As well making sure you have the correct Phillips screwdriver it does help if you give the screws a quick blast of Plusgas/WD40 and leave to stand for a few minutes as they are really tight ! I am considering changing these screws completely to something with a small nut end , as feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 2 ) When rinsing after cleaning it took 10x2l jugs of water until it ran clear . <p> 3 ) After oiling turn the filter to stand on the vanes for a minute then back the other way for 20 seconds , then back to the vanes for a minute . The reason for doing this is you can see the oil trickling down the filter to recoat . The reason for longer on the vane side is that that end will catch the oil , the other way wo n't and it will run out . You need to repeat this probably 20 times or so and this means you should n't need a second coat . <p> 4 ) The screws do show signs of rust so maybe worth applying a thin coat of rust protectant to the heads . 
@@24423396 @4423396/ 38227 @qwx238227 <h> Induction kits &amp; what they do . <p> " An introduction to induction kits " <p> As induction kits are probably one of the most popular modifications for car tuning projects we thought we should add a introductory article to explain what they are , what they do and the theory behind them . <p> An induction kit is quite simply an air filter . Most cars have air filters mounted in an air box . These filters are generally constructed of paper which filters out the particles from the air and prevents these from getting into the engine . <p> The airboxes are designed to reduce the noise of the engine and have various vanes and angles cut to maximize this noise reduction . <p> Because the air is not flowing freely through the filter there is potentially a loss of power due to the turbulence caused by all that sound deadening . To make up for this loss of power the air filter surface area is a lot larger than the intake tubes so manufactures have effectively closed the gap between , noise reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise reduction is generally the last thing on peoples mind . Swapping out the restrictive air box with an open filter helps to improve the flow of air into the engine and fully releases the induction roar , a noise associated with tuners cars the world over . <p> The induction kit is quite simply an open air filter shaped like a cone , dome or tube . <p> So it would appear that induction kits are a win/win situation . However there are some downsides . As the filter is sited in the warm engine bay it will suck in warm air which carries less oxygen . Thankfully after a mile or so the air temperature in the engine bay is much reduced and closer to ambient temperatures . Fitting a cold air feed pipe taking air from outside the engine bay will help to counter this problem . <p> Engines with induction kits fitted typically see the power gains quite high up the RPM range . However low end power can be compromised . In small engines the effect of an induction kit is often a noticeable loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to use the top end of the RPM range all the time , like you would in a race environment , but on the street this is just not viable . Fuel usage would be much higher and you will be causing a noise nuisance to your neighbors . <p> Induction kits flow better than paper elements partly because they do less filtering . Induction kits are still efficient filters but they are never going to be as effective as an OEM paper filter . <p> Do induction kits always add power ? NO - typically power gains are toward the top end of the RPM range and some engines will show a power loss , especially low down . <p> Do induction kits add fuel economy ? By sucking in warm engine bay air the engine will use less fuel , so round town you might notice a slight improvement in MPG but the induction roar promotes a heavier driving style which negates this . Engines can be a little more efficient with induction kits so pull in more air . <p> This generally means you get more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style , to use less throttle and settled for your previous power figures , you can get improved mpg with induction kits . <p> Are all induction kits the same ? No , quality varies considerably . We recommend filters that are using a cotton gauze filtration medium . Some kits come with high flow air boxes and air intakes designed specifically for a car and these will usually out perform basic filter only kits . <p> Are induction kits hard to fit ? Induction kits are very simple to fit . You may need to cut a pipe or two but most kits can be fitted in 4 minutes with just a screwdriver . <p> I fitted an induction kit and I have flat spots ? Wait for a while . Modern engines may need to adjust to the new air flow characteristics . They will auto trim the fueling based on lambda readings . <p> If after a tank of fuel you still get flat spots then you should check your fuel delivery . Running lean can be a problem and some have noted that fitting a sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main benefit of an induction kit ?

Do I need to take it in to be tuned ? Also I gave it a minute to run and get used to the new intake and the damn light still comes on after a few miles <p> I would take the air induction kit back . Simply put in a K&amp;N you will not only notice performance but when you get on it it is plenty loud heads will roll it sounds good and no check engine light . Just do not over oil it when you clean it you have to spray it with oil.It is transmission fluid red and all . Good luck mine runs sweet with 164,000 miles . <p> Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air to flow more quickly , when the intake pipe is wide , you admittedly have the ability to flow more air , but at low RPM the air is moving more slowly than it would in a narrower pipe , so you get less air into the cylinders . There is an ideal pipe width for a volume of air , and this also depends on the airs pressure and temperature . This is why you lose power low down in some cars under certain conditions with induction kits . 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234 
@@24423397 @4423397/ <h> The advantages of adding aftermarket intercoolers . <p> " Keeping your cool " <p> If you do n't have a turbocharger or supercharger you do n't need an intercooler . The intake air temps on a NASP engine are as low as they can realistically get so you 'd just be adding drag to the airflow . <p> One problem with a Turbo is the close proximity of the cold intake charge with the hot exhaust temperatures within the turbo . <p> Do n't forget that a big air intake heat rise comes from the actual compression of air so even supercharged engine will benefit from an intercooler . <p> If you have ever felt the nozzle on a tyre pump you will realise that when air is compressed it gains heat . <p> We know from our chemistry and physics lessons that the colder air is the more oxygen it carries . <p> Why is this important ? To burn fuel you need oxygen and , the more oxygen you have , the more fuel you can burn , which increases the power output of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> An intercooler is effectively a radiator which allows the intake air charge to be cooled before it gets into the engine . You would ideally mount an intercooler in front of the radiator so that it benefits from all that nice cold air hitting it . It would sit after the air intake filter and after the turbo or supercharger . <p> Most cars have front mounted intercoolers which sit in front of the radiator and as a result they tend to offer superior air cooling over top mounted intercoolers . You need to take into account the fact that the air reaching the radiator is reduced so you may in extreme cases need to uprate your cars radiator to maintain low on track temperatures . <p> An efficient intercooler design can give the benefit of 5% to 10% more power and resist heat soak for longer ! <p> Some cars have top mounted intercoolers which suck air in through the bonnet , this may mean that when the car is stationary it is actually being hit by warm air coming from the engine bay . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less fuel because the air is warmer and you certainly do n't want to be pulling big power figures whilst ticking over in traffic . The Subaru Impreza springs to mind as a car with a top mounted intercooler . A top mounted intercooler offers a substantially shorter air flow route into the engine . <p> All turbo cars will benefit from an intercooler and improvements can be made on the standard factory fit intercoolers . You need to remember that you want to suck as much air into the engine as possible , so if the intercooler internal core hinders airflow you will actually lose some power . <p> The 2 factors which make an intercooler work are the internal flow characteristics and the cooling fins . Ideally the fins will have the largest surface area and the internal core will benefit from a low number of tapered bends and no internal welds to cause turbulence . <p> Some argue that all intercoolers restrict the airflow , but considering the benefits gained by having a good quality one fitted and the minimal loss of airflow inherent in a well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality using an intercooler which is too large can hinder airflow so there is an important case of getting the correct size for the application ( this is something which can be discussed in more detail in our forum . ) Bigger is not always better ! <p> For a boost level of 15PSi , we at TorqueCars would expect a pressure drop of .5 to .9 psi with some applications losing 1.3psi in the worst case scenario . ( Just as increasing pressure increases temperature so decreasing pressure is the result from lowering the air temperature so do n't blame the intercooler design for the entire loss of pressure . <p> Weight is always an issue in performance cars and many after market intercoolers are both lighter than their factory equivalents and offer substantially better performance gains . As a general rule of thumb a slightly bigger intercooler will have better cooling properties although it usually creates more drag . This extra drag needs be carefully weighed up against the cooling offered . The longer the air is inside the intercooler the better the cooling effect will be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercooler with water or nitrous , therefore reducing the intake temperature further as the liquid evaporates using heat from the air flowing through the intercooler . <p> The actual power gain from an efficient intercooler design over OEM is typically between 5% and 10% with a temperature drop of 35C-40C and this will obviously depend on the ambient temperature - the bigger the difference between intake temp and ambient temp the better the cooling effect . <p> Eventually even large efficient intercoolers will suffer from heat soak . This is where the intercooler itself starts to warm up typically after longer periods of high boost driving . Generally speaking the larger the intercooler the longer it resists heat soak for . So if you are looking for the maximum benefits from an intercooler you need to obtain the optimum size . <p> Please join us in our friendly forum to catch up with the latest trends in tuning and car modification for your car . 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234 
@@24423398 @4423398/ <h> What is a hybrid turbo ? <p> When you have a turbo engine you are actually starting out with a fantastic base to work from . <p> As a rule the turbo engines are stronger than the NASP equivalents and are able to handle substantial power gains . <p> The key thing in a turbo engine is the flow rate that can be generated and this depends largely on the internal profiles of the impellers inside the turbo . <p> Hybrid turbos are a great way to make extra power without lots of additional engine modifications . <p> When you want to increase the turbo capacity you have two options . Firstly you can fit a larger turbocharger , but this will usually require a lot of custom pipe work as the oil feed , exhaust manifold and intakes are in different locations . <p> Your other option is to go with a hybrid turbo . A hybrid turbo is a drop in replacement for the OEM turbo but the internals have been altered to suit your power requirements . <p> By altering the profile of the exhaust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quickly , provide a longer power band or more top end power . It is usually a compromise as you are generally unable to get all of these benefits and will need to choose the best option to suit . <p> Also alterations to the intake compressors profile can have a dramatic effect on how much air can be pulled into the engine . <p> There are two types of bearings used in turbos . Thrust bearings and ball bearings . Most OEM turbos use thrust bearings as these are cheaper to produce but when a lot of extra power is put through them they can start to fail and you get oil leaks and premature turbo wear . <p> A ball bearing turbo will usually spool up more quickly than a thrust bearing one and will be able to handle much more power . Not all OEM turbo housings can be modified and converted from a thrust bearing to ball bearing , instead an OEM shaped turbo unit is made to accommodate the uprated internals . <p> We should also note that the air intake opening shape also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any steps , pits or seams in the metal surface can cause turbulence which will ruin your airflow characteristics . <p> Here are the pros and cons to consider when specifying the characteristics of your hybrid turbo . <p> +points High end power -points Bottom end power and you will get more lag . +points Bottom end power &amp; Faster spool up -points the top end power will usually be compromised . +points Longer power band -points The peak power figure will be slightly lower and there may be a little more lag . <h> Other considerations on adding a hybrid turbo . <p> You will need to consider your peak power carefully as hybrid turbos are generally graded into power bands . You 'll also need a remap to fully release the potential power gains of your turbo although most cars will cope with a hybrid turbo on a standard map . When the boost levels run beyond what the ECU expects a car may go into a limp home mode so for this reason alone a remap makes good sense . <p> Just pushing more air into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matched to the fuel supplied as well . Uprating the injectors and fuel pump along with a higher pressure fuel line will make good sense . <p> Standard engines can generally cope with power hikes in the region of 30-40% but anymore than this and you should consider fitting forged internal engine parts , particularly the pistons , crank and rods . <p> You can discuss hybrid turbos with our members in our technical forum if you have any further questions or wish to see what other people have done to their cars . 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Run your fingernail over the scratch to determine if it is only a surface scratch . If your fingernail snags on the scratch then it is deep . If not and your fingernail goes straight over it you have a light scratch . <p> Once you know what sort of scratch you are dealing with you can go about removing it . <p> Scratches can be easily removed , but the method to use depends on how deep the scratch is . <h> Repairing light scratches <p> These light surface scratches can be easily removed with the use of an abrasive paste .

When you treat a scratch it can restore the colour of the paint around the scratch so you 'll need to gradually work outwards , smoothing the colour change . <p> When you 've finished with the polish you should apply a good quality wax to protect the paint . <p> The swirls you get in paint work which are caused by washing the car from grit in your sponge can also be removed with a polish . You ca n't do this too often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Repairing deep scratches . <p> Deeper scratches can be right down to the metal or base coat .

If there is a lot of deep metal damage you may have to build this up with filler or a high build primer before applying the paint . ( See our paintshop tips for a guide on how to apply car paint ) <p> For thin and long scratches , just mask off the area either side of the scratch and use a touch up pen to fill the scratch with paint . Build this up in a few layers and leave it slightly proud of the paint surface . <p> Allow plenty of time for the paint to dry between applications and then allow a couple of days for it to harden . <p> Next you 'll need to use a fine grit grade of wet and dry paper and small sanding block ( a pencil eraser works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint taking it back to be level with the rest of the paint .

The 140 TDI engines without the DPF are in our opinion better when remapped with a larger turbo than the 170 's and give far fewer headaches . <p> Gas flowing the head will allow you to maximize your air/fuel charge . TorqueCars suggest you leave this to a professional though , with a proper flow bench and machine tools When you start tuning your A5 you will find that the standard clutch starts to complain at around 300bhp so get an uprated clutch if this applies to you . <p> NASP engines do not achieve big power gains if you remap them , unless you have done extensive modifications like cams and head work . <p> With turbocharged engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A remapped turbo will give phenomenal power gains and take full advantage of the strength of the block .

@@24423405 @4423405/ <h> Tuning the cars engine for better MPG means reducing power . <p> " Tuning for better MPG . " <p> Tuning for economy . With the rising price of fuel one question TorqueCars frequently gets asked is how can a car be tuned for maximum economy . Short of getting the family to push the car everywhere there are actually a few mods that can be done to improve fuel economy . <p> First off you need to see if your car is operating within normal parameters . So get your makers stats out and work out if you are getting the right fuel consumption to start with . ( Your driving habits and use of air conditioning may also be partly to blame so take the diving boot of the right foot and affix a helium balloon . ) <h> Baseline factors for consideration . <p> First off we need to rid ourselves of problem areas that can rob us of fuel economy . You need a good strong spark to ensure that the engine burns the fuel effectively . Clean plugs are an essential so regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all leads and hi-tension electrics need to be in perfect working order . <p> The fuel system also needs to be in tip top condition . Over time , on injection engines , the injectors - the little nozzles that spray the fuel into the engine become silted up . <p> Instead of spraying a fine mist of fuel into the combustion chamber , which would burn very well , it squirts a jet of fuel which sits in the bottom of the cylinder and much fuel is wasted . <p> The addition of an injector/carb cleaner and use of high quality fuel will help with this problem but on an older car it is worth considering fitting new injectors . A simple compression test will reveal much about the condition of the engine and it efficiency . <p> An engine which loses combustion pressure will not be efficient . The cost of the work to correct the faults outlined above may well be more than covered by the fuel savings over the next year or so . <p> Your driving habits and use of air conditioning may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right foot and affix a helium balloon . <h> Regular checks <p> Tire pressures should also be checked as a 15psi drop in just one tire can rob you of 2-4 mpg at slow urban speeds ! ! ! This gets even worse if all 4 tires are under inflated . Are all of the sensors ( temp , airflow , Lambda , idle speed etc ) working correctly ? <p> Less obvious but important none the less is to check the hoses in the engine bay for air loss - a vacuum loss can cause high idling and other combustion issues . You also need to ensure that the air filter is clean and in good condition . <p> Roof racks and open windows ( at speeds over 30 mph ) will take another 5 mpg or so from your economy again depending on driving style and speeds . <h> Tuning tips <p> Now moving on to the tuning tips . When making a car more powerful you lose fuel economy because you are burning more fuel and pulling more air into the engine so the reverse is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to maintain the most efficient engine . <p> Things we do to make our cars faster can also be used ( and sometimes reversed ) to get better economy . The overall aim should be to improve the efficiency of the engine whereas in performance tuning we generally increase the engines capacity to burn fuel as well as making it more efficient . As each engine is different there is not a one size fits all approach . <p> Generally speaking getting the head gas flowed and improving the combustion cycle of the engine will make the car more economical as it is running more efficiently . The larger the capacity of the engine the more effective this is . <p> Paying careful attention to the area around the intake valves especially by introducing 3 or 5 stepped angles can improve economy by maximizing the air flow into the engine and allowing better fuel/air mixing as it enters the cylinder . <p> A lighter flywheel will also further reduce the rotational mass of the engine and free up some economy . It is worth noting that on long motorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lighter flywheel . <h> Modifications to be removed/reversed <p> Modifications such as adding larger fuel injectors and bigger valves will usually result in an increased power gain rather than greater efficiency . <p> Sometimes though the aim of performance tuning is purely to burn more fuel and this will deny you the fuel economy you seek stick with mods that improve efficiency instead . Wide tires and big wheels mean big rotating mass , which take more energy to accelerate and this applies to heavy wheels so stick with some light weight alloys wheels . <p> Wide tires also generally have higher rolling resistance which also decreased fuel economy so once again get things back to the manufacturers base figures . <p> Particularly in smaller capacity European cars ( 1.0-1.6 ) , which are fairly efficient to start with , you should look at undoing the modifications you have applied for power gains . <p> So if you have fitted a large bore ( read MASSIVE ! ) sports exhaust to increase the power of the engine you should consider replacing this with a slightly smaller bore exhaust roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This will get the air flow back in line with the designed characteristics - back pressure is not a bad thing ! <p> Changing the spark timing will also help to make the burn cycle of the engine more efficient . In modern cars the only way this can be achieved is via a remap of the computer . If you have fitted an induction kit to increase air flow to the engine then you need to consider restricting the air intake by swapping back to a standard air box and perhaps using a panel filter . <p> Basically if you reverse the power tips you have applied to your car to encourage it to burn more fuel you will have found some economy tips ! Taking the theory a little further , for urban speeds mainly , - the hotter the intake air the less oxygen it carries and the less fuel will be burnt as the fuel to oxygen mix is carefully maintained . <h> Other simple modifications to improve economy <p> Putting a warm air feed to take air from behind the radiator or better still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to increase urban fuel economy at mid to light throttle settings . <p> You probably notice that your car is a few MPG better off in the summer compared to the middle of winter but the car seems much faster and more responsive in the Winter . <p> This is due to the high air intake temperature and the fact that the engine is running a little hotter . Hotter engines are more efficient and just raising the rating of the thermostatic valve that controls the cooling system by a couple of degrees can improve fuel consumption . <p> Fitting a new clutch can help maximize the power delivery and reduce ' transmission loss ' . On cars with a couple of cooling fans in them you can wire one up to a switch which you manually throw if you see the temperature of the engine rising . <p> Re mapping the ECU is possible and on turbo models a fairly substantial fuel saving can be had but few people actually ask for an economy remap - some companies offer remaps which give better economy at low revs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as we tend to enjoy the power bit regularly . <p> We have also seen some of our members blocking off part of the radiator in winter to improve economy . In the middle of winter car engines take a lot longer to reach operating temperature and often the engine runs slightly cooler than is ideal so drivers can mask off part of the radiator which ensures the car gets up to operating temperature as quickly as possible this is best done with a heavy grade foil but you must always leave the area behind the fan free otherwise the car will overheat and if it does you will kill the engine . <p> Warm engine temps also promote vaporization of large fuel droplets that stick to engine surfaces or that are produced by poor quality or maintained injectors . It is also worth checking the alignment of the wheels as a misaligned wheel can create major drag .

Is it worth buying an octane boosting petrol additive ? <p> Does using a petrol with a higher RON improve performance or fuel economy ? <p> TorqueCars is here to provide some answers and to help you decide what to put in your tank . The old saying " you are what you eat " can also apply to what your car drinks . <p> Petrol is a complex mixture . It contains over 300 different chemical compounds , mainly hydrocarbons ( compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen ) . <p> Petrol does n't have a fixed composition but it is graded according to its performance in a test engine , which is where Research Octane Numbers come in . It 's sometimes also called the Octane number or Octane rating , but beware , these terms do n't always refer to RON . See table below . If you are reading an article from the USA the numbers quoted will refer to the AKI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knock . <p> RON tells us nothing about the economy or power of the fuel . <p> The Research Octane Number or RON is a measure of how good a petrol is at resisting engine knock . To understand what this means for our engines and our choice of fuel we need to look more closely at engine knock . <p> Ideally , during the ignition stroke the flame initiated by the spark plug should spread evenly across the cylinder consuming all the fuel and pushing the piston down in one smooth movement . In practice the high pressure and temperature in the cylinder can cause fuel in the far reaches of the cylinder to ignite spontaneously . These i 'll timed explosions place uneven pressure on the piston resulting in a jerky motion rather than a smooth piston stroke . This is known as engine knock and it causes a distinctive ' pinking ' noise , more seriously in the long term it damages the pistons and can lead to engine failure . The higher the compression ratio of the engine the more likely engine knock is to occur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single cylinder variable compression test engine . Fuels were compared to a test mixture of iso-octane ( which is good at resisting engine knock ) and heptane ( which is poor at resisting engine knock ) . 98 RON petrol would cause engine knock at the same compression ratio as a 98% iso-octane 2% Heptane mixture . <p> Modern RON tests use computerized apparatus and the method has been refined so fuels with a RON greater than 100 can be assessed , but the basic principle remains unchanged . <p> Could refer to any of the above , if you can work out which country the article was written in you should be able to work it out . <p> With a modern engine management systems you are unlikely to hear engine knock even if your fuel is n't fully meeting your engine 's octane requirements . Knock sensors in the engine detect the first signs of engine knock and takes measures to prevent it such as adjusting the engine timing . This prevents engine damage but can result in reduced performance and fuel economy . Use our easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So is the answer to just use the highest RON fuel available ? Not necessarily . If the RON of your petrol is high enough to completely suppress engine knock then moving to a higher RON fuel will not improve performance or fuel economy . RON is not a measure ofhow ' powerful ' a fuel is . <p> Higher RON fuels are also more expensive . Your car manual should recommend the optimum RON fuel for your car . My Audi manual recommends 98 RON , 95 RON can be used with a slight loss of power under heavy driving conditions ( eg heavily loaded , high revs ) , the power loss is due to the engine management system adjusting to avoid engine knock . In an emergency 91 RON can be used but only at ' moderate engine speeds and a light throttle . ' <p> Unless a higher RON petrol comes with hard evidence that it has other properties that will increase power or fuel economy then you 're better off sticking to the recommended RON . The only time I would be tempted to splash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be for a track day when the car is being driven at full throttle . <p> The bottom line is that RON is a measure of how effective a petrol is at resisting engine knock .

The solution is to have a system installed which allows the cars ride height to be adjusted . <p> Choosing the right system is fraught with problems . It is fair to say that you will get what you pay for in most cases so the budget options are generally to be avoided . Complete kits designed for your specific model are the way to go if you want a low hassle install , but if you know what you are doing then a better system can be made by sourcing your own components . <p> The weight of the car comes into the equation as well and when you buy your air bag suspension or hydraulic suspension it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to far from reality here as neither extreme is beneficial but we would say to err on the side of caution and specify a system that handles a weight above that of your car .

Few of these coilovers will allow much of a range of drop and you will generally have a choice of height but will have to compromise on the spring and rebound rates depending on the selected height . <h> Problems with air suspension . <p> Air line components that rub against the bodywork can wear through . If moisture gets into the air system it can cause components to rot from the inside out .

The air system by it 's very nature gives a soft woolly ride quality which , although comfortable , does n't lend itself too well to cornering and general road holding . Airbag suspension systems are usually quite slow to react and take a while to fully rise or drop . If your suspension is not set up properly you will experience accelerated tyre wear . <h> Problems with hydraulic suspension <p> Much of the issues around line wear as per air suspension will also apply to the hydraulic suspension systems .

Engines need to breathe as freely as possible and obstructions , seams and pits cause turbulence and this is not very good for airflow . <p> Generally speaking most standard non performance cars will benefit greatly from even a little DIY head porting . <p> A high performance engine usually comes with a fairly optimum flow and these can only be improved by a specialist with a proper flow bench . ( The S2000 is a good example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not benefit much by opening up to match the intake manifold , unless there is a step that obstructs the airflow into the engine . So most DIY port matching work is best performed on the exhaust ports . <p> It is worth noting that enlarging the port size is not always beneficial and is only required in highly tuned engines where the port size has become a bottleneck . Often better flow rates are achieved with slightly narrower channels and fewer bends or angles . <p> A word of caution though if you enlarge the exhaust port fully to the size of the gasket when the manifold port opening is smaller than the gasket you will completely mess up the airflow . This will lose power - the aim here should be to get the two port openings to roughly the same size avoiding turbulence on the exhaust side . <p> This picture shows the aim of getting a smooth join between the manifold ( x ) and the engine port ( y ) in a highly tuned rally car engine . <p> The Fuel injector ( f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough surface after the injector will help with fuel atomization due to the greater surface area . <p> Ideally you want the intake directly above the cylinder but this is not possible due to valves and spark plugs and cam assemblies . <p> Many manufacturers take the intake through a 90 degree bend into the cylinder . The straighter you can make the intake path the better it will be . <p> Additionally the intake side of the head will benefit if you can create a Spiral flow into the cylinder as this gives much better fuel atomization . Careful work around the valve can help with this further . <p> TorqueCars members have done a satisfactory DIY job on their heads but a specialist really has so much more to offer . Really , as far as a DIY approach goes , do little more with the ports and manifolds than a smoothing up and polishing ( the intake manifold has the job of assisting with vaporizing the fuel and benefits from a pitted rough surface so please do not polish the intake manifold downstream of the fuel injectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not happen after the injector as the port can be reshaped but there must be a slightly rough finish to help the fuel mix better with the incoming air . <p> Maximum airflow can only be achieved by a specialist using an air flow bench and the very latest fully programmed milling machines . <p> Air flows in a similar way to water , the faster the air moves the more gloopy and sticky it behaves . If you have ever hit the surface of water at speed you will realise that it is not soft and liquid ! <p> The aim in the head is to get as much air and fuel mixed as effectively as possible into the combustion chamber . The most important area within the engine , as far as air flow is concerned , is the valve seats and bigger power gains can be has here especially for engines with slightly higher lift valves with some careful blending below the valve seat insert to remove the steps and grooves . <p> Concentrate on a clean flow into the engine rather than just widening the inlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Beware , not all engines benefit from the inlet ports being opened up to the size of the gasket . NASP engines rely on the vacuum created by the engine to suck in air , and widening the inlet port will actually slow up the flow of air , sacrificing low end power but it will generally allow more mixture to be introduced at high RPM . The port sizes should be setup for the optimum desired characteristics of each engine . <p> In a turbo or supercharged engine bigger is usually better as the air is being forced into the engine but the entire inlet and exhaust channel should match the dimensions of your new port sizes . <p> Putting the gasket over the ports will show how much can be taken off for a good airflow match but you will rarely want to go as wide as the gasket .

TorqueCars shall look at various methods of caliper painting techniques and generally the longer you spend doing the job the better it will be . We will list some quick ways and also a few shortcuts . <p> Ideally you will have had the calipers removed from the car to enable you to do a proper job but it is possible to do a reasonable job with them on the car if the wheel is removed to allow proper access . TorqueCars have also known people with big gaps in the alloy wheel to paint them with the wheel on but removing a wheel is not difficult so there is no need to be that lazy . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very careful to mask off the brake disk , pads and pistons etc ... to prevent paint from getting where you do n't want it . <p> Take your time , the finish you get and the length of time it lasts depends entirely on the amount of time you have spent preparing and building up the paint . <p> The first job is cleaning off the caliper , if you have new calipers to go on then you have saved yourself a very messy and time consuming job . Safety first though , older cars brake dust contains asbestos and as such should be considered lethal to inhale it due to the high risk of developing lung cancers . Most brake pads in recent times are of an Asbestos free formulation but we still advise you to avoid inhaling the dust . <p> A mask is highly recommended along with gloves to protect your skin from the chemicals you will be using . <p> First jet wash or hose down the caliper to remove the loose grit and dirt . A good alloy wheel cleaner will help to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt . If you fail to strip off the dust and dirt you can expect your new paint to start peeling in a very short time . <p> Using a small wire brush , and then a toothbrush or similar , really work in the alloy wheel cleaner to all of the edges . <p> Next step is to clean off the wheel with water according to the instructions on the cleaner . <p> Next spend a little more time scrubbing the caliper and use a little washing up liquid to remove any grease or grime and more importantly and residual brake cleaner or copper grease that may still be bonded to the surface . <p> Next spray over the caliper a good quality solvent cleaner taking care that this does not go onto the rubber piston boots or brake hoses as this can quickly dissolve them and break them down . <p> What paint should you use ?

When painting on make sure you use a good quality brush and build up a few very thin layers rather than just slapping on a thick coating . Let the paint dry between coats as per the instructions on the tin . <p> If you apply a thick coating it can be very hard to fit and remove the calipers later on so bear this in mind . <p> The paint may well start to fade after 6 months but having a layer of paint will actually make cleaning them a lot easier next time and it is actually very easy to touch up any chips and flakes with the calipers on the car every six months .

@@24423420 @4423420/ <h> Modifications for the Peugeot 206 <p> The Peugeot 206 was first produced in 1998 and was set to replace the popular 205 . <p> It quickly established itself as a popular choice for the family . The 206 is well put together and a rewarding drive . <p> With some well thought out suspension modifications the 206 becomes a veritable pleasure to drive on the roads . The first step with a tuning project is ideally uprating the braking system . <p> You have a few choices , ranging from an expensive big brake conversion kit to fitting larger brakes from its big brother , the 306 GTI -6 ( you will not need to use the master cylinder but you may need to get the calipers from the donor model . ) <p> Peugeot seem intent on taking the fun out of the 206 when they designed the air intake . <p> The models of choice as far as tuning go are the ones with the 2.0 engine namely the GTi and GTi180 . The HDi turbo diesel is also a good proposition and with a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A number of TorqueCars members have gone for the Diesel route and are continually boasting about their power to fuel economy ratio . <p> Sadly there is little that can be done to increase the power of the 1.4 and 1.1 models although an engine swap is probably your most cost effective upgrade . We have heard of a 1.1 engine tuned for a power gain of 8bhp across the rev range ( peak 4100rpm +27bhp ) - but on the larger engines this same outlay can give you double this throughout the rev range . Go with a 1.6 or 2.0 petrol unit for the maximum benefit and return on your tuning investment . <p> Induction modifications . The intake on most 206 models is fairly restrictive 60 mm with silly amounts of padding further reducing the airflow . So many owners go for an induction kit , but you should really make sure you get a cold air feed pipe to suck in cool air if you are really looking for power gains and also go with a much larger diameter intake pipe in the region of 80mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intake should yield power gains as Peugeot seem to have designed the engines to be starved of oxygen . <p> Some owners have reported problems with the throttle cable preventing the inlet valve to open fully , so take off the air filter housing and get someone to press the accelerator whilst you check the butterfly valve is opening . <p> We have started to see some impressive 206 Turbo conversions performed by leading Peugeot tuners . Sadly the turbo is not a bolt on unit and many other mods also need to be done to get this working rendering this a rather expensive exercise . 206 supercharger upgrades are also popular and these actually seem easier to do than a turbo conversion partly due to the near linear power delivery . <p> Why not join us in our tuning forum to discuss 206 Tuning in greater detail with our many enthusiastic members and get inspiration and ideas from our gallery and projects forums . <p> This @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Acceleration was not easy in overdrive but it did make the car more economical and was more of a motorway cruiser . <p> With powerful cars the gearboxes can break up so you have to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap but unreliable performance mod is to get a lower ratio box from a similar model of car with a smaller engine for example an Astra 1.3 box into a 1.8 or even the 2.0 engine and you will have very good acceleration ( your top speed will be lower as will economy but you ca n't have everything ) . <p> Be warned though the gearbox will not last long ! Torquecars would also recommend using a Carbon Fibre driveshaft can help prolong the life of a gearbox as it twists and flexes to absorb the initial shock wave from the engine as the revs increase or decrease whereas a steel driveshaft takes the shock wave directly to the box . Thicker oil can help reduce a whine alternatively use a good quality oil additive . <p> A straight cut dog tooth gearbox is a little more crunchy at times as the shape of the gear teeth is like a dogs tooth ( surprise surprise ) but this minimises transmission power loss as the gears intermesh a lot more efficiently . Dog tooth gears allow for faster gear changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength . <p> Highly tuned engines often have narrow power bands and a dog tooth box with low ratio gearing can maximise the output . As much thought needs go into the selection of gear ratio and type as went in to the rest of the engine tuning . <p> Gear cuts to choose from range from a straight cut , through Semi helical and helical . An example of gear ratios for big powered V8 sports cars upto 450bhp : - <p> 1st <p> 2nd <p> 3rd <p> 4th <p> 5th <p> 6th <p> Road setup <p> 3.0 <p> 2.0 <p> 1.45 <p> 1.14 <p> 0.92 <p> 0.78 <p> Race setup <p> 2.6 <p> 1.93 <p> 1.53 <p> 1.25 <p> 1.04 <p> 0.88 <p> Final drive ratio 3.7 &amp; 4.11 <p> Limited slip differential controls the power output to the wheels especially beneficial on low grip surfaces , in wet conditions , or with a large powerful engine that causes wheel spin and can introduce a torque steer effect which can , if you adjust your driving style , give better handling on fast bends .

( Many owners say these cars improve with age as the 8v engines bed in and loosen up . ) <p> Then came the mk2 Golf which was where the tuning scene started taking off and now we see 1.8T mk2 engine conversions and also the VR6 going in as well as owners capture the original essence of a mk1 GTi . <p> mk3 Golfs were not fantastic cars , the GTi had lost it 's magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golf tuning parts created allowing you to achieve the " GTi ideal " on your mk3 model . <p> The MK4 ( mkIV ) and mk5 ( mkV ) Golfs shows VW dedication to the platform and a lot of criticisms leveled at the previous models were addressed . <p> The mk6 &amp; mk7 Golfs are a major leap forward and VW have once again come up with a stunningly fun car to drive and modify . <p> We now have many different revisions to the platform and the Golf remains a superb base for a tuning project thanks to all of the aftermarket tuning suppliers . <p> The engines pull well and the small relatively light body make it a fun car to drive . VW have continued to improve on the winning formula over the years with some fantastic engine and chassis set ups . <p> The early eighties 8 and 16 valve GTI engines were excellent and many remark that 8 valve engine actually improves with age . ( A fact the Dyno seems to bear out ! ) <p> The mk1 Golf Gti defined the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a scorching hatch ! <p> We have plenty of members in our forum with Golf tuning projects underway from engine swaps to the VR6 to 8 and 16 valve head conversions . <p> By the time the mk3 and mk4 were released there was something magical missing from the GTI . The handling was no longer as sharp and responsive as the early models . <p> It had become a run of the mill family car as VW looked to their profit margins rather than creating great cars . It was more of a lukewarm hatch than a hot hatch . This did n't stop many of our members from improving it though . With an anti roll bar , a set of adjustable coil overs and low profile tyres along with a few other suspension tweaks you get a mk III/IV Golf every bit as much fun as the original . <p> Dropping in more powerful engines seemed the logical next step and we have seen successful conversions to the 1.8T and VR6 blocks . We have even heard of some Japanese engines being fitted with great success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The first Golf modification to perform is generally to sort the suspension . Lowering the car 30-40 millimetres and fitting stiffer springs will sharpen up the ride and your driver enjoyment of the car . <h> Engine modifications <p> On the larger engines ( 1.8 and above ) and those with turbos we recommend a full induction kit with a cold air feed . For smaller engines and the Diesel variants we would recommend a panel air filter made from a high flow material such as cotton gauze . <p> A fast road cam would raise the peak power band in most engines and after a remap on a turbo model is one of the best tuning options out there for you . <p> The 2000 VAG 1.8T engine is one of the most tunable engines around and can be fairly easily tweaked to push out in excess of 300 BHP with no need for internal strengthening ( but a larger turbo/injector upgrade and remap would be essential to achieve this ) . <p> Many of our members have got power figures in excess of 200bhp with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly notable engines in the golf range was the the V6 4motion and the V6 R32 which produced 204 and 240 BHP respectively . <p> The later 2.0TFsi is a worthy successor to the 1.8T and has a wide range of options for it so we suggest you read our 2.0Tfsi tuning guide for more information on this . <p> The Golf has a reputation for being a reliable car , and certainly holds its resale value well . <p> Check for a full service history when buying one though as the oil changes must be adhered to , especially on the turbo models . <p> There are many reports of sludge problems in the 1.8 models if oil changes are not carried out or the wrong grade is used see our 1.8T article for a comprehensive guide to this engine . <p> The TDI engines have improved considerably over the years , and the Golf TDI engines represent one of the best economy to power ratios for an engine in current production . <p> Many consider the 1.9 TDi as the best diesel engine VW produced but the later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar ( sorry for that terrible pun ! ) and make superb projects to work on . With a remap , power can reach 220 BHP ( depending on the base spec ) , and you can still expect 50 plus MPG . Throw in a turbo upgrade and you can reach power figures of around 300bhp but you 'll find traction an issue at these levels . <p> The mk5 Golf actually looks smaller than the previous model , but in actual fact has a slightly larger wheelbase . The wider hips seem to make the car seem smaller but dramatically improve the handling . Much of the handling criticisms leveled at its predecessor , the mk IV , have been redressed and the golf GTI is once again regarded as a driver 's car . <p> Keep wheel rims sizes to 18 inches or less for optimum handling on all Golf 's - 17 's seem to offer the best compromise of handling weight and looks in our opinion . <p> The body panels in the Golf are very substantial and solid so if you were going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carbon fibre bonnet and front wings . <p> The front wheel drive versions will perform better if you fit a limited slip differential , or a semi locking diff as found on the A3 T Sport . Lower gear ratios will also improve acceleration . <p> Engine swaps are very popular with our members and we have seen everything from the recent 2.0Tfsi and the older 1.8T engines going into early golfs to VR6 engine conversions .

Aim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible initially .

@@24423427 @4423427/ <h> How can i make my car quicker ? <p> I have an audi a3 2.0 tdi 04 plate , looking to make it quicker .. but i 'm not too sure where to start ? <p> i put a chip in it yesterday .. bought off ebay for -80 .. supposed to add 30 bhp and 90 torque ... made a little difference but i think i 'd like to hit around 250bhp if possible .. any advice you guys can give me is apriciated .. <p> Hey &amp; welcome ! : bigsmile : First , what exactly was the chip you bought off ebay ? <p> The basic mods would be a nice good quality panel filter , a proven sports exhaust system &amp; then a re-map will see some good gains I would imagine . There is other magic doohickary you can do with diesel engines but I 'll let those in the know explain more . <p> I would also dump the " Chip " , it is probably just a little inline box that lies about the air temps causing the car to overfuel and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a good quality custom remap . <p> Drop in a larger turbo as well for extra boost , getting it to 350 will require quite a bit of money , a remap should deliver a 30% power gain , reliably and on standard internals . <p> It 's just not IMO worth putting a full induction kit on a TD engine . If you want to improve the flow then a panel filter should be just fine . It will free up the top end a bit but I do n't think you 'd really notice the extra power . <p> Premium diesel fuel i hear is a good way to make your car feel alot better to drive , plus might add a horsepowers and make it more responsive as well as being kinder to your engine . Might be worth trying a tankful to see how it is , if you do n't notice much difference then go back to the regular stuff . A very good modification in that if it does n't work your money is n't entirely wasted . <p> I find premium petrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to make the car much more responsive and a little more powerful through the entire rev range . Also makes a difference to fuel economy too . <p> I presume premium diesel will have the same effects . Someone correct me if i 'm wrong . <p> As stated many times , get rid of the ebay chip , I do n't  believe one second that it gives an extra 30bhp n 90lb/ft . It will be more like 5bhp n 10lb/ft and a whole load of problems in the future . Remaps are your best option for diesels . You get a bag load of power as well as better fuel economy . <p> I 'm a dealer for celtic tuning and the maps they provide in my opinion are one of the best and I 'm not just saying that because I deal for them , I would n't be doing it if I did n't think they were good . <p> The gains depend on which bhp model you have and whether it 's a CR or PD engine . Is yours the 138bhp CR or PD or the 167bhp CR or PD ? 
@@24423428 @4423428/ 38227 @qwx238227 <h> Drag racing car setup <p> " A bit of a Drag " <p> This article is merely an introduction to those new to the world of Drag racing , looking to convert a street car for the drag strip . We have a whole forum dedicated to drag racing where drag racers can swap ideas and talk technical together with everything from engine tuning , fuel selection , and transmission mods to oil selection . <p> Racing on the road is dangerous , illegal and stupid . We at TorqueCars do not condone or promote illegal street racing . All drag racing advice here is to be used on the track in an organized event . <p> Do you really want to tune your car for quarter mile acceleration ? First off you need to decide what your budget is and which you 'd rather do , 1/4 mile strip or circuit because you will not be able to have both . <p> A circuit car needs to be well balanced and handle well before you worry about going fast , and a circuit car needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull out of corners easily and have a higher top speed for those straights . <p> A drag car just needs to get from 0 to top speed as quick as possible . Top speed does n't have to be an extra ordinary figure to get a good 1/4 mile time , you just need to get there quickly . You may be up against a car that has a top speed 20 mph higher than yours , but if it takes an extra 4-5 seconds to get there you will probably win . <p> When building a drag car it needs to be as light as possible and as powerful as possible , whether it handles and goes round corners is not important but you do need maximum traction at the driven wheels . If you wheel spin you loose time . <p> After your first quarter mile run you will be totally addicted . <p> Turbos are alright on the strip as long as you remember to keep your rev 's up , and that includes when you launch . This means screaming the motor off the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and torque steer which will loose you valuable time . <p> With a N/A motor you have more control over your launch as you do n't have to worry what your boost is doing but you have a harder task getting the top end power . Superchargers are best as you have constant boost across the rev range giving you more launch control and good top end power . <p> Building a car for the circuit and putting it down the strip with a little squirt of nitrous to help your time is probably your best bet . It is not possible to build a car specifically to do both and you can not run a strip car round a circuit because it wo n't corner , but you can run a circuit car down the strip it just wo n't be as quick as a purpose built drag car . <p> 1 ) Do you want the car to remain very comfortable , or are you prepared to throw all luxuries out the window and have it raw . <p> 2 ) How much do you have/want to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little or build it on a shoe string . <p> The order TorqueCars would recommend tuning your drag car is this : <p> a ) Get your engine first . Strip it down and make sure it is all OK . While you are there replace your piston rings , all engine bearings and oil seals . It may be worth fitting a high pressure oil pump too as the engine will get a lot of punishment . It will also be a good idea to fit any high performance parts while you 're here too . <p> b ) Get the car of your choice , put bigger brakes on it and put the engine in . While doing the engine swap , get rid of the power steering and fit a manual rack . they weigh less and reduce drag on the engine . When you fit the exhaust put an extra flange joint just behind the engine so when you 're at the strip you can remove it . Once the engine is in drive the car round gently for 500 miles not exceeding 3000rpm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills and really work the engine at different loads ( keeping under 3000 rpm ) . Once you have done 500 miles do an oil and filter change and that 's your engine sorted ( in theory ) . Fit a good roll cage too . <p> c ) I would n't bother lowering your car but I would put harder shocks on it to hold the wheels more firmly on the ground so they do n't spin . <p> d ) Get a spare pair of wide wheels to use your strip tyres on to go on the driven axle . You wo n't be able to use on the road as they are usually too wide for a UK car and are very expensive ( and usually slick ) . For free rolling axle , I would use standard skinny steel rims , The thinner the better to reduce rolling resistance . <p> e ) Go through the car and work out what you want/need and do n't want/need . Back seat , carpet and underlay , door cards , roof lining , stereo and speakers , Spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger seat ( also when you 're at the strip ) can all come out . The less weight you can carry the better your and the faster you will go . Anything else unimportant that you can think of can come out too . If you can replace the doors , wings , bonnet and boot lid with ether Fiberglas or carbon fibre panels as they are lighter and replace what glass you can with Plexiglass for the same reason . Do n't bother fitting spoilers/body kits as they will not reduce drag enough to worry about only make the car weigh more . <p> f ) A low ratio gearbox would be a good idea too , possibly use one from a smaller engined version of your car , ie a 1.3 box on a 1.8 or a 1.6 box on a 2.0l ) . You will lose some top end by doing this but you will get there a whole lot quicker , which like I say , is the important thing . Get your 0-60 time down to about 5-6 seconds with gear ratios that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be able to get a 12 sec 1/4 mile . <p> I think that pretty much covers it . Once you have done this it is a case of fiddling with the car at the strip to try and improve your times . The biggest problem you will have with a fwd car is holding the power down and not spinning off the line . <p> How to avoid Torque-steer : <p> 1 ) Use a RWD car . <p> 2 ) Do n't be so aggressive when putting the power down . Most high powered cars ca n't floor it off the line as you lose traction and time . Yes you need to get the throttle to the floor as fast as possible but in a controlled way , so you accelerate as fast as possible , keeping traction at all time and not inducing torque steer . <p> This article was contributed by Fingers - a forum member .

@@24423429 @4423429/ <h> Pugeot 106 clutch cable replacement <p> I finally finished replacing the clutch cable on my brothers pug106 , it 's not technically difficult just incredibly fiddly but still best done as a two man job to keep up morale as it took us 4 days . The worst thing is the Haynes manual only considers it a one spanner/novice job ! Some people have had luck in doing this in 5 minutes some took hours and many clutch cables . Here 's some information and a guide which might make the process easier for you ... <p> The clutch is basically a disc which in the default state is pressed up against the engine flywheel by strong springs , when you put your foot on the clutch it pivots and pulls the clutch cable up and this moves the clutch release lever and moves the clutch away from the flywheel . Disconnecting the engine from the gear box and allowing you to change gears without matching rev speed to gear-road speed . <p> You do n't need it , say if you are in the outback without one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a rolling start ) then to change gear slip into neutral let the revs fall the slide into higher gear and visa versa for down changing . <p> To get access to it first remove the battery , disconnect it 's leads undo the retaining flap . Then also remove the 3 nuts(+washers) holding the plate to further improve access . To remove the cable form the release lever pull it back then slide it out there is a gap for the cable it 's self to go through . and tug it out of the mounting bracket old cables where the rubber is vulcanised can be hard to remove cause it does n't squeeze through as easily . <p> There is a shallow groove to guide the cable through the bulkhead . Push as much of the clutch cable up into the cockpit by pressing on the end so the inner cable moves into the tube . From inside the car in the foot well attach a STRONG wire to the head of the cable . Remove it form all the mounting brackets around the engine ( if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fits through in the bulkhead . Now you have a guide wire to help you replace the cable . THIS IS VERY USEFUL ! <p> It 's quite useful to also remove the driver seat to gain better access to the foot well and the top of the peddle which is very poor . The seat is secured by 4 star bolts on the rails , two at the front and two at the rear . Also there is a cable attacked to the bottom of the seat you should undo . Slide the seat back and lay it flat the undo the front bolts and lay it forwards and slide the seat forwards and undo the rear bolts . It should now lift out . To replace it first fix the outside ( door side ) bolts and the inside ones because of the way the mechanism works . <p> Grease the top of the new cable and attach it to the guide wire , now with one person inside the footwell on their backs and one person in the engine compartment feeding the cable through the bulkhead groove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's luck of the draw if your first time works , wiht the driver seat in place ( how we did it ) you quickly develop back problems so remove it from the begining ! <p> Once you get it through you just need to hook it on , this is also fiddly but the best way to do it is to feed alot of it through then lying on your front ( only possible if the seat has been removed ) put your hand high up over the clutch pedal and literally just hook it on . It 's worth spending some time learning the anatomy of the clutch pedal before you try so you know what needs to be done . <p> If you manage to get it on then return to the engine compartment and hook it into the mount and back onto the release lever . I used a spanner to gain leverage to push the release lever so that I could hook it back up , then go for a test drive ! <p> Notes : #Oh ! And we used a auto adjusting clutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove slack to ensure the hook is securely attached to the pedal . #Make a note of the proper routing of the cable it can block gear changes if it impenges on the linkages . <p> I am replacing my cable now .. One of the problems , I think , was the fact that the old one which snapped after just a couple of months was routed the wrong way to the bulkhead . ( My car is a deisel 106 from 1995 ) It is very awkward but so far I am managing to do it on my own without taking the seat out . But bear in mind the cable MUST go behind the horizontal steering lever rod/link thing and not in front as my last one did because this will , I think , effectively shorten it and put it under severe tension ! <p> Another thing to think about . I replaced it with one you can adjust yourself from the clutch end , there is plenty of adjustment on these with two nuts and about 2 inches of threaded rod , prefer this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppesed to be self adjusting , somehow I do n't  trust them ! ! <p> Do n't know what all the fuss is about . the hardest part was getting the old cable off the pedal . you do n't need to take out the front seat . Release the dust cover off the cable where passes through the bulkhead ( engine compartment ) then using blocks of wood raise the clutch pedal until it is right up , the end of the cable where it hooks onto the pedal can be seen poking through into the engine bay then simply unhook it . Putting the new cable in . Hook it on the pedal first then remove the blocks under the pedal then push home the plastic bulkhead fixing , route the cable as it was . To get the cable into the bulkhead feed it in behind the steering rod through a wider space to the right of the rod . Easy , no laying your back , no wires , no stress , no effing and beeing . Whole job took less than one hour .

Then in 1999 Audi saw fit to listen to their critics and add a 5 door version . The early models were a superb effort and good clean MK1 A3 's still command a good price on the used market today . <p> The later Mk2 improved further adding more interior space ( the interior of the MK2 A3 is the same as in the A4 ! ) , then in 2013 the model was further refined and revised winning Audi many awards and accolades . <p> Handling and performance easily rivaled the best in its class . The range topping S3 which was revised in 2001 was incredibly lively and fun to drive and addressed most of the unfair criticisms of the earlier S3 model . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic handling and performance . They make superb tuning projects and are great track day cars . <p> The A3 is the Audi attack on the Golf market done in an upmarket Audi way . The A3 has very nice handling and a wide range of engine choices making it a great tuning project choice . <p> On the Mk2 but we would choose the petrol 1.8T everytime , on the Mk2 A3 's P7 we would go with the 2.0 TFSi or the 2.0 TDI 140 as these both offer great returns when tuned . 170 turbo diesels can be a real pain if the fuel injectors start playing up and they have the dreaded DPF filters , the smaller twincharged cars are pretty maxed out and do n't offer much when tuned . <p> Complaints . The early pre 2003 models had little rear legroom and essentially this restricted the rear for young passengers . Boot space is generally very good . Some owners of the 1.8T engine reported problems with early coil packs , although these will most certainly have been replaced by now . <p> Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clog up and total engine failure so adhere closely to the specified engine servicing regimen and you should be fine . The model range was later revised in 2003 addressing the problem of rear passenger leg room . <p> Gear change into 1st and sometimes into 2nd can be a little notchy at times when rushed on a cold gearbox combined with short journeys . A quick shift kit can improve this . Check that the gearbox oil level is topped up and do n't fit thick car mats . <h> Audi A3 engine Tuning <p> In a 1.8T head the exhaust uses 2 valves and the intake uses the 3 . This makes the exhaust gas exhalation a weak spot in the engine . Enlarging the exit ports , doing a 3 angle valve job on the ports and flowing the head will greatly help improve the ariflow and should be considered essential if you are after large power gains . <p> The later 2.0 TFSi engines reportedly suffer from cam follower wear and the intake clogging up with carbon . See our 2.0 TFSi article for details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upgrade path on all cars . The KO4 makes sense if you have the KO3 turbo , even diesels will benefit from a turbo upgrade , see our engine specific articles for tips on which turbo 's to choose on these . Hybrid turbos are also an option . <p> Fitting an induction kit or panel filter to the 2.0TFSi engine will give a more relaxed drive , the engine will hold revs more easily and you 'll find more top end power . <p> The earlier A3 is prone to lift off oversteer thanks in part to it 's torsion beam rear suspension . This can be a blessing or a curse depending on your driving style but this little trait has got me out of trouble a number of times . <p> The Twincharged engines offer a lot of performance but are not that economical unless driven extremely frugally , and they do n't offer massive returns on tuning them . <h> Handling mods . <p> Handling on later editions of the A3 have been considerably improved . Fit poly bushings and anti roll bars to tighten things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension bushes should be checked if you have a rattle from the rear . This can be quite a big job to do and requires a special tool but your handling will be greatly compromised if you leave the worn bushes on the car . <p> You can use polyurethane bushes but we would suggest the main rear bushes are left as VAG spec rubber ones . <p> The best tires I have found for my Mk1 A3 is the Goodyear Eagle F1 which , although they wear quite quickly they do add a lot of cornering grip and feel . <p> The Mk2 A3 work well with Pirelli Pzero Rossa , and Continental conti sport 5 or 6 . <p> The 2.0T FSI engine is quite remappable but early engines were prone to a few weaknesses which thankfully Audi have now sorted out . <p> A remap on the 2.0T FSI can push the power to over 250bhp easily . With a bigger or hybrid turbo you can see power figures in the order of 350 to 400bhp . <p> Fitting a twin intercooler to the A3 like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of heat soak . A front mounted intercooler is better but will require a different intake , like that on the 225bhp TT where the inlet is on the right and this makes it easier to connect a front mounted intercooler . <p> A strut brace will help to give a little more front end rigidity . <p> Brake upgrades are a good idea . You can actually source some nice brakes from the VW parts bin . The 1.6 will probably have the 256 or 288mm disc measure them to check this before buying an upgrade . The 2.8 Golf uses 312mm and the R32 334mm both of which make an excellent upgrade path for your A3 . <p> The S3 , RS3 and RS4 are also fitted with bigger discs and providing the stud pattern is correct and you have the right clearance within your wheels you could use these as your upgrade . If your A3 has the 256 or 288mm discs then it has different hub carriers and wont allow you fit the larger disks . If this is your situation then you should look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Seat Leon Cupra . You can usually pick these up from a breakers yard quite cheaply . <p> Another option for a more radical upgrade is to fit Porsche 996 calipers on the car and go with a Porsche brake setup . <p> Avoid the 1.6 liter engine as it feels too underpowered . The 1.8T and later 2.0TFSi are the best propositions although the 2.0 TDI 's and all Quattro models give a good mix of power and economy . <p> A remap is your first and most effective choice of a mod if you have an A3 fitted with a turbo . The right map can make a massive difference to the cars performance and handling . <p> Join us in the forum to swap tuning tips with other Audi owners and browse the tuning section for tips and the latest modifications to get the most out of your Audi A3 tuning project . <p> This @ @ @ @ @qwx238234 
@@24423431 @4423431/ <h> All you need to know about the VAG 2.0 TDi <p> " Tuning , problems weak spots and complete upgrade guide . " <p> The VAG group 2.0 Diesel engines are very popular and have had many revisions and updates over the years . We shall try to map out the differences between the engines and identify potential faults and issues with them . <p> All modern engines have weak spots , by pointing these out we hope to prepare the buyer to spot potential issues early on . <p> We are not trying to make out that these engines are particularly unreliable or full of issues - I recently bought one after doing my research carefully . You should note that generally newer engines have had the faults engineered out completely . <h> Engine codes and specs for the 2.0 TDI ( 140 &amp; 170 bhp version ) <p> Pre 2008 engines are PD ( Pumpe Dnse ) based and given a BKD , BKP ( Mainly in the Passat ) or BMM , BMN , BMR and BRD engine code . <p> The VAG group 2.0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what to spot are reliable and have lots of tuning potential . <p> After 2008 CR ( common rail ) engines came in and had CBAB and CBBB engine codes . The common rail engines are superior to the PD engines although there were a few minor teething problems on early engines . All were Euro 5 rated so came with DPF . <p> These 2008 engines were also implicated in the 2015 VAG group emissions scandal where the software would detect test conditions and reduce the emissions . <h> Faults and problems on these engines . <p> The early Siemens piezo injectors on the 170 had a fault , and would just fail causing the engine to cut out . Most of these have been recalled or replaced now so it should n't be an issue anymore . <p> There are plenty of reports of DPF issues requiring a dealer regen . If you drive it hot , go on long journeys and use high quality fuel you should have no problem at all . However if you do lots of short journeys then you are best advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( *removal of the DPF is not legal in some countries . ) <p> There are also reports of a faulty fan controller where fan does n't switch off , eventually draining the battery and potentially burning out the fan . <p> The 2.0 engines have a lumpy idle which is something you generally have to live with . However a faulty DMF , Injector failures or issues with the EGR flow rate can also cause a very lumpy idle or misfire . <p> BKP engines in particular have an issue with the oil pump drive gears which were subject to a recall and there are reports of turbo failures on these engines . <p> Most longitudinal PD engines have the balance shaft module . Those engines suffer from two problems , the chain tensioner that breaks and causing the balance shaft module to stop working including the oil pump . <p> The second problem is in the module itself , how it drives the oil pump , this is done by a small hexagon that also breaks because of the wear . <p> VAG has tried to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that seems to be a working solution . They also upgraded the size of the hexagon so it should be stronger and it is , its now failing after more mileage . Still a very problematic issue that needs to be addressed . When failing the oil pressure drops immediately and the engine breaks beyond repair . <p> The last issue , the hexagon , is still present in newer CR engines , but this time not just in the Passat , A4/A6 and SuperB . The only engine we are aware of that does n't  use the balance shaft module is the 110HP 2.0 TDI(CBDC) . <p> Luckily enough there is a solution , for the PD and CR engines . It is replacing the balance shaft module for a chain driven oil pump as seen in other TDI engines . The 140hp 2.0 8v PD TDI ( BMM ) for example has that oil pump and it has been flawless . <h> Cylinder head cracking . <p> There is a reference number to the right of the cylinder head underneath the fuel lines 03G 103 351 B or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of this . If you have A you are virtually guaranteed to suffer a cracked cylinder head . The B is a little stronger but a few of these have still cracked . C is the one to go for and there are very few if any reports of cylinder heads cracking . <p> Keep a close eye on engines with the A or B codes , particularly if there are any faults or issues arising . <p> DMFs are fairly weak and will frequently fail . If yours should go we would suggest getting a high torque flywheel from Sachs as the price is similar and they are substantially stronger . <h> Tuning <p> There are few major differences between the 140 and 170 engines . In fact a 140 engine can be upgraded to 170bhp with a remap ( in our opinion it is a better choice than buying a 170 ! ) but 170-180 is the upper limit of the 140 's turbo . The main differences are the turbo and injectors . If you stayed on the standard 140 injectors but fitted a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you need to increase the injectors . <p> Taking a 140 beyond 170 bhp requires a larger turbo , TorqueCars suggest the GTB2056VK is definitely less laggy than the GTB2260VK due to its smaller compressors , but it can still flow to around the 260-275 bhp . Used turbos from the 170bhp engine are a good , cheap , viable upgrade option if you are looking at the 200bhp mark . <p> Remaps for the 2.0 TDI engines : <p> The 140 can be lifted to 170 on a software upgrade alone but to go beyond this you will need to look at the turbo . A remapped 140 is less laggy and more nimble than a 170 due to the smaller turbo . It 's clear that the headline power figures are only half the story and you should take into account the general feel of the engine and torque band . <p> A remap on the 170 bhp engines can comfortably attain 210-225 bhp . Again going higher than this will require a turbo upgrade or hybrid turbo . Remember that larger turbos are generally more laggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you spec the right turbo upgrade you should n't have this issue . <p> Cam timing adjustments are quite easy to perform on most of these engines as the Cams are fitted with vernier pulleys . Moving the cam from advance to retard slightly will alter the peak power zone of the car . Only play with this if you know what you 're doing . If you tweak it too far the car may fail to start when cold so just back off a little from the setting you 've selected . <p> Advancing or retarding the cam will push the power band down or up the RPM range so you can set the car up to match your preferred driving style . The Bosch ECU 's are pretty protective of the engine so mistakes in cam timing selection are not usually going to have dramatic consequences . <p> Removing the EGR will not make a noticeable performance difference . At full ( WOT ) throttle it does not open and it helps reduce fuel consumption and throttle response at low RPM speeds and lessens the work the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can however make tickover a little lumpy and has been blamed for carbon build up in the engine but if you use a good quality fuel and cleaner ( like BG244 ) you should not really have an issue . <p> 250bhp is a sensible limit for most drivers looking for a daily driver . <p> The engines are quite strong though and you 'll find that around the 350 bhp mark is the safe maximum power a standard block can handle , a lot depends on the driving style and maintenance though . <p> Power delivery and traction over 220bhp can be an issue as well so it would be worth investing in a good LSD and sports tires . <p> You will need to uprate the injectors around the 250bhp mark but this varies depending on which injectors you have fitted as standard to your car . <p> Most drivers report that the clutch begins to slip around the 420-430Nm mark and there is a torque limiter placed on the DSG gearbox . <p> Solid flywheels are not a great option on the 2.0TDi - it really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People who have fitted lighter solid flywheels have often regretted their choice . <p> PLEASE HELP US COMPLETE THIS PAGE , If we 've missed out some details or you have some tips to pass on please use the comments section below to let us know . <p> Hi there really good article , concise and informative .

Thnx M <p> This is great info , thanks for posting this , i 'm from the east coast of Canada and there is not much info on this out there locally or on the web . I was also wondering if you swapped the turbo from a Cr140 for a turbo from the 170 and had the same tune , would you have to get a new tune after the swap turbo swap ? <p> I have an 06 PD140 BKD which went in for a remap . The before and after showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish work that one out .. ? How could my car be labelled 140 from the factory but after 9 years have gained 14.9 bhp ? Let me know your thoughts . <p> Dyno readings are not that accurate , they measure power at the wheel and then using maths estimate the flywheel power figure . Taking the before and after figures you can however see the power gain you achieved with the remap . If you put your car on a calibrated dyno reading the wheel horse power you 'll probably get figures around 20-30bhp lower than this . A 140bhp engine is only really putting down about 120hp on the road at best . <p> I have a vw passat 2.0 tdi with bkp engine but the oil pump has failed and engine dead . I have found a bkd engine that I want to replace it with . Will the Bkd engine work nicely in my passat ? Please help ! <p> If you have n't sorted this already I can provide you with a answer .. Yes it does , just a few modifications .. The bkp uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swap the injectors over marking up what order they were in including the injector loom ( buy new injector seal kits ) . Another one is on the back of the block there is a half shaft bearing housing what needs to be to be removed also the oil cooler pipes are the other way around I found . Apart from that it all just bolts in . One major plus is the bkd does n't  have a balance shaft modual at all .. Just a chain driven oil pump similar to the 1.9 8v pd engines . All of this is from recent experience as my cam belt tensioner stud snapped and ruined the head <p> Also mine had the hot start issue what is sorted with a hot start map , where the starter motors speed is turned up as the injectors do n't  work until the engine is rotating at 200rpm and then a remap taking it to a predicted 180 , such a lovely smooth , fast delivery of power with a good map . <p> Dear all , Great info site ! Thanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engine which dodge references differently and it has been a pain trying to understand which actual VW engine it is . Dodge calls it a " 2.0 TDI I4 Cyl DOHC ( ECE ) " also known as " RX040870AC " possibly also " 68040870AB " anyone knows what VW engine that actually corresponds to on the VAG list ? I 'm Looking for a replacement and new from Dodge is prohibitive . <p> The thermostat of the DSG Gearbox is often broken so it cools the engine too and both never get warm but most car workshops only change the thermostat of the engine without success and forget the thermostat of the DSG Gearbox ! The engine and the gearbox need the operating temperature and the DPF also cause without temperature the cleaning process does n't  start ! <p> my BRE EGR cooler just blew up and totaled the engine . Since I have to get a new base engine + Turbo + EGR cooler and can only reuse my recently rebuilt injectors , then I was thinking whether it would be wise to upgrade the engine to its latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , but is the BVG the newest engine in the BRE lineage and is it just a drop in replacement ? <p> Remove the plastic top cover , and timing belt outer cover .

@@24423432 @4423432/ <h> What is the difference between , car wax and polish ? <p> " Getting the best shine with wax or polish . " <p> The two things are very different but sadly most people are unaware and have probably been using the wrong product for years . <p> Polish is mildly abrasive so it effectively sands the surface of paint removing oxidization and small scratches . Whereas Wax is protective coating on the paint which fills in the dimples , dents and imperfections of the paint causing it to shine . <p> TorqueCars note that some manufacturers confuse the terms polish and wax when labeling their products . As wax is just a coating you will still see most of the imperfections in the paint beneath so you should view waxing is a final finishing job only on good quality paint . <p> Polishing is only something you need to perform when the paint finish has become flat , oxidized or scratched . Years of sunlight , bird lime , dirt and grime will degrade the paint work finish on a car . Red cars seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paint turns a dull pink color ( this is caused by oxidation ) . <p> Determine if the paint defects are above or below the surface by dragging your finger over the imperfection , this will determine if a wax or polish should be used . <p> WARNING : Each time you use polish you will be removing a small layer of paint ( your cloth will show up this color ) . Do its too often and you will go through to the undercoat and the only way of fixing that is to respray the car . <p> You need to determine if the paint defect is above or below the surface . After washing the car sweep your fingers over the paint and if it feels smooth any defects are below the surface and if it feels rough , pitted or slightly sticky it indicates above surface imperfections . <p> Below surface defects are dealt with by polishing . Most above surface defects like traffic film , tar , bug guts and the like are best treated through washing and then by using a clay bar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a simply a case of wiping the warm clay over the paint with a supplied lubricant to trap the dirt particles . It can be a time consuming process but it really makes a big difference to the finish of your paint especially on lighter color cars which seem to show every slight imperfection . <p> After a clay bar treatment look closely at the paint . If there are still imperfections visible they will generally need to be polished out . Any stone chips and scratches should be touched up at this point before applying the wax because paint will not adhere very well to a waxed surface . <h> How to use a car polish . <p> To polish the car apply the cutting paste/polish to a soft cloth and rub in a circular motion . Use plenty of polish and make sure the cloth does not dry up . If you are removing a scratch or specific flaw include the surrounding area , aiming to fade in the freshly cut paint to the old paint and make sure that the freshly polish paint does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole panel if the paint is badly faded in order to match it in . <p> It is best done in gentle stages because you only want to cut away the smallest amount of paint to remove the imperfections . Although an electric polisher will make the job a lot quicker , it is very easy to remove too much paint . Wax can usually be more effectively applied with an electric polisher and a fantastic finish is possible in a very short time . <p> Many scratches from keys , scrapes in car parks and other damage can be almost completely removed with polishing as these photographs show . <p> A nasty scrape is rendered virtually invisible with a bit of polishing . So , before you take the car to a body shop for a respray quote have a go at polishing out the damage and see what the true extent of the damage is . <p> For scratches you should use a more abrasive polish than you would for a general paint work mop up . <p> Many thanks to forum member Freddie for his photographs which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polish you really can make a big difference to the finish of your car . Generally wax a car every 3-6 months and polish the car only when the paint becomes dull as outlined in the method above . Please join the TorqueCars friendly chat forums and chat with other car enthusiasts about all aspects of detailing , car care and car ownership . <p> Our favourite wax is Collonite 476 - it lasts a long time and gives a good deep protection .

@@24423433 @4423433/ <h> Turbo upgrades with aftermarket turbos <p> Turbochargers make a massive difference to an engine and there are many upgrade options to choose from so we 'll examine your options here . <p> Big turbos make more power but this increases the wear an tear on the engine and heat becomes a big problem . <p> The turbo charger in a petrol engine can reach 1100 degrees and will spin at speeds of 100,000 to 150,000rpm . On some setups and new models of turbo you can double those speeds . These speeds require lubrication , heat management and perfect balance . The biggest risk to a turbo is a failed oil seal , blocked oil feed or a worn bearing . <p> To upgrade your turbo you have 2 paths . <p> Fit a hybrid turbo ( based on your OEM casing but with internals from another turbo or with a different design ) <p> Fit an uprated turbo , these tend to be larger , and will usually require additional pipework and effort to get them to fit . <p> The first option pretty much just bolts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to remap to get the full benefit although most hybrid turbos will just about run ok on standard maps at lower boost levels . <p> Attention is given to the air intake aperture shape and compressor wheel and turbine profile . These can spin faster , compress more air or give boost at high or low RPM figures so you have a to choose the options to match your requirements . <p> Track day cars work best at high RPM and high boost levels with large turbos , road cars need low down power so generally a smaller turbo offers a flatter torque curve without much lag . <p> A hybrid turbo will also have stronger bearings ( ball bearings ) , be better balanced and have stronger seals . This enhances reliability and boost from lower RPM levels . <p> Path 2 involves a more dramatic turbo design most people taking this route opt for large turbos which can be laggy low down but will almost double an engines power output . All aspects of the turbo are rebuilt and often additional oil pipes and cooling pipes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts formed into a hybrid unit . <p> Conversion to twin charging ( supercharger and turbo ) , twin turbos and single large turbo replacements all count as turbo upgrades with each giving totally different boost characteristics . <p> For best results the ECU ( engine control unit ) should be remapped so the characteristics of the turbo can be taken into account and maximum power can be extracted . More air in the engine will also require more fuel and depending on how much extra power you are wanting to extract you will also need to uprate the injectors and the fuel pump . <p> TorqueCars recommend you consult a specialist tuner outlining your exact requirements so they can source a suitable turbo profile and map for you . <p> Here are some of the options and goals you will need to think about . <p> Generally you need to choose the power curve ( do you want a large peak power figure on a narrow rpm band or are you looking for a wide torque band across the rev range . Are you after less lag low down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) -but this will be at the cost of a slightly lower peak power ? <p> Alternatively a high headline power figure will usually mean a larger amount of lag at lower revs as the turbo spools up . <p> A large turbo will tend to give a big amount of lag at low revs but provide a massive power hike at high revs . A twin turbo setup and good quality boost controller can minimize the amount of lag at low revs and give a good power gain throughout the rev range . It it also possible to have a small turbo and large turbo set up with a controller to use the small turbo at low revs and kick in the larger one as the revs increase . <p> Quad turbo installations are also being introduced by tuning houses along with standard OEM cars that run a supercharger and turbo simultaneously . We are also seeing various types of high-tech components such as variable geometry turbines , ceramics fins and ceramic bearings and ceramic coatings on or in the turbo housing as well as cryogenically treated turbo components @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forced induction . <p> Most types of turbo engine including diesel turbos can be upgraded in this way and you can double the power - but this is rarely safe on standard internals forged components and balancing the engine will help with reliability . ( NB : Turbo diesel engines run cooler that petrol counterparts so the turbos tend to be larger and therefore have more scope for modification as an OEM spec unit . ) Diesel engine turbochargers run at lower exhaust flow rates so tend to be physically smaller than a petrol engine . <p> Most turbo engines can cope on standard internals with a power hike of 30% - you could even push the power levels up in the lower RPM without moving the peak power figure and retain an engines reliability . <p> As with all modifications the higher the power gain the lower the reliability of the engine and the greater the maintenance costs . <p> Uprate the fueling and may well need a custom boost controller and BOV . Whatever option you go for we strongly recommend an upgrade to a ball bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tolerate higher speeds and hotter temperatures and are generally more reliable than the thrust bearing types of turbo . <p> If you want to learn more about turbo applications for your car please join our friendly car forums where you can chat with like minded car enthusiasts and talk technical . 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234 
@@24423434 @4423434/ <h> 300zx Tuning <p> The fact is that the engine is able to handle a great deal more power without any internal modifications . <p> There are a lots of 300zx enthusiasts around and despite the rarity of the cars there are still quite a few in concourse condition . <p> When buying a 300zx look for a full service history and a book of receipts . <p> Thankfully the 300zx is reliable , at least compared with other similarly powerful cars and there is little to go wrong . It would appear that Nissan have substantially over machined the engine ( particularly the twin turbo VG30DETT ) . Our 300zx owners have done some fairly extensive modifications ranging from major engine work to complete styling overhauls . <p> Let 's get an overview of the tuning options open to you for the 300zx . <p> The 300zx is sadly overlooked because of its scarcity . It has a bullet proof engine and is just begging to be tuned up . <p> The engine choices are based on the 3.0 V6 block with a NASP engine outputting 220bhp , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never put into the 300zx ( which increases power to 255bhp ) but the 300ZX did come with the amazing twin turbo engine with a massive 300bhp output on the 5 speed version . <p> ( Interestingly the automatic transmission had power limited to 279bhp . ) The Twin Turbo VG30DETT engine is TorqueCars tuners choice and gives plenty of scope for power gains . <p> We have seen race prepared 300 ZX twin turbos hit power figures of upto 600bhp but this takes a major rebore and rebuild of the engine and plenty of internal strengthening ! A good target for the home 300zx TT tuner is the 400bhp mark . <p> The following mods are usually carried out by our members , decide how far you want to go before you begin . <p> Handling modifications are usually your first port of call for the 300zx . We suggest that you fit uprated suspension and lower the car by 30-35mm ( good quality coilovers are the best choice ) . Larger drops require arch work - especially on models fitted with oversized alloy wheels . <h> Nissan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one of the best power mod you can do mechanically to your engine particulalrly on the NASP VG30DE . When pushing up the power you will need to pay careful attention to the fueling . Quite simply put , more power needs more fuel and air . <p> When raising power by 50% you really need to consider the fueling . To get sufficient fuel you may need to uprate the injectors on your engine . When increasing your fueling you will also need to get a bigger fuel pump to supply it.You can improve the 300ZX response to the throttle with a Fuel pressure boost valve . A revised intake plenum was available on the NASP version of the engine used in the Maxima and this would be an easy mod for the VG30E giving another 5-7bhp . <p> In the VG30DETT the standard bore size is 87mm and if you are lucky enough to have a perfect block this can be increased to a maximum of 89mm which will take your cc to 3148cc . If you go for a big overbore you should get the block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperfections and stress areas which would restrict the amount of cylinder enlargement . ) <p> The twin turbo engines respond really well to a custom remap and you can get another 20-40% of a power gain . Adding a variable boost controller will allow in car adjustments to the power but for higher boost you need to get a remap . Your biggest problem with increasing the boost is engine knock . If you add water injection and use a high octane fuel you can up the boost further and see even larger power gains . <h> Nissan 300zx Intake and Exhaust . <p> The next area for modification is the intake and exhaust . The standard exhaust fitted by Nissan is actually a pretty good setup but power gains of around 5-9% are still possible with a full sports exhaust system . Most 300 ZX owners go with a sports exhaust purely for the sound . <p> An induction kit will help increase power by around 10bhp ( a little more on the Turbo engines ) - as long as you remember to get a cold air intake fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the engine but do not go too large . Stick to 2 to 2.5 inches for best results on the turbo engines and 2 inches on the NASP versions . <p> When you start tuning your 300zx you will find that the standard clutch starts to complain around the 400bhp mark so get an uprated clutch whilst you have the engine work carried out . <h> Nissan 300zx Wheel modifications . 38229 @qwx238229 <p> The larger you go the lower you top speed will be due to the change in your effective final drive ratio . Aim to keep the overall rolling diameter of the wheel the same as supplied from the factory . In all cases we do not recommend going above 18 inches and suggest that ( depending on your suspension setup ) stick with 17 's . <p> It would certainly benefit if you read ourtuning articles to get a full grasp of the pros and cons of each type of modification .

@@24423440 @4423440/ <h> Drift car setup and tuning <p> " Drifting - a tyre makers dream . " <p> For drifting you must have a rear wheel drive car or a four wheel drive car which has most of the power going to the rear wheels . Assuming you want to go into drifting on a budget you will need a car you can afford to break and repair easily . You will have lots of crashes , and mistakes when you are starting out so something like a Ford Sierra or an older American car will have a ready supply of cheap parts . <p> The only essential modifications for drifting are the Diff and suspension . Obviously weight reduction and increasing the power output of the engine would be nice but on a budget and while you are learning these are unimportant . <p> Patience , steady control and very deliberate slow throttle and steering controls are the difference between hacking a car around and drifting . <p> Let 's look first of all at the Diff ( limited slip diff or LSD hereafter ) and what it does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each end . When going in a straight line both cotton reels rotate at the same speed . But when on a curve the reel on the outside needs to rotate faster than the inner reel otherwise it will just be slipping over the surface and not gripping . <p> The LSD in a car sends the driven power proportionally to the wheels with more going to the wheel that needs to rotate a greater distance . The drawback of having a Slip Diff fitted is that when one wheel has no grip and spins all of the power goes to this wheel . It is something you 'll notice if you have one wheel in snow or mud and the other on a grippy surface leaving you effectively stuck . On a fast road you can get a sharper turning circle and put down more power if you moderate the rate of power going to each wheel . An LSD is exactly that and is usually specified as a ratio . For drifting you need a locking diff which encourages the back to slide over the road helping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diff will give the best of both worlds but can prove very expensive and is not something available for most cars so go with something like a 2 way diff with 4.788 final drive ratio . On a track or road the LSD will make a big difference to lap times and cornering speeds especially in low grip conditions like wet roads or when you are really hammering the engine so if you intend to do some track work get a slightly higher ratio diff . <p> The second area we shall consider is suspension modifications and setup for drifting and you will find detailed articles on TorqueCars tuning pages if you want to go into more detail . For drifting you do n't really negative camber , just lower it to get rid of body roll stiffen , unless your going into drifting seriously . As a rule , the more camber you roll on , the sharper the turn in will be.When you are starting out the body roll can actually give you a wider margin of error as well as reducing your overall control of the drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braces , poly bushes and firmer springs are worth considering but again not an essential . As you get better you will be able to set up the suspension to suit your personal driving style and preferences so if you go for an uprated suspension kit make sure it is adjustable or you will need to go out and buy another set of springs and dampers later on . <p> The Toyota Corolla AE86 is becoming the classic drift car of choice.They are a really good starter car for drifting the power band is just right , nicely balanced . They cost a fortune to buy now . I would stick fairly standard and go for lightening the car - this has better dividends in drifting . If you wanted to spend a bit of money we spoke with an AE86 drifter and asked about his AE86 setup . <p> Fantastic for drifting is the Toyota Corolla AE 86 ( Hachi Roku - Japanese for eight six. ) and speaking to a drifter we picked up the following tips and advice.He recommended a limited slip diff 2 way with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ APEXi SAFC II fuel controller too . Get more power from the car an engine swap was done and his selection of engine for drift competition use : - An AE92 big port engine ( red top ) Toda cams 304/288 duration 8.5mm lift . <p> Tein coilovers at the front but on the rear use something like the TRD 's blue SS 8 way adjustable shock . <p> Stick on some 9x14in rims with 185/60/14 Yoko A539 ( Check the tyre size I 'm not too sure of that for those rims but for drifting you certainly want a tight fit to the rim ! ) <p> You will also need a ready supply of tyres as you will get through them at an alarming rate . When you go to the track make sure you have a spare set of wheels and tyres so you can get home legally ! The final word has to be PRACTICE , PRACTICE and PRACTICE .

There is other magic doohickary you can do with diesel engines but I 'll let those in the know explain more . <p> I would also dump the " Chip " , it is probably just a little inline box that lies about the air temps causing the car to overfuel and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a good quality custom remap . <p> Drop in a larger turbo as well for extra boost , getting it to 350 will require quite a bit of money , a remap should deliver a 30% power gain , reliably and on standard internals . <p> It 's just not IMO worth putting a full induction kit on a TD engine . If you want to improve the flow then a panel filter should be just fine . It will free up the top end a bit but I do n't think you 'd really notice the extra power . <p> Premium diesel fuel i hear is a good way to make your car feel alot better to drive , plus might add a horsepowers and make it more responsive as well as being kinder to your engine . Might be worth trying a tankful to see how it is , if you do n't notice much difference then go back to the regular stuff . A very good modification in that if it does n't work your money is n't entirely wasted . <p> I find premium petrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to make the car much more responsive and a little more powerful through the entire rev range . Also makes a difference to fuel economy too . <p> I presume premium diesel will have the same effects . Someone correct me if i 'm wrong . <p> As stated many times , get rid of the ebay chip , I do n't  believe one second that it gives an extra 30bhp n 90lb/ft . It will be more like 5bhp n 10lb/ft and a whole load of problems in the future . Remaps are your best option for diesels . You get a bag load of power as well as better fuel economy . <p> I 'm a dealer for celtic tuning and the maps they provide in my opinion are one of the best and I 'm not just saying that because I deal for them , I would n't be doing it if I did n't think they were good . <p> The gains depend on which bhp model you have and whether it 's a CR or PD engine . Is yours the 138bhp CR or PD or the 167bhp CR or PD ?

This was sadly the last of the performance escorts , as the range has been superseded by the Focus . <p> Although the Escort was replaced by the Focus , you will still find some die hard Escort fans around . There are still plenty of Escort tuning mods around for pretty much any engine size . <h> Engine tuning modifications . <p> Peak power is all well and good but if you want a truly driveable car it will need a wide power band and lots of low down torque .

The nice steady boost to rpm characteristics of the supercharger make them easier to map . Adding forced induction will usually require a lower compression ratio or water injection . <p> If your car is making 40-50% more power than standard then it will need more air and fuel so fueling upgrades are important mods if you are serious about power.Look to aftermarket parts suppliers for uprated injectors and fuel pumps and in some cases you 'll find that your manufacturer offers uprated options as fitted to later performance models . 38241 @qwx238241 38232 @qwx238232 <h> Performance air intake and exhaust . <p> Before you start doing engine mods you have to get the breathing right and remove any restrictions in the system that could inhibit air flow.Derestricting the airflow into the engine is the primary part of tuning so get a better flowing air filter .

This is definitely a job for a professional with a flow bench . As you increase power in your Escort you may find that the clutch will start to slip and this needs to be uprated - read our article on clutches for more information . <p> Stick to the later fuel injected 1.6 and greater engines for the best base to work from .

If you are considering suicide doors we will explain the advantages and disadvantages ? <p> Traditionally car doors have- the hinges at the front and the door opens from the rear . Although this is now the established norm mass produced cars in the early days rear hinged doors were common . <p> Converting a standard door to a suicide door requires moving the hinge so that the door opens to the front . So why are they called suicide doors ? The name ' suicide doors ' is based on the fact you are exposed to oncoming traffic when exiting the car instead of having the door to shield you . In real life a parked car is more likely to be hit by a car coming from behind . <p> The Mazda RX8 , the BMW i3 , the Honda Element and Toyota FJ Cruiser are the only mainstream cars in recent times to have suicide doors . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the front doors need to be opened before rear passengers can get out . It 's a clever way make a wider opening for rear passengers . <p> Suicide doors are a popular modification for show cars . It 's a relatively simple job for a competent person . Usually the area where the hinges are mounted will need to be reinforced or the doors will sag over time . <h> Suicide door options for 2 and 4 door cars . <p> For 2 door cars the only option is to relocate the hinges to the rear so the doors open at the front . If you have a 4 door car then you have a couple of options . <p> Option 1 for a 4 door car is to get just the rear doors reversed into suicide doors . This gives easier access for rear passengers . <p> Option 2 for a 4 door car is to have all 4 doors converted into suicide doors .

A standard door only needs to be partially opened because the gap at the front only needs to be wide enough to slide your legs in . With a suicide door more clearance is required . <p> Another issue is the need to lean forwards quite a distance to close the door . Fitting strategically placed handles or straps can solve this problem . <p> You can have fun watching passengers hunt for the door handles , especially if the handles have been shaved or removed . Beware of cheap suicide door conversions . Doors that are poorly fitted can soon become- difficult to open and close .

The tick over is very lumpy and irregular and the car is lumpy to drive round town . Fuel economy is pathetic and it is unlikely that a car with this fitted will pass any kind of emissions test . <p> You can tweak the cam timing slightly with a vernier pulley , which helps push the power band to the part of the rev range you prefer . <p> Developments Rover devised the VVC cam where the cam rotates within a rotating holder and creates a marvelous tunable engine .

In this article we shall give a brief overview to the best mods for your car , but we 'd encourage you to spend some time on the site looking into the details of each type of performance part . A performance camshaft maximises the intake and exhaust durations and pushes up the power if done right . Ideally you 'd add other mods and finish up with a performance chip . <p> TorqueCars would caution you not to go with a competition cam as this affects the engines idling and general town driving characteristics.Do n't forget to uprate the fueling when you are increasing the power - it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another option if you find you are suffering from pinking or premature ignition on your Maruti project after fitting other modifications . To get sufficient fuel you may need to uprate the injectors on your engine . A fuel pump will only deliver a finite amount of fuel , so you may need to uprate this if your injectors are demanding more fuel . 38228 @qwx238228 <p> Breathing mods are usually next up . Contrary to popular belief there is usually very little power gain to be had by fitting an induction kit , they only work well and are recommended after you increase the engines power to the point where the standard air intake box can not cope ! Derestricting the airflow into the engine is a primary goal of performance tuning so get a better flowing air filter if you find that the car is running lean only if you find the car is running lean . Induction kits can sound great but due to the warm air in the engine bay they will not add noticeable power and actually rob you of power . <p> Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will slow the exhaust rate - the best exhausts for power gains are usually between 0.5 to 1 inches .

Your clutch can seriously let you down as you increase the power if it starts to complain and the standard clutches are only ever good for power gains of upto 50% . Fit a power clutch to avoid power leak through the transmission . Turbo engines are just begging to be Upgraded . You will see large power gains on most modern turbochaged cars including diesels making a remap one of the most cost effective and large modifications for your money.The most phenomenal power gains for NASP engines usually involve the addition of forced induction . It is often easier to bolt on a supercharger than it is to get a turbo working .

To cope with forced induction you will usually need to decrease the compression ratio of the engine . 38226 @qwx238226 <p> Alloy wheels will help the brakes cool down and are generally lighter than steel ones . It is worth noting that although they can look cool on the Zen Big alloy wheels will actually decrease your performance .

" <p> The BMW 3 series was first launched in 1975 with the E21 , however it was not until 1982 the 3 series became a success with the E30 . <p> In particular the Ultimate Driving Machine really kicked things off in 1985 with the E30 M3 which was produced as a race car for the road . <p> This was because BMW wanted to compete in touring car racing . <p> After this success , 3 more successful generations have followed . <p> BMWs naturally have very good suspension , especially thanks to the 50:50 weight distribution found throughout the range . <p> But any suspension setup can be improved upon . A good start to a suspension overhaul would be to install a set of adjustable coil overs .

In particular pay attention to the bushes . The better the bushes , the stiffer the ride will be . Powerflex provide a great range of polyurethane bushes ( poly bushes ) for all BMWs that will stiffen up the ride and help handling . <p> Anti-roll bars are also a great way of improving how the car handles as chassis roll is reduced through hard cornering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car is used both on the road and on the track . Strut braces are an easy modification that helps reduce chassis flex . Front and rear strut braces will ensure the car stays stable at top speed . <p> An important part of any project is making the sure the car stops . Luckily BMWs allow you to swap parts from other BMWs to create a bigger , better setup . An example of this is an E46 330i brakes being applied to an E36 . Just make sure the correct master cylinder and servo are used otherwise the middle pedal wont do anything ! If you want serious brakes though , many setups are available . <p> Grooved and drilled discs are a good idea to stop brake fade and allow up rated cooling . These characteristics are key to track cars , but may be too much for a daily drive car as brakes may not reach optimum temperature quick enough . Brake pads are also important and should be chosen wisely depending on what the car is used for . <p> Using a pad designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and visa-versa . A simple but effective way to improve braking is to install a set of stainless steel brake lines . These reduce any flex in the lines and do n't  corrode like OEM ones do . This will improve the feel of the brakes in any setup . <p> Now we come to the exciting part of any BMW 3 Series project , more power ! Exhaust systems are an effective way of increasing throttle response and adding a few extra horses . Pipe diameter is the key element in choosing your exhaust system . The right size for an M3 will no doubt be too big for a smaller powered version . <p> For example , the optimum exhaust size for a 318is is 2.25 inches , but the M3 uses a 3 inch diameter . This is to achieve the best flow rate vs back pressure . Induction kits can achieve good power gains across the range , but be sure to use a heat shield around enclosed filter as heat soak mean a loss in power . <p> However , smaller engines can achieve similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also an important part of adding power to your 3 Series . <p> Big bore throttle bodies ( BBTBs ) or individual throttle bodies ( ITBs ) help deliver more power and a better throttle response to your BMW . Once you 've finished with your power modifications then make sure to take advantage by getting a remap done . <p> This will ensure that there no flat spots meaning drivability is at its best and power is increased further . Do n't  be put off if you have a smaller engined BMW , as good gains are available for most engines , especially diesels . If that is n't enough for you then a turbo or supercharger may be the route to take . <p> Styling is possibly the most enjoyable part of a 3 Series project . There are so many parts to choose from you will spend hours looking and planning . Non-Mtec models may benefit from an Mtec conversion and Mtec models may be inspired by many aftermarket manufacturers such as Hartge , Alpina and AC Schnitzer . <p> The biggest choice you will make during your 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommends going for lightweight wheels to maximise performance . This means avoiding replica wheels as they are usually heavier than standard wheels . <p> A common wheel choice is to put 5 Series rims onto a 3 Series . If you choose this route then make sure a spigot ring is used to reduce centre bore size . Otherwise you will endure wheel wobble . <p> To ensure you choose a good base for your project be sure to check the rear arches for rust as replacements will be expensive . <p> Other areas to check are the wiring contained within the boot harness as wear and tear can cause electrical problems , the Nikasil issue found with Nickel lined alloy blocks , exhaust manifolds and if equipped , VANOS . <p> If you would like to know more or have any specific questions then please ask in the forum .

This is why diesel engines tend to have lower revs , although with Turbo charging and pre warmed fuel , Diesels are catching up petrol . <p> Due to the combustion method a diesel is going to be more efficient than a petrol engine . The ' magic ingredient ' in Diesel is called Cetane and in Petrol we have Octane . <p> You need to provide a precise ratio of fuel and air to avoid running rich or lean , both can cause problems in an engine <p> High-octane fuel burns more efficiently and lower octane fuel can actually cause detonation or engine knock in high performance engines ( where the pressure in the cylinder causes combustion prematurely . ) Japanese cars typically use 100 Ron fuel in their native country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Shell Optimax , Bp Ultimate ) . <p> Additives can help increase the octane of the fuel but I actually found my car became sooty when I used them I assume that they have moved on now but I am still reluctant to use a fuel additive . <p> Some have started adding acetone to fuel , but acetone dissolves plastic so TorqueCars are not recommending this unless you know your cars plastic is resistant . <p> A good fuel will help to clean the injectors/carb and remove and prevent further carbon build up in the engine . <p> I can usually tell if I have high octane fuel in my car after a few miles driving so recommend that you pick a fuel that suits your style of driving .

My first experience of the 207 was a diesel powered hire car in France . A remap would have lifted the performance of this massively . <p> The build quality and styling was better than I had seen on previous models . <p> Handling on the Sport and GTi models is great but there is still plenty of scope for improvement . <p> Get a decent set of lowered and fully adjustable coilover shocks . Lower the car a little , about 40 mm should suffice . <p> A rear anti roll bar will help tighten up the car in the corners amd replacing your worn bushings with poly ones will sharpen things up considerably . <p> Many 207 owners uprate the handling of their cars as a priority , this will certainly increase your enjoyment of the car . Drop the car by as much as 35mm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most instances . <p> Our aim in 207 engine tuning should be to increase peak power and Torque at the top end . The 1.6 VTi is the best base engine to tune up but the THP 175 direct injection engine is a star performer . Although the cars are setup for economy you can remap the turbo engines and really transform the car into a track day monster . <p> Expect power gains of around 30% from a remap and around 15% better economy ! A real win/win if you ask me . <p> Clean lines , edgy styling and a great range of engines give the 207 a big step up from the previous 206 model . There are still lots you can do to transform the car though ! <h> Engine tuning . <p> You really need to keep as much low end power as you can and aim for a wide power band rather than a top end spike . <p> A fast road cam will be one of the best power mods you can do mechanically to your engine . Avoid a full blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and driveability on the roads . <p> Remaps on the turbo are the best and most cost effective mods you can do . It is worth noting that the diesel engines are also completely transformed with a simple remap. 38228 @qwx238228 <p> Breathing mods are usually next up . You need to unrestrict the airflow into the engine as much as possible and a cotton panel air filter will help this . A lot of 207 owners go for a full induction kit as the engines sound great with an induction roar but TorqueCars recommend a high flow sports panel air filter as the performance mod . <p> Diesels do not really benefit from intake or exhaust mods as Peugeot use fairly free flowing parts already . <p> Sports exhausts will certainly help air flow through the engine but do not go too large or you will reduce the flow rate and upset the cars torque . Stick to 1.5 to 2.0 inch exhaust bore for best results . <p> We have already seen some 207 fitted with drainpipe exhausts and while these sound great , little if any performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow you to maximize your air/fuel charge . Leave this to a professional though with a proper flow bench and machine tools . <p> In nearly all cases of 207 tuning where power hikes of 30% or more are reached , your clutch will start to slip and this needs to be uprated - read our article on clutches for more information . <p> If you have a NASP engine then you will usually consider adding forced induction but this can be more problematic than a simple engine swap . <p> Generally turbo kits are harder to add than supercharger although a few Peugeot specialists are offering turbo and supercharger conversion kits . <p> The nice steady boost to rpm characteristics of the supercharger make them easier to map . Decreasing the engines compression ratio will allow you to add forced induction , water injection may also help prevent detonation . <h> Wheel modifications . 38239 @qwx238239 <p> For this reason we would advise sticking to a maximum wheel size of 18 inches with low profile tyres , although we know some of our members have gone larger than this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your 207 please join us in our friendly forumwhere you can discuss your tuning options in more detail with our enthusiastic 207 owners . <p> It would also be worth reading our unbiased Peugeot tuning articles to get a full grasp of the benefits and drawbacks of each modification . <p> This @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

As the car corners and rolls the suspension geometry must maintain the best angle of contact of the tyre to the road . <p> This is why manufacturers go to such great lengths to set up their cars correctly and when you make suspension modifications it should be your aim to keep as close to the makers spec as possible . Generally the more tuned the suspension set-up the less variation there is under stress and the less room you have to play with . Start off with the manufacturers settings and alter these slightly increasing the negative camber and test the results . If you cant feel any difference then why are you bothering ! <p> Remember that kerbing wheels and hitting bumps can knock out the camber setting .

The positive caster keeps the wheel straight when going along a bit like a pram wheel the connecting arm to the hub is set slightly back .

Now imagine your cars tyres are at this angle too this is known as Toe Out . Toes in is where your heels are apart and the toes are together . Obviously the angle of Toe in a car is barely perceptible . <p> The effect of this setting on the car is stability toe in gives great stability on the straight and the car resists a turn to the right or left .

As this is not possible the lift is effectively pulled down and everything is kept in contact with the road . <p> Strut braces stiffen the top of the suspension mountings and help reduce flex when you are pushing the car hard so also have a minor benefit at reducing roll . <p> Spring stiffness If the springs are too stiff the car will bounce over humps and lumps in the road . <p> If it is too soft the car will just wallow along ( itll be a really comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the car and let you get the set up perfect to match your driving style . <p> If you have slightly softer springs on the front the nose of the car will grip in corners and you will have more oversteer ( back gets lighter and tends to go wide in corners ) .

If you lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these to keep the corect angle between sway bar and wishbone <p> When you picture the cars wheel alignment you have to remember that a car is a highly dynamic system.The relationship of the wheels to the road and suspension when stood still is in a sense deceptive because the alignment is set for the car on the road at speed.It sounds obvious but a straight forward example explains and answers Marcos question . How does toe in promote straight line stability ? ? <p> When the car is traveling forward at speed the forward momentum plus drag/ resistance/friction will try and push the wheels outwards so if they are set very sightly pointing inwards when sitting still this natural tendency will effectively straighten them and square them up to the road so that they are now fully straight ahead and putting the ideal amount of rubber on the road.It is n't quite as simpe as toe in for the road/toe out for racing because some cars are RWD some FWD and some 4WD.Theres a big difference between the front wheels being under power or being pushed by the rear because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other does n't  which we all know has a significant effect on how they behave . <p> Camber is exactly the same , it may seem odd to have them slightly leaning in but again at speed when there are cornering forces at play , wheel loading and body roll the outside wheel will be pushed square onto the road again.Also the nature of the suspension will have an effect . <p> Obviously none of us have ever driven too hard down country roads except on private land , that goes without saying lol but I 'm sure were all familiar with the kind of forces and work those wheels and tyres are taking under some positive driving conditions so you e=really do want them to be in the right position under stress rather than when trolling round a car park = 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Generally the larger the wheel and the lower profile the tyre the nicer it looks . <p> There are practical limits though as large wheels will adversely affect handling and can even rub on the wheel arches on full lock . For more information on the practical side of fitting alloy wheels have a look at the alloy wheel article in tuning . <p> Switching to low brake dust pads will help to keep cleaning your new rims a simple job . <p> This article is purely discussing the aesthetics of adding an alloy wheel to your car .

When alloys get kerbed they can look really unsightly so a good choice of tyre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bear this in mind when choosing an alloy wheel as some designs stick out so much they are just asking for kerbing . <p> Spacers inside the wheel against the hub will make the tyres line up with the edge of the arches and this widening of the footprint can improve the handling of the car . Split rims are two parts which have multiple bolts connecting them together and this can also make the wheel fill the arch and allow a much wider tyre to be used . <p> Remember that if the wheel is much wider or bigger than standard you will need to get the suspension realigned and set up otherwise you can compromise your handling and safety . 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Decide how far you want to push your car before you get going . <p> Getting the right mods for your planned usage of the car is essential . Stage 3 motorsport mods just wo n't work well on the road making the car difficult to drive . <p> Your aim when modding your car should be a flat and wide torque curve . You do n't want all the power to be at the top end of the rev range , unless you are creating a motorsport car . In this article we shall give an overview and introduction to the best modifications for your car , but we 'd encourage you to spend some time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance upgrade . <p> The intake and exhaust durations play a large part in your car 's power band , but be careful here , getting this wrong can upset the idle and make the car impossible to drive in traffic . You 'd need to follow a cam upgrade with other mods and finish with a reflashed ECU for the the car more thirsty . If you find you suffer from flat spots and power surges after your mods you should check the fueling and try a higher octane fuel as well . Uprating the injectors is another beneficial modification and will deliver sufficient fuel . Uprate the fuel pump to cope with the extra fuel requirements of your tuned 800 's uprated injectors. 38228 @qwx238228 <p> Breathing mods are usually next up .

Maximum power gains come from a full induction kit with a cold air feed on heavily tuned engines , this can be sited within an air box but a panel filter should suffice for most applications . TorqueCars suggest you use a panel air filter as these are easy to clean and maintain and generally perform better than paper ones . <p> Do not go with the largest exhaust you can buy this will slow up the exhaust flow rate - the best exhausts for power gains are usually between 0.5 to 1 inches . It is the shape and material more than the bore size . <p> Getting the head flowed ( ported and polished ) will further help more air into each cylinder . This is definitely a job for a professional with a flow bench . Your clutch can seriously let you down as the power goes up if it starts to slip and the standard clutches are only ever good for power gains of up to 50% .

On NASP engines the benefits are doubtful . <p> However a remap on a NASP engine will help unleash the potential if you have done a lot of mods . Despite the large cost involved adding forced induction to a NASP engine will give large power gains . It is usually simpler to bolt on a supercharger than it is to get a turbo working . It is harder to map a turbo as the boost increases exponentially with engine speed . It is easier to map a supercharger because the boost is directly proportional to engine speed on a linear curve . Adding forced induction will usually require a lower compression ratio or water injection . 38226 @qwx238226 <p> The benefits of alloy wheels include a lower unsprung weight and better brake cooling via the extra air flow they allow .

When the car is dry you need to apply a protective layer of wax which will help to keep out corrosion . <p> When a car is standing you still have to worry about corrosion inside the engine . We recommend that you spray some oil into each of the cylinders . The easiest way to do this is by removing the spark plugs . <p> To ensure the oil coats the cylinder walls you will need to crank the engine for a single revolution ( short burst ) with the plugs removed to prevent combustion .

Do not idle the engine and allow it to come up to temperature but rather hold the revs and allow the car to warm up quickly .

This is a question we get asked over and over again . <p> There are 2 schools of thought on this subject and we aim to cover the pros and cons in as open and unbiased way as we can . <p> Firstly a bit of an introduction . What is a stretched tire ? <p> This is a tire which has been fitted to a much wider rim than it was originally intended or designed to fit . Stretches vary from an inch to around 3 inches . It has gained a lot of popularity in VW circles and the look is really starting to take off . <p> The benefits of stretched tires are that they look great ( this is a matter of subjective opinion though ) . They also allow you to run much wider rims without having to alter the arches or bodywork as no part of the tire may protrude from the bodywork . <p> We have heard many horror stories including the increased risk of blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kerbing your alloys . We have even heard of track days where cars running big stretches would often lose tire pressure and " blow out " . <p> So let 's look at the two main arguments for and against them . <h> Stretched tires are dangerous and risky - the argument against . <p> Are stretched tires safe or even legal , TorqueCars attempt to unpick the arguments for and against . <p> The arguments against stretched tires will cite that a cars tires are designed to fit a specific width of rim . Tire makers will not warrant their products fitted outside of tolerances and the speed ratings will typically be a few steps lower than a correctly fitted tire . <p> The load bearing wall of the tire is designed to be at around a 90 degree tangent to the rim and under cornering this allows a small degree of vertical ' wobble ' which aids cornering feel and grip . <p> They will state that stretched tires are no longer within this ideal tolerance and probably 80 or 70 degrees from the rim so subjected to extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop away from the bead when the pressure drops than a standard fitting tire . <p> On heavy driving , a stretched tires wear pattern , will be different to that of a standard tire with a greatly increased edge wear . The narrower tire width also reduces grip and traction - most people fit wider tires to increase the grip and this seems diametrically opposed to that philosophy . <h> Stretched tires are perfectly safe - the argument For . <p> Modern tires and especially low profile tires have much thicker walls and are more than capable of handling the extra loads they might be subjected to . In a pneumatic tire the car is resting effectively on a bubble of air so the actual walls of the tire are less important when it comes to strength . <p> If the tire pressures are maintained correctly there should be no risk of the tire popping off the rim under cornering . A lot of those with stretched tires run with much higher pressures than a conventionally fitted tire . <p> Lots of people have stretched tires on their cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also immaterial as generally speaking the rim size has been increased and standard tire widths are used . <p> Now unpicking these 2 arguments is not going to be easy . There are going to be lovers and haters of stretched tires and neither side is going to back down . <p> They are getting more popular and the craze is really catching on . As with any modification one has to examine the parts used and the dimensions involved . <p> It is fair to say that the larger the stretch the greater the risk of having a problem with your tire . We can also say that those who drive hard or use cars on tracks subject the car to a lot of extra wear and tear . <p> So the use of the car also comes into it . <p> Whilst one make of tire might be ideal for a stretch , by virtue of the tread pattern and sidewall construction another may prove woefully inadequate . Different rim sizes and tire profiles also have a bearing on this issue . <p> We would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations where the stretch is not excessive , the car is not driven too hard and the tires are properly maintained . The risks of damage from a kerb also needs to be mentioned as most tires give a degree of protection to a rim . Personally I do n't like the look and do not recommend them from that point of view . <p> There is also the question of whether these tires are legal . We are obviously based in the UK and we know that regulations vary from state to state and country to country . But from a UK MOT test point of view ( as at the time of writing ) there are no points raised specifically concerning stretched tires . <p> Insurance companies may not be happy though and tend to take a cautious view of any modifications made to a car . If an accident happened that could be directly attributed to the stretched tire there will certainly be questions raised about the " did the insured take reasonable steps to maintain his vehicle in a road worthy state " clause . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you would invalidate your policy cover . <p> It is also worth noting that the Motor Vehicles Approval Regs 2001 section 16 state that tires should be of a nominal size appropriate to the wheel to which it is fitted . The police have also taken a dim view of these in the past and issued warnings and penalties under various construction and use clauses . We would also refer you to the more recent " road vehicles ( Construction &amp; Use ) regulations 1986 " , and specifically Regs 24 to 27 concerning tires . <p> The lack of specific legislation either against or for stretched tires does not add to the clarity of this issue . " Appropriate " in our mind rules out excessive stretches . tire manufacturers specify suitable width rims for their tires as further guidelines to those wanting a " stretched look " . Speed ratings are also nominally lower on stretched tires in use so this needs to be born in mind . <p> Personally I 'd leave majorly stretched tires to show use only . There is a degree of common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't go to the extreme . I 'm sure tire makers will pick up on this trend and provide specific stretch designs that are suitable for this type of look . <p> I 'm a tyre fitter and my opinion on Stretched tyres is that yeah they look kool but would you wan na look kool or be safe ? ? it is highly dangerous to fit a tyre to a rim that is not within the width specification for many reasons , such as .. it will give no improvement on handling it will dramatically worsen the handling of the vehicle , yes there is chance the tyre could pop off the rim cornering at high/low speeds or even loss of pressure which will also change the vehicles characteristics .. uneven tyre will be another factor , you will see wear on either edges where the tread has formed a bend in the middle thus less contact with the road .. this uneven wear will be a faster rate than regular wear and a few of you dumb asses will be paying out for unnecessary wheel alignment checksyou could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tyre but then again you are altering the vehicles spec causing handling problems and adverse effects on your braking system .. is it really worth risking your life to look good ? ? personally i think the safer way of a flush wall to the rim looks way better than scraping a few mil on the suspensionthink about it ! ! <p> Stretched tyres that are excessive and outside the makers fitment specs are in MHO dangerous and generally only seen on slammed fully sic cars with wan na be boy racers/ricers behind the wheel and often wearing a flat brim cap worn at a silly angle . <p> Each to their own I agree that drifters use them BUT they are not insured and dedicated drift cars are not normally road registered . That said I would not want to be claiming insurance on a car with excessively stretched tyres as the acessor will be looking for any excuse to deny your claim due to the tyres being outside the makers recommended fitment guidelines and could be deemed as unroadworthy when the policy requires the vehicle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch is easy to get away with . Some of the factory low pros on new cars these days are thin compared to most . If your insurance adjuster gets down on all fours with a measuring tape to measure your rim width , then convert that to MM and compare to the tires it sounds to me like you need a different insurance company . Like the author of the thread said there are no federal regulations laying this out for the consumer . Basically , " Do n't  go too extreme " 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

@@24423470 @4423470/ <h> Adding spoilers and wings for aerodynamic enhancement <p> How do spoilers work ? Firstly we need to explain the difference between a spoiler and a wing . <p> Spoilers are generally closer to the body of the car and help diffuse the air . <p> Wings are mounted much higher up and have an aerodynamic effect of creating downforce . <p> Wings work like an upside down airplane wing . So how does an airplane wing work then ? Torquecars now take a complex subject and simplify it . <p> ( Obviously there are many , many complex factors to take into account but we are dealing with the basic principles of wing and spoiler design here and discussing whether it has a beneficial effect on a road cars performance ) . <p> In its simplest form fast moving air creates pull if the other side of an object is subject to slower moving air . <p> To test this theory take 2 sheets of paper and hold them between your thumbs and little fingers so there is a gap between the sheets of about 1 inch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they pull together , which is not actually what you expect to happen . The fast moving air creates a low pressure region between the paper causes them to pull together . <p> A single rear wing or spoiler is a pointless addition as a performance enhancement , although it may look cool ! <p> So to create lift or down force you need air moving faster on one side of the aerofoil than on the other creating a pull towards the fast moving air stream . Obviously on a car you will not want a airplane wing so we use a simple 2 deck deflection to create the down force required . <p> The angle of attack or deflection will have a bearing on the amount of down force generated , the larger the angle the more down force but the price you will pay is increased drag . Most wings have a two angled surface creating a two stage deflection forcing the air over the wing to take a shorter route than the air going under the spoiler . <p> Thinking about the principle of spoilers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side than on the other , either by increasing the surface area on one side making the air travel further or by creating drag underneath to slow up the air . Brings us to look at the whole car and its effect on down force/lift . <p> If you look at the typical shape of a car the air will travel further and faster over the top of the car than it does underneath , this creates lift . Opening a sunroof at speed can make this problem even worse . So , an unmodified car , travelling at track speeds becomes very unstable and dangerous effectively losing grip , traction and control . <p> Cue the Coanda effect ( a flow of liquid or air will follow the surface it is running over , try putting the side of a cup under a steady trickle of water and see what happens to the flow after it leaves the curve of the cup ! ) So once deflected the stream of air will continue on the deflected course after the end of the spoiler . Already we start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car is not addressing the whole issue of aerodynamics . <p> If you imagine the car as a see-saw when you press down on the rear the front will lift slightly . When you fit a spoiler to the rear you have to expect that at higher speeds the front of the car will become lighter . In a front wheel drive car this is very undesirable , in a rear wheel drive car you still need the front wheels to steer so although traction is improved a degree of lift at the front is undesirable . <p> To counter the front lift you can fit front splitters , and front and rear skirts , which create down force at the front of the car and control the amount of air rushing under the car to create down force . When you start redirecting the air rushing over the car you will create an amount of drag which will rob you of speed and economy so there is a fine line between an efficient spoiler and wing design and an inefficient one . <p> Sometimes in Formula 1 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car has lifted due to a bump and the spoilers have effectively helped the car to get airborne and crash . Some cars generate more down force than they weigh creating the possibility of driving upside down on the roof of a tunnel ( aside from the logistics of how you get it there in the first place . ) <p> The best wings are adjustable , allowing the driver to set his preferences to the track conditions . For example a slow track with many bends will need a different setup to a fast track with plenty of straights . They also are mounted high up on the rear so they have an effect on the air flowing over the car . Vertical slats in the spoiler help to increase a cars straight line stability , something you see in motorsports spoilers . <p> Side skirts and sills help to cause the air moving under the car to move faster creating down force and enhancing cornering stability . For the best effect TorqueCars recommend that you do not just go out to the ' chavs n tarts ' part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead go to a proper motorsports tuner and get a rear wing specked up to your car and your requirements . A single rear spoiler is a pointless addition as a performance enhancement as you need to address the nose of the car , get some suitable sills and have the underneath of the car designed to create down force as well . <p> Wings can start to provide measurable down force at speeds of around 50mph but it 's not until about 70mph that this becomes significant and offers a benefit to the handling of a car . Spoilers can help to reduce drag on a car but are little more than cosmetic add ons . <p> So to summarise , a spoiler is , as the name suggests , designed to spoil the air flow . A car , due to its wing-like shape ( the air has further to travel over the top than underneath just like a wing ) tends to create lift at the rear end so a spoiler is employed to break or ' spoil ' the flow , thereby reducing the lift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. A wing however , is mounted quite high and produces downforce and helps increase a cars grip and handling at speed .

@@24423471 @4423471/ <h> Looking at problems and issues on the 2.0 TFSi engine <p> " Tuning the 2.0 TFSi engine " <p> Due to concerns about emissions and tighter controls the 2.0 TFSi engine was born and contains a number of major revisions to enhance engine efficiency . The 1.8T engine was retired and replaced with a more powerful turbo charged 2.0 FSi unit . <p> The most notable revision is the introduction of direct injection allowing very fine control over fueling and as well as the extra economy on offer the engine provides a lot of extra performance . Because the fuel is injected directly into the cylinder it has the effect of cooling the intake charge , reducing the risk of detonation and allowing much higher cylinder pressures to be used . Plus the fuel delivery can be very precisely controlled and trimmed to suit engine load . <p> Direct injection has been a major enhancement to diesel engines and it is nice to see this innovation finding its way into petrol engines . <p> Variants of the 2.0 TFSi find their way across the entire Audi range and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels ranged from 197bhp to 265bhp depending on the model with the S3 and TT getting the top power versions . <p> A few engines had minor internal revisions and slightly altered compression ratios , the 220bhp BUL engine ( from the Limited Edition Quattro ) is a good example and these respond better to custom remaps than standard engines . <p> For serious power gains on the TFSi you are looking at an uprated fuel pump ( the S3 injectors are a good upgrade option on tuned 2.0TFSi engines to deliver the fuel ) , sports cat and manifold , cat back exhaust system , high flow air intake and a remap . The weak spots which we will highlight below can be easily remedied and avoided if watched . We do recommend the addition of an uprated non atmospheric diverter valve for mild tuning and standard cars because the original units were not that reliable . <p> With just a remap on a stock engine you can raise the power from the baseline 200bhp or 220bhp to around 240bhp and although an uprated diverter valve is recommended it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost effective way to add more power . Adding the other performance parts you should be able to hit the 280bhp mark and if you uprate the turbo to a KO4 unit you should reach around the 350bhp mark fairly easily . A bigger Garret turbo unit would be required if you want to achieve power figures around the 300-600bhp mark . <p> The 2.0 TFSi is a very powerful and efficient engine with a couple of potential weak spots to keep an eye on . <p> Cambelt changes should happen at least every 5 years and we would recommend annual oil changes , the recommended long life service is very convenient but you want to keep the car in top condition bear in mind that oil does degrade and pick up contaminants . <p> To keep your engine in perfect condition you must use the correct grade of oil and stick to a premium brand of fully synthetic . If your garage recommend a semi synthetic or worse still something that is n't 5w30 or VW503 00 , VW503 01 or VW504 00 specific you do n't really want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TFSi engines provide excellent efficiency turning every drop of fuel in power which is good for economy but there are 2 well documented problems to look out for . Regard these items as service items rather than a manufacturing defect and as long as you check them you should have no trouble at all . <h> Cam follower wear . <p> The main weak spot is the cam follower located below the high pressure mechanical fuel pump . it has a low friction coating on it a bit like " Teflon " . The follower resembles a thimble that sits on the bottom of the fuel pump . Check this every few years or at 30,000 miles for wear . <p> This fault was altered in later models with a different cam lobe set up , for example the 220bhp BUL engines are not affected by this issue . <p> You are looking out for the coating wearing off , if it has worn down and exposes a metal surface this causes very quick wear through the follower and damages the cam shaft . The first you 'll know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine warning light coming on . It is a simple check that most drivers can perform . Be very careful about the extremely high fuel pump pressures and ensure the pressure is released from the system , a jet of fuel at this pressure could potentially cut through bone or at the very least cause major injury ! <h> Carbon Build up . <p> The other commonly reported problem is that of carbon build up on the valves caused by the direct injection , Although it is a common issue with engines of this type the V6 and V8 engines are more prone due to their lower RPM characteristics . The build up happens because the fuel is not being injected over the valves and this would keep the valves nice and clean . <p> When the engine is cold the unburned particles are dumped back into the intake , and it is these that foul up the intake . So avoiding short journeys and making sure the engine gets up to operating temperature as quickly as possible will prevent this issue . <p> After 70,000 miles a decoke is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do though . Adding BG44K to the fuel once a year will keep the engine , injectors and exhaust nice and clean but sadly wont clean the intake valves . With the rest of the engine performing well the carbon build up is substantially reduced . <p> A full BG intake clean performed by a specialist with the correct equipment will do a fantastic job of restoring lost performance . If you are not making the power figures you expect then you are probably suffering from this issue . <p> Larger capacity direct injection engines are even more prone to carbon build up issues . The carbon build up will rob you of power rather than do any major damage but cleaning out the head will dramatically increase the performance and economy . ( An addition of BG44K to my engine raised the average MPG from 31.4 to 37 mpg for a similar journey . AND I HAVE NOT BEEN PAID TO SAY THIS . It shows how clogged the injectors were in my 70,000 mile 220bhp TFSi engine . ) <p> We have not seen evidence that proves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water injection engines still having the carbon build up issue ( biofuels like alcohol are not recommended on FSI engines anyway ) . Breather catch tanks are also suggested as a prevention of this problem but again we have heard of owners with these devices still suffering from Carbon build up . <p> They say prevention is better than cure so what can be done to prevent this carbon build up issue . Using good quality clean burn fuel free of bio elements , the higher octane fuels also tend to burn cleaner . Get the engine up to temperature as soon as you can ( do n't idle it but just drive it steadily at around 2000rpm till it warms up ) and keep the engine operating at 3000rpm for 15 minutes per week . At this RPM range the engine is designed to run hotter and this can help burn off some of the carbon deposits . <p> Keep an eye on the recirculation valve , the oil this sprays into the intake when it goes is cited as a major cause of the carbon build up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve checked ASAP . ( TorqueCars regards high oil consumption as over 0.5 litres per 1000 miles . ) <p> Cleaning the head is most effectively done by removal and refitting but due to the expense we 'd recommend you get the head flowed and ported whilst it is off . We have seen some excellent results from intake cleaners that are sprayed at high pressure into the intake , these are not DIY sprays though . An inspection probe through the intake or via the spark plugs will give an indication on the state of carbon build up allowing you to make an informed decision . <p> The DIY spray cans of carbon cleaner do at best a minor job , the trick is delivering the cleaner evenly to all of the valves you 'll typically see the cylinders closest to the vacuum line getting the most benefit from these . For best results take off the intake manifold and spray the cleaner directly onto the problem area and leave it to soak in . ( Always follow the manufacturers instructions though , I do n't doubt that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <p> Driving the engine at just over 3000 RPM raises the temperature and puts the engine into a " cleaning mode " where it runs leaner and hotter clearing out a lot of the carbon build up inside the engine , so try to hit this sweet spot as often as you can and for at least 15 minutes per week . <p> I have an Audi A5 Sportback with the 211 PS 2.0 TFSi petrol engine . Thankfully it is a company car , if it was my own I would be very unhappy with the oil consumption . I get through a litre every 1500 miles ( its 1 year old , 20k miles ) , Audi have checked it out , but they say as long as it is using less than 1 litre every 1000 miles then it is within spec . Very poor for a new car , and I would not buy one as a private purchase for this reason . <p> I have an A4 B8 , with 2.0 liter TFSi engine that used an excessive amount of oil during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up spark plugs &amp; was towed to service . An oil consumption test followed where 800mls of oil was used over 1000kms . Audi Australia then replaced Pistons rings &amp; rods plus modified a breather valve . The car now only uses 100mls of oil on a high speed highway run over 6 hours duration . The fuel economy is outstanding on highway travel at 5.7 Ltrs per 100 Klms @ 100 to 110klms per hour . <p> Got a 11 a5 2.0 .. I try to follow most of those tips above , but do u suggest I idle the car for a minute after reaching my destination ? I try to idle da car before every ride for about a minute . Thanks <p> You only need to idle the engine after a spirited run where the turbo has started to spin up to high speeds and this is to allow it to spin down and cool a little .

This is used to pick up any little hairs/bits of dust both on the panel before painting and on the paint during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so do n't  worry if you cant get one . <p> A Mask , preferably a vapor one . <p> T-Cut or another finishing compound . And a soft cloth . <p> Now you have the materials needed , let 's begin <h> Stage 1 Preparation <p> Remove whatever part you plan to paint . Be careful not to scratch or damage it , you 'll only be making yourself more work . <p> Once you have removed the part , start by washing it with the soapy water/solvent cleaner . This removes grease , dust or any other contaminates . If there is any damage to the part , now would be the time to sort it . Next start to key the part , making sure there are no shiny areas left on it , the better you do this , the less likely the paint it to flake later . Once you have keyed the part , wash it again . Make sure it is thoroughly dry before proceeding . <h> Stage 2 Painting <p> The main bit of advice I have for painting with aerosols would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be atomized finer as it passes through the nozzle , which results in a better finish . Bare in mind I said warm , DO NOT overheat , you are taking the chill off the can , not risking losing a hand due to an aerosol exploding while you hold it . <p> Make sure you give the can(s) a good shake before using them . The best technique for painting with an aerosol is to use light , overlapping strokes . You need to leave at least 5 minutes between coats to give the solvents in the paint time to evaporate . <p> This time can be cut by using a hairdryer . I would recommend either wearing a mask or going outside for this next bit , the vapors can be dangerous . <p> First apply the plastic primer , I would highly recommend you use this as it will give the paint something more to stick to than just the light key scratches . You could skip the plastic primer stage , but if the part gets chipped the paint will start to flake off . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you can use a hairdryer to speed the process of drying . Remember , a light coat often is better than a heavy coat less often . Plastic primer is generally quite thin , so be careful not to get any runs . <p> Once the plastic primer is dry its time to apply the base coat . Again , use light overlapping strokes . Depending on the color , it may take anything from 3 to 8 coats to cover . Again , make sure you leave enough time between coats . <p> Once the color has completely covered the part , you can start to apply the lacquer . This is not a necessity , but it helps to protect the base coat and adds a shine ( if you chose gloss lacquer ) . <p> Apply this the same way as the base coat gradually building up the thickness of the lacquer . You 'll probably need about 4 or 5 coats of lacquer . <p> Leave the part for a good 3 or 4 hours before you try to polish and re-fit it . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good Luck <p> Notes : I used normal car paint . Do n't waste your money on so called ' plastic paints ' when all you really need is a good key and some plastic primer .

It had a long production run and is still regarded by many enthusiasts as a more reliable engine than the later 2.0 that replaced it . <p> The 1.9 TDi was used in a wide variety of cars from the VAG group and came in different power levels . <p> All had BOSCH injectors , and Bosch ECU 's which are really sturdy and very protective of the engine . <p> Common faults : there are some reports of the BLE or BXE engines breaking con rods . The second generation PD engines were bullet proof as most of the kinks had been worked out which is more than we can say for the later 2.0 TDI engines . <p> PD engines generally give a better power gain than the original TDi engines .

These include the GTB1749V producing upto 205bhp from just 1900rpm , and GTB1756V which is good for around 225 bhp . Some companies offer hybrid turbos which can push power levels to 240bhp or more with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require conversion to Vacuum actuators and have the VNT system set up .

Please note that WE DO NOT RECOMMEND INDUCTION KITS , unless you have tuned your car extensively and are finding that the standard air itnake has become a restriction .

On heavily tuned engines and turbo vehicles an induction kit will help release the power providing you address the problem of needing cold air . <p> Sports exhausts generally help improve air flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too large or you may end up will reduce the flow rate .

When you start tuning your Cruze you will often find that the standard clutch starts to fail so get an uprated clutch . Turbo engines are just asking to be Remapped . You will see big power gains on most modern turbochaged cars including diesels making a remap one of the most cost effective and big modifications for your money.Despite the large cost involved adding forced induction to a NASP engine will give large power gains . It is usually easier to bolt on a supercharger than it is to get a turbo working . Turbos give boost in exponential proportion to increasing engine speed and this can make mapping difficult . The nice steady boost to rpm characteristics of the supercharger make them easier to map .

@@24423475 @4423475/ <h> All you need to know about exhaust wraps <p> High engine bay temperatures are one of the biggest , and most often ignored , performance killers . <p> Ideally you want the engine to have a ready supply of cold air because it carries more oxygen than warm air , and because this allows you to burn more fuel you make more power . <p> Where does this heat come from ? Obviously the engine block gets quite hot but the real issue is actually the exhaust system . <p> The exhaust gets really hot and it readily gives up it 's heat to the engine bay . So one defence is to lag the exhaust which will help prevent the heat escaping within the engine bay . <p> You have 2 options which you can even combine but let 's look at a few myths first . <h> Myths about exhaust wraps <p> We all know that as hot metal gets altered at it 's molecular level with visible expansion , contracting and even glowing when it gets hot enough . This constant flex of the structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exhaust to prematurely age . <p> Ceramic coatings may look cool but in our tests thermal wraps give the best temperature reductions . - It pays to be thick ! <p> In reality a modern exhausts metal integrity will last for 20 years until it suffers from corrosion . Flexing and expanding does little to reduce the lifespan , so adding an exhaust wrap does little to reduce the life of an exhaust and may even increase it if it creates an air proof barrier preventing external rust to form . <p> It is fair to say that in a cheap or badly made exhaust you may get accelerated wear or cracked joints if it gets too hot - but do n't blame the wrap for that ! <p> In fact keeping the heat in the exhaust for longer will help to reduce the moisture content and will minimize the internal rusting . <p> Because you are keeping the exhaust gases hotter you will find they flow better out of the engine . Turbo owners may also experience slightly reduced lag as a result of the faster flowing exhaust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and need plenty of fresh oil . <p> So what are the 2 primary exhaust wrap options ? 1st there 's a thermal bandage type wrap . You simply wrap this around the exhaust . <h> How to apply thermal bandage type of exhaust wrap <p> It is important to keep the exhaust wrap- tight and overlap the previous layer slightly with each rotation . <p> Small gaps in the exhaust wrap will not affect the overall efficiency of the wrap- so you do n't have to be paranoid about coating the whole down pipe - joins , mounts and corners can be tricky . <p> The thicker the wrap the greater the insulation , so bear this in mind . <p> Your other option is the bonded ceramic coating . Ceramic is a very poor conductor of heat so is ideal to have on an exhaust where heat will be trapped inside . <p> A ceramic coating also looks much neater with a powder white/cream finish on the treated surfaces but other colors are available . <h> How to apply a ceramic exhaust coating . <p> Ceramic coatings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to chemically bond with the metal exhaust surface . <p> This is not the same as paint with ceramic particles . These types of high temperature paints are only fractionally effective compared to a proper ceramic coating . <p> Good preparation is key. - If the exhaust surface is poor then you will potentially suffer from peeling and flaking . Most ceramic coatings are applied to brand new exhausts for this reason . <p> You could apply both for the maximum effect ! A ceramic coating and a wrap will dramatically increase the thermal insulation of the exhaust . <p> How much will the under bonnet temperatures reduce ? There are claims of 30-40% for ceramic coatings and up to 60% for exhaust wraps . By combining both methods you could reasonably expect to achieve the 50% mark . <p> How much of the exhaust should be wrapped ? TorqueCars would expect the optimum effect would be to completely wrap the headers and down pipe upto and including the catalyst . <p> A hot catalyst is more efficient so your catalyst will last longer and work better if you apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay clean . <p> There is nothing stopping you from wrapping the entire length of the exhaust but you need to remember that the aim is to reduce the under bonnet temperature . <p> Other budget options which can be effective include using high temperature paint and silver foil . <p> You still cant beat something made for the purpose though in terms of cost to benefit . <p> Join us in our forum to discuss exhaust wraps in more details where our members will be able to pass on their tips and experiences . 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Some get past the compression rings , more so if worn hence why some cars throw alot of oil back through the breather but you will get some pressure in there as the pistons coming back down create pressure in the block and it has to go somewhere . Breathers also act as a valve to release the pressure caused by the cycling of the engine . All these fumes are meant to go back through the system and get burnt as they are a mixture of acids etc . <p> my breather is facing me ( behind the wheel ) and its on the rocker cover i have however put back on the oe air intake , and the fumes are gone , but as you say about the commpresion rings been worn , mine dosent burn oil at all , so are the crankcase breathers good or bad for my car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that good ? ? <p> I would say good , if you get excessive pressure , where will it go ? All performance engines use them as the engines are revving higher and more quickly . As I said everyone has it in their mind that only the head has compression , well so does the opposite end . The pistons are controlled in the bore to create compression when the valves are shut , so what happens when those same pistons are travelling back down ? They are creating pressure within the crankcase , it is not the same as the compression stroke as that is a pressure chamber , but the air has to go somewhere when it comes back . Too much pressure down below has to have an effect on the horsepower as the down stroke is acting like an air brake , so releasing the excessive air allows the crank to turn and the pistons to travel when the explosion thrown the pistons back down and then accelerate back up again . <p> I would say good , if you get excessive pressure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the engines are revving higher and more quickly .

@@24423481 @4423481/ <h> MX5 Performance Tuning tips <p> The Mazda MX5 ( also badged Eunos and Miata ) is what every small roadster should be . <p> They are superb at handling thanks in part to the great chassis design and the cars light weight . <p> It was an instant hit , when it was introduced in the late 80's/early 90 's and each model revision sees improvements . <p> Its back to basics approach captured the spirit of a fun roadster and won the car many fans . <p> One criticism thrown at the MX5 is the lack of power . Originally provided with just 2 engine options , a rather revvy and sporty sounding 1.6 and the slightly more powerful 1.8 . The first task then is to uprate the power . Thankfully Mazda have provided a good block which has substantial scope for improvement . <p> Internal modifications should include a fast road cam , ported and polished head with a 3 angle valve job . If budget allows then blueprinting and balancing the engine and fitting a low ratio gearbox will futher increase the cars appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily and it appears that the MX5 becomes quite a different beast with a slightly lighter 10lbs flywheel . ( NB : If the flywheel is too light then the car will be hard to drive in stop start traffic . ) <p> The clutch is a different story and should be the primary upgrade before any other MX5 engine tuning is attempted especially if the mileage is getting up there . <p> Small and nimble the only criticism is a lack of power , add some sensible tuning modifications and you have a world class roadster . <h> Engine mods <p> One popular mod on the MX5 is the addition of forced induction . For all those newbies who think you can just bolt on a turbo or supercharger we need to state the obvious here , you ca n't - a lot more is involved . <p> Whilst turbos can be added it seems slightly easier and makes economic sense to fit a supercharger . <p> You will find that turbo engines need quite a few extra parts namely an exhaust manifold , intake piping and ideally stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pretty much a bolt on and remap upgrade . <p> There is still a lot of debate or arguments between the MX5 turbo owners and supercharged owners as to which is the most cost effective , and which suits the car the most . <p> Dyno results are generally fairly similar but the power delivery is very much down to personal tastes . The supercharger has a linear smooth delivery and the turbo gives a fun wallop in the back part way up the rev range . When this is properly setup you can hit power figures in the order of 200 to 300bhp or around 250 bhp on stock internals . <p> The stock engine will also benefit from some basic tuning modifications . Most owners will add an induction kit although the benefits of this are questionable unless you also add a cold air feed pipe . A sports exhaust and sports catalyst will free up a few more horsepower on the NASP versions and even more if you have added forced induction with a bolt on turbo or supercharger kit . <h> Suspension and handling improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension can dramatically improve the handling . All older models will benefit from the fitment new rubber bushes ( bushings ) as these tighten up the suspension especially when there is old worn out soggy suspension components . It should be noted that some owners reported worse handling with polyeurothane bushes as these cut out the passive rear steer effect ( passive toe-in ) which makes these cars so much fun . <p> The standard brakes on the MX-5 are great considering it 's light weight of the car and most owners consider the expense of bigger brakes to be a waste of money . But for serious track days where you drive harder you should at least consider uprating the brakes . Fitting better pads will improve things but for the best effect you should really get a big brake disc conversion and 4,6 or 8 pot calipers . <p> Stick with 16 inch alloys for best performance although 17 inch alloys might look marginally better to many people , it will stuff the handling and performance , smaller wheels are better from a performance point of view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chassis and help to prevent flexing .

Do n't be tempted by the high spec multi plate race solution , unless you have substantial power to contend with , as it is not very well suited to domestic driving for most vehicle types . <p> Most clutches come with a power rating - if your engines output is greater than the rated power of the clutch you will experience clutch slip ( see below for explanation ) while you are accelerating and the clutch will wear out very quickly .

Badly fitted clutches will usually fail very quickly , they must be aligned and you need to replace all parts of the clutch assembly , not just the friction plates . <h> What is Clutch Slip <p> When you accelerate you see a rise in engine speed but no pull on the car , you may also note a burning smell . It may also squeal and take a while to engage after a gear change . Clutch Slip is a bit like pulling a table cloth off a table and all the crockery staying in place .

Gear changes became more and more notchy - particularly the 1st and 2nd gear . <p> A new clutch almost sorted the problem but permanent damage to the synchromesh has been done and 1st remained notchy . Get a problem sorted out as soon as it manifests itself . <p> When adjusting a hydraulic clutch remove the mats from the car - particularly if they are thick because this can reduce the pedal travel significantly and will make the clutch appear to wear out much sooner . <h> How to tell if the clutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually start to slip or even seem sticky , not fully engaging or disengaging . Initially just First and then Second gear will become increasingly hard to select . <p> Eventually the car will stall every time you try to put it in gear from stationary ( if your lucky 3rd and 4th might still work and you can limp to a garage ) . New clutch - New Cable - New release bearing DO NOT CUT CORNERS ! <p> If your clutch has gone you can generally engage 3rd and 4th easily without using the clutch if you carefully match your engine speed to the gear you select ' providing the car is moving ' - I drove 400 miles including a stint on the M25 with a dodgy clutch cable changing gear just 20 times , and because I did n't stop the car and kept in 3rd and 4th gears I got home - I consider myself to be really lucky . <p> Do n't forget that the clutch can become ' stuck on ' when the hydraulic fluid leaks from a hydraulic operated clutch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinder sticks . A much easier job replacing either the master or slave cylinders than the clutch so investigate this first . <p> One other thing when you do replace a clutch is to watch out for the release bearing ' cage ' which is usually plastic nowadays .

Stone chips lead to pitted paint work that looks unsightly and can easily start to rust . <p> Invisible repairs to stone chips take time and patience . <p> Take your time - a good invisible stone chip repair requires more patience than skill ! <p> Step 1 : Clean out the area using a solvent cleaner such as IPA or similar . This is especially important if the chip has gone through to the metalwork below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take hold . <p> The new paint will not adhere unless all residue , dust grime and film are removed . If the chip goes down to the bare metal you need to clean thoroughly with a small wire brush , a fiberglass tipped pen or even a sharp metal knife . Take care not to make the damage deeper . <p> If rust has started to form , scrape away all of the rust and include an area around the rust spot to ensure that no small traces of rust remain . Coat the exposed area with a rust inhibitor such as Curite or Kurust . This transforms rust into a stable surface to paint on and inhibits rust formation . <p> Step 2 : Paint selection . Car manufacturers spray panels with an undercoat , a main coat ( sometimes several layers ) and , in the case of some metallic or special finishes , a top coat of clear lacquer . A successful stone chip repair needs to replicate these layers . <p> The thinner the paint the better . Many touch up paints are too thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish . I have found that the ' nail varnish ' style touch up pots work the best . <p> Step 3 : Base coat . Choose a lighter colored base coat for light top coats but any color for darker paints . Apply a thin layer of the base coat . Then wipe away any excess base coat from the surrounding area . Take care not to smudge it . Leave it for at least an hour to dry . <p> Step 4 : Main coat . Build up the main coat with 3-8 very thin layers . Leave for at least an hour between coats ( thin coats will generally dry in this time ) . Carefully wipe away any excess paint from the surrounding area . When you have finished , the new paint should be very slightly higher than the surrounding paint work . <p> Step 5 : Finishing the surface . Wait at least 3-4 hours after applying the last coat of main coat before finishing . Smooth the surface with a fine grit wet and dry paper . Start with a fine grade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper wet with a sanding block . The chip is only small , so use a small piece of sand paper and a tiny sanding block such as the end of a carpenters pencil or similar . This should take the layers of new paint down the the level of the surrounding paint work . <p> Step 6 : Blending . Use a rubbing or cutting paste and gradually rub over the area . Blend in the new paint with the faded paint on the car using a gentle circular motion . <p> Step 7 : Top coat . If you have metallic paint then add the final top lacquer coat . Again smooth with a fine grit wet and dry paper with a mini sanding block . Repeat the blending in with a rubbing or cutting paste . <p> Long Scratches <p> Long scratches can be repaired in a similar way to stone chips but take a lot more patience .

@@24423488 @4423488/ <h> My bog standard 1.8tdci 115bhp focus needs improving <p> I want to make my focus faster and more powerful ( ideally without worsening mpg ) ... just wondering what the most cost effective way of doing so is ? I hear there are some really good tuning boxes out there but the good ones seem to be about -300 , is an ECU remap a better option ? although i have heard there maybe bad consequences of the remap . Any help much appreciated ... you will definitely know more than i do . <p> Cheers mate ... well troubles with the clutch but i 've also heard that the engine life decreases , more of an issue with slightly older cars , mine has done about 80,000 miles and its an ' 03 model . The tuning boxes just seem a safer option . ta <p> the tuning boxes ( unless they connect to alot of sensors ) are the worst you can do . <p> a proper remap will be tailored to the car to take into effect all circumstances most remaps wo n't damage the clutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn then really starts to slip under the extra torque . engine life again is more effected as people will boot the engines from cold which decreass life in all cars , as long as you let the car warm up properly before having fun with it and let it idle for a few mins before switching off will help <p> sorry to highjack the thread but i also have a tdci 1.8 focus and apart from a remap giving about 30bhp , what else could i do ? i have thought of de-cat exhaust , performance air intake and filters , manifold , which could give between 10-20 any ideas on where to find a good air intake etc ? or any other idea <p> not really answering your question but how much was your ecu remap ? is performance much better now ? i have a mk1 focus so might not work so well . As for hijacking the thread go for it mate , i need all the advice i can get . <p> watch the txt speak jet . a decent remap will set you back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . generally diesel intakes and exhausts are pretty already high flowing and so do n't  gain much from it . do they have an intercooler fitted ? if not get one fitted before going for the remap as this will lower the intake temps allowing you to free up more power <p> That 's quite a lot really , but that depends on how much a decent turbo kit would set me back . I think that a rolling road session would be a good thing to do . Thanks for the advice on the intercooler , that sounds like a smart option . <p> that 's too much for me , bet it works wonders though . Think that I 'll just go for the remap and intercooler . Your bora is going to fly ! what are you hoping to get your bhp up to ? how fast is it to 60 would you say ? <p> i 'm not going down the BT route . currently 0-60 is around 7.6 standard ill say i could get around 7.3 with the suble mods ive done . although this would quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as want to keep it reliably and not too thirsty . <p> just for info 0-60 means nothing at all , more important is stuff like 30-60 50-70 , the stuff you do alot of inreal life driving , like i said above doing 0-60 will wreak clutch and drivetrain along with your tyres <p> I absolutely agree that those stats are more important than 0-62 , because its much more realistic , but 0-62 is easy to understand because its the most commonly used if you get me . That 's the area that i want to improve the most in my car ; the acceleration from the likes of 30-60mph and the acceleration from when you put your foot down in the mid-gears . A lot of focus drivers will hate me for saying this , but i found that a 1.9 mk 4 golf with the same bhp as my focus so much better in this area , it does have quite a bit more torque . 30-60 in 3.5 is awesome . i would love for my focus to be able to do that . Keep going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what your saying about mpg and all that , sounds spot on right now . <p> a intercooler , is just a radiator but has air instead of water running through it , when anything gets colder it gets smaller and denser this means you have more air and there for more oxygen in the cylinder giving you more power . so having a bigger one will reduce the temperature of the air further . price depends on size and quality from a few hundred up to alot more ! ! <p> the new air filter/ induction kit alows more air again to reach the engine , think of it like this breathing normally is easy , put your tshirt over your mouth and it is a little bit more difficult , now go get a thick jumper and try again it gets harder . the new filter/induction kit is the tshirt in comparison to your standard filter which is the jumper . <p> also with an inductuion kit you can mount the air intake as low as possible air gets densers the closer to the ground due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the weekend and a new intercooler next month ill keep this thread up to date on my progress <p> that 's really cleared things up , thanks for that mate . I 'm loving the analogies with the jumper and tshirt definitely makes it easier to understand . I 've heard that itg air filters are pretty good value for money , think they are about -45 and add 5-10bhp . Let me know how it goes with the induction kit and intercooler . <p> be warned however too big an intercooler will cause more lag as there is more air to pressurise so its not a case of going for the biggest one possible <p> filters again -45 wil by you a decent panel filter , cone or a cheap induction kit . none will give you 10bhp most panel filters will only give you about 2-3bhp but a more responsive feel . a decent cold air kit is around -150+ even then on most car your only talking 5 ponies . itg do do some good kits but not for -45 and do n't  bother with ebay most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted you might notice a difference by having a front mount the same size as there is a better airflow going through the fins rather than the smaller amount that gets through the side . would n't advise twice as big as you will suffer more lag , and the turbo will have to work harder which in turn could shorten its life due to running full boost for longer <p> remember it also comes down to how it was designed . some are build cheaply but cause alot of turbulence in the cooler rather than the air flowing freely through it

These are usually mounted directly on top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugs . <p> A faulty coil can also reduce the spark voltage to the point that no spark happens and you end up with a misfire . If you have just one coil and it fails completely your engine will not work .

@@24423496 @4423496/ <h> Choosing an A4 for tuning <p> " Tuning the A4 range of cars . " <p> The A4 range from 1995 continuing the Audi range of high quality executive cars . In the A4 Audi had a car which rivals the BMW 3 series , albeit without the image . The range includes a selection of body styles from the Saloon to the Estate model . Reliability is up to the usual high Audi standards and the huge range of engine choices ensure there is a model suitable for most drivers needs . <p> The A4 is the Audi take on the executive car - something which they have executed very well . <p> From a tuning point of view on the A4 range we would recommend the 1.8T power plant which really does stand out as the tuners choice . This engine also came as a Quattro option , losing a bit of economy and acceleration but gaining so much extra traction . The 1.8T provides a good mix of economy and power . <p> This was later replaced with the superb 2.0 TFSi engine , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remap yields a power figure approaching 270bhp . Later Quattro models were released with a 220bhp engine ( BUL code in the LeMans and Limited edition models - it 's well worth tracking down one of these if you can ) . <p> In the diesel line up we have a maximum power of 150bhp in the 2.5 TDi which provides plenty of scope for power gains when remapped . All other TDi models will benefit from a remap although only the 2.5 TDi will get a large gain for a minimal outlay . <p> As far as performance models go the early S4 Quattro and the recent RS4 put Audi back at the forefront as creators of a car which every driver wants . Some may complain that the S4 and RS4 models are ordinary looking but this car appeals to the driver who does n't want to draw attention to himself making the A4 range a car for the purists . <p> The car was updated in 2001 , the floor pan was extended a little , and a whole selection of more powerful engine options were introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio with the A4 Quattro hitting 220bhp by 2006 , and Diesel tuners have a selection of 2.5TDi engines ranging from 163 to 180 bhp which are just begging for a remap . A 3.0 NASP petrol engine gave a range topping 220bhp ( until the reincarnation of the mighty S4 ) but is not particularly economical . <p> When buying an A4 avoid the low spec basic models as these are hard to resell , get the S line or limited edition models with leather seats . <p> The Quattro models and Avant models hold their value better and are the most sought after . <p> There are some minor weak spots on the 2.0 TFSi and DPF equipped engines to look out for . Firstly you must use the correct oil specification , failing to do so is just asking for trouble . <p> DPF equipped diesel engines : If you only drive short distances and the engine does n't warm up the DPF filters are known to clog . Even motorway runs are sometimes not enough to clear it all out . Running the car at high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it also pays to drive it fairly hard . Cars that are driven carefully and at the lower RPM band tend to suffer more from soot build up . <p> The 2.0 TFSi engines are very strong and provide excellent power to economy but you need to watch out for 2 things that will eventually go wrong . If you catch this early enough you will avoid problems and should regard these as service items . ( Later engines address these issues to a large degree . ) <p> Firstly the cam follower that drives the mechanical fuel pump has a special dark low friction coating on it . It looks a bit like a thimble that sits on the bottom of the fuel pump . Check this every 30,000 miles for wear . If the coating has worn down and exposes a metal surface this will quite quickly wear through the follower and the cam shaft will become worn resulting in lost fuel pump pressure . It is a simple check and as long as you are careful about the extremely high fuel pump pressures is a simple DIY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spark plugs . <p> Secondly the direct injection engine suffers from carbon build up on the valves . The fuel is not being injected over the valves so there is effectively no cleaning taking place . Most direct injection engines suffer from this and after 70,000 miles a decoke is recommended . The RS4 engine with direct injection is even more prone to carbon build up . The carbon build up will rob you of power rather than do any major damage but cleaning out the head will dramatically increase the performance . <p> We have seen no evidence to suggest that water/alcohol injection sufficiently cleans the intake valves . Running fuel cleaner also does very little as the fuel does not get sprayed on the intake . <p> They say prevention is better than cure so what can be done to prevent this carbon build up issue . Using good quality clean burn fuel free of bio elements , the higher octane fuels also tend to burn cleaner . Get the engine up to temperature as soon as you can ( do n't idle it but just drive it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the engine operating at 3000rpm for 15 minutes per week . At this RPM range the engine is designed to run hotter and this can help burn off some of the carbon deposits . <p> Keep an eye on the recirculation valve , the oil this sprays into the intake when it goes is cited as a major cause of the carbon build up . If you notice high oil consumption then get this valve checked ASAP . <p> Cleaning the head is usually done by removal and refitting but we have seen some excellent results from intake cleaners that are sprayed at high pressure into the intake . An inspection probe through the intake or via the spark plugs will give an indication on the state of carbon build up . The DIY spray cans of carbon cleaner do at best a minor job , the trick is delivering the cleaner evenly to all of the valves . For best results take off the intake manifold and spray the cleaner directly onto the problem area and leave it to soak . ( Always follow the manufacturers instructions though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be left on for long periods of time . ) <p> The VAG group are researching self cleaning valves with catalytic coatings , small amounts of fuel sprayed in the intake and " leaking valves " to help burn off the deposits . <p> On the A4 we suggest sticking with 18 inch wheels , although the 19 's look nice they do suffer from tram lining and are quite heavy . The wheel size can be adjusted via an OBD menu option to ensure the speedo is accurate , so when you change wheels consult your dealer and ensure that the studs used are correct . <p> To read our tuning tips , engine tuning tips see our tuning articles and please join our forum where you can chat and swap ideas and tips with other enthusiastic Audi A4 owners . <p> This @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

@@24423498 @4423498/ <p> I used to use my foot on the accelerator but it should n't really be needed with the choke out fully . I 've had quite a few cars with a manual choke but most of them did n't even need it provided services and plugs and such were all in tip top condition . <p> Haha my dad started telling me all about this last night funnily enough , he said it was only needed in cold days and you just pulled it out before starting the engine . I 'm guessing each car verys though . <p> Petrol engines usually need a richer than standard fuel/air mixture for cold starting . Ie. more fuel than would be required per unit of air when running fully warm . <p> Modern cars are totally self regulating and the drifer is unaware of the process , apart from a slightly high idle speed when the engine is cold . <p> A choke , in the really old days of SU and Stromberg carbs , literally choked off the airflow upstream of the throttle butterfly . The increase in vacuum density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) caused more fuel to be drawn from the fuel metering jets within the carburettor body . <p> THe need for extra fuel is because at low engine temperatures the airborne fuel mist would condense on the intake manifold walls , thus , starving the engine of fuel and causing stalling . <p> Cars with sequential injection need much less help as the injectors generally deliver fuel to the back of the inlet valves just before the valves open . So the condensation problem is largely removed . But the mixture still is slightly richer than normal at this point . This is achieved without ' choking ' the engine now . The ECU simply directs the injectors to deliver slighty more fuel than normal . <p> A higher idle speed is often still set to encourage swift warm up which means that the car is running optimally very soon after a cold start .

I think mine was a Vauxhall Carlton 2.2CDi on a B plate . I never had any classics like the Triumph Pi etc , most of classics were of the carb and twin carb variety . <p> IIRC I had three cars with manual chokes - the 1st , a Vitesse . As you pulled out the choke , you could feel the accelerator being pulled away from your foot , which I guess is how the revs were raised . The 2nd , a Midget has twin SUs , where the extra fuelling came from lowering the needle valve seats inside the carbs , so that more petrol came in for less vacuum/air flow ( I think ) . the 3rd was a Mini 1000 .

Expect to paint the bonnet when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to protect the cut against corrosion . <p> Plan your cut carefully and mark it out with some heavy duty masking tape .

Next we need to balance the weight using a rear parcel shelf stay / spring mechanism . <p> The idea of the stay is to give a smooth opening action and reduces the amount of spring strength required . Hinges must be fitted to the outside edges of the bonnet and then you should connect them to the car ensuring they open without fouling up and leave a nice even join where the 2 halves meet .

A specialist will generally do these in a few hours for you . The tyres are removed , the wheels are rubbed down . Any nicks and scratches are filled with a specialist alloy wheel protector that acts like a liquid metal setting hard . Then the wheel is spray painted . The most common colours are silver and chrome but white and black can look very effective . You need to be careful what paint you use as the rims can get quite hot and if the surface is not keyed and prepared the paint will flake off . 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Stage 3 ( competition ) mods just wo n't work well on the road as it makes the car hard to control in slow traffic . <p> Your aims when modding your car should be a nice flat torque curve . You want to avoid sending all the torque to be at the top end of the rev range unless you are creating a motorsport car .

You 'd need to follow a cam upgrade with other mods and finish with a reflashed ECU for the best performance gains.You will need to ensure that the engine is not starved of fuel so will need to uprate the fueling . If you find you experience flat spots and power surges after your mods you should check the fueling and try a higher octane fuel as well . To get sufficient fuel you may need to uprate the injectors on your engine . Uprate the fuel pump to cope with the extra fuel requirements of your tuned Picanto 's uprated injectors. 38228 @qwx238228 <p> The next area for modification is the intake and exhaust . Please note that WE DO NOT RECOMMEND INDUCTION KITS , unless you have tuned your car extensively and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restriction . Maximum power gains come from a full induction kit with a cold air feed on heavily tuned , large capacity engines This can be sited within an air box but a panel filter should suffice for most applications . TorqueCars suggest you use a panel air filter as these are easy to clean and maintain and generally perform better than paper ones . <p> Sports exhausts balance the flow of air through the engine . But if your exhaust is too big , i.e. it 's over 1 inch bore , you will lose a great deal of the flow rate and end up lacking power and torque . <p> Getting the cylinder head flowed ( ported and polished ) will further help more air into each cylinder . This is definitely a job for a professional with a flow bench . <p> A good heavy duty fast road performance clutch will help to keep that power going where it should . Never make false economies or expect a standard OEM clutch to cope . <p> Turbo engines are just crying out to be Reprogrammed . You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including diesels making a remap one of the most cost effective and large modifications for your money . <p> The most phenomenal power gains for NASP engines usually involve the addition of forced induction . It is usually easier to add a supercharger than it is to get a turbo working . Turbos provide boost in exponential proportion to rising engine speed and this can make mapping difficult . The nice proportional boost and rpm characteristics of the supercharger make them easier to map . To cope with forced induction you will usually need to decrease the engines compression ratio . 38226 @qwx238226 38229 @qwx238229 38231 @qwx238231 38235 @qwx238235 <p> This <h> Feedback 38237 @qwx238237 <p> Great stuff , i never knew that there is a picanto forum especially for mods .

Engine swaps to these larger engines are a good option if you have a small engine size . <h> Citroen C2 Tuning modifications . <p> Peak power is all well and good but a drivable and fun car needs a wide power band and lots of low down torque . A fast road cam will be one of the best power mods you can do mechanically to your engine . When pushing up the power you will need to pay attention to the fueling . More power needs more fuel . A fuel pressure boost valve can make the car more responsive and respond better although it will not increase the power output . To get sufficient fuel you may need to uprate the injectors on your engine . A fuel pump will only deliver a finite amount of fuel , so you may need to uprate this if your injectors are demanding more fuel . <h> Citroen C2 Intake and Exhaust Tuning . <p> Now we move on to the intake and exhaust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well on turbo engines and larger engines ( if supplied with a suitable cold air feed or air box ) , for the smaller C2 engines you should go with a sports panel air filter .

Leave this to a professional though with a proper flow bench and machine tools Your clutch can seriously let you down if it starts to slip and the standard clutches are only ever good for power gains of upto 50% . Fit an uprated clutch to avoid power losses through the transmission . <p> If you own one of the HDi Diesels engines based on the Ford DLD engine you can eaily up the power by applying a remap , these offer significant power gains on all turbo charged cars and keep the reliability and fuel economy you bought the C2 for . <p> On the Petrol engines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remap on a NASP engine will help unleash the potential if you have done a lot of mods perhaps adding another 10 or so bhp . <p> If you are power mad then adding forced induction will see big power gains but this is usually too expensive to be cost effective . Turbos are harder to add than supercharger because on a turbo the boost curve is related exponentially to the engine speed and this makes it hard to map . It is easier to map a supercharger because the boost is proportional to engine speed on a linear curve . Decreasing the engines compression ratio will allow you to add forced induction , water injection may also help prevent detonation . <p> We recommend a specialist who can setup the mapping and provide a full supercharger or turbo kit for your C2 .

@@24423510 @4423510/ <h> Chrome Paint <p> Until recently the only way to get a highly shiny chrome finish was to actually chrome plate the vehicle . <p> Think of chrome like a mirror finish which can have additional tints added to make gold or other colours . <p> It can be a bit too much to have a fully chromed vehicle as the reflections caused will most likely dazzle other road users . But it provides an excellent base coat for other artwork allowing the chrome to shine through as a highlight . <p> Chrome has been used to great effect on motorsports cars or as a base for advertising or sign writing . <p> First up here is an overview of the chrome painting process , first you apply a dark base coat , then the chrome is sprayed onto this and built up but must not completely cover the base coat , finally a clear coat is added which can have a tint or pigment in it and this gives the chrome a colour . <p> See the examples below for colour variations where the same chrome paint was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Chrome paint looks stunning , it is available with any tint ( or range of tints ) you can imagine but it is a specialist only application . <p> Preparation is always key . Application of too much or too thin a coat of chrome paint will result in a dull metallic look . The dull pewter look is fine if that is what you are after but as this can be achieved with grey paint it seems a waste . <p> Drying times and application environment also have a large bearing on the quality of finish . <p> We spoke with the owner of Chromed Up and asked him to give us some insights into his area of expertise . <p> If you look at a chrome painted car under a microscope you will see the tiny droplets of chrome paint do not cover the base coat entirely . The image on the left is a simulation but shows how the droplets of chrome need to let through some base coat to create a shine . <p> The amount of shine is actually determined by the contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chrome depth and adds to the reflection . If the base coat is completely obscured you will not get a shine or reflection at all and instead get a dull Pewter finish . <p> Step 1 . Prepare the car thoroughly and give the surface a good key . The more time taken at this stage the better as chrome will show up imperfections and bumps far more than any other paint finish . <p> Step 2 . Spraying on the dark base coat . This dark base coat needs to be a good contrast with the final colour . Black is usually the best but for some top tints you may want to choose another dark colour . Apply a good mist layer of base coat and repeat allowing it to build up and completely cover the base surface . <p> Step 3 . Bake the car in an oven to reduce the drying time . This sets the paint and allows the next layer of chrome paint to go on more easily . <p> Step 4 . Spray on a very fine mist coating of the chrome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oven , then apply another 2 or 3 mist coats and bake each coat again . <p> The idea here is to keep adding paint until the desired chrome finish is achieved . You ca n't remove paint once applied so you have to take your time . <p> It is this stage that takes a great amount of skill and you need a real feel for what you are doing . If the baking is not done right you will not get a very good chrome finish at all . It is for this reason that chrome paint is out of reach for the DIY spray painter . ( At least for the moment . ) <p> Step 5 . This is the application of a protective clear coat . If you want a gold or indeed any other finish you can add some paint to tint this clear coat and the chrome reflectiveness will remain but carry the tint of the clear coat . <p> Finally when you have your finished chrome vehicle you can add all sorts of interesting designs and colours to it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been allowed to show through for the robots and sprayed art has been applied over the top . <p> We wish to thank Steve from Chromed Up ( suppliers of chrome paint ) and Lawrence aka Kaos ( spray paint artist ) for their help and support in putting together this article . <p> When chrome is combined with sprayed art or other special effect finishes you have a stunning end result . Chrome paint is quite expensive so we suggest you carefully research this and find a paint sprayer used to working with chrome paint . 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

@@24423515 @4423515/ <h> RX8 Tuning Tips <p> " Renesis Renaissance " <p> Mazda had great success with the RX7 and proved that a rotary engined car can be fun to drive . The successor came in the form the lovely RX8 . It was leaps and bounds better than the RX7 in many respects . <p> The angular lines , edgy design and interior trim all won the hearts of RX8 around the world . Mazda updated the 13b Wankel engine creating the innovative Renesis rotary engine . <p> Tuning the RX8 rotary engine is considered difficult by some but there are a few options that can transform the RX8 performance . <p> The benefits of a rotary engine include the ability to provide high rpm tolerances and a silky smooth power delivery . Problems though include a lack of low down torque at low RPM but when driven correctly these cars have a lot to give . Standard power figures of around 200bhp from a 1300cc engine really pushes the envelope of what is possible . <p> Your RX8 tuning should start off with some improvements to the handling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends and give a progressive brake feel . The car can be lowered around 35 mm . We would recommend adjustable suspension so you can set the damping and spring rates to suit your driver preference . <p> The engines need to be properly looked after and serviced regularly . Do not let the unusual rotary engine put you off . These are much better than early rotary engines and are every bit as flexible and reliable as a reciprocating piston setup . <p> The RX8 is just crying out for a turbo conversion and this is probably one of the few " bolt on " options although it can prove expensive . A turbo will raise the standard power to around 400bhp ! Sadly in the real world there is a lot more to it than just bolting on a turbo . A whole host of other components will need uprating and strengthening and the mapping will need to be spot on . <p> The 4 port engines are more suited to turbo charging than the 6 port ones but both conversions require a lot of work and planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained a full kit and have facilities to run a custom map . Obvious power mods for a turbo RX8 would include a larger front mounted intercooler . The intercooler can suffer from heat soak on long runs so channelling lots of fresh air through this will pay dividends . Power can also be increased with the addition of a larger turbo or a turbo with higher performing internals ( a hybrid ) . <p> Engine heat build up is a massive problem when adding forced induction and a larger oil pan and even an oil cooler will help address this issue . It would also pay to get the exhaust down pipes coated or wrapped to contain the heat . <p> Further engine cooling mods will include an uprated water pump and thermostat , and use of a synthetic water cooler additive with some high performance silicone hoses to avoid leaks from higher pressures . <p> When pushing larger power gains you will also need to uprate the fuel delivery system to prevent the engine from running lean - if anything these engines prefer to run rich . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without much success . Hopefully RX8 remaps will become available . <p> The best option we could find is fitting a full aftermarket engine management system . This allows you to fine tune the timing and fuel delivery for the maximum power gain and this will also allow you to factor in any other mods you have done . On a standard car with an aftermarket engine management system you can see power gains of around 2-5% . <p> Porting the Renesis engines , if done properly , can have a big impact on the power delivery and torque curve . This is not a simple job though and is only really worth doing if you are already stripping down and rebuilding the engine . Lapping the flat housings and adding high quality ceramic seals are considered important mods here , and dynamic engine balancing will also help you reach higher power gains retaining reliability . <p> A sports exhaust and induction kit can help provide power gains a little , but in the opinion of TorqueCars members , the standard setup is pretty good and gains are only noticeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not many 200bhp NASP 1.3 engines out there so you have something special in the RX8 and the nature of the way the engine works means it is ideally suited to hydrogen as fuel ! ( Perhaps this dream may become a reality one day but for now I guess we have to stick with petrol ! ) <p> Adding a sports cat will also free up a bit more power , on the Renesis these little gains all add up quite effectively . <p> Reducing the weight of the flywheel to around 9 lb 's seems to be a popular choice and does change the nature of the engine quite a bit , but we should add not always to the taste of drivers , try one fitted to an RX8 first before you commit yourself here . <p> Hi ive got a 08 rx8 and she just got 100 thousand on engine , i love the handling even as stock .

Some of our members who own the Mazda 6 have added larger alloy wheels but for the best performance stick with the standard size wheel or get a larger alloy and fit ultra low profile tyres to it . In any case we would prefer to stick to 16 or 17inch rims on the Mazda 6 . <p> Remaps do not offer much of a gain on the NASP engines but when combined with other modifications it can really improve the acceleration and release the maximum power from all your other modifications . <p> A replacement aftermarket ECU seems to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our Mazda forum to see what the latest recommended mods are .

However if you have the time and patience and the right tools you can actually do some repairs to your alloy wheels and bring them back to an as new condition . <p> There are a number of professional and mobile alloy wheel repair services around , and for what they charge it is usually worth calling them in if you have a complete set of wheels that needs attention . <p> If your wheels have only minor damage and you fancy going the DIY route then we shall outline the methods involved using a readily available kit . <p> Unsightly alloys ruin a cars appearance so we look at DIY alloy wheel repairs and the steps required to finish them . <p> Damage to wheels will generally lift the paint layer and will allow corrosion to set in causing the wheel to bubble and blister . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the deeper it goes the harder it is to repair it . <p> The basic method of repair is sand or file down any raised areas and apply filler to any depressed regions giving a smooth finish and then applying some paint to finish the job . <p> Here we have some particularly nasty alloys where the paint has bubbled and corrosion has set in along with all the minor scrapes and scuffs around the rim . <p> Step 1 Preparation . <p> Taking off the wheels and tyres is obviously the way to get a much better finish but if time does not allow this you can do an adequate job with the wheels on the car . <p> Inspect the wheel for cracks and stress fractures , these can not be safely repaired and the wheel should be replaced . <p> Step 2 Cleaning <p> This is key really and you should strip off all the brake dust and road grime that has built up on the wheel otherwise the new paint will not adhere properly and will just flake off .

Mini for example do n't even specify an oil change until the first service is due ( at least a year from new ! ) This makes no sense to me whatsoever ? <p> Can an engine be run in on a rolling road effectively ? <p> I prescribe to the high load low RPM driving to get everything bedded in , lots of steep hills and stop start driving . <p> Interesting thread . Years ago when I built engines I used to take it easy for around 1500 miles , low revs etc and then another 1500 miles opening it up gradually and then progessive use . During that time I would carry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build that may still be in the block after the machining , generally the first change within 100 miles to make sure . Then again these were not your normal small production engines but tuned ones . I remember when I rebuilt my HSX Chevette engine it was so hard to drive that at low revs and slow for so long ! I even remember being at Castle Combe watching my mates racing around and them asking why I was n't out on track . I used that day to run some more miles on it , but not on track . <p> When I was racing the Audi GT we never rebuilt our engines using new shells , we always purchased engines with at least 80k miles on them as that was found to be the best run-in period ! We would strip and rebuild them using the original bearings . Never lost an engine in that time doing it this way . We built a few new ones and even after a run-in period they siezed on track as they were still too tight . Even an expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 miles around Goodwood , bent the crank ! Supposed to have been bedded in . <p> When I bought a new Picasso I can recall that having a run-in period of around 1500 miles of ' soft ' use before opening it up gradually . <p> I guess these days I would still follow the old principles of staged run-in periods and frequent oil changes and do this with normal driving with varying loads and conditions . I do n't think a rolling road run-in would be ideal but having never done it that way I ca n't really comment . <p> Just drive it normally really . Do n't go mad with revs first 500 or so miles and try to drive at differing loads and engine speeds . So if you 're on a M/way at 70mph , drop to 3rd for 20 minutes or so to vary the engine speed . <p> Avoid heavy load ( full throttle ) operation . <p> Oil should be left alone if this is what the manufacturer states . Many cars bed in on mineral or semi and only get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacturer tells me I 'd get an oil and filter change done at 200-500 miles if I had a new car or new engine . <p> The key I think is to vary the load , some motorway some town with a bit of stop start . It is very important to warm the engine up , lots of short journeys on a cold engine would surely kill the whole point of a run in period . <p> I 've heard that the fast run in method can lead to blown oil seals on car engines . I think it has something to do with " blow by " round the piston before it beds in but I 'd be curious to know if anyone can she 'd any light on this . <p> Stop and think about what is happening during the break-in period .

How many of us have perfectly calibrated torque wrenches ?

We need to let them wear slightly to create the perfect hydrodynamic cushion of oil without turbulence or cavitation . We probably have cylinders that are not perfectly honed and need the rings to seat against them . The soft lead on the top surface of the bearing is meant to wear to the point of making the cavity as round and smooth as possible so the oil can form its cushion . <p> I 'd rather have all that happening with little extreme pressure , and change out the oil at 50 km and 800 or so at least . <p> If you push hard and do n't have a perfect circle in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Which it is . And not so clever for the buyer of a 3 yr old car which has perhaps only been serviced once , maybe not at all in the case of low annual mileage . <p> Well , I 'd never have believed that , would I now ?

Do n't forget to uprate the fueling when you are increasing the power beyond 200bhp . Generally speaking the Starlet turbo is nicely setup and it only takes a few tweaks to make it a fun track day car . <p> Paying attention to the head you need to ensure good flow of air , so porting and polishing the head and getting it gas flowed provides a nice usable base to work from . Big valve conversions are another option and feed more air into the engine . You need to be careful that any head work matches your chosen cam profile . <h> Toyota Starlet Intake and Exhaust . <p> Breathing mods are usually next up .

The sports cats give a very similar gain to the decat . <p> In nearly all cases of serious Starlet tuning your clutch will start to slip and this needs to be uprated - read our article on clutches for more information . NASP engines do not achieve big power gains if you remap them but with turbo engines this is another story . A remapped turbo engine will give a phenomenal power gain . If you raise the boost levels too high you might suffer from knock but this can be countered with a water injection kit . <p> A front mounted intercooler will further benefit the engine , cooling the heat generated by compression within the turbo . <p> The turbo itself can be uprated either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself or by getting your OEM turbo with uprated internals ( known as a hybrid ) . In all cases get a turbo with ball bearings rather than thrust bearings as these last longer and spool up more quickly plus they last a lot longer . <p> The engine should be strengthened if you want to go beyond 200bhp and we would recommend cryogenic treatments as well if you are serious about having reliable power .

Power comes on at around 2000rpm and the car pulls well up to 6000rpm . A set of fast road cams offer one of the biggest performance gains as far as a bolt on part goes . You will need to ensure that the engine is not starved of fuel so will need to uprate the fueling . <p> Uprating the injectors is another beneficial modification and will deliver sufficient fuel . A fuel pump will only deliver a finite amount of fuel , so you may need to uprate this if your injectors are demanding more fuel . There is also the possibility of dropping in the more recent TFSi engines for a straight power upgrade and better tuning platform . <p> You can still perform the modifications we recommend to the 1.6 and 1.8 engines but you should only expect a modest power gain of 10-20% , for the same amount of money you could do an engine swap to the 1.8 Turbo and get an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on improving the handling and braking of the smaller engined Octavia models . This will create a fun car that is good in the corners . <p> The VAG 1.8 Turbo engines were stunning , a real favourite of ours , and a simple remap is all you need to raise the power from 170bhp to around 225 bhp or more . Fitting a larger turbo , many choose the KO4 or KO3s will raise the potential as the standard KO3 runs out of puff quite early on ( around 5500rpm ) . To retain economy use a fairly aggressive mapping from around 3200 rpm and keep the lower rpm range in a more conservative setting , this will help to avoid wheel spin . <p> On the 1.8T engines it also pays to get a heavy duty recirculating diverter valve ( blow off valves have caused error codes to show ) and we would also uprate the intercooler . The 1.8 Turbo engine has been used in a number of powerful applications including the sporty Audi TT and can cope with power figures of upto 300bhp and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1.8T 225bhp and 150bhp engines are in the head and intake . Swapping the head will help lift the performance potential of the 1.8T and a custom remap can squeeze out a little more of your other mods as well . <p> The diesel engines lend themselves very nicely to a remap and have another 30% power gain to give on standard internals . Uprate the intercooler and exhaust for further gains . <h> Audi S3 Intake and Exhaust Tuning . <p> The next area for modification is the intake and exhaust . Derestricting the airflow into the engine is the primary part of tuning so get a better flowing air filter . Induction kits sound great but due to the warm air in the engine bay they will not add noticeable power and actually rob you of power . Sports exhausts will certainly help air flow through the engine but do not go too large or you will reduce the flow rate .

NASP engines do not achieve big power gains if you remap them , unless you have done extensive modifications . With turbocharged engines this is another story . <p> A remapped turbo will give phenomenal power gains and take full advantage of the strength of the block . Adding forced induction will see big power gains but this is usually too expensive to be cost effective . Turbos are harder to add than supercharger . It is harder to map a turbo as the boost comes on exponentially with engine speed . The nice steady boost to rpm characteristics of the supercharger make them easier to map . Decreasing the engines compression ratio will allow you to add forced induction , water injection may also help prevent detonation . <h> Audi S3 Wheel modifications . 38239 @qwx238239 38231 @qwx238231 <p> This @ @ @ 38234 @qwx238234

You should aim at a minimum to replace the core plugs , head gasket and cylinder head bolts . <p> While the head is off you also get an opportunity to inspect the engine for damage and can decide in advance whether more extensive engine work is required or cost effective - usually for the extra cost involved you will save yourself a great deal of hassle later on dealing with component failures . <p> When you have a stripped down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save a small fortune if you get all of the engine modifications done at the same time so look into engine balancing , fitting larger valves , gas flowed machined head , crank lightening and even a lighter flywheel and clutch . <p> Most of these will involve a great deal of man hours stripping and rebuilding the engine again should you decide to do these at a later date . Replacing the oil pump , water pump and fuel pump is also a good idea at this stage as a failure can be catastrophic undoing the work you have done and requiring another rebuild . <p> With the new engine fitted check all of the leads pipes and hoses are connected , there should not be any exposed connections . when you are satisfied start the engine and let it run for a few seconds . Check the engine for leaks and look at the oil level and pressure , water level and look on the ground for leaks . <p> An engine will usually take a few hundred miles to properly bed in so keep the revs down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you have stripped down the engine and fitted new pistons and rings run in the engine afterwards carefully . <p> The run in drive should be with low rev &amp; high stress driving such as hills and acceleration , changing the oil and filter after 200 miles and then after 500 miles and 3000 miles to get rid of the metal fragments that will collect in the oil and prematurely wear the engine . ( Do not use any oil additives in this run in period or for the first 9000 miles as these will stop the bedding in process . ) <p> Please join us in our friendly forum to discuss engine swaps , if you have done or are currently in the middle of an engine swap we 'd love to hear about it .

@@24423533 @4423533/ <h> Boost controllers to maximise smooth power delivery . <p> Boost controllers The turbo is driven by the exhaust gases and the faster the exhaust flows the quicker the turbo spins and more air gets forced in to the engine . <p> If too much air is forced into the engine then it will run lean . This causes an intermittent loss of power and you also risk putting too much pressure on the engine with a surge of power . <p> You also risk detonation or knock and the car would be undrivable and unreliable . TorqueCars recommend getting a boost controller setup with a custom remap for reliable power especially on twin turbo engines . <p> A good boost controller adds an electronic brain &amp; allows much better control of the boost <p> To get around this the makers have fitted a spring valve ( the wastegate actuator ) to shut down the flow of exhaust to the the turbo which regulates the pressure . For example to get 1 bar of pressure the valve might fully open when 1.3 is achieved . <p> Then it starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 0.7 bar of boost it closes completely . The wastegate actuator is also very gradual in its operation being partially open or closed most of the time effectively restricting the power on offer . <p> This opening and closing wastegate actuator helps keep an average pressure at 1 bar . But it means that power comes in unsteady peaks , especially on highly tuned engines . <p> We also need to take into account the fact that when the foot is lifted off the accelerator the air that the turbo sucks in can not be burned and would just fill the engine until something bursts so this pressure is released - see dump valve or blow off valve for a description of this in more detail . <p> This means that the turbo effectively spins down because the 1 bar pressure will build up instantly due to the fact that there is nowhere for the air to go , while the engine is at closed throttle ( when you lift off the accelerator ) so the spring valve driving it is closed . <p> When you re-apply the throttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turbo spins up again when the exhaust gases are moving fast enough typically at 2500 rpm or greater - this delay is called turbo lag and can be quite annoying . <p> A good boost controller adds an electronic brain to the valve that controls the flow through the turbo and allows much better control of the boost . Instead of peaking at 1.3 and dipping to 0.7 and only allowing full turbo flow at its its peak you can maintain a full boost of 1.3 at wide open throttle . <p> This also means you have a much quicker response when the throttle is applied and the wastegate actuator will match the throttle position with the amount of boost given rather than just averaging around a safe setting . <p> Some boost controllers can effectively double the amount of boost at full throttle and give more power throughout the rev range . <p> Mechanical boost controllers are clunky things that do little more than allow a bit of tweaking to the threshold at which the wastegate is fully open and a switch can be added that allows you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still subject to fluctuation and are quite different from a fully mapped electronic boost controller . <p> Boost controllers will increase the power gains from the turbo but it is upto the engine management to set the fueling .

If these sensors are faulty the car will run into limp home mode at relatively low boost pressures . <p> Combine a boost controller on a twin turbo engine along with a good custom remap for the best of both worlds . <p> On single turbo applications a remap will generally be all you need but it does sometimes pay to uprate the standard wastegate if it is known to be restrictive or slow to operatre . <p> Why not join our forum and meet other car tuners where you can discuss the options of boost controllers and remaps and get a wide variety of friendly suggestions . 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Rust requires oxygen and water to form . <p> The paint on your car bodywork protects the underlying metal from rust by preventing moisture and oxygen reaching the metal . All it takes is a chip in the paint for the rust to start taking hold . <p> Initially rust will bubble up the surface but gradually it will eat deeper and deeper into the metal . The earlier rust is caught the easier it is to repair . <p> Any rust spots will need to be thoroughly treated . <p> 1 ) Sand the area down until you get back to bare metal with no trace of rust visible . It 's always a wise precaution to sand a little wider than the obvious rust damage . It 's vital to sand the surface smooth because any imperfections will show up when it is painted . For larger areas of rust you may need to cut out the rust patch and weld in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area with a rust inhibitor . This doubles up as an undercoat/key for the next stages . There are many brands of rust treatments on the market and generally they are equally good . Remember , these products are not rust killers or rust removers , they simply prevent further rust formation in sound metal . <p> 3 ) Fill the depression left after sanding with filler . Smooth the filler and when dry sand it off . ( Shallow depressions may only need a thicker coat of paint or some high build primer . ) <p> 4 ) Cover the area with paint as outlined in our stone chip repair guide . Finish off with some cutting paste and a clear coat . <p> Rust is like a metal cancer and should be dealt with immediately .

The most obvious way to guard against surface rust is to apply a wax coating every 6 months . See our article on wax and polish for more information on this . <p> Another line of defense is corrosion inhibitors . These are usually sprayed under the car and behind panels .

@@24423535 @4423535/ 38227 @qwx238227 <h> Water Injection <p> " Water lot of fun . " <p> You 've finished tuning up your engine but you find that at full throttle the engine splutters or stalls . When you get the car on a diagnostic you find that the knock sensor is kicking in to protect the engine . <p> Engine knock is a condition where the fuel inside the engine ignites prematurely and occurs within an engine running at high compression . ( It can also be caused by other factors including low octane/poor quality fuel or hot spots within the engine . ) <p> For the purpose of this article we shall assume that the engine knock is occurring because your engine is highly tuned and running big compression figures or due to forced induction . <p> This can also be caused when adding or uprating the turbo in your engine . Your options are to rebuild the engine with lower compression pistons , reduce the airflow into the engine or use water injection . <p> Just as a fireman sprays water onto a fire to cool it down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will literally slow up the burn of fuel and enable a more thorough combustion process . Some advocates of water injection list the cleaning effect this has on the engine and head but this is not a primary consideration . <p> Unless you are suffering from engine knock water injection is pretty irrelevant but can literally save an enthusiastic tuning project . <p> The question is where to inject the water spray . Your main choices are after the compressor ( turbo or supercharger or before it ) . Then we have options around injecting into each intake or just prior to the branch . <p> Your route depends a lot on the manifold and positioning of the compressor . Ideally each intake manifold header will have a water injection nozzle requiring a more complex injection controller . The simplest systems go just downstream of the compressor before the branch allowing the manifold flow to direct the water charge . <p> Your aim is to get the same amount of water to each cylinder otherwise the engine will be out of dynamic balance and you will have to tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run their water injection pre turbo but others assume that this could have a detrimental effect on the long term life of the impellers . Proponents of this method will state that this allows the best atomisation of the water into the intake charge and also reduce the intake temperature allowing the turbo to work more efficiently ( compressing air increases its temperature ) . <p> We would certainly agree that having a jet or large droplets of water hitting your impeller does not make sense . <p> The jet of water only really needs to start when you approach your critical knock threshold so there is little point injecting the water all of the time . <p> In an ideal world you need around 10 inches of intake length to mix the fuel/air and water in a uniform fashion . <p> Nozzle size is also vital and just like with a fuel injector you want a mist rather than a jet . A mist size of around 50 microns is acceptable with the droplets reducing in size as atomisation occurs . The smaller 1mm nozzle sizes are much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine heat ( and intake compression heat ) will finish off the atomisation process . <p> How does one control the quantity of the water injected into the engine ? The amount of water should vary according to engine load and rpm . As an example let 's look at manifold pressures . <p> Manifold pressures can reach 11psi at 3500rpm and also hit the same 11psi at 7000rpm . As the engine speed is 100% greater you will also need to at least double the water injection . It really does pay to get a good quality water injection controller which takes the RPM and fueling figures into the equation . Fuel delivery rate alone is a reasonably good indicator of the amount of water so a crude controller could take this into account . <p> Because water injection slows down the burn most common applications will benefit from slightly advanced timing of a few degrees .

This can be caused by injector failure , the tank running dry or some other component failure .

The more highly tuned the engine the bigger this problem is . <p> On a fast road tuned street car the knock sensor should be able to adjust the fueling and it would be similar to using a low octane fuel .

Use filtered water and periodically check the intake for signs of corrosion . <p> Water injection typically has a similar effect on an engine to running higher octane fuel . As such it is irrelevant if you are not suffering from knock . However on NASP engines with turbos added it can make the difference between a driveable fun car and a lumpy dog of a car . <p> The other problem I see is a leaking valve/nozzle pooling water in the inlet tract which IMHO is a recipe for disaster as the motor gulping in a belly full of water on start up will end with say bent/broken rods as water will not compress . <p> Hello sir I am doing water injection in intake manifold of diesel engine .

It also means that impressive gains are to be had from a few simple ECU tweaks and changes . <p> If the car is , as judged by the onboard GPS , on an approved race track or circuit the speed limiter is removed , but on public roads the top speed is limited to around 120mph . Further restrictions in the ECU detect unusual cornering forces , additional power modifications and the like the and if it smells " non standard modifications " then the ECU goes into limp home mode , so the remapper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> The GTR with all of it 's electronic cleverness is one of the best drivers cars out there , competing with most thoroughbred sports cars . We ca n't wait to see what the major tuning houses can do with their GTR tuning as they unlock the potential . <p> It should come as no surprise that to get any power gains from your GTR we have to look at remapping the GTR 's ECU . Doing this opens up a lot of additional parameters and permits the removal of the speed restrictions . <p> We are already seeing a number of performance upgrades on offer that claim power levels of over 1000bhp but most GTR owners will be happy with something around 500 bhp . <h> Engine mods for the GTR . <p> The engine is the powerhouse of the GTR and it is here that we can start to see real power gains . Adding a larger turbo will provide more power and after a remap is probably the largest single gain you can see . <p> For simple power gains then most owners will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliable power gain but it is sensible to cut the service intervals down a little as a precaution . <p> The next stage of tuning is where owners look for other bolt on parts to enhance the car . The obvious candidates for this are sports exhausts with a high flow sports catalyst and properly flowed headers . The power gains from these are nominal but adding in aggressive cams and a lighter flywheel will push the power levels ever higher . <p> An uprated intake manifold and induction kit with a cold air feed will also free up a few more horses . Turbo upgrades and hybrid turbos are also popular but these will often raise the peak power band to a higher RPM range so need to be considered carefully . Getting the exhaust downpipes and intake headers coated can help reduce under bonnet temperatures . <p> Some enthusiasts complain that the stock turbo and manifolds cause too much heat build up so they go for a complete upgrade kit from a performance part producer .

It is best to decide where you want the power gain in your rev range and chatting to a turbo specialist for your options . <p> Inside the engine you can start adding a stroker kit to raise the capacity of the engine , but as with all mods you have to combine it with other mods . A good design of kit will help the engine stay cool and allow you to run higher boost levels safely . We 've seen 4.0 stroker kits from JUN that seem to be a solid upgrade . Another benefit of a stroker kit is that it spools up faster and gives you more torque . <p> Ideally all engine components should be balanced and blueprinted if you are serious about big power gains and still want to have a reliable engine . <p> Treating the engine to a full strip down and balance along with some stronger pistons , crank and other ancillary components will provide a good basis for your GTR tuning project . <p> You can sensibly raise the red line to around 8500rpm if the mapping is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The head should also receive some attention with bigger valves a 5 angle valve job and some flowing and porting . <p> Fuelling upgrades make sense with larger power gains with fuel pumps and injectors that can match the engines new found thirst . <p> Clutches take a real beating , especially if you do lots of full bore launches or you have some serious power gains . Look to get a 16 plate racing clutch , and research your clutch compounds carefully as quality varies enormously . <p> There are not many aftermarket bodykits on offer for the GTR yet but these will surely hit the streets in numbers as the GTR enters the used car market . We can however find some carbon fibre styling parts like the mirrors and rear wing so we expect to see more over the coming months . <p> Any performance mods on your Nissan GTR tuning project will require a full remap to be done to fully unlock the power and avoid any potential limp home issues .

Cringe ! <p> My car is an 06 Corsa SXI+ and as I was considering lowering it when a friend of mine offered me his lowering springs ( 60mm apparently ) and has fitted them free for me too . Now believe it or not he IS a mechanic but as soon as I turned the steering the springs were making really loud clunking noises . We did n't have enough time to fix the problem as he had to go away ! It 's ok in a straight line when I drive it but any steering and the clunking is back . I 'm guessing that 's because I 've gone so low that the springs are just too short for the shocks - is this correct ?

I would only drop a Corsa by 40mm or 35 if it was a sporty SXi model . <p> Springs and shocks should be installed as pairs but when you are looking for new shocks or more accurately " dampers " they must be rated to the 60mm drop . <p> The car is actually dangerous to drive at the moment IMHO so please go carefully and get this sorted out quickly <p> When lowering any car by that amount it should be done as a complete set and it is best to use coilovers , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60mm is way too much on just springs , your so called mechanic friend has taken you for a ride and is not really a friend . <p> Get shot of them , go back to standard or at least a 30mm lowered spring no more . Or get a set of coilovers . Another thing when lowering up to 60mm is that the steering geometry will be out of tolerance . <p> " as I turned the steering the springs were making really loud clunking noises . ....... It 's ok in a straight line when I drive it but any steering and the clunking is back . " <p> If it is from the inside front wheel , the noise is from the edges of the springs snagging on pits formed by the original springs on the inner sides of the 2 retaining cups present on the dampers , which basically keep your springs centered. when you turn , the car sits down further on the outside edge due to centrifugal forces , and the inside edge is lifted , ever so slightly , thus allowing more room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But if it is from the outside wheel , it could be due to the fact that the the car is now so low that the axle is in a state of complete distension and , by virtue of its design , is slipping inside the engine end . ' Coz you see , there is an inbuilt play incorporated in the length of the axle to accommodate the changes in height , and therefore the length required for connection to the wheel , as the car goes over bumps on the road . <p> Hence in a scenario where the distance between the wheel and the transmission is closer than the minimum distance incorporated in the design of the transmission , the drive gear tends to slip over the actual groves it is supposed to snag to actually transfer the engine power to propell the car forward . <p> In this case you would either have to shorten the axles or not go that low on the suspension . <p> " I 'm guessing that 's because I 've gone so low that the springs are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( also I briefly had it on a ramp and you could literally move the springs freely : S:S:S ) " <p> You guessed right . You should not have been able to moved the springs , even on a lift , leave alone ramp , even upon applying enough effort that your veins stood out . <p> The Best Fit for your Springs would be dampers ( in fully extended state ) that require the spring to be compressed by at least 15-20mm before the housing sits properly in its seat and the retaining harnessing can be tightened into place . <p> But I would still consult Waynne &amp; Turbonutter before incurring expenses . <p> If you can move the springs with the car 's weight on the wheels then I reckon that you are running on the bump stops .

Dampers control the oscillations of the spring only , they do n't affect ride height ( unless they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and the ride height will remain the same ( assuming no other changes are made ) . <p> Without actually seeing the car we are all guessing , but if the springs are loose when the car is stationary then they are MUCH too short and something else is supporting the weight of the car . If in doubt , the best way of checking if these springs are any good is the water test . Throw them into the nearest deep water you can find , if they float you can recover and use them <p> Yea I know that dampers wo n't affect the ride hide but it will help limit the compression for the springs 38230 @qwx238230 <p> Sorry again , but they wo n't . Dampers have no effect on the extent of spring compression , they only moderate its movement . The springs will compress the same amount whether you fit the stiffest damper available or remove them completely . So , the car will still be riding on its bump stops ( if that is what is happening ) regardless of the stiffness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I can see , is to remove the springs and fit a more sensible set . <p> If the car IS sitting on the bump stops it is potentially lethal and should not be driven if you value your , your passengers ' or other people 's lives . <p> I have said it before and I will say it again . Modifying vehicle suspension should only be done by people who have an understanding of the principles of suspension geometry , which is very few judging by the number of people who seem to think that the way to improve their car 's handling is to slam it to the ground ! They seem to think that because racing cars are very low if they make their car low it will improve the handling as well . <p> A racing car only works well because the WHOLE suspension geometry has been redesigned to allow the car to be lowered , they have n't just cut the bloody springs !

Despite the pub arguments women drivers cost the insurers less . The debate rages on in TorqueCars forums as to whether women have more but smaller accidents than men so you might want to wade in and let us know what you think on that ! Despite the arguments and debates insurers love women drivers and they get lower premiums . ( In 2011 the UK outlawed sex based descrimination in premiums which is intended to create a level playing field .

Inner city areas cost more than outlying rural areas to reflect the higher inner city repair costs , the heavy traffic and increased risk of a collision and the increased vandalism and theft risk . <p> Short of moving home you may get a discount if your car is parked off the road or if you do a limited mileage each year . If your car is garaged overnight or you agree to use the car only during daylight hours ( verified by a tracking device ) you can get reductions in your premium . <p> Also adding a good quality insurance approved car alarm can help reduce the premium further .

Things taken into account for the rating of each car include the safety ratings awarded to each car , which have a direct bearing on injury claims , both from occupants and pedestrians . <p> The power of the car and its handling ability which includes its braking and the size also determine the frequency and amount of claims made . Faster and larger cars will attract higher premiums than small or slow ones . <p> Add to this the typical driver profile of a car and you find anomalies like Diesel automatics are lower to insure than a petrol manual of the same power and specification . Also some 3 door hot hatches cost more to insure than the similarly powered 4 door hatches again due to the typical profile of the driver . <p> The repair cost and ease of repair is also a factor .

This is partly why imported cars depreciate more quickly . <p> Be honest at all times with your insurer . They will ask very specific questions at the time of a claim and ask for proof . For example an insurer may not want to see your license when you take out a policy but may want to see it if you make a claim to verify you have no endorsements . <p> Previous accidents and claims are stored on a database which is again often only consulted if you make a claim . Giving false information to obtain cheaper car insurance is a false economy as you will find yourself without cover and open to prosecution . <p> Modification to a car must also be declared , no matter how small .

At the brake pad end , which is subject to high temperatures , the fluid itself can get very hot . <p> When making the car go faster you must make sure you can stop it faster too ! <p> The benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , means that the effect of braking passes along the tube ( brake pipes ) almost instantly . A cable would stretch a little and needs constant adjusting most handbrakes use a cable system so you are aware how inefficient the cable brake system is also cables are more susceptible to the effects of heat and stretching . <p> The problem with brake fluids are that they are hygroscopic ( they draw in water particles ) which reduce the effectiveness of the transference process also at high temperatures they can boil bubbles of air in the brake fluid create a spongy effect at least or at worst can completely prevent the brake from having any effect . ( See the article on Brake Fade for more details of this phenomenon and how it can be avoided . ) <p> The heat is dissipated from the pad by the discs a vented disc has a central channel which increases the surface to air ratio of the disc and created better and faster cooling . <p> Drilled discs also increase the air ratio and along with grooves help to prevent a gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pads clean and sharp . <p> Bigger discs = better cooling but bigger discs may require a different style of alloy wheel . <h> Brake pad selection . <p> The pads though are an essential part the higher the friction the better . <p> Racing pads are specially constructed from a high friction compound which works at much higher temperatures . <p> A true racing pad will start working effectively only when it gets hot so this renders race spec pads useless for the road where braking most often happens on cold pads . <p> TorqueCars have found that fast road pads such as those supplied by Pagid and Black Diamond are a very good compromise and some makes of performance pads have the added benefit of producing nearly zero brake dust and even last longer than the standards pads I was using although driving style will effect the wear on the pad and on your discs . <p> ABS helps to prevent lockups under heavy braking and allows you to steer the car but steering will reduce the braking efficiency as the ABS cuts in more . ABS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brakes are cut due to loss of traction whereas if the wheels where slowed a little the car could stop more quickly . <p> Rally cars have a custom ABS setup which is quite different to standard road cars and maintains control and braking efficiency on gravel surfaces . If you are not a competent mechanic Torquecars recommend that you leave brake work to the specialist as a failure would result in a certain accident . <h> Brake upgrade kits . <p> There is much that can be done to upgrade the cars braking system . Key areas for attention are fitting bigger discs . As a larger disc will have a bigger friction area and be able to dissipate more heat you will benefit immediately . You will also notice you have more feel and it is easier to detect the point of lock up with a large disc conversion kit . Taking a standard family car with relatively small discs , as an example , an easy and cheap route would be to visit the breakers yard and get brake disks and servos from a performance model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car will usually upgrade to the 1.8 GTi brakes ( you may need to upgrade the wheels at the same time ) . And often small cars share similar part specifications to the larger executive counterparts so a little research and chatting with our forum members will point you in the right direction . <p> Brake calipers and pistons next come in for attention . More pistons equal a greater clamping force and allow the use of much larger pads . Torquecars see little point of adding more pistons to a standard size disc as the heat dissipation ability of the disc will be impaired by the larger pads used . When upgrading the discs you should also look into increasing the pad , caliper and number of pistons for best effect . <h> General maintenance &amp; care . <p> When driving through floods apply the brakes briefly to dissipate the water and grease that gets on them and this will dramatically improve your chances of stopping in an emergency situation . <p> Once a year or if you notice the brakes losing their effectiveness you should rough up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will brake the glaze and help the pad to bite the disc more effectively . You should always check your pads for wear and if you are preparing for a track day Torquecars recommend fitting new pads as these will take a lot of abuse . Check the brake discs for wear by measuring the diameter and ensure that a wear ridge is not appearing on the outside . Thin brake discs can warp or under heat stress can brake causing a wheel lockup so it really is a false economy to run with worn discs . <p> Brake fluid should also be frequently checked and changed annually to bi-annually depending on your driving style and the recommended service interval for your car.B rake fluid should be checked ideally by a specialist for its boiling point which gives an idea of its degradation .

Sign up now 38236 @qwx238236 <h> Electric water pumps for performance engines . <p> " Pump up the volume ! " <p> In a performance engine you should never underestimate the need for adequate cooling . <p> All water cooled cars work on the principle of water being pumped around the engine and then to a radiator where it releases the heat . <p> Most hold the water in the engine until it warms up and then the water circulates to the radiator when the thermostatic valve opens . <p> Some manufacturers are fitting electric water pumps instead of mechanical ones and the after market fitting of electric water pumps is taking off so what are the performance benefits of them ? <p> Most water pumps are mechanical and run off the crank . <p> This creates 2 drawbacks : - <p> Firstly water is pumped in proportion to the engine speed . So if you have been driving hard and then suddenly go slow the water is being pumped more slowly and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water pumps exert a pull on the crank . They are usually fairly bulky and take a fair amount of force to turn the impeller . <p> Power losses to the water pump alone have been recorded to be as high as 17 bhp on a 170bhp engine . <p> When you look at the benefits of electric water pumps you wonder why they are not fitted as standard to cars - but as always it often ' boils ' down to cost ! <p> Long used in Motorsport an electric water pump is able to address both of these issues . It must be noted that the extra current it draws will create pull on the alternator in a similar way to the air conditioning unit ( but nowhere near as much ! ) <p> The electric water pump will come as a kit with the main pump and a controller . The more sophisticated controllers allow you to select an operating temperature for the engine from within the car . <p> The benefit of a water pump is that the water is circulated in direct proportion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pumped round the engine and this will assist with cooling . It also means that the pump is only running when it is actually required allowing the engine to warm up quickly and maintain an optimum operating temperature . <p> You will need to remove the existing water pump impeller and the thermostat as your electric water pump will replace these . Removal of the entire water pump is not absolutely necessary ; indeed keeping the belt pulley in place will mean you do not have to get a new belt fitted . <p> A big benefit of an electric water pump is the fact that you can easily select the operating temperature of your car . Setting the temperature lower will mean the engine produces more power and setting it higher will improve the engines economy . <p> Sitting in traffic will no longer mean the engine reaches dangerous levels and the cooling fan on the radiator will have less work to do due to the faster cycling of the engine coolant around the engine . <p> Fitting an electric water pump is very straightforward , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifics here . The pump will usually fit inline near the switch that operates the flow through the radiator . You will typically have to cut a hose and fit the water pump inline and then wire this into the car 's ignition circuit . <p> Depending upon your settings you could even let the water pump run when the car is stationary allowing it to continue to cool the engine when it is turned off . <h> Negative sides of electric water pumps . <p> Generally speaking an electric water pump will not last as long as a mechanical one . Many manufacturers recommend that the mechanical water pumps are replaced every 7 years or so anyway . <p> An electric water pump will also exert load on the battery , but this will not incur the same losses as the crank driven mechanical ones . <p> They can be difficult to fit and setup . Buying a kit designed for your car is strongly recommended .

We 'd also caution you not to go with a motorsport cam as this affects the engines idling and general town driving characteristics.When pushing up the power you will need to pay attention to the fueling . <p> More power needs more fuel . Most power losses , flat spots and erratic idling after modifications are done can usually be traced to timing or fueling issues.Uprated injectors will enable you to supply sufficient fuel to the engine . Uprate the fuel pump to cope with the extra fuel requirements of your tuned 307s uprated injectors. 38228 @qwx238228 <p> The next area for modification is the intake and exhaust . Induction kits only help to add performance if your air intake is struggling ! <p> Adding an induction kit to most standard engines will see NO POWER GAIN AT ALL . If you have heavily modified your engine and it 's need for air INCREASES DRAMATICALLY then an induction kit is the answer and will help remove this restriction . Maximum power gains come from a full induction kit with a cold air feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an air box but a performance panel filter should suffice for most applications . TorqueCars suggest you use a panel air filter as these are easy to clean and maintain and generally perform better than paper ones . <p> Sports exhausts will certainly help air flow out of the engine but do not go too large or you may end up will reduce the flow rate . Stick to 1.5 to 2.5 inches as a rule of thumb . <p> Getting the head ported and polished will further help more air into each cylinder . This is definitely a job for a professional with a flow bench . A good multi plate fast road sports clutch will help to keep that power going where it should . Never skimp or expect a standard clutch to cope . <p> Remaps offer large power gains on all turbo charged cars - the turbo diesel engines respond very well to remaps and can totally transform the cars performance . <p> On NASP engines the benefits are doubtful . However a remap on a NASP engine will help unleash the potential if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains for NASP engines usually involve the addition of forced induction . Superchargers are often easier to add than a turbo . With a turbo the boost curve is related exponentially to the engine speed making it hard to map . It is easier to map a supercharger because the boost is proportional to engine speed on a linear curve . To cope with forced induction you will usually need to decrease the compression ratio of the engine . 38226 @qwx238226 <p> Alloy wheels will help the brakes cool down and are usually lighter than the steel ones . The downside to large alloy wheels on your 307 is that you alter your effective final drive ratio and this will have a detrimental effect on acceleration and performance .

@@24423551 @4423551/ <h> Sports exhaust design and performance gains . <p> TorqueCars will take a look at sports exhausts as they are very popular modifications , but sadly many mistakes are made . <p> The job of the exhaust is to break up the sound pulse from the engine , muffling the sound and allowing the exhaust gases to escape efficiently . <p> We see the young lads fitting drainpipe size exhausts and will examine the cause of power losses in these cases . <p> What effect do they have on the engine and do all exhausts increase power ? <p> This component affects the Blow phase of combustion - getting rid of the exhaust fumes is important and the less pressure there is in the exhaust system the higher the BHP produced . <p> However the rate of flow or velocity of the exhaust gases also comes into the equation . Big exhausts slow up the flow and smaller ones increase it . You have to balance the exhaust with the intake and engine capacity to give the best flow rate without causing back pressure ( a delay of exhaust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have a different bore size for each RPM band in the engine , but this is not practical , so an optimum all round setting is selected . Most good quality performance aftermarket exhausts move the optimum to work more effectively at higher RPM . <p> Interestingly some performance car makers have a " dual bore size " exhaust which varies according to the RPM allowing low down Torque and better peak power figures . The flow rate is generally controlled with a mechanical valve or butterfly valve . <p> The silencer is often the biggest bottleneck in a car . Conventional exhaust filter the exhaust gases round numerous S shapes and through baffles to deaden the noise . A sports silencer is generally a straight pipe with holes in it . The sound waves go through the holes to the outside casing and then bounce back and if done right this cancels a lot of the noise in the exhaust . <p> Polishing the inside of the exhaust will aid the fast exit of gases as there is less internal friction . This is why a steel header @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pits and imperfections left in the casting process . <p> We hate to see street cars with massive exhausts and we hope the following suggestions will help common sense to prevail . Typically the exhaust is based on the amount of air an engine needs to expel and this varies greatly in turbos and highly tuned engines . <p> To try to deter our younger readers from sticking the largest exhaust they can find we add the following general tip . As a very very general rule of thumb , under a 1.6l engine , TorqueCars recommend you stick with a maximum 1.5 to 2 inch pipe ( the smaller the engine the smaller the bore size ) . Under 2.5l engines go with 2-2.5 inches and over this go with a 3 inch exhaust . <p> Over 2.5 liter engines we would suggest a twin exhaust system using half the engine size to determine the optimum pipe size as we have just outlined . so a 3.0 Engine would be ideally suited to a twin 1.5-2 inch bore and 5 litres with a 2-2.5 inch twin bore . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length of the exhaust right up to the back box and tail pipe . <p> ( The back box &amp; exit pipe can be a little wider but this will not release more power , it will just give a deeper sound . ) . <p> Gases flow better from a large pipe to a small pipe if the join is cone shaped . Steps will cause turbulence and this can interfere with the airflow and affect performance . <p> Bigger exhausts will actually slow up the flow of gases , there is an optimum size to give the best flow rate but resist back pressure where the exhaust gases are constricted . If you can get your fist inside - it 's too big ! <p> The shape of the exhaust manifold ( painted red in picture ) is also critical as is the primary and secondary length . <p> This is something best left to the experts to calculate most manufacturers do a reasonable job . <p> Aftermarket performance exhaust headers will obviously be better . <p> However you can improve a standard exhaust by smoothing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alternatively buy a purpose built stainless steel unit for your car . <p> The best systems for a street car are called 4-2-1 which means they go from 4 pipes into 2 pipes and then into 1 in a 3 step process . This will maintain some lower RPM torque . Some very high performance exhausts are 4-1 where all the pipes merge at one point lower down the manifold or 4-2 with two exit pipes . These exhaust allow higher peak power figures and are best suited to a very high average RPM band for example on race cars and Honda VTEC engines . <p> Cats suck power a little by slowing up the airflow . Catalysts are sadly a requirement on today 's cars , there is a typical reduction of 1-4 bhp overall . To minimise this the catalysts are generally twice the bore size of the exhaust which makes up for most of the restriction . <p> If you find a high flow sports cat or use an off road only de cat pipe you will notice an improvement on most applications . <p> Although this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There is little difference between a sports cat and a decat and some high performance cars already come with a good quality sports catalyst . <p> Another option is to go for a 4-2-2 exhaust where you have twin exit pipes with 1 for 2 exhaust ports from the engine . <p> Most sports silencers add a deep roar to the exhaust but this adds little to the overall experience other than the noise they make . One of the best exhausts I ever had was a standard one ( from a larger engined car ) with the rear silencer remover the center expansion section was larger to help muffle the sound but it really improved flow a lot and sounded great . I will note that low down torque was lost with a noticeably higher peak rpm torque band . <p> TorqueCars recommend the " Cherry Bomb " for simplicity and a deep throaty sound but you will probably need to fabricate your own mounts . <p> Just as induction length is critical so exhaust length is also vital . You should also aim to have the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaust headers ( or depending on your location manifolds ) are cast and have many imperfections on their internal surface . They often have ridges where surfaces are joined . Grinding and polishing the inside of the exhaust smooth will aid airflow and improve things . <p> While you are at it you could polish it throughout its length to completely remove resistance . Performance exhausts are made of stainless steel which has a much smoother internal surface and is also much lighter . Attention should be given to the joins and bends , and the fewer the better being the order of the day . <p> Under bonnet temperature is one of your biggest performance killers see the induction and vents articles for more suggestions . Wrapping the exhaust manifold with a heat resistant wrap can yield a dramatic reduction in temperature and will help the cat to reach operating temperature more quickly therefore prolonging its life and efficiency . <p> ( Do n't use cloth bandages as this becomes a fire hazard ! ) The application of a ceramic coating can substantially reduce the transmission of exhaust heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to working temperature more quickly . <p> To find out more about exhausts in general , or to ask which exhaust application would be best for your car , join in the friendly banter in our members forum and discuss exhausts in more detail ( and all aspects of car modification ) . <p> Tell us about your project - we 're always interested to hear what people are doing to their cars . <p> Hi-my 1000cc Suzuki car comes standard with a 1 ? bore for the exhaust system throughout till the tail pipe . I have retained the CAT but removed the muffler , and fitted a 2 ? pipe about 5 feet in length . The car sounds great , however whenever I try quick acceleration there is a certain amount of loss in power . But , when I accelerate gradually , the pick up is good . Any suggestions ? Thanks . <p> One thing I would add to an excellent article is the following . The main function of primary pipes is to set the initial rpm point ( engine speed ) at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headers . Keep in mind , exhaust and intake systems can be tuned to different engine speeds . By so doing , an overall torque curve can be broadened or narrowed by the separate dimensioning of intake and exhaust systems <p> In the case of headers , primary-pipe diameter determines flow rate ( velocity ) . At peak torque ( peak volumetric efficiency ) , the mean flow velocity is 240-260 feet per second ( fps ) , depending upon which mathematical basis is used to do the calculation . But for sizing or matching primary pipes to specific engine sizes and rpm , 240 fps is a good number . <p> Changing the length of primary pipes generally affects the amount of torque produced above and below peak-torque rpm . For example , all else being equal , shortening primary pipes transfers torque from below to above the peak , not significantly shifting the rpm point at which peak torque occurs .

You will need to ensure that the engine is not starved of fuel so will need to uprate the fueling . <p> A fuel pressure boost valve will make the car more responsive and respond better . To get sufficient fuel you may need to uprate the injectors on your engine . When increasing your fueling you will also need to get a bigger fuel pump to supply it . <h> Vauxhall Vectra Induction kits and sports Exhaust . <p> The next area for modification is the intake and exhaust . Induction kits work well on turbo engines and larger engines , for the smaller Vectra engines you should go with a sports panel air filter . Sports exhausts balance the flow of air throughout the engine . But if your exhaust is too large ( over 2.5 inches bore ) you will lose back pressure on most engines . <p> When you start tuning your Vectra you will find that the standard clutch starts to complain so get an uprated clutch .

Despite the large cost involved adding forced induction to a NASP engine will give large power gains . Superchargers are generally easier to add than turbos .

Superchargers however will give a boost which is proporttional to engine speed so is easier to map . To cope with forced induction you will usually need to decrease the compression ratio of the engine . <h> Vauxhall Vectra Alloy wheels . <p> Alloy wheels will help the brakes cool down and are usually lighter than the steel ones . The downside to large alloy wheels on your Vectra is that you alter your effective final drive ratio and this will have a detrimental effect on performance . <p> For this reason we would advise sticking to a maximum wheel size of 17 inches , although we know some of our members have gone larger than this with no problems . <p> Please join us in our forumto discuss the Vectra options in more detail with our Vectra @ @ @ @ @ <h> Feedback 38237 @qwx238237 <p> I have a 2005 Vectra 1.9CDTI SRI 150 Sat Nav .

Contrary to popular belief there is often very little power gain to be had by fitting an induction kit , they only become beneficial and are recommended after you increase the engines power to the point where the standard air intake box can not cope ! <p> Derestricting the airflow into the engine is the primary part of performance tuning so get a better flowing air filter if you find that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but due to the warm air in the engine bay they will not really increase power and usually rob you of power . <p> Sports exhausts increase the flow of gases through the engine .

A good heavy duty fast road sports clutch will help to keep that power going where it should . Never skimp or expect the standard clutch to cope . <p> Remaps offer large power gains on all turbo charged cars . On NASP engines the benefits are doubtful .

Large Juke alloys can decrease performance . If you get big alloys you will be changing your final drive ratio .

Stage 3 competition upgrades just wo n't work well on the road difficult in stop start traffic . <h> Engine tuning mods . <p> Peak power is good on competition cars but for a daily driven car you need a wide torque band and perhaps extending the rev range .

We 'd also caution you not to go with a motorsport cam as this upsets the engines idling and general town driving characteristics.When pushing up the power you will need to pay attention to the fueling . More power needs more fuel . If you find you get flat spots and power surges after your mods you should check the fueling and try a higher octane fuel as well . To get sufficient fuel you may need to uprate the injectors on your engine . A fuel pump will only deliver a finite amount of fuel , so you may need to uprate this if your injectors are demanding more fuel . 38228 @qwx238228 <p> Now we move on to the intake and exhaust and ensure proper flow through the engine . Contrary to popular belief there is usually very little power gain to be had by fitting an induction kit , they only work well and are recommended after you increase the engines power to the point where the standard air intake box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would suggest you just go with a washable panel air filter . On heavily tuned engines and turbo vehicles an induction kit will help release the power providing you address the problem of needing cold air . <p> Do not go with the largest exhaust you can get this will reduce the exhaust flow rate - the best for power gains are usually between 1.5 to 2.5 inches . It is the shape and material more than the bore size . <p> Getting the flowed ( ported and polished ) will further help more air into each cylinder . This is definitely a job for a professional with a flow bench . When you heavily modify your Insignia you will reach a point that the standard clutch starts to fail so get an uprated clutch . Remaps offer massive power gains on all turbo charged cars . On NASP engines the benefits are doubtful . However a chipped ECU on a NASP engine will help unleash the potential if you have done a lot of mods .

@@24423562 @4423562/ <h> I 've got an itch i may have to scratch <p> As the title alludes to , I have this huge urge to purchase a SAAB 9-3 as a long term rolling project but i have a lot of questions first of all , if anyone can help me out . <p> 1 . Do i actually go for a 9-3 or do i go for a different model ? 2 . Which engine ? 1.8t 2.0t 2.2 and so on . I have ruled out the v6 option but this is the only firm decision i have made 3 . There are a lot of cars out there to choose from , are there any known issues to keep an eye out for with regards condition , reliability etc . <p> Firstly , the 9-3 ( Excellent choice ) is a great car for you and possibly a small family . The 9-5 is a tad larger and is generally considered to be a little more comfortable . Look for the Aero model ' Top of the range ' or Linear or Vector . Some of the Linear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . The 1.8t is alright if you just like to go from A to B without to many thrills and spills and is pretty good on economy . The 2.0t or T low pressure or high pressure turbo model is very good and can be remapped quite easily for additional horses . I personally have no time for the V6 models , they drink faster than a really cheap date for the one night if you get my drift , and with no guarantee of any fun being had that evening <p> Reliability : Tough one , these cars need to be loved and shown the love , if there is no full and comprehensive service history then ' Walk away ' . These cars have the ability to empty the wallet faster than the above cheap date or HMRC . <p> Known issues with the 9-3s are front drop links , upgraded stronger versions are available for a few pounds more than the standard . Crank position sensors go after 10 years and will not allow the car to start , straightforward to do but budget around -150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very small range at that , put another make in at your peril , this can damage the individual coil packs and that will set you back -500 plus to replace . Stay away from 2003 models ' Mine ' as this was the very first model that uses fibre optics , very fussy and known to throw a DIVA style temper tantrum every now &amp; again . Look for 2005 and upwards . Manual gearboxes are ok and there is both a 5 speed and 6 speed version available which includes the automatic too . The 6 speed manual can be notchy on changing but again there is an upgrade kit that corrects this . Parts availability not a problem , many service centres and independent specialists around the country that can help . <p> I think that about covers it , feel free to ask if you need any further help . Oh , do n't touch the diesels . <p> A good example commands a lot of money now Andy , again there are quite a few for sale but on the older ones it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies have sprung up making parts for these lovely chariots , unfortunately they seem to have confused the pricing of such parts with a third world country 's national debt <p> I could have put a months wages on the fact you would have been the first to reply to my post @T9 man , Cheers for the info . I 'm very comfortable doing any kind of mechanical , electrical work on cars so issues do n't  really bother me as it would be a parts cost only basis . I must admit i was a little tempted by a derv version just to see what 's possible from the JTD engine as it is very popular across a few brands and power figures are good for an oil burner tbh . <p> Then i look and see the possible power gains on the petrol versions of the SAABs and my mind goes into overdrive . I 've not owned a turbo charged petrol for 10+ years since i had my AUDI S2 , which was no where near stock when i was finished with it <p> I 've done quite a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dads which are all the 1.9 150ps derv versions and must admit i 'm pretty impressed with the build of the cars . The only tiny little thing that wound me up about them was the ignition key location in the center console I 'm sure i will get used to that tho after a few weeks or so . <p> All are quite good to be honest buddy . The problem with diesel is not so much the engines on the SAAB but the growing dislike by government and alike for them . They are no longer the must have fuel choice and as such , the up keep and more importantly the resale could prove to be very difficult . There is already talk of a scrappage scheme that could be introduced for these once loved diesel cars . <p> I have the auto on mine and have absolutely no complaints . This version has the Tiptronic style operation . You can choose to select the gears manually from the gearlever that you move into a new position on the gate , or via the up &amp; down buttons located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashboard shows you the gear you have selected . <p> And they are more than able to deal with moderate tuning ? torque increase ? 38230 @qwx238230 <p> Put it this way , my autobox has had the fluid changed religiously every year since I bought the car from new back in 2003 . If you look after the box then it will look after you . Can not vouch for a box that has probably never had the fluid changed before on a secondhand car .

@@24423564 @4423564/ <h> Effect of big Intake valves on engine power gains . <p> The heads primary job is the mixing of fuel and air and delivering this to the combustion chamber . <p> Any turbulence or drag can restrict the air flow into the engine starving you of power . <p> So this TorqueCars article will focus on the intake valves ( center of the cross section picture ) . <p> The aim of head tuning is both to maximize the amount of air and fuel that gets into the engine , and to improve the mixture . <p> We have another article on porting and polishing so we are going to focus on the job of the valves and lifters . <p> Intake channels The intake ports in most cars are at 70-90 degrees of the combustion chamber , requiring the air to turn as it enters the combustion chamber . For practical reasons the intake ports can not run vertically into the engine as you have to negotiate the camshafts and other engine components . <p> The more shallow this curve the better the flow rate you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and angle of airflow through the head into the engine . <p> A worn camshaft can reduce the valves lift so always check the cam for wear . <p> Making the channels that lead into the head wider , will also help to increase the flow rate . Just as with exhaust design you need to avoid steps and sharp bends . If you have to reduce the bore of a channel , this must be done as a gradual cone shape . Remove any burrs or metal seams and smooth the head as much as possible . <p> The valves are like little trumpets , which open to allow air into and out of the engine . The duration that these valves open for is the job of the camshaft but the lifters decide how wide the valves open . If the valves open too much it is possible to have them crash into the piston which is obviously not good . If the valves bounce you will lose power or suffer from engine damage . <p> Maximising the airflow into the engine with larger inlet ports will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air into an engine if there is a restriction in the valve size . <p> Valves must be properly seated and mate well to the surface inside the engine when they are closed or you will lose power . A valve seating paste will help with this . <p> By using a drill and and old valve with the abrasive paste grind the valve seat smooth , making an air tight seal when the valves close . Older engines will usually benefit from re-seating valves , particularly if compression is down across all the cylinders . At this point an owner will start to look at big valve conversion kits . <p> Instead of opting for larger valves many manufacturers increased the number of valves . We now see most engines with 16 valves which theoretically channel almost twice as much air as 8 valve engines . The VAG group have even produced an engine with 20 valves which has an over sized exhaust valve ( more air volume exits the engine due to heat expansion ! ) <p> The size of valve you choose is restricted by the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can not overlap valves , and valves can not open if they scrape the cylinder wall . Some manufacturers use valves which are peanut shaped allowing them to fit 2 closer together . <p> The valves will open and close at a fast rate , especially in a performance engine so attention must be made to the springs and retainers which can wear at an alarming rate . Springs come in different grades and allow some control over the rate at which the valves open and close . Listening to the top of the engine will give you an idea of the condition of the valves and lifters . <p> Often , instead of fitting big valves to your engine , you may have the option of fitting a 16 valve head to an 8 valve engine from the same manufacturer . But you need to exercise caution . <p> Taking the Rover 1.8 VVC head as an example this would technically fit on a 1.4 block provided the 1.4 engine is rebored to allow the valves to clear the liner wall . <p> Some heads are interchangeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the VW golf 8v and 16v heads , this require little more than a few timing/electrical tweaks to work . <p> The key is to do your research , it might look like it fits but there could be a whole set of obstacles in the way . <p> Check the cams for wear because some motorsport cams are made of a softer material and will wear quickly . Run your finger nail at a 90 degree angle over the cam to check the surface for wear . The surface should be smooth and not dip in the center . A worn cam will dramatically decrease the amount the valve can open . <p> An interesting article and introduction into a fascinating , complicated and potentially most effective area for power increase on a N/A engine ( ok , when I say that I 'm referring to the entire head , cams , ports , throats , comb chambers , manifolds as a whole ) . <p> Multi valve instead of larger intake valves almost always is the better option for a variety of reasons although you may well be surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a single valve and two smaller ones because you would tend to find that the single bigger valve has almost as much area ( mm2 ) as the two valves , even as much sometimes . <p> The true benefit of multi valves then has to come from not just thinking of the difference in size but by visualising the system 3 dimensionally over the full time of the valve opening and closing . One of the big advantages comes from the area and how much is opened up around the valve itself and how quickly it increases or in other words picture the valve say at 10% open and just off the seat and you find more area around two smaller valves increases and at a quicker rate than one big valve . <p> Add to that two smaller valves will take less force on the the cam lobe . They can be lighter and the valve springs under less pressure because there is less inertia to over come 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

" <p> VAG 1.8T engine Volkswagen/SEAT/Audi : 150-240 bhp from the factory . <p> The 1781 cubic centimeters in this 20 Valve turbo charged engine represents what must be one of the most tunable engines around today . The 20 valves are arranged as 3 intakes and 2 exhaust valves per cylinder . ( The exhaust valves are larger and the intake design makes the engine an efficient one ) . The compression ratio is set to 9.5:1 , but , in the 170bhp engine compression ratio is 9.3:1 and a slightly lower 9:1:1 in the 240 bhp versions , which although high for a turbo gives plenty of low down torque . <p> Technical information of this engine : Bore size of 81mm ( 3.19in ) a Stroke of 86.4mm ( 3.40in ) and a Rod Length of 144mm The peak power band is between 2000 and 5000 rpm , and delivers good fuel economy as well around 34-38mpg . The turbo delivers a boost pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this engine although the 180bhp engines run 11.6 psi from 2002 . The standard cast iron engine block can handle power up to 240 in factory tune and many owners have reported much higher power gains than that . The most common turbos fitted are the KO3 ( 150-180 bhp ) and KO4 ( 210-240 ) . A remap on a standard engine will typically yield around 40-50bhp increase , and , with the addition of a higher capacity turbo , a freer flowing intercooler and efficient induction and exhaust design , power gains to around 300-350bhp are possible . Expect to have to upgrade the clutch when increasing the power of the engine or the clutch life will be dramatically reduced . The pistons are forged aluminium Mahle , with fracture split forged steel connecting rods mated to a forged crankshaft which is capable of handling far more that the mild 150bhp tune . <p> Volkswagen 1.8T engines represents one of the most easily tunable engines today . <p> The engine code is found at the top part of the engine near the valve cover on the side etched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious upgrade path for KO3 turbo owners is to swap in a KO4 turbo . The software take a lot of getting right for the maximum power gains but interestingly most people report that the KO4 turbo runs fine on the standard manufacturers ECU Map . It is usually easier to remap the standard KO3 engine and set the boost to 1 bar but the KO4 changes the characteristics of the engine and gives a more rewarding drive pulling hard even when the KO3 runs out of steam around 5000rpm the KO4 still delivers good power . You may think the KO4 is more prone to lag but this is not the case and both are very similar as far as low down low boost power goes . <p> Weak spots - the engine oil must be fully synthetic and changed at the correct service intervals . Use of the wrong type of oil will cause the oil pump to seize causing a catastrophic loss of oil pressure and engine failure .

@@24423567 @4423567/ <h> LED side lights / bulbs vs . CAN-Bus wiring system . <p> CAN Bus is a multiplexed wiring system used to connect intelligent devices such as Electronic Control Units ( ECU 's ) on vehicles , allowing data to be transferred in a low-cost and reliable manner . CAN means ' Controller Area Network ' and was developed by Bosch in 1980 . Most new vehicles use this system and it is becoming increasingly difficult to install after-market products without using a CAN Bus Interface . This days it is a standard in cars such as BMW , Mercedes , Audi etc manufactured after 2005 or 2006 year . For sure it was used in higher class models , but not sure about middle range cars . Now , this days it is very popular changing standard side bulbs such W5W 501 for LED ones . LED side bulbs can cost between 4 and 20pounds , it all depends from where you getting them from and how many LEDs have each bulb and they structure- build-in extra resistors etc . LED bulbs offer a much longer lifetime and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white with a bit of blue , completely blue or even they can change color from blue to red and green etc . <p> BUT , they also use much less energy than for example standard W5W 501 side bulb or even H11 LED fog light , and that 's where the problem is with modern CAN-Bus wiring system . Why ? ? ? As CAN-Bus is sort of ' intelligent ' wiring it monitors lots of other features and one of them is the wattage / working state of light bulbs . When light bulbs burns out , consumption of electricity goes down to zero ( this is base on Audi 's A8 system ) and automatically system bring NO BULB warning . Usual it also displays where is the faulty bulb and indicates it by flashing or lighting red color . So because one of the main feature of LED light is a very low wattage/consumption , as soon you plug in the LED bulb , CAN-Bus records a lower consumption than a standard bulb ( originally programmed in the system ) and therefore brings the NO BULB ERROR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent on the end of the day <p> This days , you can buy an ordinary LED replacement bulbs such as fog lights or side bulbs or number plate bulbs etc , or the CAN-Bus compatible ones . <p> But , it does not always do what it says on the tin . Very often you will need to connect them together with a resistor or get the ones with resistors already built-in . This is base on my recent experience with LED side bulbs on Audi A8 ( D3 4E ) . <p> On the beginning I went for the expensive ones as I thought that 's the way to do it if you want to get it right as choice is massive this days . <p> 2nd set I got from another online retailer - 9.99 for pair plus postage / same design 2LEDs per bulb , but with different resistors built-in That 's how they looked , by the way they should be crystal white and they were blue RESULT - NO BULB error , well again very disappointing <p> 3rd set I got from a very old good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get certain stuff or the last place to buy 11.99 per pair , this time 3LEDs per bulb . <p> RESULT - NO BULB ERROR ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Just to check that there is no issue with the wiring , I unplugged the LED bulb and put the standard one , and error was gone straight away . <p> RESULT - well ...... as soon I switched the ignition on , system checked all other stuff and straight after that it came up with ......... NO BULB error .... BUT , both bulbs flashed red on the screen and after 15-20sec error was gone and everything came back to normal . So I switched the ignition off and start the engine this time , ERROR came up , it beeped twice and it was gone in much less time the on the first attempt . I have n't tried the 3rd time as I was in a rush , but it looks like system is getting familiar with them and in some sort of strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its all OK after few seconds . I will try it tomorrow few times and see what happens . But if 2beeps and error message for just 10-ish seconds is the only issue , I may even leave them until I will know that there is something 100% tested and in full working order on my car as they look really really nice : <p> and together with the Osram Night Breakers Plus <p> and just to compare the standard bulb <p> If you have a car manufactured before 2005 or no CAN-Bus wiring , then you are good in getting any LED bulbs you want for your car . <p> I hope I did n't bored you to death <p> Also , I am not saying that you will experience same issue , it could be just issue with high class models or just with A8s , no idea , so do n't get negative about it as you always can return bulbs within 7days at least , so it 's always worth trying .

@@24423573 @4423573/ <h> Guide to E85 Ethanol gasoline <h> E85 Fuel : What Is It ? <p> E85 is a term used to refer to rich ethanol-gas fuel blends that contain a 51%-83% ethanol ratio depending on the season and geography of use . <p> E85 fuel can and is commonly used with the flexible fuel vehicles ( FFVs ) sold by both foreign and domestic manufacturers . <p> For a motorist driving an FFV , he or she will see little difference , other than the reduced gas mileage when he or she is using E85 as opposed to the typical gasoline . When using E85 , you will notice that it provides less energy per gallon than gasoline , depending on the ethanol content present in it . In many cases , the mileage penalty will start to lessen as the ethanol content in the E85 begins to decrease . <h> E85 Tips : Fueling Stations <p> In the United States alone , there are more than two thousand four hundred public E85 fueling stations . These are stations that provide high-level ethanol blends to the over seventeen million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The high-level ethanol blends are available in over forty states , even though the largest concentration is in the Midwest . <p> You are therefore guaranteed to find a station to fuel your FFV along the roads in the U.S. In other countries supply is somewhat scarce and limited . In Europe and the UK Bio derived Ethanol may be added to forecourt fuels at up to 10% without any notification or warning required . <p> The UK has just 3000 E85 filling stations ( as of 2013 ) so it can be really hard to source . <p> E85 Ethanol gas is hard to find and few cars can use it without modification . <h> Octane Number in E85 <p> You will see that there is a lot of misinformation floating around about the virtues of ethanol blends like the E85 as compared to gasoline . It is a common belief among many hot rodders that E85 has a real advantage over petrol , even though it is hard to fully establish this fact scientifically . <p> It is difficult for one to measure octane rating in E85.directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 172 degrees F , compared to gasoline which begins to boil at between 100 and 430 degrees F. The Motor Octane Number designed to test gas requires that the air/fuel mixture be at 300 degrees F as it passes through an intake . At that temperature , ethanol will be vaporized , making the tests inconsistent . <p> As such , the ethanol octane numbers are often calculated from results that have been gathered in less than ideal operating conditions . <h> Modifying Your Engine to Use E85 Fuel <p> Almost any vehicle can be converted to run happily on E85 . The costs are not high as this can be achieved by using less than four hundred dollars , and for those looking to increase their MPG , they can do so in less than six hundred dollars . <p> You can achieve this task by adapting the fueling and timing through a remap or piggy back component . The aim is to change the duration of the vehicle injectors leaving them open for longer and hence delivering more fuel to the combustion engine . <p> The injectors themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion kits usually supply these . The FexTek plug is then inserted into the fuel injectors . For many vehicles , this will a do it yourself project and should not be very time-consuming . <p> Some components in the fuel and fuel pump system will need to be modified to resist the corrosive effect of E85 fuel . Modern engines are generally better suited than older ones . Again a good conversion kit will supply these if required . <h> Benefits of Using E85 <p> When using E85 fuel , you can expect to enjoy the following advantages : <p> Environmental Impact Ethanol is cleaner than gasoline when burning , and , therefore , produces less toxic fumes , making it advantageous as far as environmental pollution goes . It is also preferred by environmentalists as it does not contribute to greenhouse gasses . <p> Burning Facility flex fuel vehicles are designed to burn the proportion mixture in their combustion chambers . There are electronic sensors to determine the blend , and microprocessors to adjust timing and fuel injection . <p> Great Alternative to Oil FFVs use ethanol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a real alternative to using foreign purchased oil . <p> Disadvantages of Using E85 <p> E85 problems may not be many , but nevertheless , they are there and include the following ; <p> Sole Use Using ethanol can also be seen as a disadvantage because crops made available for producing the oil can not be utilized in any other way . In return , this could lead to increased prices for animal feeds . <p> Damage to the Engine Ethanol can cause damage and corrosion to an engine mainly because it absorbs dirt directly and it can be more corrosive than other fuels . <p> Fuel consumption is higher due to the lower calorific value of Ethanol but price factors help offset this when the crude oil prices are high . <p> Even though the advantages and disadvantages of using Ethanol have been a source for great debates , it is currently the most popular alternative to foreign fuel , and this can be verified by the increased number of plants requesting permission to set up ethanol production facilities . <p> This entry was filed under Articles @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234 
@@24423574 @4423574/ <p> Something I found on the interweb about diesel engine oil ............. <p> Engine oil is perhaps the most important component of a combustion engine , it provides separation of moving metal parts preventing seizure slowing the wear of components . Engine oil also cools the engine components including ( were fitted ) the turbo charger . Engine oil options are endless , from single grade mineral oils to today 's full synthetic ' race grade ' oils from an equally endless number of brands with a confusing number of classifications . Diesel engines of yesteryear were not too fussy on what oil was used , as long as it was for diesel applications it would generally provide protection , even if the oil change periods were ignored . The modern diesel ( generally 1998 onwards ) however , must use the correct oil , of the correct class and be changed at the correct intervals . Grades of oil refer to its viscosity ( thickness ) , the lower the grade the thinner the oil . We do n't have the space to explain the grade system in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Personally we prefer to use ( were possible ) an engine oil with ' body ' , such as 10/40 , 15/40 or 15/50 as our own in house tests have shown that an engine running such oils will outlast an engine running more modern oils such as 5/30 . Unfortunately higher viscosity grade oils are simply not useable in very modern diesels , the reason for this is down to the design of modern engines . Modern engines use very small oil galleries which a high viscosity oil would not pass through quickly enough . The modern engine is also running hotter meaning older type oils would effectively ' cook ' if used . One sometimes wonders if vehicle manufacturers have purposely designed there engines to run exclusively on these thin ' watery ' oils to ensure the engines do n't last too long . Diesels that ran with older style oils would easily rack up mileages of over 300k without any major engine rebuild work needed , today we see modern diesels covering not much more over 100k before a compression issue develops or some expensive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered with diesel engines that utilise a DPF ( Diesel particulate Filter ) in the exhaust system . The DPF is highly sensitive to the gases / particles that pass through it , use of incorrect oil would contaminate the DPF rendering it unusable to the point of blocking it . Diesels with a DPF system MUST use correct grade and class of oil , as a rule this is a 5/30 full synthetic high performance with low SAPS and a classification of ACEA C4 , ACEA C1 . Ensure you check your vehicle handbook before ordering engine oil , the wrong oil could very easily lead to a big repair bill . Leading from engine oils it is worth mentioning oil filters , air filter and fuel filters . With the massive greed driven motor factors battling to provide the lowest prices the supply of cheaper but inferior filters has become common . Poor quality filters fail to trap harmful particles which cause accelerated wear of components , this leads to expensive damage . In the past 3 years we have had multiple case of fuel system damage caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filters , these cases where often related to Ford TDCI vehicles . We strongly advise the use of original , branded filters and also advise they are purchased from a main dealer . Yes they are a little more expensive but the piece of mind they provide truly is priceless . <p> No car maker engineers its engines to fail . Nor do they engineer the oil specs to force the engines to fail . <p> This would completely sod up the resale value of their cars , thereby reducing the attraction of either same brand trade-ins at best . At worst it would cause a defection away from the brand . <p> It 's not to say that some makers are n't far less skillful than others in engineering cars for the long term ownership prospect . Some cars are poorly engineered , full stop . <p> I 'm sticking to my guns rigidly and suggest a full synthetic oil but do a detergent flush first . <p> Avoid the solvent type flushes ( wynns , STP etc ) - these can be problematical at times , though some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are wary , then swap the oil for a mineral one as a flush , drive a week or so and then refill with a fully synthetic , not a part synthetic - most of these are labelled semi-synthetic - they only have to contain 2% synthetic base stocks to be labelled as such . <p> What is the source for your post . I 'll hazard a guess , without prejudice , it sounds like dieselbob . <p> The real raison-d'etre for synthetics is the stability of the base stocks . There is little need for VI improvers . The deteregency packs will be the same but will do less harm to the base oil , which , because of it 's suitability for purpose will not degrade anywhere near as quickly as a by-product of dear ole Mother Earth . <p> Ha ha it was copied from the diesel bob site , if the guy is taking engines apart all day I am sure he knows what he is talking about generally , I have purchased some Forte snake oil , both engine flush and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some quality filters .

@@24423578 @4423578/ <h> VW Touareg Tuning <p> The Touareg is a good tuning project and although still quite a new model we are starting to see a lot of Touareg tuning options . <p> Many Touareg owners uprate the handling of their cars as a priority , this will certainly increase your enjoyment of the car . <p> The Touareg was not designed to be a hot hatch , but with the right mods you can certainly turn it into one without compromising its practicality . <p> The Touageg would benefit greatly from stiffer suspension and an uprated anti roll bar and strut brace - many feel the standard suspension is a little loose . <p> Our aim in Touareg engine tuning should be to increase peak power and Torque at the top end and you want a nice flat torque curve . If you get the right mods you will be rewarded with a car that handles and performs very well indeed . <p> The amazing V8 engine is just crying out for a major tune up . It certainly needs a lot of power and Torque to shift the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost 480bhp and over 540nm of Torque . <p> The 2.5 TDI is also a good base to work from with a base power figure of 174bhp remappable to over 200bhp and taking torque to around 260nm ! The V6 TDi is probably the tuners diesel engine of choice though and this can be taken to an unbelievable 280bhp and 525nm of torque ! <p> It is also worth looking at the V10 5.0 TDi if you dare with power figures after tuning approaching a heady 800nm of torque . <p> The Touareg is quite heavy and will respond well to a strict program of weight reduction . Before you start increasing the power though you should look to uprate the brakes . Aim for larger discs all round say 390+mm on the front and 375+ on the rear depending on your wheel clearances and offset . <p> Bigger 6 pot calipers allow a larger pad to be used which will further enhance your ability to stop this behemoth when it really gets moving . <p> With just a few mods you can turn your Touareg into a real bruiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both needs and can handle a lot more power . <p> The simplest mod would have to be a remap , which would handle every aspect of engine management . The remap should ideally be done last to tie in all your other tuning mods . <h> Tuning modifications . 38241 @qwx238241 38232 @qwx238232 <p> Peak power is all well and good but a driveable and fun car needs a wide power band and lots of low down torque . Fast road cams offer one of the biggest performance gains as far as a bolt on part goes . It would also pay to get the head gas flowed and ported . A big valve conversion will also help airflow . <p> If you are dramatically increasing power you should pay attention to the fueling . More power needs more fuel - it is as simple as that . Uprating the injectors is the obvious way to go if you find the engine running lean . A fuel pump will only deliver a finite amount of fuel , so you may need to uprate this if your injectors are demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Breathing mods are usually next up . Induction kits work well on turbo engines and larger engines ( if supplied with a suitable cold air feed or air box ) , for the smaller Touareg engines you should go with a sports panel air filter or induction kit with an enclosed airbox and cold air feed . <p> Do not go with the biggest exhaust you can find this will slow up the exhaust flow rate - the best for power gains are usually a big single exhaust of around 3 to 4 inches , or smaller twin pipes between 2 to 2.5 inches depending on your engine choice . <p> A good fast road power clutch will help to keep that power going where it should . Never skimp or expect a standard clutch to cope when you raise the power over 40% of standard . <p> Adding forced induction will see big power gains but this is usually too expensive to be cost effective . Turbos are harder to add than supercharger . It is harder to map a turbo as the boost comes on exponentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boost which is proportional to engine speed so is easier to map and we have already seen some stunning supercharger conversions for the Touareg V8 . To cope with forced induction you will usually need to decrease the compression ratio of the engine unless you fit water injection , use high octane fuel and use a more conservative boost setting . <h> VW Touareg Wheel modifications . <p> Alloy wheels will help the brakes cool down and are usually lighter than the steel ones . The downside to large alloy wheels on your Touareg is that you alter your effective final drive ratio and this will have a detrimental effect on acceleration and performance . <p> For this reason we would advise sticking to a maximum wheel size of 18/19 inches , although we know some of our members have gone larger than this with no problems when they used lower profile tyres and added some suspension mods. 38231 @qwx238231 <p> This @ 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Note that I am not speeder .. it was just to test the car . 2 . Acceleration is very bad .. when pressing the gas you can easily press it ll the way to the end and speed gains slowly . 3 . Gas pedal respond very slowly . 4 . When I was pressing the clutch and gas pedal i could hear a knocking sound from underneath of the car .. sometimes it was coming from back of the car and sometime from the front . I thought may be knocking sound was coming from any metal objects of the boot .. but i checked , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . when i was driving at 70mph sudden braking was making the steering wheel shakes .

I have MaxiScan , the basic code reader tool and it did n't give me any particular fault code . i will consider taking the car to someone else if the problem persist after tomorrow .. but it is really hard to make the garage people understand the problem .. they wo n't realise until they have driven it in motorway . <p> Things have been sorted . I am so happy . Worn out nearside Track Rod End was causing the banging sound . Split vacuum pipe ( connected with Solenoid Valve ) was the culprit for acceleration problem .

I love the way it sounds . exactly this is the way it used to sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banging/knocking noise led me to thinking that it only arrived after the FW change <p> It seems that my first post was spot on re " split hose " <p> As your car has a few miles on the clock and IF your car has a wastegate I would replace the hose going to the wastegate actuator NOW with a quality silicone hose as any split will bleed off pressure to the wastegate actuator which remain closed and result in much higher boost pressures that can potentially result in a blown motor . <p> NOTE this applies to all turbos with a wastegate . <p> Check all rubber hoses including the radiator ones by squeezing to see if they are still flexible and not hardened over time and replace with new if if they do n't feel right . I carry spare hoses , bulbs , belts and the basic tools needed to fit them . <p> Have had a IC pipe blow off at the track and the car lost boost pressure to the inlet manifold and still drove ok but slow .

First TorqueCars will look at what a catalyst does and how it works . <p> A catalyst is actually a term used to explain anything which accelerates or performs a chemical reaction . In a car the exhaust fumes are fed through a matrix of ceramic honeycomb lined with precious metals . <p> As the metals heat up they cause the gases flowing through them to react and change into less harmful substances . <p> Diesel catalysts : In a 2 way diesel catalyst the CO2 and O2 into 2CO2 ( carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide and partially burnt fuel into carbon dioxide and water . ) Diesels also have particulate filters . <p> Petrol catalysts : 3 way catalysts are used in modern petrol engines . These convert nitrogen oxide into nitrogen and oxygen , carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons ( partially burnt fuel ) into carbon dioxide and water . <p> A catalyst will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used whilst it is cool . Therefore you should avoid jump starting a car with a catalyst and you must avoid short journeys . <p> We will then see if there are power gains from a sports or high flow cat and compare these with the removal of the catalyst altogether . <p> First the sports catalyst or sport cat . This has a much greater flow rate than a standard cat . It is constructed of the same materials but the chamber size and smoothness allows the exhaust gases to flow through more quickly . <p> In terms of efficiency they will have the same effect as a standard cat on your vehicles emissions . They create less turbulence than a standard cat and have a finer matrix and therefore a greater internal surface area . <p> The catalyst has been viewed as a major enemy of your cars power output , but does the reality bear this out ? <p> Weight is also a consideration , and a sports cat will typically weight less than a standard catalyst . Most sports cats are a drop in replacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit a car which has had a sports exhaust upgrade . <p> The power gains on smaller engines will be barely noticeable . On larger engines you can see power gains of between 4 and 10bhp . Generally the more power the car is producing the greater the benefit will be from a sports cat . <p> The de-cat pipe is a popular choice by many . This is a pipe which replaced the catalyst causing the exhaust fumes to flow freely . A de-cat is a cheap option but there are some drawbacks . In some cars with O2 sensors you will create a fault as far as the ECU is concerned . This may result in the car running in a fail safe limp home mode . Alternatively the engine may decide that due to the amount of unburnt oxygen it will use less fuel . This causes the engine to run lean . <p> Other cars have the Lambda or O2 sensor before the catalyst so will happily run with a de-cat pipe . This though is an illegal modification in most countries where mandatory CO2 reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car will fail its emissions test and you could risk prosecution . <p> Fitting a de-cat will again give a modest power gain but this will be similar to the power gain on offer with a sports cat . The sports cat has the benefit of being legal and keeps the car within its emission requirements . <p> Many people subscribe to the popular misconception that a catalyst is the enemy of your cars power . <p> This is mainly due to the experience of people who had early catalysts fitted . <p> This was around 1992 in the UK . To cope with stringent emissions the manufacturers introduced the catalyst and use the Lambda sensor to measure emissions . <p> To get the emissions down and economy up most makers de-tuned their engines . When comparing a pre 1992 vehicle with an earlier one the earlier one would usually seem to be more powerful . <p> The post 1992 cars had better fuel economy . So in reality the catalyst had very little impact on the cars power and most of this was down to the manufacturers latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly since its introduction so there is little to be gained for most modern cars . <p> As the power gain is only going to be 4-10 bhp on all but the least powerful engines we can not really recommend this modification unless your engine is already producing in excess of 200bhp or your power band is quite high up the rev range like in many VTEC engines . <p> If however your catalyst needs replacing we would strongly recommend the benefits of a sports catalyst , you might as well take the extra performance on offer and the cost is generally not much more than a standard OEM catalyst . <p> The prices of an original catalyst and a sports catalyst are very similar , so if you are spending the money you may just as well get a high performance alternative . 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

This is often down to poor planning and preparation . <p> When you telephone the first task is to find out if it is a dealer trading from home . TorqueCars recommend that you haggle over the phone before you see the car - most people are after a sale and will lower their price if it is the only way to get you to see it . This also applies when buying from a dealer <p> Rough cars tend to have rough owners - so look at the seller as well as the car . <p> Most back street dealers buy cars with minor accident damage and spend the minimal amount of money on parts and make the car look good . Often major chassis damage is ignored with new panels fitted to cover the damage . <p> The back street dealer will often have a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm calling about the car " - a genuine private sale will know which car you are talking about but the dealer will need to identify the car and will ask " which car , the Audi ? " or ask " where did you see the ad " . Remember the type of person you buy from is an indication of the type of car - rough cars have rough owners . <p> Next rule is never inspect a car in the wet - you will miss so many imperfections in the bodywork if it is wet ! Also look at the seams in the car - gaps should be the same at the top of a panel as they are at the bottom . Uneven gaps between panels or crooked bonnet and small dents in the roof edges can all suggest accident damage and a substandard repair . <p> The paint should also match on all of the panels . Beware of cars with body-kits and wacky paint jobs - ask to see a receipt for the work and only buy the car if it was done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage is to respray the whole car . Even if the car is in its original colour look out for signs of over-spray on plastic particularly around the lights , mirrors and at the edges of the engine bay . <p> Next step is to start the engine - first feel the exhaust and make sure it has not been warmed up - many problems are evident on cold engines and people will pre warm them so they start easily and run smoothly . <p> When the engine has started the temp guage should move into the operating range quite quickly - while you wait for this to happen open the bonnet and listen for rattles at the top of the engine indicating worn valves , tappets or cam problems . Get a friend to rev the engine and look out for blue smoke - oil burning - black smoke a bad sign especially on a turbo model <p> Test drive - take the car for a good few miles . We at TorqueCars recommend that you have adequate insurance cover for this , many policies will cover you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this is sufficient and you could find you have to pay the cost of repairs yourself . <p> When driving the car check it does not pull to one side when braking or acceleration - choose a road with no camber for this test . Move up through the gears and move down then skip a gear 1st to 3rd to 5th down again then 2nd to 4th and down again . <p> This should highlight any gear change issues . Being in too high a gear will tell you about the condition of the engine - if it judders and splutters there could be a problem but a good engine will steadily increase speed until the correct speed is attained so start off in 3rd or 4th if the car has sufficient torque . After the test drive look under the car for oil leaks and check the engine over for signs of recent leaks - it may have been cleaned up but a good test drive will allow the leak to surface again . Torquecars would recommend that you test drive a car for at least 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new car . <p> Check all paper work thoroughly - ring the previous owner and ask them about the car . If the sellers name is not shown as the current owner find out why ? Is it his car to sell ? Run an outstanding finance check and see if the car has been listed as an accident damaged write off by an insurer . <p> Also avoid buying a car which has only been owned for a couple of months or had a large number of recent registered keepers and do not touch a car that has not been serviced in the last year . These questions should be asked over the phone at the beginning and will save you a lot of wasted time . Also ask about the reason they are selling - you can tell from their reply if they are genuine or not . 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

We are talking about very high voltages as we are trying to get a spark to arc through a gap . <p> Be very careful working on any part of a cars high tension circuit . Never work on it with the engine running . Many cold start faults are caused by faulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves of what goes on inside our engine . <p> A good strong spark will maximize the power and economy of an engine . A sightly wider gap and higher voltage coil will produce a bigger spark . <p> The suck has a big effect on the bang or combustion part of the process . Any restriction in the suck will affect the efficiency of the burn . The more air that gets sucked in the more fuel can be efficiently burnt . <p> Primarily you need a strong spark so make sure you have a good set of spark plugs with a slightly wider gap than standard ( some TorqueCars members increase the gap by 20-50% but this is not recommended on many modern engines ! ) <p> For older types of engine and plug lining the spark gap to be on the side of the intake can also increase the efficiency of the burn , this tends to happen automatically on modern plugs as they have a directional thread to facilitate this lining up . <p> To line up the electrode with the intake : With the plug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge , at the top so you can see it as it goes into the engine , with a marker pen to show which side the gap is on . This is called indexing the plug . <p> All plug threads will typically be different , especially on cheaper plugs . If the mark does not line up with the intake you 'll need to use very thin washers to alter it 's position . Ideally spend money on a good set of plugs that will all match up . <p> The spark will always take the shortest path so on a twin , triple or quad tipped plug the gaps must be the same all round otherwise you may just as well have a single contact point . You ' still only get one spark from a multiple electrode but the additional electrodes extend life and share out the wear . Join the debate which is raging on in our forum to establish whether triple or quad plugs increase a cars performance or not . <h> High performance HT ( high tension ) Leads <p> Faulty high tension leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will just prevent the spark from happening so if you are having a misfire or uneven idle make sure the HT leads are in good order flexing and bending them is often enough to damage then so make sure that they are handled carefully . A set of good quality HT leads will minimise electrical faults especially in extreme temperatures but will not in themselves increase performance . <p> The HT leads should have the lowest internal resistance and also provide electromagnetic shielding to prevent electrical interference with other car components such as the main engine control unit ( including the radio ) . <p> The lead should be matched to the voltage as the wrong size core can lead to heat problems and resistance issues . A sports lead size will be as large as 8.5 mm diameter with a 1 or 2mm internal core , whereas a street tuned car will probably get away with 7 or 8 mm sizes with a 1mm core size . Most HT lead suppliers can assist you in choosing the right length and core size for your cars application . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low current is carried to the coil pack which generally sits on or near to the spark plug . The correct term for this is an ignition lead as it is not carrying a high tension voltage from the coil . Internal resistance and breaks and cracks will still have an effect on performance so the foregoing paragraph is still applicable . <h> Performance ignition coils and coil packs . <p> Just as a power transformer converts mains 240 volts into a usable 9 volts for your charger or appliance a coil will increase the voltage ( in some installations up to 40,000 volts ) allowing the creation of a spark which can jump the gap between the plugs . <p> In some modern engines there is a separate coil pack with a separate coil for each spark plug . A faulty coil can also reduce the spark voltage to the point that no spark happens and you end up with a misfire . <p> Sports coils increase the power to the plug and allow a larger spark so match a sports coil with a larger plug gap . Timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the engine could be damaged and too late and the compression will be lower as the exhaust port opens potentially causing damage to the cat &amp; exhaust as combustion move down along the exhaust . <p> Ideally you want to create a spark inside the cylinder of the engine and expose as much of the spark as possible to the compressed air and fuel mixture . Ideally the electrodes should be as thin as possible and be good conductors of electricity and the voltage should be as high as possible . Spark plug technology has really moved on in recent years and iridium tipped plugs allow an ultra fine electrode , last for up to 40,000 miles and are superb conductors of electricity . <h> Ignition system maintenance . <p> A good steady power supply is vital for a good strong spark , common problems in an old engine are actually caused by a bad earth connection ( actually just the connection to the -ve battery terminal ) . Power regulators are available which ensure that a constant voltage is always available . <p> If you have a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may find that on a cold day when a battery typically struggles it will fail so ensure you have a battery with a large cranking power which although only gives 12V , it will do so in a much more steady manner and be more resilient to adverse conditions . <p> Ensure that the spark plugs are clean and in good condition as the terminals may well glaze and lose their conductivity to a small degree over time ( expensive plugs are typically more resistant to glazing and can be left for longer periods of time ) . <p> So every six months or so it can be beneficial on normal plugs ( we are not here referring to iridium or performance/long life spark plugs ) to deglaze them by rubbing them over with a fine wire brush or fine metal file ( do not use a fine grade of sandpaper - the bits will end up in the engine ! ) . This keeps the conductivity of the contact points and ensures a strong spark thereby maintaining both performance and economy . 38243 @qwx238243 38233 @qwx238233 <h> Feedback 38237 @qwx238237 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Generally the Mitsubishi ECU is replaced with an aftermarket one which is fully programmable and covers everything from Boost to fueling . <p> When tuning the GTO you must not overlook the importance of uprating the fueling .

@@24423594 @4423594/ <h> The best tuning modifications for the Integra . <p> " Maintaining your ' integraity ' " <p> The original Integra was actually a joint project between Rover and Honda , who wanted to create a new model which would appeal to europe . The Rover 200 and Integra DC2 share many similarities as far as body styling goes . The engines and suspension choices are perfected in the Type R. <p> Honda took the Integra platform on through 3 generations adding many refinements and improvements along the way . <p> This page is only a general introduction to tuning the Integra models and only touches on the many options , for more detail we suggest you join our friendly and active forums for specific tips . <p> The Type R Integra was a perfect example of a track day car you can use as a reliable daily transport . It features a stunning engine which has been carefully balanced , flowed and set up from the factory . The chassis has also been carefully tweaked to provide driver feedback and stunning levels of grip and handling . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort was made to save weight so many standard gadgets were removed . There was for example , no radio or air conditioning , although many owners have added these options . <p> Also the sound deadening was removed which does save weight but makes the car a sheer driver 's delight . The engine positively sings when the VTEC kicks in . <p> The high revving nature of all of Honda 's petrol engines make for some positive gains when adding tuning mods . Getting air into the engine and the exhaust gases out again are priorities . <p> Exhaust , intake and air filters can all give you the edge but for serious power gains you have to start looking at doing internal engine modifications such as balancing , gas flowing , porting and polishing . <p> Please note it is not a matter of bigger is better when it comes to airflow , if you read our articles on exhaust and induction kits you will gain further insights into the world of professional power tuning . <p> Stroker kits can increase the displacement of the engine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The early DC2 was hailed as the ultimate front drive car , a testimony to the R&amp;D boys at Honda who tweaked and set this car up to be the best driver 's car around . They have avoided the modern school of tuning with superchargers and turbos and shown everyone what can be done with a highly tuned , high revving NASP engine . <p> The newer DC5 is a stunning car , and shows up pretty much every other contemporary FWD car around but there are many fans of the original who feel it does not match up to the DC2 . <p> So how do you improve on perfection ? It is fair to say that most of the cheaper aftermarket performance parts rarely improve on the standard Honda set up . <p> If you have a basic non performance Integra , then the obvious options are to look at the Type R parts bin for suitable upgrades . Brakes and suspension should rate pretty high up but engine swaps and gearbox changes make a massive difference on base models . <p> The DC5 is rated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It combines a good chassis setup with a powerful engine . <p> It is possible to source performance enhancing parts . One of the most popular modifications on the DC2 and DC5 are high flow exhaust headers . These allow the exhaust gases to flow out of the exhaust efficiently . <p> Your selection of a lighter flywheel and fast road cam is probably one of the biggest power adding mods you can do on most of the Integra engines . Our forums are a great place to discuss these options in detail so you can get the right set up for your particular engine . <p> Do n't dismiss weight reduction either , this is something Honda did in the Type R models and this strategy improves handling and performance . <p> Some enthusiastic owners have started fitting superchargers . Although the engines are high compression you can get away with a low boost supercharger and it really changes the character of the engine . We have also seen a fantastic turbo conversion on an early DC2 but this required a full engine rebuild and some clever mapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power figure . <p> Putting all that power down through the front wheels is just asking for trouble . But with a good limited slip differential and suspension set up it is possible to channel upwards of 250bhp through the front wheels in a usable manner . <p> Many owners note that the powerful Integras can struggle in wet conditions . This makes your choice of tyre of paramount importance . A good directional tread pattern on some wider alloys will make quite a difference . <p> As far as lowering the car goes we would recommend that you try and resist the urge . The standard suspension setup is actually superb on the type R models . Standard models will benefit from a drop of around 40 mm . <p> Uprated bushings can make a big difference to handling and should be considered on all older models where they have become brittle . <p> As the shocks get older you may suffer a little extra roll and wallow so this would be a good time to get some good quality coil overs . TorqueCars always recommend you get adjustable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's setup until you get it right . <p> Induction kits can also help raise power as long as you have a cold air feed ( at least in the upper RPM band ) . Under bonnet temperatures can rob you of significant power so you would be wasting your time adding an induction kit without the cold air feed . A bonnet vent near the filter will also help keep the intake temperature down . <p> @daryll , yeah if you want the best out of your motor , then changing the cams will increase lift &amp; duration and you can allow more air into your cylinders and with greater fuel have a greater combustion . which means , more power = 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

This has to be the engine of choice as far as the tuner goes . <p> Avoid the tiptronic gearbox as this saps a lot of power from the wheels and go with a 5 or closer ratio 6 speed box instead .

Whilst on some engines this wont be a problem it will be on the legacy . <p> If you intend to run enough boost to make it worthwhile you may need to change : The pistons to lower the compression ratio the rods and maybe the block and cams The ecu will need changing or a complete remap <p> bigger injectors <p> then there is the turbo installation , - pipes oil/water lines , bigger or front mount intecooler and of course once you have that extra power then the rest of the car needs upgrading to cope with the extra power . <p> It is probably easier and cheaper to either buy a turbo engine or a turbo legacy <p> Or to put it a different way xcheck your spec with the turbo engine and that is half the answer

@@24423599 @4423599/ <h> Golf TDI 1.9 Sport ( 105bhp ) <p> Hi guys , I am new here and new to tuning cars in general ! I am still learning to apologies if my questions are noobish . <p> Basically I am looking to upgrade the car . From what I no diesel 's are good at producing high amounts of torque which kicks in early . I am looking to maximise this - I am not so fussed about top speed and bhp ( i no this goes hand in hand with torque though ) but more about getting that quick pull . <p> As far as I am aware on the stock engine the maximal sort of upgrade I can get with a remap alone without wearing out of the car is about 240n.m. of torque and around 130bhp . However I would like to push the torque output to 300+ <p> Basically I am looking for information on what sort of upgrades I will need to look at to sustain , achieve or increase this sort of power e.g. intercooler , new clutch etc . What brands provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Even just a pointer in the right direction and i will look into it myself . Thanks for any help . <p> I know a tuner who made 175 hp out of such engine . He saiz it was under owner 's request and he advices nobody to tune so far full stock car because everything is on max - turbo and injectors and injecting time etc . ( I am no tuner expert so do n't bash on me if I write some inacurate term ) I guess remaping to 130 hp is somewhat conservative . <p> Almost forget , he claims that one year after remap owner still drives that car without issues . If it is so , I guess the owner is very thoughtfull about heating and cooling the engine and turbo . <p> Some often recomended route would be remap and suspension of your choise , but if you want more many people suggest to install biger turbo , FMIC , injectors/nozzles , clutch , remap . <p> Yeah there is no way I would out put that sort of power on stock alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly spoke to said he will only push cars to a certain level as he does n't them breaking down after 6months and damaging his reputation . I think that 's why he stuck with around a 30bhp gain and still run relatively safely . <p> Could you point me in the direction of turbo 's that would be compatible with the golf tdi mk4 , I guess this would be a good starting point . From there I can work out what else will need to be upgraded to allow for it cost etc . Thanks for the help . <p> Your engine should go quite happily to 160+ bhp . You 'll probably struggle for a steady 300lbft but what you will get with a good remap is a much flatter ( and fatter ) torque curve . This simple flattening of the torque delivery makes astounding differences to the way the car drives . <p> Additionally , a good tuner will possibly be able to offer short term overboost , so you might be allowed to have 300lbft for say twenty seconds or so of full pedal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out put that sort of power on stock alone engine alone ! The guy at the garage I have briefly spoke to said he will only push cars to a certain level as he does n't them breaking down after 6months and damaging his reputation .

Thanks for the help . 38230 @qwx238230 <p> That is why i explained how " my " tuner saiz it is not recomendable . But gives you a insight for what is capable when all is maxed out . About turbos , Garret 1749VB ( not sufix V and not VA ! ) is from PD150 . I do n't know is it plug and play for your engine . For biger numbers people use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vendors which making hybrids . For even biger numbers people use gt2052v , gt2260 and likes . In last couple of years seems like many apreciate newer generation of GTB turbos - GTB1756vk , GTB2056vk or GTB2260vk. ( maybe i missed some of numbers but you can verify them easily with " google " . Some even report good flow with Vauxhall/Saab turbo out of 2,2 liter DTI engines - GT18v aka GT1852V . All of them , except 1749vb and hybrids need heavy conversions - custom manifolds , reclocking , and in case of GTB series even changing the way the ECU manage VNT . They have electronic actuation and need to be translated for vacuum actuator . So , I think 1749VB should be cost efective upgrade , altough not cheap yet . <p> Of course , everything I say should be taken with caution ! Ask some more people and/or wait for someonehere to agree or disagree with what i have writen . <p> Thanks turbonutter. @HDi ... the car is 2006 with 60,000 miles ( if that is relevant ) . 38230 @qwx238230 <p> I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fine , no cause for concern at all . <p> The figures are supplied are based upon Celtic Tuning 's figures anyway and that 's pretty much what you 'll see from your car . The PD engines will tune ' harder ' but 270 is lbft will make a significant change to the car 's acceleration . <p> I had a 406 2.2 HDi remapped . It delivered nearly 320lbft and went extremely well . Consider that your Golf is significantly lighter than a 406 you should see some very impressive performance gains with a remap alone . <p> That 's very hard to determine to be honest . It 's something to which I do n't pay much attention . My 406 was booked listed at 9.6 and a very unscientific test saw sub eight seconds without smoking tyres and clutches and without driving through to the limiter . More impressive was 50-70 in sub four seconds in FOURTH gear . 30-50 under three seconds in THIRD . <p> Trust me you 'll notice the difference in acceleration far far more than you think you will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remap . <p> The 30 - 50 time sounds amazing ! That is probably were I am looking for the most power boost to be honest . Think I will defo go for the remap at least . 38230 @qwx238230 <p> You wo n't be disappointed , of that I can assure you . I found the overtaking prowess to be stunning with all the extra torque . I 'm using a BMW 528i SE at the moment , which is a 2.8 litre 24 valve straight six petrol model and it 's spineless in comparison to the 406 . <p> If you do choose to commit to subsequent mechanical mods you will have to have the ECU code changed again to take advantage of the mechanical upgrades . Many operators will do subsequent remaps for a lower fee than the first remap . <p> Thanks Zwaf .. lot of info there for me to take in . Good starting point for me to look into turbo 's many thanks ! 38230 @qwx238230 <p> Do n't thank me ! Thank to HDI fun instead ! Really ! I tryed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advising you to try just remap first . You could be very pleased and save a lot of money for mods you maybe do n't wan na in first place . <p> Things I listed I have n't done myself . I know of them because I explore that route just like you do . And trust me it is not polite to your account . Once you bite the bullet one mode require another if you wan na maintain drivebility and keep your car reliable . <p> Read again what HDI wrote and reread this sentence in my first post : " Some often recomended route would be remap and suspension of your choise . " . <p> Because of hastle and expense take the next step only if you are sure you wanted or need it . <p> the limiting factor on the 105 bhp engines are the injectors and intercooler and turbo but the block and head is exactly the same , best hunt around for for pd130/150 parts for making more power , 300bhp 400lbft is possible using the gt2260 , the are found on BMW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cams are the same in all 1,9 TDI ( at lest as far as I know ) . PD130/150 got biger injectors then PD105 . PD150 got GT1749VB turbine . PD130 and PD150 got the same rods , but pd150 got different pistons - different ring position so got smaller compression ratio . <p> About optimistic numbers look for SMChiptuning on Youtube . There you can find some TDI videos on rollers and during street race . That guy who runs SMChiptuning company got proves for 300+ BHP out of 1,9TDI - 13 sec on 402 meters . <p> More then half relly cars , hill climbers and circuit runners from Bosnia And Hertzegovina , Croatia and Serbia use his services when comes to maping out of scratch for highly moded race cars . <p> That Golf with 1,9 liter and stock 105 BHP is remaped upon request . Owner just whant to see what is possible . Owner of SMChiptuning highlighted that this is not recomendable , but he also admites he was suprised aswell ! Everything on that car is maxed out - injecting durations , turbine pressures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight out exhaust . <p> Back on topic , If 130-140 BHP out of safe remap is not enough , best hunt is PD130/150 parts - turbo and injectors . Turbo in Pd150 is biger ( better ) but costs more , and injectors are same on PD130/150 . Untill 170bhp it is not necessery to install FMIC , but I guess it wont hurt as long as you do n't  use something to big and in that way induce turbo lag . GT2260v turbine reportedly gives high BHP figures , but at cost of low rev response . GT1749VB is godd for about 190BHP . Hybrid 17/22 is good for about 200-210BHP . GTB1756vk is good for 220+ BHP and spools like stock , but require pretty much moding to suit - as all GTB turbos does ! GTB2056vk spools about 100 revs later but it is good for real big numbers . I never got chance to drive car which is moded that way so my words are just an echo of other people and my only intention is to give you something to explore yourself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even got my remap done in different place . ( because in that time I did not even hear for SMchiptuning , altough he is much closer to me then then company where i got my remap done ) <p> no point hyrbidising that turbo when you can get a more powerful one of the later models 38230 @qwx238230 <p> far from being an expert on vw tdi 's but the later models are straight swap/bolt on ? how much it would cost for a new or used one ? at least a hybrid wo n't cost a leg and a arm , you know what you getting/doing , it 's a straight swap and as far as i understood from DG87TDI it will be more than enough for +300n.m. with a remap only . <p> not actually sure , is the 105 a PD engine ? if it is then apart from a few pipes it will be bolt on , if you 've a decent scrappy around you then shouldnt be too hard to get hold of a decent one for less than what it would cost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give you over 300ftlb never mind nm with a remap <p> i can get your turbo serviced and " custom " hibridised for -550 p&amp;p included ( in portugal ) . how much would it cost a similar service in england ? simply put it will be a new turbo for little money and up to your specs ... with the advantege of no mods needed to bolt in. i do n't  really trust scrapp yards when it comes to tuning .... <p> 700 is not a bad price ! ( i think ) about the scrappy i only talk from my experience back in my country .... sometimes it can get VERY expensive and not very good/reliable option ... but if you say here in england you can get decent stuff from a scrappy , hey why not , i will think about it next time i need something <p> Hello again guys , have done a little bit research ( and saving ) while I have had time to .

These are quite light and small ( for an SUV ) so will make a good tuning project and with the right performance upgrades you can substantially increase your driving fun . <p> You can do much to improve the performance of your Vitara with our step by step tuning tips . The key to Vitara tuning is getting the right mods - a lot of money can be wasted if you do it wrong . <p> Improving the handling should be your first priority in your Vitara tuning project . Drop the car by as much as 45mm and fit stiffer dampers , bigger drops will need other modifications in most instances . If you intend to use the car off road then you should just stiffen the suspension a little , perhaps raising the ride height and fitting larger chunky tyres . <p> Our aim in Vitara engine tuning should be to increase peak power and Torque through the entire rev range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some decent track times and maintain it 's reputation as a good solid reliable daily driver . 38238 @qwx238238 <h> Engine tuning mods . <p> These are the mods that are usually performed by our members , decide how far you want to go before you start . <p> Getting the correct grade of mods for your planned usage of the car is vital . Stage 3 motorsport mods just do n't work well on the road difficult in stop start traffic . <p> Your aims when tuning should be a flat and wide torque curve . You do n't want all the torque to be at the top end unless you are creating a motorsport car . In this article we shall give your a good starting base to the best performance parts for your car , but we 'd encourage you to spend some time on the site looking into the details of each type of performance modification . <p> Fast road cams offer one of the biggest performance gains for your money as far as a bolt on part goes on a NASP engine . It improves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if done right . Ideally you 'd add other mods and finish up with a reflashed ECU . <p> TorqueCars would caution you not to go with a motor sports profile cam as this affects the engines idling and general town driving characteristics.You will need to ensure that the engine is not starved of fuel so will need to uprate the fueling . If you find you have flat spots and surges after your mods you should check the fueling and try a higher octane fuel as well . Uprated injectors will enable you to supply sufficient fuel to the engine . A fuel pump will only deliver a finite amount of fuel , so you may need to uprate this if your injectors are demanding more fuel . 38228 @qwx238228 <p> The next area for modification is the intake and exhaust . Please note that WE DO NOT RECOMMEND INDUCTION KITS , unless you have tuned your car extensively and are finding that the standard air intake has become a restriction . <p> Maximum power gains come from a full induction kit with a cold air feed on heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box but a panel filter should suffice for most applications . TorqueCars suggest you use a panel air filter as these are easy to clean and maintain and generally perform better than paper ones . <p> Sports exhausts can help increase the flow of gases through the engine . But if the exhaust pipe is too big , ie : it 's over 2.0 inches bore , you will lose a lot of the flow rate and end up losing power and torque . <p> Head work including a gas flow ( ported and polished ) and 3 or 5 angle valve job will really help to release the potential of the engine . A good fast road upgraded clutch will help to keep that power going where it should . Never cut corners or expect a standard OEM clutch to cope . Turbo engines are just crying out to be Upgraded . You will see significant power gains on most modern turbochaged cars including diesels making a remap one of the most cost effective and significant modifications for your money . <p> We 've also come across some owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hikes . <p> Adding forced induction will see large power gains but this is usually too expensive to be cost effective . It is usually simpler to bolt on a supercharger than it is to get a turbo working . Turbos increase power in exponential proportion to rising engine speed and this can make mapping difficult . Superchargers will give a boost which is directly proportional to engine speed so is easier to map . Decreasing the engines compression ratio will allow you to add forced induction , water injection may also help prevent detonation. 38226 @qwx238226 <p> Because alloys are lighter they improve performance and they will help to cool the brake disks . We 'd like to point out although they can look cool on the Vitara big alloy wheels will actually decrease your performance . The larger you go the lower your acceleration will be - this to the change in your effective final drive ratio . For this reason we would advise sticking to a maximum wheel size of 17-18 inches , although we know some of our members have installed larger rims with no problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Maybe not , I just got that sort of vibe from them ... <p> Soooo ... <p> Does anyone out there know what could be wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sucking in a load of *#*#*#*# and cant sustain combustion properly so injects a bit more fuel in to compensate , hence the bouncy rev counter at idle ... <p> The car is alos fine once started up but gets worse at running temp . I 've also driven it without the airbox on for a short distance and the idle seemed to handle it a bit better .. <p> Being drive by wire you will need to reset the throttle body after cleaning this is either done by vagcom or disconnecting the battery for 30-60 minutes. ( make sure you have your radio code ) This is an easy free step and may resolve your issue . Also does the 1.6 have an idle control valve ? <p> I 've reset the system by disconecting the battery and I 've got a little cheap diagnostics reader too where I removed any codes . the trouble is , the reader is for older vw 's and the codes did n't tally up with any which are in the booklet . <p> I think I 've found the problem for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where people have had similar problems . It 's a build up of oil from the crankcase breather where oil vapour gets caught and should go back into the system but gets clogged up after time .

I 've just done a 130 mile round trip and there 's now no gunk coming from the breather pipe ( for now anyway ) but the cars idle is still jumping from about 600 to 800 rpm continuously .

Thinking it 's got ta be a sensor somewhere that 's gone tit 's up . I 'm kinda new to all this sensor business because my old mk3 golf had what seems like none compared to this motor ! <p> Cleaned the MAF and EGR valves and gave the throttle body another clean . Both the MAF and EGR were filthy ! It is definitely better but still not 100% . I think the engine may just be a bit gunked up and need a bit of a thrashing . I 've put some fuel additive into a full tank of petrol and am doing a 130mile trip later so sure that will help clean her out . <p> I cleaned out the MAP sensor and EGR sensor along with the throttle body again . Put it all back together and it was driving nice and the revs were n't bouncing around at idle ( or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile round trip over xmas and now the rev counter was back to normal bouncing from 600 to 800rpm over and over at idle . But my little diagnostics reader is n't reading any faults . <p> I 've just taken the throttle body off and it 's caked in black soot again , which I think is coming from the Exhaust Gas Recirculation . I 've cleaned the throttle body right up again , checked the MAP sensor and it 's all clean . <p> The breather pipe is now not an issue . no gunk in there whatsoever , so that is good news at least . Think it just needed a clean out and a couple of long journeys . <p> I 'm going to re-assemble the throttle body and leave the EGR unplugged for a few days and see how it gets on . <p> Just a bit concerned that my engine could be burning a lot of oil , but then if the intake manifold is dirty it will burn the crap that 's in the manifold and then re-circulate some of that crap back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EGR valve has gone , I 've done several miles with it unplugged and the idle seems to be fine , once it 's plugged back in and after a good little while , probably 50 - 100 miles the idle starts to roughen up . <p> I think this is partly due to the engine burning a lot of oil , so the oily exhaust fumes are getting re-circulated back into the intake and is clogging up the throttle body . I think that the throttle body is getting clogged and the ecu ca n't judge the mixture that needs to be going through to keep the running smooth . <p> It 's as though it starts to stall ( revs drop to about 600rpm ) and then the ECU goes ' Oh *#*#*#*# ! ' and shoves some more fuel in to keep it alive . <p> That may not be the case but seems to me at least to be logical ... <p> I think the car 's a bit knackered to be honest , not done a compression test yet but I 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of power and burning a fair amount of oil ? ... <p> I think it 's had a wrong gear box fitted to it too by one of the 2 previous owners , which I think is why the speedo is out , seems like it 's probably got a lower ratio box on ? Just a guess at the mo . <p> No more problems with gunky mayo oil in the breather pipe now though which I guess is at least one good thing , <p> Well with regards to the incorrect speedo reading , are your wheels and tyre sizes still OEM ? On my Saab as I graduated up in sizes from the factory 17 " and through to my aftermarket 19 " . A Tech II diagnostic and programming tool had to be used to tell the car what wheel size was fitted now , this then altered the speedo accordingly . Just a suggestion as to what your issue might be .... <p> Na , the tyres are the right size . Pretty sure it 's the wrong gear box . for example - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the revs match the speed . so at 70mph on the clock I 'm at around 3k rpm. but 70mph on my clock is more like 58mph . <p> Also , my mileage is clocking up too high . I drove from Leeds to Whitby last Sunday with the girlfriend and the satnav said 73 mile but the clock in my car said 88 ! that 's a fair few mile more . And no I did n't get lost or go a different route . just checked on Google too , 73 miles . <p> Not checked the Gear box code thoroughly yet but when I had a quick look I could n't find one .

@@24423603 @4423603/ <h> Dump Valves <p> If you did n't  already know , I have a Peugeot 206 HDi 2.0 D-Turbo , you should know this as my signature makes it painfully obvious . I want dump valves for my car , they are very common on diesels with turbos right ? I want the sound anyway and my mate said it could cost me -350 in total whilst a different mate said it would cost -50 or less . <p> You can get a kit that makes dump valve noises via under bonnet speakers for fifty quid . <p> I never thought that a dump valve was applicable to a diesel engine . Diesels run on excess air ( no throttle to restrict air intake , like a petrol car has ) so no need for a dump valve . <p> When you lift off the pedal in your ( diesel ) car all you 're doing is telling the ECU to stop fuelling . Air flow is never changed , so your turbocharger will spin up equally quickly in the next gear . There 's no need to ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the nature of a diesel engine . <p> PS : - HDi Peugeot diesel units sound pretty nice anyway , they hiss and make air intake noises under acceleration that are quite sexy ( if cars ' noises can be as such ) <p> Dump valves have a use in off-road petrol fuelled rally cars . To me they sound like someone trying to flush a toilet inorder to dispose of an unrequited turd and an over size sanitary towel . Not so sexy , really . <p> Dump valves allow the turbo(s) to carry on spinning in free air when the throttle is closed during gear changes . It helps to eliminate turbo lag . If you 're a race driver you probably wo n't need ' em as you 'll keep the throttle pedal flat down ( against the rev limiter ) during changes anyway . <p> Clearly this is more economical if your sponsor is paying for your tyres , clutches , and fuel . <p> Dump valves do n't really have a place on the road with sophisticated engine management systems . <p> The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve as such , in terms of airflow restriction . Diesel engines are controlled only by the amount of fuel metered and subsequently injected , and the amount of air that the turbo is shoving in . Clearly all this under ECU control in your car , as it is in mine . <p> Do n't you think that the almost ultrasonic hiss of the turbocharger compensates ? A sympathetic ECU remap will make it sound much nicer . And it will go beautifully , too . <p> Sadly , none of these will recreate the authentic sound of a proper mechanical dump valve . <p> I think you 'll find that they 're getting scarcer even in petrol turbo track racing cars as the ECU 's now control so much of the engine that the function can be taken over electronically by artificially ' damping ' the throttle valve and wastegate . <p> I 'll do some more research . If you want to get a true Peugeot specialist 's opinion then please do contact Matt Jobling of Pug1Off Limited on 01280 701919 . He 's the only man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He 's done some really impressive conversions . For example : installing two 3.0 V6 's in a 306 . You may have seen it in Max Power magazine . <p> It 's as simple as not bothering . HDi 's sound nice anyway , especially if you get it re-mapped to wind up the boost pressure low down . Even the 90bhp will go to over 120 and sound like a rally car at low revs . <p> Celtic Tuning did mine - given my car is 139bhp in factory tune the 192 they got is stunning . No need to use it all though - changing up at 2500rpm still leaves you well ahead of 16v two litre Golf Gti 's etc . The torque in the midrange is absolutely silly . The car will fidget if you over pedal it in third ( in the wet fourth can be interesting ! ) . <p> What you get though is the delight in driving a car that pulls in all gears evenly . No peaks , no troughs , just loads and loads of torque . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for litre a high tech turbo-diesel engine is going to outrun a petrol engine of the same size with consumate ease . That 's before we modify either of ' em . Diesels are also very quiet now with all the added ( costly ) technology such as dual mass flywheels , hydraulic engine mounts etc . <p> My 2.2 HDi with a remap has the sort of mid revs mid speed range shove that you 'd expect from a 3.5 litre petrol engine . Surely the 3.5 will win in the end as it can be revved to 7000rpm plus . In gear though , not much in it . <p> Whether you make any monetary savings is debatable . Diesels do need more frequent servicing ; the filters are more numerous and more costly ; the engine oils have to be fully synthetic etc. road tax is levied above a petrol car . <p> I 'd stick with the 206 , consider a good custom re-map , run it on BP ultimate diesel and dose up with Millers Diesel Sport additive.

With indirect injection the atomised fuel spray helps to keep the inlet valves clean but with direct injection into the cylinder there is no such cleansing action . The contamination is caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crankcase ventilation system and with a turbo engine the CCV discharges into the turbo inlet . <p> Have a Google about the changes VW are having to make to their 1.4 TSI engine re carbon formation . <p> Just buy a car with a turbo mate .

@@24423612 @4423612/ <h> What is Chip Tuning ? <p> The days of fiddling around in the engine bay with a spanner to make the car go faster are numbered . <p> Modern engine computers ( ECU 's ) have taken over many of the controls of all aspects of engine management from timing to fueling and more . <p> This actually means you get better power , a cleaner burn and more reliable engine but it does not mean the end of tuning as this program or map can be easily upgraded in most cars . <p> See our article on remapping the ecu for more information about how the engine management maps work . Chip tuning is a term used very loosely to describe any process of remapping the cars engine . To choose between a remap , replacement chip , new ECU or piggy back join our forum and discuss your options with our friendly members . <p> In this article we shall focus on the specific act of " Chip tuning " and not dwell too much on remaps although both are very similar in nature . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not easily be reflashed and updated . Now with some locked ECU 's chip removal and replacement is once again becoming an option . <p> The only option in these cases was to literally replace the chip . Often these would need to be soldered and could be quite fiddly and , due to the delicate nature of chips , prone to failure . <p> EPROMS which were erasable and programmable chips could be removed reflashed and reinserted into the car . <p> Chip replacements were the only way to change a cars mapping but now with standardised diagnostic ports it is much easier . <p> In recent times we have seen cars equipped with on board diagnostic ports that allow a fresh map to be uploaded . <p> Is chip tuning something you can easily do yourself ? Not really , you need to have detailed knowledge of the engine and ideally a full set of diagnostic equipment on a rolling road to allow you to make " live " adjustments to the mapping . There is certainly a lot more to it than just changing a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIY chip tuning you also run the risk of a bad flash where the computer can not be recovered and without a restoration image you will need to visit the main dealer or worse still buy a new computer . <p> The best form of chip tuning is where a custom map can be inserted that takes into account your cars strengths and weaknesses and any other modifications that you have had done . There are still a few companies out there offering replacement chips set to a more sporty setting . <p> This is not to be confused with piggy back chips or plug in boxes . These are only useful in cases where a reflash or replacement chip is not available and it would still be better to buy a whole aftermarket ECU and use this . <h> Performance Chips <p> It is possible to buy performance chips that you can install in your car yourself or specialist companies offer a replacement service where they supply and fit the performance chip . These are often off the shelf maps designed to suit a wide range of cars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generic mods , they can never compete with a custom map designed specifically for your car and driving style . <p> We are often asked if chip tuning works on all engines . Generally speaking any car will see a benefit but the larger gains are from turbocharged applications . In a NASP ( Naturally Aspirated ) engine power gains are around 10-20% , but in a turbo engine the power gains are typically around 40% for a petrol and 30% for a turbo diesel . <p> Even a car getting a relatively low power gain from a remap will actually be more lively to drive . The peak power gain figure is only a very small part of the equation . The engines response under acceleration and its torque curve are the primary reasons for getting into chip tuning . <p> The downsides of chip tuning are the need for more regular car maintenance and servicing . You are effectively reducing the safe margin of error the makers build in . This compensates for low quality fuel , or the wear and tear associated with longer service intervals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your car is serviced and running in tip top condition . 38243 @qwx238243 38233 @qwx238233 <h> Feedback 38237 @qwx238237 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Thank you for all of your advices mates I 'm really a worm in tuning but want to become at least an average point at it , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> VNT or VGT is a variable geometry turbo or variable nozzle turbo . The turbine blades themselves are fixed but the angle of entry of the exhaust gas is changed to that at low speeds the turbo spins up swiftly , and they geometry of the turbo is altered so that it does n't impact too much upon exhasut flow whilst still providing strong boost pressure . <p> THe most you will get is about 150-160bhp . An intercooler will be essential as the 2.0 HDi 90 does not have one .

Do n't by a VTs or VTr as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no end of problems . <p> A good engine conversion to think about for your 106 would be either the GTi engine as you said , the 1.9 8v GTi engine from a 205 or if you want to be really daring , go for the MI 16 engine from a 405 or 309 . Do n't  think about the T16 engine as that would be far too much power to weight ratio that you would never get grip . <p> As far as the buying a Saxo goes , you would be waisting your money on 2 things , A ) they constantly go wrong and no point in buying one when you can drop the same engine in your 106 as they are exactly the same chassis underneith . Found this out when me and my mate were doing a suspension on both a 106 and a VTS .

You can pick up a GTi engione from ebay for about -300 upwards where as a whole car would be twice if not 3 times that . As far as the other engines i suggested , it depends how far he wants to go .

If you only want something as big as the gti engine then just buy the car as the other guys said above . But like I said , depends how far you wan na go ... <p> Personally If I was gon na do a hot-hatch pug , i 'd buy a gti and then do the MI16 or T16 conversion , leave the outside totally standard apart from wheels and the ride height and then go pouncing on supercars hehe <p> Despite the mixture of emotions you 'll feel from doing an engine conversion the money you 'd save doing the swap yourself you 'll need to definately upgrade the brakes and suspension too , which will eat in on the amount of money you 've saved and then the insurance , if you can get it will be prohibitively high on such a project . <p> I always like the idea of engine conversions though - and if its going to be for off-road use you should do it for the experience !

First off , I fully appologize for this . Secondly , allow me to rephraze my question . What I meant to ask was , what is the highest boost pressure ( psi ) that I can run on a the engine with 9:1 compression AND 91 OCTANE PUMP GAS ! Thank you for letting me know I skipped that . <p> Yes , I know , and that is why I was asking . 91 is the highest readily available pump gas I can get where I live , a few stations have 93 , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just want to be able to use what 's available for convenience . The car , with only a cold air intake and straight pipe header-back exhaust ( with ( high-flow ) converter - mandatory on the street ) , puts out 135hp ( &amp; 133 ft-lb trq ) to the wheels ( untuned ) - this is with the stock rotating assembly . I 'm wanting to get 300hp at the wheels with the fine tuned intercooled turbo setup . Any idea on how much boost I would need ( turbo setup is rated to max out at 450hp ) , and if the amount of boost is possible on 91 octane ? I could setup a water injection system if necessary . Thanks ! <p> Switch to e-85 . You should be able to run 20psi safely on a good tune . I 'd keep it down to 10-15 though on 91 octane. on e-85 , and a good intercooler , you could run 30psi . Or the water injection would be fine too , but if you ever run out of water , watch out ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can have a lower amount of boost ( 10psi will probably get you pretty close to where you want to be . It 'll feel good anyways ... ) and when you 're feeling particularly froggy , you can turn on the scramble boost and , for a short time , you 'll get a bigger ( predetermined ) amount of boost and fuel . That would serve to keep your fuel economy up , not wear on your internals too much , and give you an extra 50-100whp right when you need it . <p> PS : What about your block ? You can have the most amazing internals on the planet , and they mean nothing if you blow a hole in your block . Titanium sleeves ? <p> Sleeves are for high boost . I guess iron sleeves would work too . As long as they 're stronger than aluminum . Is it a cast iron block ? If so , then you prob do n't need sleeves . Saturn tho , I was assuming aluminum . I guess I do n't aim for a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> but if you 're going to have more than 25-30psi , you prob need sleeves . 300whp is more like 350-360bhp If you decide you want more than 300 somewhere down the line , it may be a good idea ... ( on an aluminum block ) <p> Yes , it is a " lost foam " cast aluminum block . I actually have to travel about 100 miles or so to get e-85 ( I live in one of the states that happens to not have it unfortunately ) Could someone give me a decent whp estimate of 10 psi of boost on 91 octane with my setup ( just a guess will do ) ? Also , I use octane booster before every fill-up but I count it out to keep my numbers conservative . I was thinking , after I have the turbo all set up , if I want more power , to add a 50-100 hp shot of nitrous to at least give a faster spool up or enhance the curve . Would a 300whp intercooled turbo car + 100 shot of direct port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand my hp desires , I 'll have a custom block made ( cnc forged billet aluminum , which is stronger than cast iron ) instead of just sleeving it . Thanks for all the help this far tho !

" <p> When it comes to wheels there are a large number of styling options available for the purpose of this article though we 're going to consider coloured rims , one of the latest styling trends to take off . <p> There is a wide selection of different styles of wheel available . <p> After market manufacturers are starting to produce wheels with colour options . <p> One of the most popular designs currently is the black wheel with red highlighting along the inside faces.There is absolutely nothing stopping you from creating this effect yourself . <p> To paint an alloy wheel you will need to remove the tire and , obviously , take the wheel off the car . The wheel will need thoroughly cleaning . <p> Coloured wheels are a fantastic way to give your car some individuality . <p> Whilst TorqueCars do not normally recommend most alloy wheel cleaning solutions , which are little more than a concentrated acid , these do a good job of stripping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> More radically getting the wheels blast cleaned or giving them a good scrubbing with a firm brush will help . If there is a layer of lacquer or polish this must also be removed , otherwise the paint will not adhere properly . <p> It is a good opportunity to repair any corrosion and impact damage that may have occurred to the rim . Minor damage and abrasions can be sanded out fairly easily , but deeper damage is usually best repaired by a specialist . <p> Use a good quality metal primer and build this up in a number of thin layers to aid adhesion of the paint . When the primer has dried , mask off any areas which will have a second colour applied to them then switch the mask to the newly applied colour allowing an underlap when you paint on the highlight colour . <p> Again build up the paint in a number of very thin layers . Please take care to avoid getting paint in the inside area of the wheel where contact with the tire is made . <p> ( Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tire fitter to insure a good fit between the tire and the rim . Whereas other people insist that there should be no paint on this inner side of the wheel . You can join the debate in our chat forum and compare notes with others who have painted their alloy wheels . ) <p> The photographs show a number of different colour schemes applied to alloy wheels . Chrome and black looks nice and can be achieved by partially painting a chrome wheel . <p> Wheels can also be colour coded to match or contrast the car , TorqueCars have seen some nice white cars with black wheels at the shows . Powder coated alloy wheels may also be painted but it is preferable to strip the wheel back to bare metal . Many people will hesitate to paint their wheels , because they fear getting damage from the kerb . <p> In reality , damage is more easily repaired requiring little more than a touch up pen . The layer of paint will also be easier to keep clean as the smooth finish will repel brake dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels which can become corroded . <p> You can , as the photographs show , just paint the rim , the internal spokes or inner faces of the wheel .

@@24423619 @4423619/ <h> Heel and Toe downshift gear changes . <p> " The heel bones connected to the toe bone ... " <p> The heel and toe gear change technique is critical on the racetrack but also very useful in every day driving . When you are on the track it is important to keep the car in its power band and if you drive a turbo you want to avoid lag at all costs so need to keep the turbo spinning . <p> Fast driving is all about keeping the balance of the car and this is so important when braking . As you brake you throw the cars weight to the front . Under heavy braking the front wheels lock up and you skid . <p> Even when changing down a gear you risk throwing more of the cars weight to the front and if you do this whilst heavily braking it can be enough to cause you to lose control . <p> As the car slows you need to change down a gear to maintain the power band of the car . You have few options , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you into a skid , release the brake and blip the throttle to match the engine speed with the new gear speed ( this means braking early to get enough time to do this properly ) or somehow whilst still braking blip the throttle and match the revs . <p> This is where the heel and toe gear change come in , the technique involves braking with the ball of the foot ( the toe area ) and blipping the throttle with the heel to rev match for a smooth down change . <p> This technique is hard to master . The obvious difficulty lies in having enough control over the brake and being able to adjust the throttle simultaneously . The first few times you do this it will be far from smooth but you need to be patient and bear with it - it does make a big difference when driving and will help you to feel more at one with the car . <p> The heel and toe technique involves braking with the ball of the foot ( the toe area ) and blipping the throttle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fairly thin soled shoe to give you the subtle control and feel you need . <p> Practise at first in a stationary car . With the engine running put your toe on the brake and use your heel to control the throttle . Bring the revs up to 1500 rpm and hold it there for a count of 5 then let the revs drop and bring the revs up to 2500 rpm . The aim is to do this as accurately and as smoothly as possible . When you have mastered a good level of throttle control on the heel practise braking with your toes the big toe and ball of your foot to be more precise . This will seem relatively easy after the last exercise . <p> The next stage involves learning what engine speed goes with what gear . As you drive around change down a gear and note the amount of revs the gear requires for a given speed . So bring the car up to 30 in 4th gear and change down . The revs will increase from say 2000 rpm to 2600 rpm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have set before you release the clutch . You will notice the car lurches until the correct engine speed is reached and you are aiming to eliminate that lurch by correctly matching the engine speed . Rather than being a memory exercise you will learn to do this instinctively . When you have become proficient at this move on to the next step . <p> Practise accelerating using your heel only . As you accelerate let your toes raise and tip to enable you to develop independent control over the heel and your toes . <p> The next step is to combine all these methods and start performing heel and toe downshifts . To practise keep your speed down and make sure the road is empty . <p> At first only apply the heel and toe technique when braking and bringing the car to a stop . But instead of dipping the clutch as you slow up , try changing down a gear or 2 . Go from 4th gear to 3rd or 2nd gear but use the heel and toe braking and throttle control method . The aim is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you increase the engine speed to match the road speed for the selected gear . When you are happy with this method apply it when slowing up for bends that require a down shift . <p> Be very careful as the last thing you want to do is skid out of control due to excessively heavy pedal control . Double clutching is not the same thing as heel and toe . TorqueCars have covered this subject in the double declutching article . <p> Some cars pedals are more suited to this method than others . If you find that the pedal positions are wrong you could try an aftermarket pedal cover set . These often come in a sporty looking drilled metal effect and usually make the throttle pedal a little longer . <p> This entry was @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

I 'm all for people saving money but there are times when you need to use specialists , this is one of them . <p> It depends who is doing the work .

The best base for tuning are the 2.0 Turbo engines which respond favourable to a remap . <h> Ford Focus Tuning modifications . <p> Bear in mind the mantra that you want to keep as much low end power as you can and aim for a wide power band rather than a narrow top end power spike . We see a lot of people tuning their Focus and moving all the power to the upper rev band . This is great for the track but next to useless on a daily driver . <p> One of the most significant with the best cost to power gain , engine mods you can do is to fit a fast road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ruin the cars idle and driving characteristics around town . When pushing up the power you will need to pay attention to the fueling . More power needs more fuel - it really is as simple as that and for larger power hikes you often risk running lean . <p> Look to aftermarket parts suppliers for uprated injectors and fuel pumps and in some cases you 'll find that your manufacturer offers uprated options as fitted to performance models . <h> Intake and exhaust modifications . <p> Breathing mods are usually easily sorted and probably one of the easiest mods to do . You need to derestrict the airflow into the engine as much as possible and the bottleneck on most engines is the air filter so fitting a cotton panel air filter will address this . The standard Focus airbox is actually not very restrictive so there is little to be gained by fitting an induction kit ( unless you want the noise ) See our induction kit article for more details on this . <p> Exhaust selection should take into account the flow rate , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restriction , too big and the flow rate will diminish the point the engine scavenging suffers.See our article on performance exhausts for details of the issue around large bore exhausts and how to choose the right size for your engine . <p> Head work including a polish and port and 3 or 5 angle valve job will really help to release the potential of the engine . Your clutch can sap a lot of your power if it starts to slip and the standard clutches are only ever good for power gains of up to 35 or 40% . Fit a performance clutch to avoid power losses through the transmission . <p> NASP engines do not achieve big power gains if you remap them , unless you have done extensive modifications . With turbocharged engines this is another story . A remapped turbo will give phenomenal power gains and take full advantage of the strength of the block . Despite the large cost involved adding forced induction to a NASP engine will give large power gains .

@@24423627 @4423627/ <h> Tuning and mods for the Citroen Saxo <p> Being a popular car it has many parts and performance options so we 'll outline the best ways to improve your car . <p> The Citroen Saxo was introduced back in 1996 and was very closely related to the Peugeot 106 sharing many common parts and components . <p> Many high performance parts can be sourced from the Peugeot 106 parts bin so with a bit of research you should be able to save money and have a wider choice of Saxo mods . <p> The VTS enjoys a more powerful 16 valve engine ( the VTR has only 8 ) which produces 120 brake horsepower . <p> It propels the car to 60 in around 7.6 seconds and makes the Saxo a very capable track car or fun road car . <p> TorqueCars have seen the Saxo outperform much more powerful cars on very short twisty tracks where the nimble handling and quick steering reactions come into play . <p> The car is very agile and the best models for suitable tuning projects would include the 1.6 VTR and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with young drivers as it is cheap to run and insure and there is certainly no shortage of tuning parts available for it . The first modifications you want to do to a Citroen Saxo is outbreak the brakes and you will find that the disc brakes from a Peugeot 306 will fit nicely . <p> The Saxo is a very nimble car which can outperform more powereful cars on short twisty tracks ! <p> Engine swaps are also very straight forward with the Saxo and you can , with relative ease insert the 1.6 engine into a car fitted with the 1 litre engine and enjoy almost three times as much power . With so many suitable engines available from breakers yards this becomes a very low cost performance modification . <p> You will also need to upgrade the security on the car ( only the VTS model comes with reasonable security equipment ) , TorqueCars would suggest a deadlock and immobiliser . There are a few tuning companies which can provide turbo conversions offering astronomical power gains ! These can be quite costly and require a fair bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and small proportions , any amount of tuning has a noticeable impact on the car 's performance . For the ultimate track day car remove the back seats fit a roll cage , and get some lightweight alloy wheels . As far as the engine goes you should get the head properly gas flowed and ported , fit an induction kit and sports exhaust and apply a fast road cam . A fuel pressure boost felt will also increase the response in acceleration from rest . <p> Please browse our tuning tips pages and join the forum to discuss the best tuning methods and modifications for your Saxo with our other dedicated Saxo tuners . <p> This @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Turbo engines are just begging to be custom remapped.You will see big power gains on most turbo engined cars including diesels making a remap one of the most cost effective modifications . <p> The largest power gains for NASP engines usually involve the addition of forced induction . It is easier to bolt on a supercharger than it is to get a turbo working . It is harder to map a turbo as the boost comes on exponentially with engine speed .

Stage 3 motorsport mods just wo n't work well on the road and will make the car undriveable . <p> You really need to keep as much low end power as possible and aim to get a wide power band across the rev range rather than a narrow top end power hike . In this article we shall give a brief overview to the best upgrades for your car , but we 'd encourage you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each type of performance modification . <p> The intake and exhaust flow play a large part in your cars power band , but be careful here , getting this wrong can upset the idle and make the car hard to drive in traffic . You 'd need to follow a cam upgrade with other mods and finish with a remap for the best performance gains.When pushing up the power you will need to pay attention to the fueling . More power needs more fuel . If you find you have flat spots and power surges after your mods you should check the fueling and try a higher octane fuel as well . Uprated injectors will enable you to supply sufficient fuel to the engine . Uprate the fuel pump to cope with the extra fuel requirements of your tuned Ritzsuprated injectors. 38228 @qwx238228 <p> Now we move on to the intake and exhaust and ensure proper flow through the engine . Contrary to popular belief there is usually very little power gain to be had by fitting an induction kit , they only work well and are recommended after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard air intake box can not cope ! Induction kits can work well on turbo engines and larger engines ( if supplied with a suitable cold air feed or air box ) , generally though we 'd just recommend for Ritz engines you should go with a high performance panel air filter prefereble made from cotton . <p> Do not go with the widest exhaust you can find this will slow the exhaust rate - the best exhausts for power gains are usually between 1.5 to 2.5 inches . It is the shape and material more than the bore size . <p> Getting the polished and ported will further help more air into each cylinder . This is definitely a job for a professional with a flow bench . Your clutch can seriously let you down as you increase the power if it starts to fail and the standard clutches are only ever good for power gains of upto 50% . Fit a performance clutch to avoid power losses through the transmission . NASP engines do not achieve big power gains if you remap them , unless you have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A remapped turbo will give significant power gains and fully release the potential power of the engine . Despite the large cost involved adding forced induction to a NASP engine will give large power gains . Turbos are generally harder to add than a supercharger . With a turbo the power curve is related exponentially to the engine speed making it difficult to map fueling with . It is simpler to map a supercharger because the boost is correlating to engine speed on a linear curve . Decreasing the engines compression ratio will allow you to add forced induction , water injection may also help prevent detonation. 38226 @qwx238226 <p> Alloy wheels will help the brakes cool down and are generally less heavy than the steel ones . The downside to large alloy wheels on your Ritz is that you alter your effective final drive ratio and this will have a detrimental effect on acceleration and performance . For this reason we would advise sticking to a maximum wheel size of 16 inches , although we know some of our members have gone larger than this with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Happy to learn <p> I would assume any mods will be declared to your insurance ( otherwise you 'll be driving illegally and if the worst comes to worst you will be prosecuted ) meaning that anything you do declare will no doubt sky rocket your insurance premium .

The turbo engine gives a lot of scope for tuning with the addition of a larger turbo , a hybrid turbo ( uprated internals in a standard case ) or a twin turbo setup . A remap will help release more power in all cases . <p> Because the engine is so light it makes the car feel a lot faster than it should be , this also means you get a massive and noticeable hike in power from most modifications . <p> Rotary engines are specialist items but there is plenty of experts out there with a wide range of RX7 tuning options . <p> Weak spots include gearbox issues caused by loose mountings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue usually manifests itself as an issue in 2nd-3rd gear changes and will get worse if ignored . <p> Oil leaks have also been reported but a number of specialist RX7 tuners offer stronger sumps with a better o ring seal . <p> The car is relatively light but this should n't stop you taking it further with a carbon fibre bonnet and even carbon fibre wings and panels . <p> The key to power gains on the rotary engines is air flow through the engine , a low resistance high flowing air filter and porting within the engine are well documented power adders . A better flowing exhaust will further help to improve peak power . The turbo chargers on the RX7 can be uprated to larger flowing units and because of the high RPM characteristics to the engine they are well suited to a twin turbo setup to avoid lag . <p> Get an uprated intercooler to save the power lost by heat gains . If you are serious about power gains then lose the air conditioning and fit a larger intercooler mounted at an angle in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vent if possible . <p> A set of coilovers will stiffen the handling and if this is matched to a rear strut brace you can have a very sharply cornering RX7 . Reinforcing the front and rear suspension turrets are beneficial and give noticeably improved handling on older cars . <p> Talking with some of our members who own RX7s we find that the rear wing is actually quite important and that without it the back is pretty light at high speed . Relocating the intercooler and putting a vent in the front bonnet will also help minimise heat soak and push up the power figures . <p> When buying an RX7 you should ensure that it has been well looked after and properly serviced . These are specialist engines so need the attention of a specialist . Reports of unreliability and requirements to rebuild are largely unfounded provided the car is properly serviced and looked after . This is also an engine that requires you to read the manual , particularly with respect to starting and stalling the engine . As the engine is very high revving to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will generally stall it . If you get it badly wrong you risk flooding the engine and it requires dealer attention . <p> We should n't really give attention to making the RX7 go faster without looking at the brakes . There is a nice range of large brakes available such as the KAD 356mm discs mated to 6 pot calipers . Even the standard brakes can be greatly improved with a high friction performance pad , and there are plenty of vented and upgrades available for the standard size discs . <p> Why not join us in our Mazda forum and meet our other resident RX7 owners and swap tuning tips and advice with them . <p> This @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

It 's generally cheap to insure and popular with young drivers and as a result of this there are lots of performance parts around for them . <p> You must choose your mods wisely though , we frequently hear of 107 owners who have lost all low down power , experience misfires or flat spots and have starting problems after they have added the wrong mods . <p> We 'll look at the best mods for your 107 and blow a few of the commonly held myths out of the water allowing you to focus on the mods that will really make a difference to your performance . <p> Many 107 owners uprate the handling of their cars as a priority , this will certainly increase your enjoyment of the car . Drop the car by as much as 40mm and fit stiffer dampers , bigger drops will need other modifications in most instances . <p> Our aim in 107 engine tuning should be to increase peak power and Torque at the top end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a practical scorching car that will out perform bigger cars , especially on a tight track . <p> Sadly with smaller engine sizes you are wasting your time spending money on modifications , so if this applies to you get yourself an engine swap then apply the following mods . <p> This list of the stages and mods that are usually performed by our members , decide how far you wish to go in your tuning project before you begin . <h> 107 Engine Tuning . <p> Getting the right mods for your planned usage of the car is a time and money saver . Stage 3 ( competition ) mods just wo n't work well on the road making the car difficult to drive . <p> Your goal when tuning the engine should be a wide torque curve . You do n't want all the torque to be at the top end unless you are creating a motorsport car . In this article we shall give your a good starting base to the best mods for your car , but we 'd encourage you to spend some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of performance mod . <p> The intake and exhaust durations play a large part in your cars power band , but be careful here , getting this wrong can upset the idle and make the car hard to drive in traffic . You 'd need to follow a camshaft upgrade with other mods and finish with a performance chip to fully realise your gains.Do n't forget to uprate the fueling when you are increasing the power - it makes the car more thirsty . <p> Using higher octane petrol is another option if you find you are suffering from pinking or premature ignition on your Peugeot project after fitting other modifications . Uprated injectors will enable you to supply sufficient fuel to the engine . A fuel pump will only deliver a finite amount of fuel , so you may need to uprate this if your injectors are demanding more fuel . 38228 @qwx238228 <p> Now we move on to the intake and exhaust and ensure proper flow through the engine . Contrary to popular belief there is usually very little power gain to be had by fitting an induction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you increase the engines power to the point where the standard air intake box can not cope ! Induction kits can work well on turbo engines and larger engines ( if supplied with a suitable cold air feed or air box ) , generally though we 'd just recommend for 107 engines you should go with a performance panel air filter prefereble made from cotton . <p> Do not go with the biggest exhaust you can get this will slow up the exhaust flow rate - the best for power gains are usually between 1.5 to 2.0 inches . It is the shape and material more than the bore size . <p> Getting the polished and ported will further help more air into each cylinder . This is definitely a job for a professional with a flow bench . A good triple plate fast road performance clutch will help to keep that power going where it should . Never skimp or expect your standard OEM clutch to cope . NASP engines do not achieve big power gains if you remap them , unless you have done extensive modifications . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbo will give significant power gains and fully release the potential power of the engine . Despite the large cost involved adding forced induction to a NASP engine will give large power gains . Turbos are generally harder to add than a supercharger . Turbos give boost in exponential proportion to increasing engine speed and this can make mapping difficult . The nice steady boost to rpm characteristics of the supercharger make them easier to map . To cope with forced induction you will usually need to decrease the compression ratio of the engine . 38226 @qwx238226 38239 @qwx238239 38231 @qwx238231 38235 @qwx238235 <p> This @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Low profile tyres also increase grip , but the ride is harder and the tyres are more expensive . <p> Some alloys are designed to be light weight ( they can snap more easily though ) and have a pattern that increases the airflow to the brake discs aiding your breaking efficiency .

@@24423660 @4423660/ <h> The main areas for engine balancing . <p> We all know what happens when a wheel is fitted to a car without being balanced . <p> At low speeds you do not notice it but at higher speeds noticeable vibrations start to appear . <p> Inside an engine the rotational speeds typically reach 6-7000 rpm and , the higher the speed , the more critical it is to ensure that vibrations do not occur . <p> As you can see from this cross section of a piston there are a number of parts which move in each stroke of the engine , in varying directions and speeds , and if these are imbalanced you will end up with vibrations and internal stress . <h> The benefits of engine balancing <p> A balanced engine will generally be more efficient and reliable and will certainly tolerate much higher engine speeds . <p> We must remember that no engine can be perfectly balanced due the amount of subtle factors involved but we can certainly improve upon the balance of a mass produced engine . Torquecars members will typically want to maximise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already modified many other aspects of the engine but we should not overlook the benefits of balancing the engine first , as this enables us to sustain higher engine speeds and gives us reliability . <p> No engine can be perfectly balanced but you can certainly improve a mass produced engine . <p> When balancing an engine there are 2 main areas to focus on , firstly the components inside the engine , their weight and how accurately machined they are and secondly the forces created within an engine under combustion . <p> When each cylinder reaches combustion ideally the amount of energy released should match that of the other cylinders . Firstly though we will look at the physical engine components from a balancing perspective . <h> Blueprinting an engine <p> Balancing the physical engine components is often referred to as " Blueprinting " , as the components are carefully matched and machined as a set with each engine being unique . <p> Just as a tyre installer has a special machine to balance your wheels a machine shop have a dedicated engine balancing machine onto which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of where adjustments need to be made . <p> The main components in an engine to be considered for balance are the flywheel , bearings , pistons &amp; rings , the piston rods , pins and the crank . Weight is removed from the heavier side of a component to achieve balance but sometimes weight has to be added to the lighter side . <p> The pistons and rods are machined as a matching pair ( with drilling away excess metal &amp; again occasionally adding metal around the pin boss and the inside of the crown ) and the weight and dimensions of each is also closely matched you will be well on the way to having a nicely balanced engine . <p> The counterbalance in the crank usually has metal cut away and sometimes weld added to add metal to adjust the weight and in extreme cases , a tungsten alloy is added , which is substantially heavier than most other metals although this is an extreme solution . <p> It is worth remembering that weight incrementally increases imbalance so using lighter components can assist with the aim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often lighter components are weaker . <p> The crank , located at the bottom of the engine has quite a hard job as it converts the vertical motion of the pistons into rotational forces . Crankshafts are generally forged from steel although they can also be cast from iron but the forged steel ones are lighter and are more compact . <p> A machined crank from a billet of steel will be stronger as the metal has not been subjected to heating and cooling cycles of casting or the additional heavy pounding of forging . In some performance applications the crank shaft is balance lightened to reduce its rotational mass and then fitted with counterweights made from a tungsten alloy ( or similar ) to help balance the rotation of the shaft . <p> Crank shafts will suffer from sideways motion as they convert the vertical piston action into rotation and the bearings combat this , so getting good quality well machined bearings is also an essential in creating a balanced engine with high performance engines potentially carrying a larger number of bearings . <p> The crank also endures a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine configurations attempt to address the problem of the forces on the crank in different ways , ranging from the v6 and v8 to flat 4s and boxers but no engine is perfect and they all suffer from an amount of vibration the best we can hope for is to maintain the engine balance throughout our usable rev range . <h> Balancing the engine dynamics <p> The next area of balance involves the dynamics of the engine itself . If the compression ratio is out between cylinders you will have an imbalance and vibration happening as the engine turns over . <p> The compression ratio can be affected by a large number of factors , cylinder wall damage , gasket imperfections , poor valve seating and even a badly machined spark plug . <p> It is a good practice to take compression readings from each cylinder at regular intervals and check that everything is within an acceptable tolerance . <p> Check the camshaft also as uneven wear will cause the valves to open at different intervals and amounts and this can upset the delicate balance between cylinders . <p> Assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fueling to each cylinder . Again the injectors should be matched and need to deliver the same amount of fuel to each cylinder and the fuel to air ratio also needs to matched . <p> A gas flowed head ( see the TorqueCars article on port matching also ) will help to ensure equal air delivery to each cylinder although getting the compression ratio matched is more important . When an engine is balanced you will hear a purr as it ticks over . <p> Get used to the sound of the engine exhaust note on tick over and if you lose the regular throbbing purr it will generally indicate that something has moved out of balance in the engine . <p> Join us in our forum where you will meet a whole community of enthusiastic and knowledgeable tuners ranging from pro drag racers and track day enthusiasts to the retired hobby car tuner .

And the general rule about bhp is about 100 bhp per litre so in theory you could easily get 300bhp out of the 3.0 V6 . Slap a couple of Turbo 's in there as well and it 'll be rapid . <p> If you could set up a ' cross-pollination ' twin turbo configuration then you 'd have one heck of a car .

Here are some recommendations for the GT engine . As far as bang-per-buck goes so to speak a full " Seb2 " setup as it 's called is the way to go .

Again , this was achieved on standard internals . <h> Engine swaps options for the Punto <p> There are plenty of engine swaps out there on the Punto . GT conversions ( from smaller engined models 60s etc etc ) are probably the most common as running donor GT 's with poor bodywork can be picked up for peanuts . <p> The 16VT from the Fiat Coupe will fit into a Mk1 and Mk2 with custom mounts and some slight loom splicing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Exhaust needs to be adapted also . Further details can be provided in our forum if needed .

Turbo-charged 1.6 16V bravo engine is underway for example , and the Sporting ( 90 ) 1600 bottom end can be used with an otherwise GT engine and some custom work to create a 1.6 GT . <p> As with all engine swaps uprated brakes and suspension are recommended and pretty much essential .

I have 2005 Chevy Cobalt 2.2 L nothing special but I would like ideas to make it special . Specifically I would like to add turbo if I could but any ideas would be greatly appreciated , thanks <p> Please note that I do n't think it is worth adding a turbo to an old car with a small capacity engine . There is nothing stopping you but the money and hassle will just not be worth the power gain you get . It is better to just buy a better car for your tuning project . <p> Adding a turbo is a major engineering task and without a kit with full instructions and all the parts you need there is a big risk of blowing up the engine . Expect to spend 50 hours upwards on a project of this type . This is not the sort of modification you should undertake unless you are mechanically competent and know what you are doing . <p> It is worth looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a turbo is . <p> The 2.2L was never supercharged from the factory . But the set up from the 2.0L bolts right on , due to the cars having the exact same engine block . <p> As for the Cobalt performance . I would not even consider modifying the car if it 's an automatic unless you wan na be blowing through transmissions often . If it 's a 5 speed manual though , keep reading . Start with a cat back exhaust , header , and downpipe with high flow cat ( ZZPerformance sells all these ) . Then do a short throw shift kit ( TWM Performance sells these . I have one on my car and love it ) . I do NOT recommend a " cold air intake " on these cars because it 's been dyno proven the intake is not restrictive at all . All restriction on these cars is in the exhaust and in the head itself . Having your head ported will do wonders on these engines . If you 're doing head-work though , also have a 3 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferrea offers these . GM Performance Parts offers a dual valve spring kit if you can find them , but I personally think that 's overkill ) and stainless oversized valves ( Ferrea again ) &gt; If you do n't want to pay to have your head ported ( and to have your car inoperable during this time ) , GM Performance parts offers a bolt on head that 's already been ported and polished ( note this head ONLY works on cars built BEFORE the 2007 model year . In 2007 , a cam sensor was added along with a new ignition system and computer ) . Here 's that part number for the GM PnP 'd head : 88958619 After that , valve retainers are a good idea ( Ferrea again ) . After that , you can upgrade the camshafts . Comp Cams offers a variety of different camshaft grinds including 3 stages of naturally aspirated grinds , a turbo grind camshaft , and a supercharger grind camshaft . <p> As for forced induction , it 's been done to death on these cars and the limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with is supercharging as opposed to turbocharging . Turbocharging is more complicated , finicky and more expensive to install . Supercharging on this car meanwhile is ridiculously cheap as the parts to do so can be grabbed off a junked Cobalt SS Supercharged or Saturn Ion Redline , or you can order the parts new from the dealer . It 's a bolt on affair but do n't expect the computer to compensate for it . As you have a 2005 2.2L You have 2 options when it comes to the computer . You can either scrap the factory one and go with an aftermarket standalone , or you can do mail order tunes from Trifecta Performance . If you TRULY have your heart set on turbocharging there are kits , the most trustworthy of which come from Hahn Racecraft , who built the kits GM uses in their 1,500 HP Ecotec FWD drag cars , and ZZPerformance who have a reputation for quality products for a reason . The downside to ecotec turbocharging is that it is much more expensive due to the fact that you ca n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turbocharged ecotec Cobalt ( 2008-2010 Cobalt SS ) , but the car used direct injection and it has never been confirmed if any parts bolt on beyond the cat back exhaust . Now when considering forced induction on these cars , it is good to remember a few things . The engine internals on the stock 2.2L that you and I both have is rated for up to 250 HP . Anything above that and expect to switch to forged internals ( available from numerous places like diamond , wiseco and JE ) or blow up your engine in the process . Optimal compression ratios depend on which type of forced induction you want . If going supercharged , the optimal compression ratio is 10:1 or 9.5:1 ( it 's often debated ) . The 2.2L comes from the factory with a 10:1 compression ratio so you would n't have to do anything until you hit that 250 HP mark . If you 're going turbocharged , it 's generally agreed that the optimal CR is around 8.7:1 which will require changing out for forged internals anyways ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to note is that after installing forced induction , you WILL need to run premium fuel to help try and keep knocking and premature detonation at bay . Both are potentially dangerous and a large reason many people blow their cars up after installing forced induction is they do n't change fuels . Forged internals does NOT include changing the crankshaft , which itself it rated for 500 HP , which I highly doubt you 'll be hitting any time soon . If you are interested though , both GM Performance and Eagle offer forged crankshafts rated for over 1000 HP for the 2.2L . <p> As for the rest of the car . The clutch in the manual transmission is rated for 175 ft-lbs of torque . The transmission itself can withstand MUCH more abuse . Swap to an aftermarket clutch like I did to help prepare before installing forced induction .

I heavily recommend their XXX Hardcore rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my rear axle swap ( do n't worry about that .

You do n't want all the torque to be at the top end unless you are creating a competition car . <p> The point of this article is to give a limited introduction of car tuning mods and point you in the right direction , our forum is where you can ask for more detailed advice and tips on your project and all aspects of modding cars.It maximises the intake and exhaust durations and increases the power if done right . Ideally you 'd add other mods and finish up with a reflashed ECU . <p> We 'd also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cam as this upsets the engines idling and general town driving characteristics.You will need to ensure that the engine is not starved of fuel so will need to uprate the fueling . If you find you experience flat spots and power surges after your modifications you should check the fueling and try a higher octane fuel as well . Uprating the injectors is another beneficial modification and will deliver sufficient fuel . Uprate the fuel pump to cope with the extra fuel requirements of your tuned Sparks uprated injectors. 38228 @qwx238228 <p> Now we move on to the intake and exhaust and ensure proper flow through the engine . Induction kits only help to add power if your air intake is restricted ! <p> Adding an induction kit to most standard engines will see NO POWER GAIN AT ALL . If you have heavily modified your engine and it 's need for air INCREASES DRAMATICALLY then an induction kit is the answer and will help remove this restriction . <p> Derestricting the airflow into the engine is a primary goal of tuning so get a better flowing air filter if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find the car is running lean . Induction kits can sound great but due to the warm air in the engine bay they will not add noticeable power and actually rob you of power . <p> Sports exhausts can usually air flow out of the engine but do not go too large or you may end up will reduce the flow rate . Stick to 1.5 to 2.0 inches for best results . <p> Head work including a head port and polished and 3 or 5 angle valve job will really help to release the potential of the engine . When you start tuning your Spark you will often find that the standard clutch starts to complain so get an uprated clutch . Turbo engines are just begging to be Remapped . You will see large power gains on most modern turbo charged cars including diesels making a remap one of the most cost effective and large modifications for your money.Adding forced induction will see big power gains but this is usually too expensive to be cost effective . It is usually cheaper to bolt on a supercharger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost in exponential proportion to increasing engine speed and this can make mapping difficult . The nice steady boost to rpm characteristics of the supercharger make them easier to map . Decreasing the engines compression ratio will allow you to add forced induction , water injection may also help prevent detonation. 38226 @qwx238226 <p> Alloy wheels will help the brakes cool down and are usually lighter than the steel ones . It is worth noting that although they can look cool on the Spark Big alloy wheels will actually decrease your performance . The larger you go the lower your acceleration will be - this is due to the change in your effective final drive ratio .

Use the recommended oil for you car - older cars sometimes prefer a slightly thicker oil to avoid leaks and burning in the cylinder but consult your workshop manual for your car . <p> Choosing oil that is too thin can cause permanent leaks in the seals once it has wicked through . Running low on oil will typically wear the top of the engine and this wear is typified by a rattle in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pistons will also wear more quickly and you will start to burn oil ( well , your car will ) producing a blue exhaust discharge . <p> Do not use a different grade to the recommend one unless the engine is very worn ( in which case go thicker ) or if the engine has been rebuilt ( a thinner oil may be needed but the engine builder will recommend the correct grade . ) <p> Never put a semi or mineral oil in a car that requires fully synthetic unless this is an absolute emergency and get the oil drained and corrected as soon as possible afterwards . Try also to avoid mixing viscosity grades of oil and certainly never mix oil types . <p> NB : The oil light comes on to tell you your oil levels or oil pressure is dangerously low and NOT when it needs topping up check your dip stick every 2 weeks or after a long journey - oil is CONSUMED by engines ( but different cars have different consumption 16 valves seem to use more than their 8 valve counterparts ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people recommend a thinner oil in the winter and a thicker one in the summer - your manual should have the recommended oil specs to air temperature chart . Sadly so many people just buy the cheapest oil they can get and use the Grade for the cars life summer and winter . <h> Which oil type - synthetic , semi synthetic or mineral ? <p> A raging argument ensues about synthetic oil lasting for 36,000 miles or more . There is certainly some big advantages to synthetic oils but I would still recommend a regular filter change - the filter gets the tiny particles of metal from inside the engine that acts like a sandblaster inside your engine so even if the oil does last it will pick up lots of gunk from the engine . <p> While your changing the filter you may just as well change the oil anyway ! Choose a good quality filter that collects the damaging small particles of metal . There are magnets available that wrap around the filter to collect more fine metal particles and these have be proven to be effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the oil : We do not recommend the use of additives that " bond " to the metal surface . A few studies have shown these to work well in lab conditions but in the real world people have experienced blocked oil filters , oil starvation and other issues . <p> PolyTetraFlouroEthelyne - PTFE bonds to the surface of the metal parts to theoretically create a low friction surface . Other additives work in this way also and usually need the engine to be warmed up for the bonding to take place - most engine oils set out to do the same thing so the question of these additives has been raised . <p> When you strip down an engine treated in this way the cylinders will generally have a hard black - almost mirrored finish - perfectly smooth . <p> Some additives can help with noisy valves and cold start issues but please do your research carefully . <p> Other substances condition the oil and make it ' sticky ' ( it works well and I do n't know how ! ) . The oil seems to cling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still lubricates and flows around and can even prevent minor oil leaks and reduce blow back and burning oil ( Moreys Oil Stabiliser is the products name but I 'm sure there 's others around ) The downside is that this additive is flushed out with the oil and needs to be reintroduced . <p> When starting a cold engine TorqueCars recommend that you let it tick over for a few moments ( do n't run it for minutes though ) to circulate the oil - most engine wear occurs within the first minutes of switching it on although there is little if anything that can be done about this - as the oil warms an thins it gives better protection ( most cold start engine wear occurs due to acids created in the combustion process rather than friction ) . Only drive at 1/2 to 1/4 of your redline until the engine warms up unless you want to wreck the engine . <p> Some pistons , normally high performance ones are tapered which stops slap on the skirt which can be catastrophic to a piston . An engine specialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapered end ) and explained that it indicated that the car had been driven very hard before it had warmed up - obviously pistons change shape slightly ( expanding ) as they warm up and this design prevents piston slap . <p> The piston contains less metal than the bore surrounding it , which may even be made from a different material with a different modulus of expansivity , thus the piston is likely to expand at a higher rate than the bores . Until the whole engine is warm and the bore and piston have expanded equally engine revs should be kept relatively low . <p> Important note to turbo car owners : Turbo 's spin at phenomenal speeds and are more prone to wear if the wrong oil is selected . They also run at high temperatures and this can show up weaknesses in the oils formulation . Also if you have a turbo you must wait for the turbo 's turbine to slow down before switching off the engine . <p> The supply of fresh oil stops when the engine stops and the turbo 's spinning will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details or buy a turbo timer which keeps the engine running for you automatically shutting it off when it 's safe to do so . ) Most turbo manufacturers recommend the use of a fully synthetic oil . <h> How much oil should you put in ? <p> Obvious Tip : keep the oil level below the max and above the min line ! ! - too much oil and it will get into places it should n't and could start seals leaking or cause other damage the engine ie : - burning oil/broken seals/piston rings . <p> Too little oil will cause premature wear . Always change the filter with the oil . Of the 7 oil changes I had done at garages only 2 had the correct level of oil - ( 3 would have caused serious damage to the engine if I had n't spotted it ( when I drained it out there was a whole litre too much oil ! ) after a service check the dipstick and complain if the oil is under the min or over the max mark ! <p> I heard recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been overfilled . When the correct level was restored the car thankfully did n't burn oil and no damage was done . The dipstick ( on this car ) should have been checked with the engine running as oil seeps into the pistons when stationary ! <p> Do n't assume you know how to check the oil . Consult the manual . If the manual says 4.5l then put 4.5l in and check the level in the way specified in the manual , allowing sufficient time for the oil to reach the sump , then top up if necessary - generally oil is checked with the engine warm but having stood for a couple of minutes to allow the oil to settle . Although I have slagged off garages the average motorist is equally negligent with 1 in 4 having below the minimum oil level in the engine . <p> Please also note that only car engine oils should be used , not motorcycle oils , which are designed for a totally different purpose ( they have to lubricate the gear box and also most bike clutches run in oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To discuss engine oils in general or more specific engine oil selections for your car please register and join our friendly forum and our friendly community will answer your questions . 38242 @qwx238242 38233 @qwx238233 <h> Feedback 38237 @qwx238237 <p> The way I was taught when being schooled on the matter was that the Hotter the engine is allowed to Burn or Run before over heating the more efficient .

For the best Cold Start you can ever get do n't  ever forget about a pressurized oil reservoir this ensures that before the engine is started that all critical areas of the engine are at the recommended oil pressure before firing the engine .

@@24423682 @4423682/ <p> Is it a single or twin cam ? If its single that 's probably why the engine revs slower . In this case although it can undoubtably be remapped for more power it probably ca n't be remapped for more revs If its a twin cam then higher revs should be possible but you may need to change quite a bit first . <p> Label on the bulkhead says its a K24A3 . The engine cover says i-VTEC 2.4 DOHC . I undertand that the Civic has the K20 ( 2 litre ) , which I presume is also VTEC DOHC <p> My questions are : ( i ) why does the K24 in the Accord rev less than the K20 in the Civic Type R ? ( ii ) I 've seen info where the K20 in the Civic is more BHP as standard than the K24 in the Accord as standard , but not sure . ( iii ) What changes will I need to let it rev higher , surely there is a setting in the VTEC engine map that can be changed ? ( iv ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to get more power ( assuming no drop in torque - its a VTEC ) than by other changes in the engine map without increasing revs ( v ) finally I 've been googling and can not find any re-mapping companies that specialise in petrol non-turbo Honda engines , anyone know of any ? <p> So if there is no loss of torque , then if the revs can increase then the result is more power . <p> This may not mean higher speed since there is no increase in torque , but it will mean increase in acceleration in the lower gears , because the engine has a longer reach in the lower gears i.e. if no decrease in torque then it will be possible to reach a higher speed in lower gears , and the engine will momentarily produce higher powers in those gears . <p> So I was simply hoping that there was an easy way to increase revs from 7k to 8k without reducing torque , which would mean true speeds as follows : 1st = 38 2nd = 65 3rd = 97 4th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Which would obviously mean much better straightline acceleration , which is all I want ( I do n't want a higher top speed and I do n't want to go round corners more quickly ) . <p> The Type R engines are balanced and therefore capable of holding higher power . <p> Rather than increase the RPM range i 'd suggest mods that improve peak power from about 3000rpm . A 2 to 1 exhaust header , sport cat , and modified intake manifold and ported head would be my recommendations . <p> Hi Wayne , I have never modified an engine before , but I do fully understand how engines work . My background is control systems and a long time ago I worked on intstumentation systems for engine test beds , including hydro and electric dynos . <p> I have tried Google to find any companies that specialise in re-mapping of Honda petrol VTEC engines , unfortunately most seem to now specialsie in re-mapping of Diesel engines . <p> I am sure that it should be possible to re-map the engine , but I want it done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I suspect that it would be possible to change how , and when , the VTEC engages . This might give a slight uplift in torque and also a higher redline . <p> I have not seen a torque curve for the engine , it feels as though it does not droop away after 4500 and hits the redine without warning if not looking at the rev counter . <p> If I am correct , then a re-map to 8000 should give a longer reach in lower gears as I mentioned earlier , and otherwise it will not affect the engine 's life because it will not be spending a long time at those increased loads . <p> Having the head ported and a modifed intake manifold and exhaust sounds over the top to me , and I do n't understand how that would help without cam changes in an ordinary engine . If I am correct , Honda simply kept the revs to 7200 to give the engine a very very long life . I mean , the car is now over 6 years old and is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a different market than me , but I 've had it for 5 years and I do n't want to spend a lot on it or sell it . <p> To conclude , I am sure that there are more changes possible in the mapping as it is a VTEC with " fly-by-wire " so the ECU can map throttle opening and cam opening angles and engagement of higher lift , as well as the bog-standard ignition timing and fuelling which non-VTEC ECUs can do . <p> Hope this helps , but note that I am not an expert in these engines and I have no practical expertise in engine mods . <p> formulas , speeds in gears etc etc are all very well but the simple fact is your engine wont rev like an R unless you tune it like an R <p> You are right that just increasing the revs on the same engine wont decrease torque but if it wont rev higher the formula ca n't be applied . <p> To raise the rev limit you will need to change the engine spec and this will change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without wishing to be confrontational you say you know nothing about tuning engines but when someone does offer help ( and I do have a V tec civic ) you seem to suddenly become an expert and do n't  want to accept the advice which was supposed to be helpful . <p> Waynes info by the way pretty much agrees with what I am saying . <p> BTW honda diodnt just cut the revs on the accord for a longer life - they cut it by detuning the motor which of course does make it more reliable because there is less stress <p> Your last reply is the sort of direct answer that I wanted . If you have a Civic then your advice is what I want . <p> I have several very old British carb cars , and what stops them revving is the breathing , which also represents a steep decline in torque . When you say " increasing the revs on the same engine wont decrease torque but if it wont rev higher the formula ca n't be applied " does not make sense , because if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With or without a formula , if the torque does not decrease then the engine will rev higher ( if the rev limit is removed ) which means that the engine will deliver more power in lower gears . <p> However you then say " honda did n't  just cut the revs on the accord for a longer life - they cut it by detuning the motor which of course does make it more reliable because there is less stress " , which suggests that if I get the rev limit removed , it will be pointless because the breathing will make the torque drop off rapidly as it goes over its present electronic limit . This point of your does make sense . <p> I 'm sorry if I appeared to " suddenly become an expert " but ambiguity confuses me . With the electronic limit removed then either - the engine will rev higher without loss of torque or - at higher revs the engine will no longer breath and so there will be a loss of compression on the pistons ( loss of torque ) which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems strange that the high lift cams only come in at 6000 and then the engine hits the end stop at 7200 , it just feels as though it would go on to 8000 without loss of torque . But will it ? ? ? <p> That is what I want to know , without ambiguity , and also where I can go to get the rev limit removed if this is safe to do ? <p> Alternatively , where can I go to get the engine remapped so that the high lift cams come in earlier , hence more torque ( power ) earlier in the rev range ? <p> Finally , if I decide to get serious on this engine and go to improve its breathing , where to buy parts and the sorts of prices ? <p> Maybe my explanation was n't good so I will try to explain it a different way ( bear with me ) First of all let 's put all the formulas and engine specs to one side just for a moment . <p> All engines have a natural rev limit which varies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On japanese car engines is usually to do with the head/cams/valve . But it could be a restrictive exhaust or fuel system or even piston speed . <p> On higher revving engines power certainly does not neccessarily increase proportionally with revs but the likelyhood of engine damage does . So an artificial rev limiter is sometimes fitted to stop this damage occuring . The more tuned the engine is the more likely it is to have such a limiter <p> For example I also have a highly tuned nissan that will rev to over 9000rpm on high boost but I do n't  want it to because 8300 gives sufficient power and the torque and power drops off so dramatically after about 8000 The rev limit is set to 8300 by the ecu which is aftermarket and adjustable . No matter what I do it cannott rev over 8300 because the spark is cut . The important bit ( that 's relevant to our discussion ) is that this gives the appearance off a missfire which is very easy to feel . <p> It does n't  make sense for car manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rev limiter on for the sheer hell of it . Instead they design the engine to be viable in stock form up to its natural rev limit A prime example of this is my civic . It revs it happily enough but stops at about 7300 . It stops here because the head set up - valves , cams , porting etc simply do not flow well enough to allow higher revs and not because of an " artificial " rev limiter . This give a smooth engine up to the 7300 without a missfire suggesting that the engine desin itself is the limiting factor as far as rpm is concerned . <p> My point about formulas was that if an engine is restricting itself to say 7300 by way of head design then until the flow is improved it wont rev higher full stop . If it wont rev higher a mathematical equation might be correct but wont make any difference to the engines actual rev limit . <p> As far as the formula goes it cant calculate anything without either the bhp or torque figure <p> You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the formula but not the other way round . <p> There is another important factor - you only get more power when increasing the revs if the engine can " process " the neccessary extra fuel with roughly the same efficiency <p> On my civic ( and I think your accord ) the engine cant but on the Type R it can <p> That is the difference and that is what you need to address to get more power . <p> I cant help with where you sould go because I ahve never wanted to tune my civic but any well known honda tuner will be able to tell you easily enough . A visit to the honda section or the civic/accord forum would find the answers . <p> I certainly did n't want to get off on the wrong foot , unfortunately I did , but the formula was just a way of trying to explain what I meant . <p> But I get what you meant now . I now believe that if I had the electronic limit removed without changing the engine breathing , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time other unpredicatable time . Or bugger the cat quite quickly . <p> I 've called a few ECU remappers and they all say that it is possible to get the high-lift coming in sooner and remove the rev limiter if I wanted , but of course they would say that would n't they ! ! <p> I du n no about vtec but I do know that forcing variable intake systems to come in earlier can have adverse effects on torque - lower down the rev range a longer intake path helps to increase torque , further up a shorter one helps power - making the intake shorter lower down the rev range you can lose torque . <p> I think I 'd want to do a lot more research before messing with a key part of the engine . <p> Or alternatively , stick an S2000 engine in it . Or more alternatively , supercharge it , I know people have done this to S2000 engines . <p> the reason you may be struggling to find a remapper for the petrol engines is im pretty sure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> the type r engine is also quite different to the standard 2ltr engine hense why they rev differently . <p> the honda engines seem to like being supercharged as for where the drive is taken from ether custom build into the auxulary belt or by removing another item and replacing it with the pulley from the charger - air con for example <p> Do a search for supercharger and our member claymore , he 's fitted a couple to his Volvos in the past . At low boost it is relatively straighforward . ( You obviously need to up the fuel and alter the timing slightly. )

If you are increasing your fueling with bigger injectors you will also need to get a bigger fuel pump to supply it . 38228 @qwx238228 <p> The next area for modification is the intake and exhaust . Contrary to popular belief there is often very little if any power gain to be had by fitting an induction kit , they only work well and are recommended after you increase the engines power to the point where the standard air intake box can not cope ! <p> Derestricting the flow of air into the engine is the primary part of car tuners so get a freer flowing air filter if you find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car is running lean .

Stick to twin 1.5 to 2.5 inch exhausts as a rule of thumb . <p> Getting the head flowed ( porting and polishing ) will allow you to maximize your air/fuel charge and should give a nice spike in the torque output . Leave this to a professional though with a proper flow bench and machine tools Your clutch can lose you loads of power as the power goes up if it starts to complain and the standard clutches are only ever good for power gains of up to 30% . <p> Fit a power clutch to avoid power leak through the transmission .

It is generally simpler to bolt on a supercharger than it is to fit a working turbo . Turbos give boost in increasing proportion to rising engine speed and this can make mapping difficult . It is more straightforward to map a supercharger because the boost is correlating to engine speed on a linear curve . Decreasing the engines compression ratio will allow you to add forced induction , water injection may also help prevent detonation .

Please let us know in our forum if you have experience with this setup . <p> Piper also offer a fast road 270 degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbo at around 18psi but our member Blunty tells us " this is something i 'm unsure of unless i try it ( wink wink ) . Also headwork regardless of what anyone says if you have the head off for any reason is a must as a better flowing head is always going to be a benefit no matter what the level of tune your engine is also why the head is off make sure you replace the gaskets with a group A gasket set " . <p> Another note on Renault 5 GT engine tuning - if your really serious about getting the best flow then look at getting the inlet manifold ported and de burred as it is a tad restritive and then look at getting the carb top gas flowed <p> Now obviously like with most cars its a good idea to get the suspension uprated either with lowering springs or a full kit and always look at upgrading the brakes either by fitting better discs and pads or going for a big brake upgrade . <p> If going for big brakes either ktec recing or cgb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 285mm on the front . There are many different sets of upgraded pads and discs for the r5 gtt iv always fount that ebc make good discs and greenstuff pads seem to work well . <p> When it comes to choosing wheels it is possible to fit 17 " rims on them but it takes alot of work and you will lose the handling qualities of the car . The best size is around 15 " really and popular Renault spec upgrades are the mk1 clio 16v turbines or mk2 clio alloys also Ronal turbos look amazing on the 5 gtt but alloy choice is always down to the owner and for me the alloys make or break a car <p> Choosing tyres is subjective but Blunty recommends his personal favourite choice , the uniroyal rainsport 2s . Someone told him they are more for the wet to which his response was , " well compare the days the roads are wet or dry in the UK . Also do n't  be fooled by this as these tyres are better in the dry than any toyo proxes or yoko parada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about handling then fit front and rear strut braces this will also help stiffen the chassis and no doubt help you if doing trackdays or some seirously hard driving . <p> The 5 gt turbo is one awesome track toy once set up right . Keeping on the trackday lines is great fun , and , even though the 5 gt turbo is a light car ( around 830-860kg ) a bit of weight loss can be had by removing the back seats and even adding perspex windows then its an ideal time to get a nice cage in there this will really help stiffen what already is a great little chassis up . <p> As said this is a pretty basic guide if anyone would like to add or comment on this that would be great and appreciated in this forum thread . <p> This @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

I also know that when you want to make a useful remap you need a dyno and it is helpful if you even have exaust gas measuring tool . I also know that modern ECUs do n't allow real time programing , ( at least I read about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be written into flash and tested on dyno ) .

My personal opinion about 32bit MCUs in ECU is that this is no more than exaggeration like everything in todays car industry .

So please sugest on that one . <p> The other request is that if it is not to hard that someone can briefly explain or give an internet link to an explanation how exactly ECU even work . I know that it has a close and open loop mode , but I do n't know if ECU determines outputs by including input data into equations or it simply search the output values from comparising inputs and outputs in the maps . <p> No you do n't need a dyno to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture ) Table , etc . It is possible to for example study factory tune files and compare the " GT " versions of the tune files with the more mundane models tune files to see what parameters had been changed . Going by the assumption that a any car company would not validate and release poor tune files for production , complete with in some cases 100,000 mile ( 160,000km ) warranties . <p> Some tune files can be down-loaded from the net , depending on software tuning companies . EFILive.com provide a free tune file reposiory here for example : -www.holdencrazy.com <p> The tuning software I have experience of , has an additional software package ( " moates road-runner " ) that allows anyone with it to make changes to a cars computer as you drive in real-time . <p> If you do n't have this particular option , with the efilive scan &amp; tune software for instance , you can log as you drive , notice a parameter that needs changing , stop the car ; make adjustments to the tune-file and flash it in . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can re-start and go with the changes made and if necessary continue logging to see what effect the change may have made . <p> The only thing to bear in mind here is that changes to things like Long Term Fuel Trims and other some other parameters such as throttle cracker and follower to name just two , can take up to 100-150kms for any alteration to become effective in the tune . <p> You are able to short-cut the time some of the parameters take by doing a PCM re-set which sets things like fuel trims back at zero ( The PCM stores fuel trim information and has an adaptive learning capability for a whole load of things . THIS MAY NOT BE THE CASE FOR ALL TYPES OF PCM , ECM . Though I 'd imagine most work in a very similar fashion now . <p> Getting back to the real-time logging capability that some of these full software packages have .

Then when you are finished you can just plug it into a lap-top , down-load it and do a playback . <p> Although AFR is adjusted in these software packages I am familiar with . Nothing beats a dyno with a 4 or 5-gas analyzer for best results . Especially a dyno where you can additionally hold speed and vary loads to get part throttle tuning sorted and the great bonus of being able to find where MBT ( Mean Best Timing ) is for best torque production at WOT for instance ( Wide Open throttle ) which will keep you well away from the dreaded detonation . <p> ( It 's amazing how many people still believe " More timing is better so most timing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the information available .

@@24423698 @4423698/ <h> Spark plugs <p> Spark plugs are an essential element in petrol engines but the spark plugs are often overlooked . <p> For the best combustion you want a good strong spark . <p> A bigger spark will ignite the air/fuel mix more effectively . <p> It is the burn rate , the expansion of the flame front , which causes the piston to change direction and produces the power stroke . <p> Peak power is reached when the flame front is at the point of maximum expansion . For smooth running it is essential that this happens at the same point each time in the cycle and is synchronized across the cylinders . The spark initiates the flame so a good , strong , consistent spark is essential for a consistent burn . <p> Spark plug technology has come a long way . New materials are in use which have lower resistance and give a longer life . State of the art Iridium plugs will typically last for 40,000 miles and will not require regapping or deglazing . <p> Copper tipped spark plugs benefit from deglazing - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some Emery paper , sanding paper or a soft wire brush . Take care not to scratch the contacts or ceramic coating . Glazing inhibits the spark consistency and strength so deglazing maintains efficiency . <p> There are a several different types of electrodes . The overall aim is to get the biggest spark , one that is fat as well as long . A good spark gives a better burn . <p> You can choose between split tip electrodes , double or triple electrodes . For most cars you wo n't feel a difference between these and a good set of standard plugs with a copper core . Only one spark is produced regardless of how many electrodes the spark plug has . It 's worth noting that multi electrode spark plugs may last longer . <h> Fitting spark plugs . <p> Fitting spark plugs is a simple enough job . Just make sure you have the correct tool . Locate the ignition leads going into the center of the engine . <p> You may need to remove the engine cover . These are usually plastic and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinders in line but there are several other engine configurations ; 5 cylinder engines will have 5 leads and a V6 will have- 2 banks of 3 . Regardless of the configuration there will be one lead for each spark plug at the top of each cylinder . <p> A cross section of an engine showing the spark plug cross section ( white ) - to the left of the image . <p> It is good practice to change the plugs one at a time to avoid getting the leads mixed up . This would cause the spark plugs to fire in the wrong order which could damage your engine . <p> Working from left to right take out the first plug using the removal tool . The state of the plugs will tell you a lot about the condition of your engine . Lay them out in order of removal for later inspection . <p> When fitting new spark plugs it is vitally important to make sure they are fitted straight . To start with , only screw it down until the plug is finger tight . In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers , in other engines you will require the tool - if so , hold the tool like- a pencil and do not use any leverage at first . <p> Whichever method you use , do not tighten beyond finger tight initially . Once it is as tight as you can get with your fingers then tighten a further quarter turn using the plug tool . <p> The engine block is softer than the plugs- so any damage from cross threading them is going to occur on the engine . This is why it is important to ensure they are straight . If you have a cross threaded spark plug then a helicoil or re cutting the thread will usually fix the problem . <p> Move on to the next plug and repeat the process .

Derestricting the airflow into the engine is the primary part of tuning so get a better flowing air filter . Induction kits sound great but due to the warm air in the engine bay they will not add noticable power and actually rob you of power .

However a remap on a NASP engine will help unleash the potential if you have done a lot of mods . <p> The largest power gains for NASP engines usually involve the addition of forced induction . Turbos are harder to add than supercharger . It is harder to map a turbo as the boost comes on exponentially with engine speed .

@@24423705 @4423705/ <h> Tuning the A1 <p> " The small car with the big performance " <p> Some may argue that Audi did n't need a small car in the model range but the uptake of the A1 has been phenomenal and the car is a superb high end small car . <p> Handling and performance are quite good as standard but we shall look at A1 tuning and report on the best modifications . With a few sensible performance modifications you can greatly increase your driving enjoyment . <p> The A1 is a great project car if you want a track day car , and our members have some interesting projects underway in our forums . The 1.4 Twin charged engine is a great base for a project and the engine offers significant power gains for very little outlay by way of a remap . <p> Most A1 owners seek better handling of their cars as they want it to handle as well as possible . We suggest that you look for some performance suspension parts and lower your car by around 30-35 mm . More than this will generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Watch out for really stiff suspension , as it impairs the cars grip causing it to bounce over the road surface rather than gripping it . <p> When it comes to engine tuning you want to get the power coming on early and lasting for as much of the rev band as is possible . <p> With our common sense tuning guide your A1 can turn out to be a track day performer and yet still be a reliable daily runner . <p> The biggest power gains usually come from larger engine sizes and turbocharged cars . It is a general rule that the more power you start with the greater the return on investment . Do an engine swap to a 2.0 TFSi for a stonking hot hatch . A remap has to be the top of your list of mods if you have a turbo model , petrol or diesel - they both respond really well and there is lots of hidden power in the engine . <h> Audi A1 Tuning modifications . <p> Bear in mind the mantra that you want to keep as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide power band rather than a narrrow top end power spike . Whilst a lot of car part makers will claim peak BHP figures what you really need is a dyno plot showing the full torque curve . 38241 @qwx238241 38232 @qwx238232 <p> Fast road cams offer one of the biggest performance gains as far as a the car more thirsty . This makes sense as you need to burn more fuel to match the extra air the engine is using . <p> Using uprated injectors and a bigger capacity fuel pump deals with the fueling issue - which you 'll hit when pushing power gains of 60% or more . <h> Audi A1 intake and exhaust modifications . <p> Before you start doing engine mods you have to get the breathing right and remove any restrictions in the system that could inhibit air flow . A panel filter made from cotton gauze would give a slight advantage over the paper filters in some conditions . On larger engined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would suggest fitting an induction kit but only where the standard airbox has become a restriction . Where the car power differs little from standard it is not worth adding an induction kit . Ignore anyone who claims that induction kits add power on the A1 ! This is generally not the case even if you address the problem of it sucking in warm engine bay air by using a cold air feed . <p> A good high performance sports exhaust is an essential to balance your engines need for free flowing air , just adding an induction kit on it 's own will do little to increase your power . See our article on performance exhausts for details of the issue around large bore exhausts and how to choose the right size for your engine . <p> Airflow through the head can be dramatically increased with some professional porting and polishing . These should match and be setup to take into account any other engine mods . Your clutch can sap a lot of your power if it starts to slip and the standard clutches are only ever good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fit a performance clutch to avoid power losses through the transmission . <p> Turbo engines are just begging to be remapped . You will see big power gains on most turbo engined cars including diesels making a remap one of the most cost effective modifications.Adding forced induction will see big power gains but this is usually too expensive to be cost effective . It is easier to bolt on a supercharger than it is to get a turbo working . <p> Turbos give boost in exponential proportion to increasing engine speed and this can make mapping difficult . Superchargers however will give a boost which is proportional to engine speed so is easier to map . Adding forced induction will usually require a lower compression ratio or water injection and some deft engine management . <h> Audi A1 Wheel modifications . <p> Alloy wheels will help the brakes cool down and are usually lighter than the steel ones . Large wheels tend to be heavy and the last thing you want is to increase the unsprung mass in your car , instead choose performance tyres and light weight wheels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the overall rolling diameter of the wheel the same as supplied from the factory . In all cases we do not recommend going above 17 inches .

@@24423708 @4423708/ <h> Fuel saving tips <h> Most drivers are wasting fuel by ignoring a few simple steps . <p> If you were a Hypermiler you 'd be going to extreme measures to eek out as much distance from each drop of fuel so we 'll cover some of the more extreme fuel saving options out there . <h> Engine condition <p> Keeping the engine properly serviced and clean will make a big difference to fuel economy . If fuel economy figures are way down on the manufacturers claim then you should really look first of all at the condition of the engine . <p> Oil selection does affect fuel . Minimizing the internal friction and reducing engine wear are two factors that a good quality oil will address . <p> By making a few adjustments you can save 20-30% of your wasted fuel . <p> TorqueCars recommend a high quality FULLY synthetic oil for most applications . Mineral oils tend to break down over the oil change interval . Synthetics are engineered to lubricate , clean and cool an engine and you should always use the specification of oil recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the engine will help to keep the injectors and valves in good condition . <p> The only fuel cleaner that TorqueCars recommends at the moment are those made by BG - namely BG244 and BG44K . We have used both of these products and noticed an increase in power and engine efficiency . <p> Tire pressures will drop all of the time , so when the car is cold check the pressures and raise them to the manufacturers upper spec ( considering the usual load ) . This should gain around 4 bhp and will allow you to determine if you have a puncture . <p> Tire type and size also impact on fuel . Grip causes friction and by minimizing grip through a smaller contact patch you also reduce friction . Energy efficient tires will generally give another 4-7mpg through clever tread design and tire compound and composition . <p> Carrying junk around will add to the work the engine has to do to overcome inertia . Clear out all unnecessary tools and items from the car . <p> Hotter engines are more efficient so avoid short journeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off part of the radiator are methods extreme hypermilers may employ . <h> Your driving style <p> The faster you go the more fuel you will use . Driving at 50-60 on motorways will dramatically decrease the fuel you use on a typical journey . Conversely driving at 70-80 will use much more fuel than you would at say 65 . <p> Thinking ahead and avoiding braking and following another cars slipstream will also cut down the fuel you use . TorqueCars does not encourage dangerous tailgating though , you should always follow at a safe 2 second distance and leave sufficient braking time . <p> Planning your journey to stick to main roads and avoiding junctions will prevent delays and wasted fuel . <p> Turn off your engine when your car is idling in traffic if it is safe and legal to do so in your area . Modern cars fitted with stop start technology do this automatically . <p> Buying a more economical car is not usually a saving when you factor in the additional cost of the car and depreciation . For most drivers it makes more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years than to change car every few years . <p> Higher octane/cetane fuels will generally give better fuel economy if your engine is designed to benefit from them . On cars we 've owned we see around 50 miles extra on a tank of premium fuel compared to the standard fuel . As it is more expensive the saving benefits are debatable . <p> This entry was filed under Articles <h> Feedback 38237 @qwx238237 <p> Interesting info . Three points : Carbon fiber panels wont greatly affect the weight of vehicles with large engines or steel chassies . This is most effective on smaller , lighter cars in terms of affecting a % of the cars original mass . And cars that have aluminum body panels will see more benefit vs. fiberglass . There are two other driving tips that I have found useful . It takes a lot more fuel to accelerate over a given distance than cruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versa , seek traffic that moves evenly a 35 kph crawl is likely to be more economical than zipping from one intersection to another . And when you do come to a halt , instead of turning the engine off , simply hold down the brake and shift into neutral ( on level ground ! DO NOT try this on hills or steep grades ! ) . In automatic transmissions this uncouples the torque converter and reduces the load on the engine without the added wear of stopping and starting on your engine and starter motor . Hope that helps . 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

We would say to ignore the peak power figure and look at getting a nice wide and flat Torque band across the rev range for everyday driving . In motorsport you will be using the high rpm bands and this is where you want the power to be . <p> You can also have EITHER improved fuel economy and a slightly lower power figure or tune the engine to the max and get reduced fuel consumption .

Your redline will be higher if the engine is balanced and a lighter polished crank gives less friction and releases more power from the engine . <p> The balancing allows you to run higher RPM levels safely without nasty vibrations in the engine . <h> Sport computer tuning ( Remapping , Chipping and Flashing ) <p> This changes the timing characteristics of the engine and is usually perfectly matched to your engine , fuel choice , driving style and car condition rather than the standard makers best guess setup which can cope with pretty bad servicing and poor quality fuel . <p> Massive power gains and better fuel economy are available ( particularly on turbo diesel models ) as is a high revs sport power setting and a low revs economy setting . <p> The downside is that you have to keep the engine in peak condition changing the plugs regularly and fastidiously following the service intervals .

Turbo chargers use the force of the expelled exhaust to drive a turbine and ram fresh air into the engine . Superchargers however are driven by the engines drivetrain but both turn relatively small engines into real powerhouses . <p> Superchargers give a noticeable power increase at all revs . Because the supercharger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air is sucked in . Some manufacturers are introducing superchargers to their turbo engines to minimise lag and eek out every drop of available power . By altering the pulleys on the supercharger you can effectively overdrive it boosting power and we see a lot of superchargers fitted to large v8 engines . <p> Turbo chargers produce more power than supercharges but are subject to lag . More and more manufacturers are adding turbos to their cars and there is a growing trend of fitting aftermarket turbo kits as well .

It is a great project car if you want a track day car , and our members have some interesting projects underway in our forums . <p> The ZS is a good size and suitable for families but the chassis is quite nimble and provides a fun basis for a performance car with plenty of lift off oversteer ! Most ZS owners seek better handling of their cars as they want it to handle as well as possible so with this in mind we would suggest that you look for some performance suspension parts and lower your car by around 40mm . <p> Poly bushes will tighten things up and adjustable coilovers allow you to set the car up exactly as you desire . Dropping by more than this will generally require arch work - especially on the performance models which are already equipped with lower and stiffer suspension . <p> Bear in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live with on our roads with potholes and rough surfaces to contend with . <p> Do n't look at peak power when doing engine tuning , what you need is a flat torque curve across as much of the rev range as possible . <p> With some simple modifications you can really transform your ZS into a fun car , and credible track performer . <p> Sadly with smaller engine sizes you are generally just wasting your time and money on modifications , we 've seen people spend 1000 's and only getting a gain of 10-20bhp . So ignore the smaller ZS105/110 and 120 and focus instead on the ZS180 . An engine swap to the early Rover Tomcat 2.0 Turbo or a supercharged 1.8 VVC unit makes for an interesting power upgrade . <h> MG ZS Tuning modifications . <p> Bear in mind the mantra that you want to keep as much low end power as you can and aim for a wide power band rather than a narrow top end power spike . Do n't get misled by manufacturer claims of big peak power gains , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torque or power band you need to focus your attention on.Fast road cams are generally one of the best power mods you can do to your engine . <p> But you need to select the right profile , for advice on cam selection see our tuning articles for more information . If your car is making more power then it will need more air and fuel so fueling upgrades are important mods if you are serious about power.For fueling upgrades you will generally need a set of uprated injectors and a higher capacity fuel pump . <h> MG ZS intake and exhaust modifications . <p> Breathing mods are usually easily sorted and probably one of the easiest mods to do . Derestricting the airflow into the engine is the primary part of tuning so get a better flowing air filter . Induction kits sound great with the induction roar they create but due to the warm air in the engine bay they will not add noticable power and actually rob you of power . Exhaust selection should take into account the flow rate , rather than just the bore size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big and the flow rate will dimish the point the engine scavanging suffers.See our article on performance exhausts for details of the issue around large bore exhausts and how to choose the right size for your engine . <p> Airflow through the head can be dramatically increased with some professional porting and polishing . These should match and be setup to take into account any other engine mods . A good fast road power clutch will help to keep that power going where it should . Never just hope that a standard worn clutch will cope . <p> A remap on a NASP engine will help unleash the potential if you have done a lot of mods but it is worth noting that the Rover derived MEMS can not be remapped so to get a custom map installed you 'll need an aftermarket ECU or a chip upgrade . Adding forced induction will see big power gains but this is usually too expensive to be cost effective . Turbos are harder to add than supercharger .

@@24423719 @4423719/ 38227 @qwx238227 <h> Wheel modifications and upgrades <p> " Keeping it wheel " <p> One of the most popular modification done on cars is replacing the wheels . We will look at the types of wheel available , the pros and cons of each and look at the implications of fitting different size wheels . <p> We will be challenging the concept of wider wheels giving more grip and looking at the effect a larger rim size has on a cars performance . <p> The wheels should never be underestimated as this is the only contact the car has with the road . <p> Unsprung weight , what is it and why is it bad ? Most of the car is Sprung , that is the vertical and to some degree lateral movement is controlled or dampened by the suspension . <p> When things change direction or speed you lose energy . The suspension in a car is attempting to keep the wheels in contact with the ground . In a wheel travelling over a rough surface you will be losing energy as it bounces and skips over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to control these undulations . This is simple physics really , a heavy object requires more energy to move and stop than a lighter one . When you start rotating an object rotational forces come into play , much like a gyroscope and the heavier the wheel the more resistant it is to directional changes . The faster the wheel rotates the greater the gyroscope effect is so the weight of a wheel is magnified due to the rotation . <p> The lower the weight of the wheel is the more inclined it will be to respond when you want to change direction when you turn a corner , slow up or accelerate . So you really want your wheels to be as light as possible and not too high . <h> Myths about wider wheels and grip . <p> It is often thought that wider wheels will increase the cars grip . It should be noted that this is a wild generalisation . Wider wheels still have a similar contact area to narrow wheels ! The weight of the car is spread over a wider contact patch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall surface area is similar . <p> In cars you will usually find that in the wet and snow a narrower tyre is able to cut through to the road surface and grip better than larger wheels . ( Tread depth also comes into play here as well . ) In a wider tyre more water or snow is trapped under the tyre effectively lifting it up and reducing grip . <p> To illustrate this we might compare the footprints of an elephant and woman wearing High Heel shoes on a wooden floor . As the elephants feet are quite large the weight is spread out , the high heels however have a narrow point and all the weight is focussed causing a dent to appear . <p> The key component in grip is the footprint of the tyre and this changes as cornering and accelerative forces are exerted on the tyre . The tread pattern , side wall height and material used in the tyre all have a bearing on this . <h> Types of wheel and the advantages of them . <p> Steel - the wheels that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid with holes cut around the outside of the wheel . Most are covered over with plastic wheel trims . The downside of these are the lack of brake cooling vents and the fact they look rather boring but the plus side is that they are very strong , relatively light and very cheap to produce.Alloy ( Various metal alloys are available , also known as MAG wheels - Magnesium alloy ) These are generally spoked designs and can be quite light , although some weight a surprising amount . Generally the lighter ones are more prone to splitting and cracking . They look nice and allow the brakes to cool.Split rim - a two or sometimes 3 piece design , where the inner and outer parts are bolted together . These allow a wider wheel to be created and some extreme offsets are available . These can be made of a variety of metals.Spoked - Associated with classic cars , the central hub is attached to the outside by a series of spokes . They are a nightmare to keep clean but do look stunning on the right car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are required to give them strength.Carbon Fibre - We are only just starting to see carbon fibre wheels produced . These are light and strong and unlike metal the material allows for some deformation under load aiding grip and giving a smoother ride . Type approvals on carbon wheels are the delay where the wheels need to be thoroughly tested for road use before they can be sold . Initial tests show that they perform at least as well as the metal counterparts and in some cases even better . <p> Wheel construction types.Monoblock , is a term used to describe any wheel that is just one piece . It is a wheel made from one piece of metal which is cast , forged or bent and cut to shape , they are pretty light.Cast , this is where the molten metal is poured into a mould and left to set , they are then finished off to give a smooth finish , giving a light aesthetically pleasing wheel.Forged , the metal is heated and pressed or hammered into shape . This gives a very strong final product . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The style of the wheel also has a bearing on the heat dissipation from the alloys and would certainly be a factor for consideration in a track day car . <p> The downside of larger wheels is the change this makes to the final drive ratio . It can cause the speedometer to under read and will also reduce the cars acceleration . They are also heavier and more resistant to directional changes causing tram lining and can be bumpy on rough surfaces . See our article on choosing alloy wheels for a calculator which allows you to compare the rotational diameter of your new wheels to the OEM ones . <p> The plus side is that a cars top speed will be marginally higher and tyre wear rates are generally a bit lower on larger wheels . <p> Conversely smaller wheels will increase your acceleration and reduce the cars top speed . Your speedometer will also tend to over read with smaller wheels . A smaller wheel is also lighter so is a good way to save unsprung weight . So if you are after performance rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When changing your wheels you should also note that your suspension may well need to be adjusted . In most cases where the wheel size change is marginal this is not vital , but we would still recommend a full geometry set up anyway . <p> Another consideration with wheels is the offset . The wheel can be biased towards the wheel arches , widening the track or biassed inwards giving a narrower track . <p> Cool , this answers all my queries from the other sections about alloy wheels and tyre combinations . BTW : Myths about wider wheels and grip this section fails to point out that its referring to wider wheels/tyres that have the same circumference as narrower ones so you need wider tyres with also a longer circumference too , to increase grip ? 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

I have had a few problems with the car since i bought it which led me to remove the dpf and have it removed from the ecu . After I did that I had turbo problems which i recently resolved but soldering a broken wire to the turbo electrovalve . Now the car has no antipollution fault and is no longer in limp mode but I still feel it is underpowered . <p> What can I check now that could be lowering the boost ? Or will the car just need time to clear out with driving ? I was considering a remap but want to wait until I know the car is running 100% . Any suggestions ? <p> after the air filter and before the turbo ( between them ) . you should see a plug somewhere in the hose . that 's the maf. other thing i can think is the egr valve dirty and not closing properly ? can you check if boosting levels are normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean the sensor or would it just need replaced ? would a faulty sensor not throw up a fault code on pp2000 ( diag ) ? and about the egr - the car does idle a bit rough at the start which i think is a symptom of a dirty egr or am i wrong ? <p> Could be something . get it cleaned then blanked off to stop it happening again . It should improve power too , because it will stop exhaust gas being recirculated , which is only good for reducing emissions <p> some say the maf can be cleaned but the results are next to no good . a faulty sensor should send a fault , but there is a chance of not doing it yet ... can the diagnostic tool check the egr cycle on your car ? rough idle is one symptom yes . you can either blanke the egr as Jakeymd said or clean it . <p> well my gut instinct would tell me the lack of boost would be coming from a pipe split or clip , or something like the sensor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I fixed the cable to this valve which clearly was n't functioning until I soldered the connection to it , so could it be blocked up ? <p> well my gut instinct would tell me the lack of boost would be coming from a pipe split or clip , or something like the sensor messing up .

Also on this we seem welded the shell and had to add strengtheners as although from the outside it looked the same once completey stripped it was obvious that Pug themselves majorily increase the strength of these more powerful shells . just a point , not sure if it is relevant on more modern cars but something to consider , <p> yea i mean my rover was a set shell for the 400 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell not sure about the 2.0 but there was holes all over my car for other parts like i fitted a radiator from the 1.6 but i did n't  know it was bigger but it fitted in other holes perfectly <p> the wholes are usually in the same place for most models but some manufacturers strengthen the chassis and weld other plates on so normally it looks likes everything is in the same place but need to check closely to see the changes . <p> So many areas to watch when doing this , depends on the car in question and the engine/gearbox configuration going in . <p> Dimensions of new engine , layout and gearbox , will it fit ? <p> Firewall fabrication . <p> Will it clear the pedal box assembly ? <p> Will it foul the brake servo ? <p> Will it foul the steering column ? <p> Will it require a custom radiator ? <p> Will it need an oil cooler ? is there room for it ? <p> Will the sump pan require modifying ? <p> If using a bell housing adaptor , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

The aim of this article is to give a limited introduction of car tuning mods and point you in the right direction , our forum is the place to go for detailed advice and tips on your project and all aspects of modding cars . <p> It improves the intake and exhaust flow and pushes up the power if done right . Ideally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remap . We 'd also caution you not to go with a motor sports profile cam as this upsets the engines idling and general town driving characteristics.When pushing up the power you will need to pay attention to the fueling . More power needs more fuel . Using higher octane petrol is another option if you find you are suffering from pinking or premature ignition on your Ford project after fitting other mods . Uprated injectors will enable you to supply sufficient fuel to the engine . A fuel pump will only deliver a finite amount of fuel , so you may need to uprate this if your injectors are demanding more fuel . 38228 @qwx238228 <p> The next area for modification is the intake and exhaust . Contrary to popular belief there is usually very little power gain to be had by fitting an induction kit , they only work well and are recommended after you increase the engines power to the point where the standard air intake box can not cope ! For most Probe engines TorqueCars would suggest you just go with a washable panel air filter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit will help release the power providing you address the problem of needing cold air . <p> Sports exhausts can usually air flow from the engine but do not go too large or you could will reduce the flow rate . Stick to 1.5 to 2.5 inches as a rule of thumb . <p> Head work including a head port and polished and 3 or 5 angle valve job will really help to release the potential of the engine . When you start tuning your Probe you will find that the standard clutch starts to complain so get an uprated clutch . NASP engines do not achieve big power gains if you remap them , unless you have done extensive modifications . With turbocharged engines this is another story . A remapped turbo will give impressive power gains and take full advantage of the strength of the block . Despite the large cost involved adding forced induction to a NASP engine will give large power gains . Turbos are generally harder to add than a supercharger . It is harder to map a turbo as the boost comes on exponentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is proportional to engine speed so is easier to map . Decreasing the engines compression ratio will allow you to add forced induction , water injection may also help prevent detonation. 38226 @qwx238226 <p> Alloy wheels will help the brakes cool down and are usually lighter than the steel ones . It is worth noting that although they can look cool on the Probe Big alloy wheels will actually decrease your performance . The larger you go the lower your acceleration will be - this is due to the change in your effective final drive ratio . Although some people have gone larger we would stick to a 18 inch rim size as the maximum . 38231 @qwx238231 38235 @qwx238235 <p> This @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

@@24423736 @4423736/ <h> Possible BHP for very very little money for MG/R KV6 owners ... ( your thoughts ? ) <p> Me and a fellow MG ZS180 friend have been talking a lot lately about a possible mod for the 180 or 190 engines that could cost less than -80 in parts . <p> After much research , measuring and testing we have come to discover that there is the possibility of getting over 200bhp from a KV6 without a remap or spending loads of money . <p> There are some differences in the 180 and 190 engines that give them their different power . 2 of the biggest ones for the 190 engine is that the intake system is better for infinite better breathing and also the Inlet cam is advanced by 4 degrees using a static pully . We also discovered that the exhaust cams on both engines have a duration of 244 degrees and 8.8mm lift , instead of the 236 degrees and 8.2mm lift the standard inlet ones use . <p> So our theory is , why not use 2 pairs of exhaust cams giving them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pullies from the ZT190 giving you 4 degrees advanced timing . The Valve spring and cap ratings are exactly the same on the front and back which helps a lot . <p> So for the price of -70-80 you can have a mild fast road cam set-up at 244 degrees aswell as advanced timing on the inlet which would be the same effect as having vernier pullies . Much better than spending -500+ on Kent or Piper just for cams and no one seems to make the verniers anymore so this theory should be some proper bang for buck and is a perfect mod if belts are being done at the same time . <p> We predict ( due to the 260 degree Piper Cam giving 20+bhp on a standard engine ) That the cams alone will give in the region of 10+bhp ( as they give roughly 50-55% increase of the Pipers ) and then a further few bhp from the advance timing on the inlet . So in theory 15+bhp is not impossible at all . Matched with a full 2.5 " straight through from flexi back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 215-220bhp . And of course maybe another 10 if a walbro fuel pump and uprated injectors are installed before the remap . <p> So again , in theory , there is n't any reason this wo n't work aswell as a full cam and pully set up from a leading company , just a milder road use version and anyone who knows what a ZS180 is like , giving it 215-220bhp will put it in a different league . <p> There 's no reason it should n't work in theory . But Vauxhall guys have been doing it for years putting 2 pairs of 3.0ltr cams in the 2.5 , the 2.6 , 3.0 and 3.2 . Works wonders . I just do n't think hardly anyone in the MG world has realised what is available under their noses . <p> If I remember rightly , a few members who own the MG ZT KV6 have tried and failed . At one point I was even seriously looking at ZR 's with HGF and ripping the engine out and putting in a KV6 . <p> However , the KV6 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them they blow up . The only way to get decent power out of them is Supercharging but that 's expensive . Camming option is a good one , but you 'll be hard pressed to get any more then 200bhp even with a port and polish etc etc . <p> Many have proven that theory right about braking the 200 mark without major modding . Mine is already 201 , but need a walbro fuel pump and a set of uprated injector before going down the remap route , but should be looking at 215-220bhp when done . <p> There is a lovely ZT190 on the forums who is running a proven 247bhp N ? A and the stuff he 's had done is n't actually out of the realms of costing a fortune . <p> But after much reading , no-one or hardly anyone has tried this method we are playing with . Another one aswell is to use the inlet manifold from a Rover 825 or 827 as they are full metal inlet aswell as the VIS system , and also uses a twin throttle body set-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to the MG ZS rev setup for it 's standard VIS . <p> Many have looked at the ZT190 but found it to be alot of work for little gains . There has been many opinions on the actual differences on the 190 none actually proven accurate . I 'll be interested to see what the actual gains are with those changes but doubt if you will see the figures mentioned . If proven right then it may be of interest assuming people keep them when the belt change is due again , enthusiasts will of course . At least with the 270 profile you can get the current cams reground for a fraction of the new cost but again with the lack of verniers there is no room for adjustments . Personally I am happy enough with what I have got and not bothered about chasing numbers and focus on the handling and braking where it is pretty decent base to start from . <p> I have the press release literature here if interested on the exact difference of the 190 engine to the 180 version <p> Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . I 'm not thinking of doing the " 190 " conversion , but rather create an engine using the different engine parts . If already owning a 180 then all that is needed is another pair of exhaust cams , and the static pullies off the inlet of a 190 , thus giving a 50% version of fast road cams and verniers ( the statics have about 2 degrees adjustment if using the 190 timing kit as the 180 kit is different ) . Piper etc say that a 20+bhp gain can be seen on standard application and none of them sell the verniers for the KV6 anymore . The exhaust cam is just over 50% of the profile of the Pipers Fast Road Cam . So a 50% gain of the pipers for 15% of the money is definitely worth it . <p> 1 of the main things they talk about making the difference with the 190 is the 4 degrees advance timing on the inlet , and the larger intake on the air filter piping ( hense why such a noticeable gain can be felt on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Could very well be . My engine is having a little rebuild in the next 2-4 weeks so could be an opportunity . But will be going to buy a spare engine aswell which can be built up over time . Also using the 190 for the already port matched heads and the exhaust manifolds . Found out aswell that a stand alone system will work for the VIS system from the Rover 825 and 827 's better than a circuit board being made which will also open a lot of doors for further tuning and probably better tuning of the bits I 'm going to use . But in doing so will then take the costs of this theory rocketing . The whole idea of this theory is that the parts for it wont cost any more than -100 , so in theory from a standard ZS18o with the 177bhp , should see an increase of over 30bhp which is n't bad for total cost of -350 inc remap . <p> You get over 240bhp without going near throttle bodies , super charger or NOS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ZT that 's floating about is stunning . But unfortunately , getting anything out of N/A car is hard and costly , but covering the basics is a good start and aslong it gets near or over 215 then I think it 's work it for the money spent . <p> Vauxhall engines are far easier to get a bit more out of , just by using 2 pairs of 3.0 cams will knock a 2.5 up to 200bhp alone . But it 's all about breathing with V6 's engines . And aslong as the engine can take the extra heat , then the sky is the limit , well your pocket is anyway lol . <p> I have the press release literature here if interested on the exact difference of the 190 engine to the 180 version 38230 @qwx238230 <p> This by any chance ? <p> The ZT range has newly-enhanced versions of MG Rover 's all-alloy quad-cam V6 engine . For the ZT 190 models , several special features have been engineered to achieve the higher power output of 190Ps or 140kW , and increased torque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the air intakes have a 15% larger duct and a new intake diffuser . This provides a smoother airflow with less than half the usual pressure drop ; it has also been tuned for a more sporting induction sound . Internally , there is a new inlet valve cam profile , advancing the inlet valve opening by 4- , as well as improved inlet porting . To withstand higher cylinder pressures , the gudgeon pins and big end bearings have been upgraded , and the oil specification has been raised to ACEA-A3 for protection at sustained high revs . A further contribution to performance comes from a new exhaust system , with 60mm diameter pipes in place of 57mm , new low-restriction metal-based starter and main catalysts and a modified rear silencer unit . This has larger-bore internal pipes , twin straight tail pipes and a mechanical valve that responds to exhaust pressure at around 4500rpm to by-pass the internal baffles . This reduced back pressure helps create an attractive sporting note while still meeting all legal requirements for drive-by noise . A redesign of the engine ECU software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of responsiveness to the accelerator pedal , with a deliberate reduction of the normal throttle on/off damping . Finally , an enhanced cooling system , with 20% greater cooling intake area , uses an improved-flow radiator and top hose configurations , with a new plate-type oil/water oil cooler replacing the oil/air heat exchanger . <p> I remember the Scotch Lock King did one of the first ever throttle body conversion on the KV6 and only managed 230bhp from it ! The aim was 250bhp ! ! 38230 @qwx238230 <p> That car was broken up , shame as Steve spent a lot of money over a few years !

A current flows from one lead plate through the electrolyte to the other . Car batteries are made up of a row of these cells typically 6 cells rated at 2 volts each .

This will cause harmful battery acids to leak out of the battery into the engine bay . The first victim is usually the battery tray so this should be regularly inspected for signs of corrosion . <p> If you experience a power failure get the whole electrical charge system checked .

@@24423745 @4423745/ <h> The 5 best ways to save fuel . <p> With ever increasing fuel costs it makes sense to look for ways to save fuel . The more fuel you conserve the more money you will save . <p> We 'll take a look at the best fuel saving tips and blow a few myths out of the water . <p> If everyone who read these tips just managed to save 1 mpg it would add up to a massive fuel saving and help the environment . <p> In reality I think most people will save about 10-20% in fuel costs by reading and applying these tips . To keep track of your MPG use an online fuel calculator . <h> 1 General servicing <p> The following things can really affect your fuel consumption . <p> Servicing - a regularly serviced and well maintained car will be more efficient and use less fuel . Pay particular attention to oil levels , spark plug condition and air filters to save fuel . <p> Tire pressures - having soft tires or slow punctures can cost as much as 4 mpg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel economy at the higher end of tire pressures but this needs to be balanced with the vehicle load , use and manufacturers recommendations . <p> Wheel alignment - if the wheels are out of alignment or you have a high friction hub issue you will be losing substantial amounts of fuel economy . <p> Running the engine hot - a warm engine is more efficient . Some drivers change the thermostat for a hotter one and will usually gain a few addition MPG and save some fuel . <p> Think of how much carbon we would save if we all followed just one of the tips on this page . <h> 2 Avoid modifications to the engine that do nothing to help you save fuel . <p> There are a number of products out there claiming to give you extra fuel economy but most are downright fraudulent or at best so negligibly effective at saving fuel they are not worth it . <p> Magnets on the fuel line do nothing , fuel does not magnetize ionize or similar as claimed by the makers of these fuel magnets . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could try taping a fridge magnet to your fuel line and see for yourself how effective this is rather than shell out on a " miracle fuel saving magnet " . <p> Oil additives that bond to the engine . There are so many of these around on the market . Most of the particles will get caught in the fuel filter anyway potentially clogging it up . There is very little evidence to support any oil additives and less so to support the fact they help with saving fuel . There is no substitute for getting a good quality engine oil in the first place and keeping it topped up . <p> Water to Hydrogen kits , we are constantly asked about these kits and if they save fuel and the answer is NO ! Leave them well alone . If it were that easy to run a car on water and save fuel the manufacturers would have done it . Most of the companies selling these devices have amended their claims following complaints from the advertising standards . Perhaps one day someone will come up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a pipe dream . <h> 3 Beneficial additives and tuning methods to save fuel . <p> Remapping an engine , chip tuning and SOME smart tuning boxes will increase your fuel economy . This needs to be specified when buying , as most will increase performance and fuel consumption . It is worth noting that most diesel engines remapped for performance will also return a better fuel economy figure as they are working more efficiently . <p> Fuel saving tires also work . They reduce the rolling resistance so you have to expect slightly less grip from them in some conditions but they can knock a few more MPG out of a tank . <p> Petrol additives that help burn off carbon deposits can work really well ! <p> Conversion to LPG fuel usually means a large fuel saving . In the UK LPG duty is substantially lower than petrol . Conversion is relatively simple and providing you have access to LPG fuel and the price of this is low you are in a win/win situation . ( LPG conversions are not necessarily legal in all states/countries and fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more LPG fuel than petrol as it has a lower calorific value but the low price more than offsets this difference . <h> 4 Driving tips <p> Driving style has the single biggest impact on your fuel economy . Changing the way you drive will save fuel . <p> Try to accelerate slowly , avoid braking and allow the car to slow up naturally as you approach junctions and stop signs . Heavy braking and accelerating are the enemy of fuel economy . <p> The amount of fuel used is directly related to how much the accelerator is pushed . You will get around 80% of your engines performance at just 40-50% of throttle at low RPM . Pushing harder just potentially wastes fuel . <p> Avoid stops altogether . If you can keep the car rolling at all times you will save the extra fuel needed to push against inertia . <p> Turn off the engine . Newer cars are fitted with stop start engines that automatically do this in traffic . There is no reason why you ca n't switch off your engine rather than letting it idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fuel consumption . All the little bits of fuel you save will quickly add up over time . <p> Drive more slowly , pushing over the highway speed limits will use significantly more fuel and only make a minor reduction to the journey time . Aim to cruise at 60 mph instead of 80 and see a 20-40% gain in your fuel economy . Driving at 80mph wastes a lot more fuel than you would use at 70 , going at 60 sees a major gain . <p> Avoid short journeys . All short journeys use a lot more fuel than longer ones as fuel is wasted trying to get the engine to warm up . You are better off combining all of your short trips into one day and running a warm engine or better still walk instead of using the car over short distances . <h> 5 Choosing Fuel , Oil and Tires carefully <p> Fuel choice can make a difference to your economy . On most modern engines , particularly performance engines you will get more MPG from the Higher Octane fuels . In most cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving but you 'll also benefit from more power . <p> Converting a petrol car to run on LPG can cut around 33% from your annual fuel costs . The only downside is the cost of the conversion which takes most people 1 year to recoup and having to find a fuel station which sells LPG . <p> Putting low quality oil in can also dramatically increase engine wear . Not all oils are equal , the numbers and ratings of oil only tell part of the story . I have noticed an instant improvement in mpg just by topping up a low oil level to the correct level . <p> Different tires have differing rolling resistance , choose fuel saving tires with a low rolling resistance and the fuel savings will add up over the life of the car . <p> Must you keep a roof rack on the car , the extra drag this creates makes a noticeable difference to your fuel economy . Driving around with open windows at high speed will also create unnecessary drag . <p> This entry was filed under Car @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234 
@@24423746 @4423746/ <h> Fuel systems <p> Much of the engine tuning done by TorqueCars members involves increasing the cars capacity to burn the air and fuel mix , which must be supplied in an exact ratio . <p> Much attention is generally given to the air intake and we have discussed the various aspects of forced induction . <p> We should not overlook the fueling as it is essential to keep the mix right . Power is lost when the engine adjusts itself to stop it running too rich or lean . Many power losses , which manifest themselves as flat spots , at certain points in the rev band can often be traced to a fueling issue . <p> SAFETY NOTE : Manufacturers have started to introduce direct fuel injection in engines . This is where the fuel goes straight into the cylinder rather than being sprayed into the incoming air stream . Diesel engines first used this technology but many car makers are using direct injection on petrol engines in a bid to meet tight emissions standards . These direct injection systems operate at very high pressures and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing more air into an engine you should also match it with more fuel . Otherwise you will be running too lean and will miss out on the potential performance . <h> Components of a fuel system <p> Fuel pump - This is the essential and sucks the fuel from the tank piping it to the injectors . <p> regulator valve - This adjusts the amount of pressure in the fuel system and directly relates to the throttle ( accelerator ) position . More throttle requires more fuel . <p> Injectors - these squirt the fuel as a fine mist allowing it to mix with the intake air charge . <p> Intake manifold - This is where the fuel mixes with the air before entering the cylinders . ( Although manufacturers are now perfecting direct injection where fuel is sprayed directly into the cylinders . <p> Return pipes - Excess fuel is returned to the tank . This process is carefully controlled and ensures that irregular pressure fluctuations do not happen . <h> So what can go wrong ? <p> If the fuel pump is too weak the engine will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumps or larger fuel pumps will help to ensure a good delivery of fuel at the engine . Some cars experience starvation on long bends where the fuel pick up is on one side of the tank . If the tank is running low the fuel will flow to the other side of the tank causing the pickup to run dry . This was noted on some early Subaru Imprezas although most will now have an uprated fuel pick up to address this issue . <p> Regulator valves are not known for their speed or smooth operation , especially when they get old . Fitting an uprated fuel pressure valve will greatly improve throttle response . Owners report a much snappier response when they put their foot down and problems such as surging and hesitancy in traffic are also improved . <p> Some drivers also report more top end power although theoretically the amount of fuel delivered is the same . This could be attributable to the improvement over a standard sticking hesitant fuel valve though . <p> Over time the injectors will clog up . This will reduce their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily with the air . Instead a dribble of fuel is delivered which is then only partially burnt . <p> A fuel injector cleaner used regularly can really help to keep them operating at peak efficiency and TorqueCars fully endorse the BG44k product . Injectors are rated by cc - the amount of fuel they deliver . When substantially increasing engine power it becomes imperative to uprate the injectors . Look to other models in your manufacturers range for suitable uprated parts . A turbo charged 1.6l engine will easily require as much fuel as a naturally aspirated 2.0 engine . <p> Manifold shape is critical . The grooves and bumps on the surface provide more area to aid the evaporation of fuel into the intake charge mixture . For this reason you should avoid the temptation to polish the intake manifold , concentrate instead on the head of the engine and exhaust outlet if you have an overwhelming need to polish something . <p> Return pipes can get clogged up . This can cause all manner of problems in the fueling and generally cause surges and make the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and renewed if they show signs of fatigue . <p> When increasing the fuel pressure the fuel lines are typically the first thing to go . If they are not in perfect condition the extra pressure will highlight the weak spots and cause a leak . Air locks in the fuel lines are very undesirable and pumps can burn out or fuel starvation can happen . Never run a car with fuel injection on empty , the damage and inconvenience caused is really not worth it . <p> It is perfectly fine to polish the inlet manifold UPSTREAM of the injector and it is fine to deburr the manifold downstream of the injector but ensure you do not use a too fine a stone of flapwheel as there needs to be marks similar to a cylinder hone marks to promote better atomizing of the fuel air mix for better moire complete combustion and power 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Next thing to do is a wet compression test ( this was dry ) and then go from there . This involves putting a teaspoon of oil into the cylinder just before the test .

To cope with forced induction you will usually need to decrease the compression ratio of the engine . 38226 @qwx238226 38239 @qwx238239 38231 @qwx238231 38235 @qwx238235 <p> This @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Now as our car use is very less and frequent We do n't  want to invest 5-6L kind of money in new car for now.So I just want to upgrade my maruti 800 so that I can have comfort and peace of mind for atleast next 5 years . Info of my Maruti 800 : - It runs very well on Petrol and LPG ( lavota kit ) on both , odometer shows 96000km , till date no major repair has done to any part of engine.Engine is in good condition ( I mean it runs good and sometimes I drive more than 150km run in one go still no problem like engine jam or overheating , etc , what can you expect from 14 years old engine ) . Now I want to make some modification in it to enhance its performance , suspension etc.So please suggest me some good points to do with engine , tyres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport car and so But I want to make it like original one and little bit smooth ride , which we can do with the help of some minor upgrades or changes . for example I read that FFE and K&amp;N filters can enhance some performance of engine ?

Pls give some point wise ( with brands/type ) suggestions so that I can ask same to mechanic also please suggest any good workshop in Pune which can do this kind of job . Thanks ! <p> Hi and welcome to TC forums . Would n't bother with changing filters on a 3 cylinder 37hp engine , you wo n't gain anything acceptable more noise .

Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basically I want to extend its life for another five years and for that I want to do something to engine for better peace of mind.So that 's what I am asking what should I do , half engine overhaul , engine reboring etc ?

Someone will be along soon no doubt buddy , but I will offer you my advice in the meantime . <p> You say it is used infrequently - so why spend money on it ? You want to modify the suspension yet you want a smooth ride , have a look at Koni FSD dampers for your car model as this may give you the best of both worlds . As to the performance side of the engine , I would just replace your air filter with a performance direct replacement version for your car . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a waste of time and will generate noise only - which some people like . In certain instances and depending on where you fit a cone filter , it can actually remove power from your engine . You could look at tyres with slightly more width and a softer compound rubber " BUT " if you do not keep the tyres properly inflated then this will alter your ride quality , also you will need to be careful of kerbing the wheels as the sidewalls on these tyres will invariably be softer and more prone to damage , especially if your the type who likes to hug the kerb when he parks the car . <p> I would just keep the car regularly serviced and do the modifications that I have suggested .

@@24423756 @4423756/ <h> Tuning boxes review <p> There are tuning boxes and there are boxes ! We must make a distinction between the cheap plug in boxes sold by some sellers on popular auction sites and proper tuning boxes . <p> The cheap ones are very crude in their operation and merely fool the car into throwing more fuel into the engine . This does appear to give more power but over fueling is not a great strategy and can lead to many issues with your engine . <p> At their worst these tuning boxes are just a resistor that alters the air intake signal to the cars ecu . TorqueCars have even heard of sellers posting pictures of tuning boxes which appear to have a chip and circuit board inside but when you open it up you 'll just find a cheap resistor and a few wires ! Be warned and do n't get caught out . <p> A proper tuning box should be thought of as a piggy back ECU . It will have a processor on it and this will access the live readings from the cars sensors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost and fueling . <p> Readings from car sensors are effectively intercepted and then control decisions can be made by the piggy back ECU or tuning box . The more powerful the processor the smoother the power delivery will be . <p> Car makers have to build a very general map taking into account the wide variations of fuel , road conditions and emissions standards of many countries . It makes economic sense to build a very safe generic state of tune that works across all territories . <p> This strategy leaves a very wide margin for tuning companies to work in . Most can offer more power and greater fuel economy without any sacrifice of reliability . It makes sense to service a tuned car more frequently but at the end of the day we all want our cars to work as efficiently as possible . <p> It will need a map stored which reflects the different states of load and be able to trim and adjust the essential engine parameters to suit the current conditions . <p> Not all tuning boxes are the same , beware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be set up on a car specific basis , even different models which use the same engine will have different maps due to variations in weight , gearing and typical use of the car . <p> Quality tuning box companies develop car specific maps on the dyno or live on the car before applying these to tuning boxes . A good quality tuning box can outperform a cheap generic remap . <p> We should note that custom remaps do have a place and if you are serious about performance then a custom map is the route you should take . Where other modifications have been added to a car you really need a specific map tailored to your car . <p> The advantage of tuning boxes is that they can be installed in minutes and updated through the post minimising down time . Your vehicle will not be out of action while you take it to a remap company and you can easily remove the tuning box should the car need to go back to a garage for servicing or repairs . ( A few tuning boxes require a cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most will just plug into the existing wiring . ) <p> By tightly controlling the boost , fueling and timing you can actually make the engine a lot more efficient and smooth out the power delivery . Turbo diesels in particular usually produce better MPG after a tuning box has been fitted and make much higher power gains than petrol counterparts . <p> Good tuning boxes allow a degree of user control over the map used . With the use of micro switches or dials , drivers can select a handful of different setups . This is ideal as you can effectively have one setting for your daily commute and use a more aggressive one at the weekends . <p> Even within a tuning box you have the option to control the state of tune , perhaps you need more low down torque for towing , want the maximum power for a track day or need a good compromise between fuel economy and power for daily use . <p> You 'll also find that some cars run better on different maps due to differences in manufacturing tolerances and wear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to match the driver 's style and personal preferences , again drivers all have different priorities in what they expect from the car . <h> So how can you tell if you are buying a quality tuning box or one of the fakes around ? <p> When buying a tuning box TorqueCars urge you to check the reputation of your supplier carefully . <p> Internet and forum reviews can prove helpful . Be aware that many people regard all tuning boxes as the same thing when in reality there are some that work well and others that are just a complete rip off . <p> Ask yourself are they just resellers or do they make , setup and test the boxes themselves . <p> Do the boxes they sell have a good reputation , is there a money back guarantee ? <p> Are there any rolling road printouts to back up the power gains claimed ? <p> Is the tuning box designed specifically for your make and model of car or is it just a generic one size fits all model . <p> Cheap boxes are often a dead giveaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviews and check the forums for other members who have experience with your chosen tuning box supplier .

The challenge here is to actually improve on perfection . Honda showed us what can be done with their Type R NSX . <p> First off TorqueCars suggest that you fit uprated suspension and lower the car by 15-20mm . Larger drops tend to compromise the ride quality and handling balance . <p> Fitting a front and rear " brace " and fitting stiffer spring and sway to the front will keep the rear tyres firmly planted under heavy cornering .

Do n't forget to uprate the fueling when you are increasing the power - the power gains make the car more thirsty . <p> Change the engine mapping to gain another 10% performance from your modifications . <p> These engines are already in a good state of tune and while not impossible it takes a lot of effort and money to improve the internal components and design of the engine . <p> Uprated injectors will enable you to supply sufficient fuel to the engine . When increasing your fueling you will also need to get a bigger fuel pump to supply it although there is some scope in the OEM NSX fuel pumps to push out more power . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the route to take with engine mods . Larger capacity engines of 3.2 litres were introduced , components were all balanced and the cars under went a weight reduction programme . <h> Honda NSX Intake and Exhaust . <p> The next area for modification is the intake and exhaust . Maximum power gains come from a full induction kit and top quality sports exhaust with a high flowing sports cat . Sports exhausts balance the flow of air through the engine . You 'll need to protect the induction kit from the high underbonnet temperatures . Some owners have used cotton gauze panel filters and reported power gains from these . <p> But if your NSX 's exhaust is too large ( over 3.5 inches bore ) you will generally compromise the performance . The catalyst can be improved , so fit a sports catalyst to improve the top end power and throttle response .

@@24423762 @4423762/ <h> What is the most easily tunable car ? <p> What are the most tunable cars in 2005 ? This is going to be rather subjective and I rule out new cars as most tuners are modding cars that are at least 5-7 years old . <p> This is a question TorqueCars get asked frequently . The answer depends how much you want to spend . <p> If you are after a big power figure and loads of Torque you should really go with something big like a 5 litre V8 engine . <p> There are some practical considerations . You need a fairly hefty piece of metal to bolt an engine of that size to and you will need to strip and rebuild the engine to achieve the mythical power gains . <p> We want a car that we can easily tune up on a Friday night and then stick the family in and go for a weekend away . <p> The 2 most easily tunable cars , maximum power for minimal effort . <p> Most people though are thinking about a strong base engine when , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains in power and torque . We shall examine 2 options , a true sports car and a family ( practical ) car . <p> Some people still need certain practicalities and others just want the fastest car within their budget . The larger the base engine power figure the greater the potential power gain . <p> The answer on this basis has to rest squarely on the no longer produced Toyota Supra Twin Turbo . The standard engine produces sufficient power to out accelerate many supercars and will cost considerably less to run . <p> The main running cost of a Supra is fuel especially if driven hard and then tyres which you will burn through with alarming regularity . Other cars will brake and need constant tweaking to keep them running but a well serviced Toyota will go on for years . <p> The basic engine is very strong and with a larger turbo conversion power figures of 700bhp are quoted without undermining the reliability of the base engine . Many owners settle for less and with a boost controller air filter and sports exhaust system hit figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , and I will admit to being a little biassed here as I own one , is the Audi A3 1.8T . Indeed any car with this popular engine provide a great base from which to tune up from ( the Audi A3 came with the stronger AGU engine with larger exhaust ports ) . <p> So this includes a few offerings from Seat in the guise of the Cupra and Leon and the VW Golf , Passat and Bora and even the Beetle and wide range of models from Audi including the A4 and TT . The engine can be factory tuned to put out 225 bhp with little more than a different turbo and a remap . <p> The majority of these cars come out with 150-180bhp with essentially the same block as the higher powered models . <p> A small outlay of a few hundred will buy a remap which ups the power by another 50-70 bhp . Get a little more adventurous and fit a larger turbo and you will see figures approaching 350bhp on standard engine internals . <p> Although quite different from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Firstly the engine will return up to 37mpg on a run , the service intervals are long and items like spark plugs are good for 40,000 miles . <p> The base vehicle they reside in is commonly produced and ensures a good supply of spare parts to cover any unfortunate mishaps and the re-sale ability is good with a strong demand for any car with this VAG engine fitted . <p> If you do not have a family , do n't mind shelling out for new rubber twice a year , and are not shy the Supra is probably the ultimate choice . But sadly they are getting hard to come by - especially a non imported model which has not been badly modified . If you want one you had better track one down quickly . <p> Already we are getting feedback asking why we did not pick the Skylines , Imprezas or Evos etc .

@@24423763 @4423763/ <h> Corrado Tuning <p> The Corrado could be described as a coupe version of the Jetta but it is really a car in its own right . <p> It was designed purely as a fun car and this is reflected in the engine choices on offer . <p> We start off with the frankly underpowered 1.8 which became a credible engine when it was supercharged in the form of the G60 . <p> There was a 2.0 engine also which did a reasonable job but the 160bhp 1.8 Supercharged engine would still be a better choice for a Corrado tuning project . <p> The top of the range included the VR6 engines which sound absolutely awesome at full throttle . Depending on the country of origin you had a 2.8 or a 2.9 VR6 block to choose from . In VR6 form the engine puts down around 188bhp . <p> The Corrado shows what VW are capable of when it comes to providing a sporty car . <p> Handling is not something a Corrado owner needs to worry about with a fantasticly well sorted suspension package but there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will detail below . <p> Some owners with the 1.8 NASP or 2.0 NASP engines look to do an engine swap to either the 1.8 Supercharged or the VR6 . The latter will give the best power gains from the swap but with further modifcations the supercharged version has a little more to offer . The 1.8T engine is our favourite block so far from VAG and would realy transform the Corrado into a track day stormer , but there is a fair bit of work involved in a swap of this nature . <p> Although the NASP engines are a little lacking in power there are still plenty of modifications that can be done . Getting the head ported and gas flowed is a good starting point . You can also fit large valves and if you have a 3 or 5 angle valve job you will squeeze a little more power and better economy from the engine . <p> Reboring the block is another option and will increase the displacement allowing you to extract every last drop of potential power from the engine . <p> We have even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block . Providing you run low boost and use high octance fuel you should be ok . A turbo conversion requrires a lot of work and whilst not impossible to do the sheer cost and work involved does not make turboing a viable option . <p> Popular Corrado modifications with TorqueCars forum members include breathing mods including an induction kit , fast road cam , FSE boost valve and sports exhaust will increase both the power output and the enjoyment you get from the engine . The fast road cam is one of the most cost effective mods you can do . An induction kit is questionable as far as power gains go but the Corrado engine does sound fantastic with one fitted . <p> Having made the Corrado go faster you should also look at improving the handling and braking . Dropping the car 35mm and fitting stiffer shocks will allow for better cornering without compromising ride quality too much . <p> An anti roll bar will aid cornering and avoid body roll under very hard turns . When it comes to brakes we would suggest fitting bigger discs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorsport ) pad . Vented and grooved and drilled discs are best for the road but if you are into track days we suggest you just get vented discs as these are less prone to warping . <p> There are a number of big brake conversion kits out there and there is also the cheaper option of fitting brakes from a Porsche or the Golf VR6 or R32 providing these fit behind your alloys so check the pcd and clearance before ordering them . <p> Join our other Corrado owners in our forum and swap tuning tips and ideas and keep up to date with their tuning projects . <p> This @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

Expect to pay around -3000 upwards for a turbo conversion . <p> 3 ) Internal engine modificiations are required in pretty much every case as the high compression ratios of a NASP engine will result in detonation . The idea of the internal engine mods are twofold . a ) It strengthens the parts that will be put under stress ( pistons , crank etc ... ) and b ) It will lower the compression ratio allowing for a turbo to compress more air into the cylinders . <p> 4 ) External modifications are required . A turbo requires an oil feed , and needs to be connected to the exhaust and the intake . You will also need a diverter valve on the intake side and a wastegate and controller on the exhaust side . The engine will also need to be remapped or tuned to cope with the very different behaviour of a forced induction engine . <p> 5 ) Forcing more air into an engine also requires more fuel . You will need to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra demand for fuel . <p> 6 ) Higher pressures in the cylinders mean there is more chance of detonation happening . Lowering the compression ratio will allow you to run more boost . We note that direct cylinder fuel injection helps negate the problems of detonation by cooling the intake charge . Water injection systems have also been used to great effect in Turbo charging applications . <p> 7 ) Strengthening the engine is a VERY good precaution . Many cars will happily cope with an extra 30% of power but will start to fail at higher power levels . Forged parts , and uprated oil pump will help as will balancing and cryo treating the block . Forged parts are generally much stronger . Some cars can cope with much higher power level fairly easily , it pays to do your research .

There is nothing stopping you but the money and hassle will just not be worth the power gain you get .

Expect to spend 50 hours upwards on a project of this type .

The only time they 'd investigate is if they really thought you were trying to pull the wool over their eyes . <p> They would n't really need to prove anything as I can not imagine any loss adjuster spending days getting cars professionally examined unless they have a sound case to believe that you 're trying to defraud them . <p> Obviously , if you 're car is modified and you know about it you MUST disclose it to your insurer .

Multi-phase injection is standard in diesel engines now so a box which plays with the pulse width is going to have to differentiate the pilot phase from the primary phase .

I have also had my own mechanic ( known him and trusted him for years ) change the oil and 3 filters just to be on the safe side . fuel economy is not brillant about 50 on a good run expected a bit more but I have only had the car 8 days so hard to say . <p> I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I noticed that taking say , a minute or so after the engine is warm to just take it in first gear and drive it slowly up the revs and do the same on 2nd etc that when you do it again and change gears fast it will pull - an amazing difference . ATM I drive it out slowly in first then bang in 2nd 3rd and its pretty noticable , however i got mine remapped by a garage I know from 90 to 125 and i do recommend you do it because it is deff worth the money if you want power . Other makes of cars seem to have alot better diesl engines , VW , SEAT for example , the 1.9 TDi engines they have seem to be alot better than peugeots . Although with that said the fuel economy from peugeot and citroen alike are superb . <p> DVLA only need to know of a change in information on the logbook such as cylinder capacity . On newer cars that record emissions you need to keep within those tolerances but you must tell your insurers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some tips on how to approach the insurers . <p> Any remap backed with a rolling road at that price is great from where I 'm from , mine was a little more expansive and i did n't  get a rolling road , good job my friend has one though to make sure I got what i paid for It is entirely up to you if you tell the insurer , it is worth thinking about what would happen if you crashed though and your insurance company decided they would n't pay out ! I guess its ok if you go the whole hog providing you do n't go mad everytime you get into the car , otherwise no matter what you do to it you 're going to give the engine problems . <p> It is entirely up to you if you tell the insurer , it is worth thinking about what would happen if you crashed though and your insurance company decided they would n't pay out ! 38230 @qwx238230 <p> The consequences of not informing insurers - invalidated insurance cover . An endorsement on your licence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insurance by deception . No Cover means you could become liable for ALL third party claims ( property and injuries ) and there will be no payment for the repairs to your car . With this on your record it is extremely unlikely that you will obtain reasonable insurance quotations for a period of 10 years ! : shock : <p> Thanks to everyone for all there help regarding all issues and the insurance I think I have read the correct article on the main site ' modified insurance ' <p> A very useful article and this is one of the reasons I was only thinking of getting the car re-mapped slightly short of maximum to 110 bhp because one of my arguments then if the insurers got concerned would be <p> The car is available as 110 bhp as manafactured so what 's the difference between mine and someone elses . Also my model has disc brakes all round could easily handle the extra power without compromising safety at all . <p> My model is the Rapier is that why I have all round disc brakes : ? : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wipers : ? : As I have no manual with the car but am about to buy one soon . <p> Exactly lol , I was too lazy to tell the story though I know of alot of high performance cars were I live currently insured and taxed as standard 1.2 's even though they have 2.0 supercharged beasts roaring in them , God only knows what kind of a stunt you got to pull to get away with that lol . <p> EDIT : Regards to the rain sensitive wipers , on my 206 on the right leaver for wipers , the first notch up from off makes them automatic , if you have a small screen that tells you MPG , AVG SPD , Mileage , miles left on tank , it should come up , Automatic wiping Active . Also ! If you turn your key ( whilst the car is off ) around to 2 notches before ignition , and HOLD the button on the end of the left leaver ( for lights ) auto lights come on , ( based on me thinking 307 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notch is just before the " click " that starts heating the engine . They are highly annoying though because you can only turn them off by stopping the car and turning them off ( I think , never read the manual ) . Hope that helps . <p> On the note of Diesel Turbo 's and remaps there are significant gains to be had . One thing you must remeber is that this new and mproved power figure is ' peak power ' .. And from reading what you have said , it seems like what you are experiencing is turbo lag . I 'm not sure on how much you know at turbo 's , but just incase this is nothing I will explain a few things quickly . <p> ( Skip this is you know how turbo 's work ! ) Turbos are powered by the gasses which leave your engine . The turbo is is attached to the exhuast manifold , all of the gasses which leave your engine pass through here , the turbo utilises the flow rate of these gases , using them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposide side of the tubo housing . The turbo now ' spooling ' will suck air in through the air intake system , creating a boost effect forcing air into the engine . <p> Now the lag part .. This occurs becuase the turbo does not ' spool ' or spin right from the word go . On some engines with large turbo 's ( and large , heavy turbines ) they wo n't reach a decent level of boost until 3k RPM , or even higher . Therefore turbo 's wont improve acceleration low down anyway , infact they have the opposite effect , restricting airflow and reducing the rate of combustion . <p> Although remapping will eliminate lag to certain degree , as you are improving engine efficiency , there is only so much fuel the engine can combust without the nessessary air to combust it with . <p> Diesel turbos are considered to have the best of both worlds .. They combust very little fuel whilst cruising and running no boost , but can shift when the turbo kicks in . <p> I think the re-map is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 110BHP , if you can achieve 125 then do it . It wo n't make a difference to the insurance company . But it is practically undetectable anyway . <p> I think that the real problem is that you are not giving your car enough stick ! Drive turbo 'd cars up high in the powerband and they will respond by giving you what it is you crave , acceleration ! Once you hit the boost hard in first , when you change gears the revs should n't drop too much and the turbo should continue spooling .. Resulting in little lag when you shift up . <p> A few things come to mind could I have a problem with the turbo and is it worth while getting the car diagnosticly tested at my local Pug dealer : ? : <p> Before a throw money on a remap out <p> I cant count my Citreon ZX cus that never had a turbo and that used to shift and it was only 72 bhp if my memory serves me right . <p> But the Rover 400 SDI I had was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this turbo lag problem at all And also the Renault Clio 1.5 dci 65 bhp common rail never had this problem it was quite gutsy really . <p> ( The Renault was bought from a main Renault Dealer makes you wonder does it not : ? : the car was probally set up properley by the servicing department . Once they have sold it they do n't  want you going back every 5 minutes ) <p> I fully understand what you are saying Freddy when you say give the car some welly but at 90bhp should I really need to really poke it or is it quite a heavy car indeed heavier than the Rover 400 which was a solid car as we all know built to Honda standards as it was available as a Civic as well . <p> As you say this is an interesting thread and it will be quite useful when I find the answers hopefully without laying to many shillings out . : ! : <p> Rover 400 SDI I had was a turbo and it was 84 bhp but it never had this turbo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dci 65 bhp 38230 @qwx238230 <p> From memory these engine run on lower compression pistons to help avoid turbo lag . The Clio is very light also so would seem really quick and the Rover 400 was about 1400-1500kgs so still pretty light in diesel terms . Sometimes its down to the gearing as well . <p> I have had some info back regarding the problems I have been having from a re-map specialist . He tells me that the car deffo has a fault on it and not to get it re-mapped as this may actually make it worse . He tells me he has not heard of this fault before on the 90bhp 307 's <p> So interesting that I have booked in to were I bought it a non Pug dealer and I will let there mechanic look at it . After that if no improvement I would rather take it to a Pug dealer and shell out than put up with it running like rubbish . Its doing it in third now as well . <p> But thanks a lot for all your help it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fraud I have just found out that some car mats installed by a previous keeper of my car were limiting the throttle peddle slightly . : ? Not a lot but enougth for me to think my car was having particually bad turbo lag as opposed to mild turbo lag . I have of course removed the offending mats and the car drives much better it does still lag but its a lot more bearable and does not distract from the pleasure of driving the car . : wink : So here 's me thinking my car was crap underpowered and any other name you can think of and all the time it was a silly mat. : twisted : They say every day is a school day they are right . : ! : I am grateful for all the info inputted by other members of this forum thank you everyone . <p> On my old Corolla - we had a new clutch fitted and the hydraulic clutch &amp; pedal was set up with a thick mat and we seemed to suffer from drag with the clutch never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy at the garage spotted the problem - took out the mat and adjusted it up to the correct tolerance ! ! ! <p> Thanks to everyone for all the advice you all gave me regarding my car .

Puts you right off main dealer serviceing unbelievable . : ? <p> At the end of the day you cant beat a local knowledgeable mechanic who actually wants your repeat business . : ! : <p> May report this to Peugeot head office because customers should not get this sort of thing happening what do other members of this message board feel : ? : <p> I tried a couple of Audi dealers before I found a nice one . The first was only interested in me if I was buying a brand new car . I guess that some dealers get complacent - they are the only one in the area so they presume that people have to use them ! I agree wholeheartedly with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would certainly report it to Peugeot - many dealers have incentives and customer service targets to meet .

@@24423775 @4423775/ <h> The Mighty Mito <p> " Mito Tuning " <p> Alfa Romeo have shaken off the old concerns about rust and reliability and have a fine reputation for producing cars that are fun to drive . The Mito is a fairly new concept from Alfa Romeo , a small fun car with cheeky styling . <p> Although the styling is not to everyones taste it is winning a fair few fans . Although the car is percieved as being a bit girly we know many blokes who have bought the car for their partners only to become the main driver of it themselves . <p> So let 's look at the best modifications for the Mito and see what we can improve upon . The range of engines is rather limited with 3 1.4 ( 2 were turbo charged ) units and 2 diesel engines ( 1.3 and 1.6 ) . Thankfully these small engines have been heavily optimized and deliver good power figures . Ideally you want a turbo based engine to tune up as these give much more return than a NASP engine . <p> Before we start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strut brace to help improve the handling . The rear torsion beam suspension is a very clever design with a stiffer setup to the rear . On sharp turns the suspension geometry gives toe out helping the car turn sharper . It takes a bit of getting used to and has been described as a little rubbery but most aftermarket mods will compromise this fine setup so TorqueCars advise you to leave well alone , unless you are seeking a competition setup and have a large budget to spend . The car loses something when the suspension is too hard . <p> The Mito is the stunning chiq car from Alfa Romeo and it is just begging for a little more power . Thankfully this is easy to achieve on the turbo models . <p> The traction control and adaptive suspension setup combined with the electric power steering make the Mito a ground breaking car for Alfa Romeo . If they continue at this pace of development we are sure to see some stunning cars from Alfa Romeo . <h> Mito Engine Tuning . <p> Your aim when tuning should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band . Fast road cams offer one of the biggest performance gains as far as a bolt on part goes . 38241 @qwx238241 38232 @qwx238232 <p> The next area for modification is the intake and exhaust . Stick with a washable perfromacne panel filter rather than a full induction kit . ( If you really do want the sound of a full induction kit then make sure the cone filters gets a good supply of cold air . ) Do not make the mistake of going with the biggest exhaust you can find this will slow up the exhaust flow rate - the best for power gains are usually between 1.5 to 2.0 inches . A sports cat will also free up some power for your Mito to exploit . <p> Getting a professionally flowed head with larger valves can fully release the engines power . Your clutch can begin to let you down so if it starts to slip get an uprated clutch to avoid power losses through the transmission . Remaps offer significant power gains on all turbo charged cars . On NASP engines the benefits are doubtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upto 190hp on a remap with the turbo diesel engines offering gains from 20 to 30bhp . The only downside to a remap is the need for fastidious servicing but most performance car drivers will already be using top quality service items and sticking to the service schedule . <h> Alfa Romeo Mito Wheel modifications . <p> Alloy wheels will help the brakes cool down and are usually lighter than the steel ones . It is worth noting that although they can look cool on the Mito Big alloy wheels will actually decrease your performance . The larger you go the lower your acceleration will be - this is due to the change in your effective final drive ratio . <p> The added weight also affects handling , remember this is unsprung weight and you will usually end up tramlining with large wheels . Although some people have gone larger we would stick to a 17 inch rim size as the maximum anything bigger and you compromise the handling too much in our opinion . 38231 @qwx238231 <p> This entry @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

" <p> If you 've read our diesel tuning article then you probably want to know more about particulate filters . The particulate filter is a stand alone unit . It is located upstream of the cat in the exhaust system and its purpose is to remove soot particles from the gas stream . <p> The cat the proceeds to do its usual job of converting CO to CO2 and is in no way dependent or relied upon by the particulate filter . <p> In diesels the cats are two way devices and run in unregulated mode ( ie. no O2 sensor like a petrol car ) . Petrol cats are 3 way closed loop controlled devices , although the principle is much the same . <p> Diesels are much more efficient that their petrol counterparts and release less CO2 however diesel exhaust fumes are black and sooty which is what the particulate filter attempts to address . <p> What does a particulate filter do and does it affect performance ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalyst to be mixed in with the fuel . This is done automatically each time the filler cap comes off ; the car registers the amount of fuel added and then administers the appropriate does of additive to the fuel tank directly . <p> This additive is stored in a vessel adjacent to the fuel tank and needs periodic refilling , typically every 50,000 miles . PSA vehicles use an additive made by Rhodia Inc ( formerly Rhone-Poulenc ) ; its brand name is Eolys . The additive lowers the burning temperature of carbon so that the soot can be cleaned out of the particle filter periodically . This process is known as regeneration . <p> Regeneration is triggered automatically when pressure sensors either side of the FAP ( particle filter ) register a pressure differential due to partial blocking ( by the soot ) . During this process a number of things happen : <p> 1 . Intercooler is bypassed <p> 2 . Glow plugs turn on <p> 3 . Extra fuel is injected into the combustion chamber during the expansion phase . <p> This creates lots and lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soot is literally burnt away . To my mind it 's the equivalent of a horizontal chimney fire and probably as dangerous as one . <p> The process can be induced manually by a technician who has access to the appropriate diagnostic tools . This is called forced regeneration and can occur with the vehicle stationary in the workshop . In this situation , in addition to the intercooler/plugs/post injection the engine revs itself up to about 4500rpm for up to 40 minutes to burn off the soot . There 's a rumor flying about that this creates so much exhaust heat that it 's been known to burn the workshop 's painted floor . <p> I 'm told that some systems operate without the fuel additive but the principle is much the same . So , no , a particle filter is not a cat . No , you ca n't get a sports one - its job is to primarily filter out larger airborne particles from your exhaust fumes . <p> Technically you can remove it but you 'd have to re-program the ECU to ignore the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home mode with fault lights all over the place . <p> My car is fitted with a FAP , and to my mind it 's technology taken too far . What 's the point of getting rid of a bit of smoke and replacing it with very very carcinogenic cerium compounds ? <p> As far as particulate filters and performance go they 're OK - the Peugeot LE Mans car used them . I am told though that if I removed it from my remapped 406 ( 192 bhp currently ) it would go to nearly 200 ! So to summarize they are a necessary evil . They 're not ideal for performance . <p> But I wonder how much crap mine would belch out without it ? I at least have that warm fuzzy feeling that I am not contributing to the suffering of Asthmatics around the country .

It generated so much heat that plastic cover under the engine started to burn and melt .

I use my car for urban driving mostly , so that could be the part of the problem , there are no high revs and speeds , I was told that could be the reason . <p> I have removed mine on a 320D and it does almost as much as remap to remove the filter also . There are additives you can poor into your tank that burns the soot at low temps directly in the cylinders if you want to feel good about removing it . Dpf is a evil as it states in the article .

Fingers has painstakingly turned a ' normal ' American sport satellite into a General Lee look alike and spent time tuning it up into a drag strip monster . Here is fingers remarkable story . <p> " On 25th July 2005 , after an 18 month long search for a Black 1968 Dodge Charger I accidentally stumbled across this rare beast on eBay , a 1970 Plymouth Sport Satellite . As soon as I saw it I wanted it , and the eBay ad had a link to approx 50 pictures of the bodywork restoration , from this into this : <p> Which made me want it even more ? The car had only been listed for about 20 minutes so I e-mailed the seller to see if he wanted to sell privately before anyone bid on it , he agreed and I picked it up the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it a good going over to see if I had bought a 35 year old car that 's seen a hard 35 years and was pleasantly surprised . <p> The body shell is good and very solid . The only welding that has been done is a patch in the boot floor and to the lower rear quarters , which were standard places for these cars to corrode . <p> The 5.2liter V8 engine starts and runs like a dream from cold with no choke with two pumps of the throttle and a flick of the key ( and makes the most awesome noise ) . <p> The original single exit exhaust was removed some time ago and replace with a dual system with two very small ( almost not worth having ) cherry bomb type silencers . The standard 2barrel carburetor had been removed and replace with a 600cfm 4barrel Holley carburetor with vacuum operated secondary throttles . This was fitted via an adaptor plate allowing the 4bbl carb to be bolted to a 2bbl intake manifold . While this setup worked to a certain degree it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 5 minutes it would over fuel and flood itself . I remedied this by asking Father Christmas for an Edelbrock ( Webers American division ) Street performer 4bbl Intake manifold . That was fitted last Boxing day and made an impressive difference . <p> The gearbox is a 3 speed auto and it functions perfectly . Well almost . Every month or so after the car has been standing for a day or two , it decides to spit most of its gear oil out over my drive and I have no idea why ? <p> The car pays for itself - school proms are fantastic because I 'm getting paid to show off ! <p> The rear axle has been changed at some point from a 7.25inch axle to a stronger 8.25inch unit . This currently has excessive amounts of end play ( you can slide the drive shafts approx 0.25 of an inch in and out of the axle casing without undoing anything ) and requires a rebuild or replacing . I will probably replace with an even stronger 8.75inch unit so I can give it even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car when I bought it were horrible , ugly pepper pot looking type things that I think really did not suit the car : <p> So I again embarked on a major search on eBay for some wheels . This came to an end when I found some American Racing Vector wheels that were new old stock and had been sitting in a store room for years . These cost me far too much money but they are quite rare and havent been made since 1997 so I paid it . I think you 'll agree , they look so much better <p> The next thing I had to do was raise the rear end by 3-4 inches due to the new rear tyres . I had gone from 205/60R15 to 265/50R15 and there was a little bit of a clearance problem ( must remember to check that in future ) . <p> This was around the time " the Dukes " film was released and I have my own Wedding Car Hire business ( contact me via the TorqueCars forum for more details ) so I stickered the Satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company name and contact details in the rear window to get the business some attention . ( That was the excuse anyway , it seemed like a really good laugh and just had to be done ) After a couple of weeks I started to think about peeling the stickers off ( as I had had my fun and its not a dodge charger ) when the phone rang with a booking for the " General " . I explained it was the wrong car but they did n't  care . Since then jobs have been coming in enough for the car to pay for its own upkeep so the stickers stayed . School proms are awesome in this thing , I get paid to show off . <p> When I bought Near Lee I did think about keeping him for a while and changing to the Charger that I wanted , but have since changed my mind because . a ) This car is simply too good to get rid of . b ) At recent shows I have noticed how common 68-70 Chargers are , they are everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plymouth Sport Satellite in the country , so it is very rare indeed . <p> In July I ran " Near Lee " down the quarter mile as Santa pod , with a best time of 16.7sec. , at 81mph . For a 2.5 tonne car with a fairly standard engine I was quite impressed . But unfortunately while I was there I contracted the fatal " Quarter Mile Bug " . This is a condition that leaves you with a craving for more power and lower times , and sadly has no cure . The symptoms are starting to show already . I have already removed the heavy mechanical radiator fan and replaced it with two electrical ones . And I also have a Competition Camshaft , Valve Springs , Retainers , Timing Gear , Four Branch Exhaust Manifolds or " Headers " , a spare pair of rear wheels fitted with Hoosier Quick Time racing tyres and some shiny rocker covers waiting to be fitted . <p> If anyone is tempted to buy a yank do n't  be put off by all the " expensive to run " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're all rubbish . Parts for this car are easier to find , are more readily available and most are cheaper ( even when they come from the US and I have to pay the dreaded Import Duty ) than parts for most of my UK cars , and I also find that parts coming from the US get to me quicker ( figure that one out ) . And as for poor fuel consumption , yes the huge 7 litre monsters are going to do gallons to the mile , but my 5.2 will return 20-25mpg if you drive it sensibly . If you drive it like you stole it you get about 10-12mpg but my god its good fun , and that 10-12mpg is worth it just for the noise . Tax is free and even though I have only had my licence back from a ban since 24/06/05 , the insurance is about 200 a year fully comp ( full European cover with breakdown and public display cover ) . <p> Over the winter I am pulling the engine out to fit the performance parts I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit a High Capacity Oil Pump while I 'm there .

The other problem is that the 2.2 HDi ( engine DW12TED4 ) did not sell in big numbers , so finding one is likely to be a problem . <p> my advice is also to get bigger turbo , biger injections , biger fuel pupm , intercooler ... u could also install full exast system and after all do a remap to use max from your mods .... after all ull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigsmile : <p> tbh mate fitting a newer engine would be better . much more techology has meant that diesels do have oomph without all the smoke you would get with fitting a huge turbo and injecting the diesel in until its up to boost . <p> Even if you can get enough fuel in you will not be able to burn it all . High pressure diesel engines have outrageous injection pressures . The old design indirect cars use about 30-40 bar , Current HDi systems are upwards of 1900 Bar . <p> Yeah I know , however some parts can be interchanged , I know a chap who used a set of HDi rods in his xud engine and i know the gearboxes can be interchanged , just not on the 2.2 that 's a completely new design where as the first hdi 's are loosely based on the xud 's <p> I can imagin , also some to mention that the stdci mondeo engine is the same I believe all be it in a higher standard tune about 150 hp I think , but I do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also something to note as well I would get some forged rods out of a 2.0 hdi for this and rebuild trust me it will be worth the effort I 've seen plenty of people who have blowen holes in there block because of the power , the hdi rods and good for up to 230 hp and I doubt you would get that much <p> While we are on the subject paul , I 've been trawling auto trader and you can get 2.2 hdi 406 's for -1500--2000 ! ! not top spec though but they do n't need to be , buying a whole 406 with engine would be ideal to do this conversion due to the fact I know of only one other person who has done it wo n't share the details Sounds extremely temping to me now , <p> As far as I know they only did it in GTX and Executive trim until the SE model came on the scene . All have full electric adjust front seats , Harman Kardon/JBL audio , auto wipers , auto lights , auto mirror dippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 406s bloated bodyweight . They are very durable and protective in collisions as well . <p> If you can get one for -1500 make absolutely certain the engine is sound . <p> The engine should pull very strongly in all gears and rev cleanly to 5000+ RPM . There should be almost no discernible lag or latency . <p> There should be no smoke at all from the exhaust since all 2.2 HDi models have a particle filter . <p> No warning lights should be showing during normal operation . Also no messages on the cental MFD . <p> During general driving the engine should be silky smooth and very hushed indeed with no vibration at all . Any vibration is indicative of a failing dual mass flywheel . These are expensive . 
@@24423780 @4423780/ <p> So what changed my mind ? I think it is the arrival of the paddle shift and dual clutch super fast super quick 6 speed auto boxes . <p> A modern automatic is better than one driven manually for fuel economy and performance when in the hands of the average driver , and it 's probably fair to say the performance would be better under a modern autobox for most drivers . <p> I went automatic in 1998 with a Nissan UK supplied 1997 2.0i Nissan Primera . This was a four speed effort but it had torque converter lockup which meant that at main road speeds there was not ATF churning . I 'd driven many automatic cars previously - some appealed , some did n't . Latterly I had the 528i with the ZF Steptronic box . I like automatics but I am quite happy to drive either auto or manual . There 's more differences between cars than the transmission mechanism . Kind of like saying that you do n't like diesel cars . Like saying that because you do n't like sashimi/sushi tuna means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my 1st auto and it is great in congested stop start conditions but I only went with the auto box after reading about the short lifespan of the manual clutch and the DMF along with the repair costs . HI has a manual license but loves her automatic . <p> Just got back into an auto after 4 years and I 'd never go back now . It " s an old fashioned slushbox but the changes are smooth . The Alfa I test drove had an twin clutch auto which was lovely , seamless changea . <p> They 've been good for years now . It 's very silly people who state that there 's less control than with a manual . They boat steer and pan the wheel . As if that is control . I can go happily from one car to another and another still without concern . Manual/auto , petrol/diesel. 300bhp to 60bhp . Not that hard at all . I know that my driving preference is cars with usable and accessible performance . The transmission is very secondary . <p> I personally prefer manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to laid back . My attention to the road became less because all I did was stick it in drive and on occasions neutral . I did n't like this ! I prefer using my gears to how I want to drive not how the gearbox dictates . <p> my daily drive is a caldina GT Four . According to the toyota spec sheet it is supposed to have a super intelligent tiptronic gearbox which only the n spec has . I do n't  know what it is supposed to do but it is extremely good and very smooth with quick changes . So yes its very very good . That is until driven close or near to its limit then you do notice its not a manual . Mind you with 300bhp , awd , torsen diffs and 3 way adjustable suspension ( all standard ) that limit is higher than most cars .

BMW 335 engines are one of the best around to work on making it a good tuning project and with carefully picked performance modifications you can substantially maximize your driving experience at little cost . The 335 diesel engine when remapped gives the M models a real run for their money and offers greater fuel economy . <p> The 335 is popular among our members for tuning projects The key to 335 tuning is getting the right mods - a lot of money can be wasted if you do it wrong . <p> Many 335 owners uprate the handling of their cars as a priority , this will certainly increase your enjoyment of the car . M series suspension parts and upgrades are suitable and offer an easy upgrade path . The diesel engine is heavier so you 'll need to take this into account when setting up the suspension geometry . Drop the car by as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need other modifications in most instances . <p> Turning our attention to the 335 engine we need to get a bit more power out of the top end . <p> Keep it looking standard and remove the badges creating a sleeper ! 38238 @qwx238238 <h> Engine tuning mods . <p> The following modifications are usually performed by our members , decide how far you wish to go in your tuning project before you begin . <p> Without a doubt the best mod is a remap or piggy back ecu upgrade . Power gains of 60bhp are available . Oil coolers are recommend if you get an agressive map . Turbo upgrades push these power gains into the 120bhp region , but for reliability we would suggest you settle for a maximum of 100bhp gain , on stock internals and injectors . <p> Getting the correct grade of mods for your planned usage of the car is essential . Stage 3 ( competition ) mods just do n't work well on the road hard to control in slow traffic . <p> Your aim when modding the engine should be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to be at the top end unless you are creating a motorsport car . The whole point of this article is to give a little insight into the world of car tuning mods and point you in the right direction , our forum is best place to go if you need more detailed advice and tips on your project and all aspects of modding cars . <p> More power needs more fuel . Using high Cetane diesel is another option if you find you are suffering from detonation or premature ignition on your BMW project after fitting other mods . Uprated injectors will enable you to supply sufficient fuel to the engine . Uprate the fuel pump to cope with the extra fuel requirements of your tuned 335 uprated injectors. 38228 @qwx238228 <p> The next area for modification is the intake and exhaust .

If you have heavily modified your engine and it 's need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer and will help remove this restriction <p> Sports exhausts can help balance the flow of air through the engine . The standard 335 exhausts flow really well and do not need upgrading , DPF and catalysts can be removed for off road use and will allow the turbo to spool up more quickly or a high flowing performance alternative added for road legal use . <p> Airflow through the head can be dramatically increased with some professional head porting and polishing . These should match and be setup to take into account any other engine mods . Your clutch can seriously let you down if it starts to fail and the standard clutches are only ever good for power gains of upto 40% . Fit a sports clutch to avoid power leak through the transmission . 38226 @qwx238226 <p> Due to the fact that alloys are less heavy they improve performance and they can help to cool the brake disks .

I 've been advised that as long as you can not see the tubes from under the body kit , its fine . I 've also been told that every colour except blue is ok , as this is used for emergency vehicles . PLEASE help ! <p> Neon undercar kits are not illegal , so long as they follow a couple rules . <p> They must not flash , rotate etc . Any direct light source ( i.e. the bulbs or tubes ) must not be seen , only the glow can be visable Only white lights on the front of the car Only red lights on the rear of the car Only orange/amber lights on the sides of a car <p> There is no written law prohibiting the installation and use of under car neon lights , so long as they follow the few simple rules i mentioned earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They can be flashing or whatever when your not in motion off the road ; but whilst on the road , they must be a solid glow ( no light ) . <p> Only white lights can be used on the front of the car , red on the back and amber/orange on the side , this is true . Only these colour lights can be shown on the car whilst in motion on the public highway . For example , the small windscreen lights ( the ones you attatch to your windscreen wipers ) are illegal because they are a blue LED light that is visible from the front of the car . <p> under cars neaons are completly illeagle . shows only the rule book states that if the glow is seen not the bulb and there 's no flashing or strobing then ok but police can now do you for miss use of light bulbs so i recomend not bothering on the highway . you 'll just get grief <p> If you say " under cars neaons are completly illeagle " then say that " if the glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strobing then ok " it does n't  make sense . That 's basically what i just said <p> I 've been informed from reliable police source that under car neon lights are not illegal so long as they follow the rules on no flashing , or no direct light visable . Of course , installing and using neons on the highway will attrack police attention , as well as other road users ' attention , but it is not illegal as there is no written law prohibiting them . Some states in America however , do prohibit the use of them . <p> The police can not hand out a fine or penalty for using them ( so long as your county/state allows neons ) but they can request for you to switch them off . After being asked to turn them off and you not doing so , will result in a penalty of some form . <p> There is a massive controversy over neon lights , and i am not certain of the law covering all of the UK . However , i have driven past police before at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what so ever . <p> daaft i 'm not here to pic a silly argument with you . there 's no real do or do n't  in the mot law but the police have a different rule book i have had various neon sets when they were deamed cool and some officers do n't  mind some do and some know the rules went to court and had a hefty fine do what ya want i got charged for miss use of light bulbs and payed the price even have the document to state there illeagle but if your police officer says there not he obviously does n't  know the law and what he s preaching .... <p> your choice .. <p> only lights allowed on a vehicle is white or yellow front depends on european law red on the rear amber front rear and side for indication . or marker lights depending on length of vehicle <p> If it 's unlawful for the light source , reflection of it whether called a glow or something else then why bother fitting them ? Unless it 's for off road or show use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights . They are not road legal .

Stick to 1.2 to 1.5 inches for best results . <p> Head work including a polish and port and 3 or 5 angle valve job will really help to release the potential of the engine . A good fast road power clutch will help to keep that power going where it should . Never skimp or expect a standard clutch to cope . NASP engines do not achieve big power gains if you remap them , unless you have done extensive modifications . <p> Adding forced induction will see big power gains but this is usually too expensive to be cost effective .

There are some Lupo supercharger kits around but TorqueCars have yet to meet anyone who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please drop into our forum and tell us about it . <p> With a turbo the boost curve is related exponentially to the engine speed making it hard to map .

Decreasing the engines compression ratio will allow you to add forced induction , water injection may also help prevent detonation . <h> Lupo Wheel modifications . <p> Alloy wheels will help the brakes cool down and are usually lighter than the steel ones . The downside to large alloy wheels on your Lupo is that you alter your effective final drive ratio and this will have a detrimental effect on acceleration and performance . Although some people have gone larger we would stick to a 15 inch rim size as the maximum and shoe the wheels with low profile tyres keeping the same rolling diameter as standard . <p> We would also strongly recommend a Lupo brake upgrade , making the car go faster is one thing but it is equally , if not more , important to make it stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable upgrades or get a big brake upgrade kit from your Lupo performance parts supplier . <p> For more information on Tuning your car please feel free to join us in our very friendly forumwhere you can discuss Lupo options in more detail with members .

You will need to ensure that the engine is not starved of fuel so will need to uprate the fueling . <p> Improve your cars response to the throttle with a Fuel pressure boost valve . To get sufficient fuel you may need to uprate the injectors on your engine . When increasing your fueling you will also need to get a bigger fuel pump to supply it . <h> Mitsubishi Carisma Intake and Exhaust . <p> Breathing mods are usually next up . For small Carisma engine sizes go with a washable panel air filter . But if your exhaust is too larger ( over 2.5 inches bore ) you will lose back pressure on most engines . <p> When you start tuning your Carisma you will find that the standard clutch starts to complain so get an uprated clutch . NASP engines do not achieve big power gains if you remap them but with turbo engines this is another story . <p> Decreasing the engines compression ratio will allow you to add forced induction , water injection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more expensive than an engine swap . <h> Mitsubishi Carisma Wheel modifications . <p> Alloy wheels will help the brakes cool down and are usually lighter than the steel ones . It is worth noting that although they can look cool on the Carisma Big alloy wheels will actually decrease your performance . <p> The larger you go the lower you top speed will be due to the change in your effective final drive ratio . For this reason we would advise sticking to a maximum wheel size of 17 inches , although we know some of our members have gone larger than this with no issues arising . <p> Please join us in our forumto discuss the Carisma options in more detail with our Carisma owners .

@@24423801 @4423801/ <p> I would start by replacing your air filter with a performance panel version , so that the car will breath better . Your factory filter comes out and the performance panel filter drops in . Change your exhaust system to something a little more free flowing as the standard system is quite restrictive . After you have done this , then seek out a reliable tuner in your country who can remap your ECU to release even more power ! Good Luck <p> I 've not got round to a detailed article on the 1.4TFSI - it 's just a question of it getting old enough for the weak spots to show . <p> Is it the twin charged version ? If so a remap is the one top mod for it . An overdrive pulley can be added to drive the supercharger harder and give more low down power . <p> The best mods for a car engine are as follows . Internal work yields the biggest gains , head work like porting polishing and 3 angle valve jobs will maximise the airflow and raise the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then cryo treat the block , get it rebored and look into blueprinting and balancing as well . <p> Bigger valves are an obvious addon but not all engines are suitable as it depends how close together the OEM valves are . <p> A fast road cam will yield good power gains , especially in the top end of the rev range . Do n't go mad though a profile of up to 270 degrees will give the best gains without the engine becoming cammy . <p> The most popular power mods are induction kits ( which are questionable as power mods but they can sound nice if that is your sort of thing ) and sports exhausts with sports catalysts or decats . <p> To keep the car legal I 'd recommend a sports catalyst rather than a decat . The last mod should always be a remap as this will allow you to fully realise the power gains on offer from your mods . Turbo cars respond very well to remaps . <p> It 's worth having a read of the articles on **26;252;TOOLONG for more information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just joined the site today after using the excellent mpg calculator . I thought that my 2010 1.4s Golf , ( which I purchased last month ) , was heavy on the petrol . Turned out that I was getting 47.36 mpg which I am very pleased with . However , I think in hindsight , I should have opted for either a diesel , ( cover 200 miles per week ) , or 1.4tsi , which has a much higher bhp . My 80bhp seems to lack oomph ! I was interested in this term remapping and wonder if anyone can kindly answer the following : - 1 . What exactly is remapping ? 2 . Is it expensive and can a competent garage mechanic carry this out ? 3 . Would it wildly affect my mpg ? Please excuse my ignorance but basically , I suppose , I want to know the implications of such a procedure and while I really like everything about the car , I would like to have a little more confidence when I overtake . Many thanks in advance , for taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our TorqueCars Forum my Friend ! Good to have you along with us <p> To answer your questions as simply as possible : <p> 1 ) Remapping is where a skilled practitioner of the black arts explores your car ECU via a special software on a laptop or PC and makes adjustments to the fuel , air delivery , timing , advance or retard the ignition amongst other things to help increase performance and fuel economy . Note : if you have performance and fuel economy tweaked then the performance gains will not be as great as outright performance tuning alone . <p> 2 ) Expensive depends on who and what facilities the chosen tuning company uses i.e. laptop adjustment alone with tried and tested maps , live mapping on the road , or live mapping done on a rolling road . Prices vary between mates rates -50/60 up to and sometimes beyond -500 . There are companies on TC here who are bonafide traders who will be able to do the job for you . They will advise you what is and is not possible with your car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package , so you will have to ask if they do custom or at least what you can expect from the service that they provide . <p> 3 ) It will only wildly effect your MPG if your car setup is rubbish or in serious need of a service . This fact will only be revealed once the tuners have plugged into your car to discover what it is actually developing . You can not get huge miles to the gallon and Ferrari performance as well , so strike this Wizard of Oz thought from your dreams ! <p> Note : If you go to have your car remapped then there are some limitations on cars with engines as small as yours ! No offence buddy ! Speak to the tuners first and see what they have to say , if they can help you then help them by having your car fully serviced first - oil &amp; oil filter , air filter , spark plugs etc . If your car is not in tip top condition then you can not expect miracles to be performed on your engine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Thanks T9 man for that very detailed and enlightening reply . I realize now that because I have more or less the basic bog standard 1.4 model , there is very little to play with and any gains through remapping would be minimal . The car was fully serviced before I purchased it last month so it should be running at optimum efficiency . I think I will leave well enough alone and sell it in a couple of years time . It still is a nice car to drive . 
@@24423802 @4423802/ <p> Not sure whether there actually is 2 intercoolers ( ca n't see it tbh ) . However assuming there are 2 , one big FMIC would probably be slightly more beneficial because of better placement moreso than changing from two smaller ones to one large one ( I 'm assuming that the FMIC is the same size as the two smaller ones together ) . <p> A larger surface area and capacity would be better for power full stop up to a point . Too big and the pressure drop would cause extra lag . <p> A fmic is essential if your planning a remap with high boost , if you have a remap without a fmic , then after an hour or so of driving , or minutes on a boiling hot day heat soak would cause it to fall to its original bhp . So the fmic will give you your engines real power throught out the day , not ju8st in the monring or first hour of driving .

I do n't  see how inlet temps of 70 degrees is good . I 'd much rather have 35 maximum degrees .

Why wouldnt A3 owners just buy a s3 fmic , becuase the pipeworks completely different , becuase the s3 has 2 intercoolers plumbed in . <p> And if i 'm running highboost on a k03s at 24 psi , its going to get very hot indeed . <p> y I 'll tell you what a waste of money for a k03 k03s and even a k04 , a " sports exhaust " 38230 @qwx238230 <p> got to disagree on that ive had mine on just over a week and notice a difference in throttle response and car feels more torquey lower down . also the turbo seems to spool alot faster . larger downpipe is supposed to be the way to go . <p> suppose having the intake enlarged helps as well see the difference in pics <p> Yer i know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things a bit more responsive but for the money it costs , full turbo back system , i was quoted -600 , there 's been a few people on the other forum that had a dyno before and after , with no gains atall , more resposnesive , but no gains what so ever . And for about a grand for a milltech , rather get suspesion . <p> All the larger this larger that only really makes a big difference in big turbo upgrades or other 300bhp , That turbo i was quoted they said you do n't  need a turbo back exhaust , the a3 downpipe is restrictive apperently though . At like 1.2 bar , a 2.5 inch hole is plenty big enough to get it out . <p> For a start an FMIC is no more efficient than a SMIC of the same volume and surface area if it 's not getting greater air flow . <p> Heatsoak will still build up at idle ; sitting in traffic for example . Then everything i cooled down as you start to move again and air passes through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decent headwork is just as important as an efficient intercooler for performance and minimising heatsoak . If you ca n't get the exhaust gases out fast enough the heat energy will build up around the head impaticular . This will also have a negative effect on turbo spool . <p> Also 24psi seems like far too much on a KO3s to me . There comes a point where you 're running beyond a turbos peak efficiency and just increasing inlet temps without actually gaining any power . Be very surprised if it holds that beyond a boost spike . <p> Is n't part of the point being that a SMIC is never going to be as big as a FMIC . The front mount allows you to have a bigger surface area . <p> Heat from the compression of air inside the turbo , is IMHO , still a larger cause of inlet heat gain than any heatsoak will ever be . Especially considering the Audis take cold air from the front wing , away from the engine bay . <p> This has turned out to be a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has certainly given me food for thought . <p> the heat soak is caused by the hot air passing through it . not the heat from around the bay . <p> problem with fitting a large front mount that is that you need to cut back the crash bar alot - not the best idea when this is all that holds the front together in the main . even with a small one some cutting back is required <p> the only real issue with the SMIC is the fact that the air can get to it without much problem however it cant get back out as easy . this is why so many ether fit the S3 or TT vent in the arch liner - this allows the air to pass through much easier . <p> the heat soak is caused by the hot air passing through it . not the heat from around the bay . <p> problem with fitting a large front mount that is that you need to cut back the crash bar alot - not the best idea when this is all that holds the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one some cutting back is required <p> the only real issue with the SMIC is the fact that the air can get to it without much problem however it cant get back out as easy . this is why so many ether fit the S3 or TT vent in the arch liner - this allows the air to pass through much easier . 38230 @qwx238230 <p> The smic themselves will get warm from raditation from within the engine bay . The engine bay is boiling in the audi turbo cars , so if the smic is hot then the air passing through it will get hot , but the cold air coming in does cool it down , but not enough for it to be completly hear soak free , ive heard loads of people on the other forum praising front mounted intercoolers . And yer much more air is going to hit it as its much bigger , and the front grilles are bigger . I can with ease notice heat soak in my car , after a long drive or a boiling hot day . Feels so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 've got a spare -500 going , or -200 depends what one you get , but as someone said earlier , you wants a fmic with both pipes on the same size , to reduce the lag . Not needed for a standard car , but what 's the point in gettinhg a remap done and not being able to use the added , all day long . Even on RR they show the intake temps and sometimes get a short of there stated bhp because they had a long drive to the RR and heat soak kicked in . <p> You can never completely remove heatsoak and unless you use a chargecooler and ice as per drag racers your temps will never be lower than ambient so your car will still be more responsive on a cold morning than a warm afternoon . <p> I was n't referring to a " safe " limit for the Ko3s . If you want to run 24psi that 's a pointless turbo to do it on . All you need to do is look at the maps for it to know this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RS and do it properly instead of working a small turbo too hard . <p> If your running the k03s on what mappers do it to a generic then they give torque figures of 230lb , with a custom and running high boost , probally 23 , 1 psi more than the unwritten safe zone for the k03s , itll give you 270lb torque , that 's a double the amount . <p> And yer but if the air from the engine gets cooled down more before it goes into the turbo then the car will be more responsive . 40 degrees difference is a lot ,

The look is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited to a car in a scrap yard . The tell tale sign is the sound of a well tuned engine and loud exhaust . <p> Tricked out - A car with plenty of gadgets and mainly visual upgrades including scissor , Lambo , suicide or gullwing door conversion . Motorised doors and boot/trunk . Split folding hood/bonnet . Hydraulics to electronically alter the cars height and even can cause it to jump off the ground . <p> Lowriders ( Southern California area ) very very low to the ground typically large American cars . These are usually equipped with trick hydraulic suspension . <p> Old Skool - Classic car from the late 70 's to early 90 's that has received a modern makeover . Engines are often swapped out for more modern and powerful ones and other modern parts are added such as fuel injection and ABS braking . <p> Classic - A fully restored pre 1980 car which has been put back to the condition it would have left the factory in . These when done right create a car that still looks and drives today like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sleeper - Standard looking car which has had extensive performance upgrades or a car which is a high performance model which has been made to look like a standard , normal production non performance car . <p> Tuned - This is typically a powerful car with modifications primarily added for performance reasons . Spoilers , splitters and chrome are also used in moderation with the aim being to enhance the OEM look and feel of the car . This style is similar in aims to the sleeper but the owner wants to add a little subtle personalisation to his car . <p> Jap - Anything Japanese with Japanese styling parts falls into this category . If you are a true Jap fan then you will hate to see a Japanese car styled as a euro look .

@@24423805 @4423805/ <p> Hi and welcome to TorqueCars . Anything is possible the question is though is it economically viable . <p> To run a turbo on the 1.6 passat you will either have to run a low boost or lower the compression ratio of the engine . Option 1 means little gain from the turbo and option 2 means a lot of expenditure . <p> The turbo needs to be plummed into the exhaust and intake side so you will need custom manifold you will also need a supply of oil to the turbo to help with cooling and lubrication . <p> The cost of a good turbo conversion kit ( if available for the passat ) would be in the region of -3000--4000 . For this money you could source a cheap VR6 engine and drop that in and still have a couple of grand to spare .

Exhaust selection should take into account the flow rate , rather than just the bore size , too small and you have a restriction , too big and the flow rate will dimish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausts for details of the issue around large bore exhausts and how to choose the right size for your engine . <p> Gas flowing the head will allow you to maximise your air/fuel charge . Leave this to a professional though with a proper flow bench and machine tools A good fast road power clutch will help to keep that power going where it should . Never just hope that a standard worn clutch will cope . <p> The largest power gains for NASP engines usually involve the addition of forced induction . It is easier to bolt on a supercharger than it is to get a turbo working . Turbos give boost in exponential proportion to increasing engine speed and this can make remapping difficult . The nice steady boost to rpm characteristics of the supercharger make them easier to map . Adding forced induction will usually require a lower compression ratio or water injection . <p> It is worth noting that the Rover MEMS can not be easily remapped so to get a custom map installed you 'll need an aftermarket ECU or a chip upgrade .

@@24423808 @4423808/ <h> The best car tuning modifications for the 9-5 . <p> Engine choices for the tuner include the TiD engined model - yes a diesel engine . More on that later . <p> The 2.3 HOT , which stands for High Output Turbo , really is a hot hatch running the 0-60 sprint in 6.9 seconds ! <p> Power starts at 230bhp and this can be raised to 290bhp with a remap , sports exhaust with sports catalyst and air filter ( a more conservative remap is usually better and will retain reliability , driveability and economy . ) Without the exhaust and sports cat this power figure will be nearer to 275bhp on a more modest remap . <p> The power gains on the Diesel engines start to make petrol ownership irrelevant . Hence the HOT model . <p> Then there is the 3.0t V6 engine ( pre 2001 ) after 2001 the 3.0t v6 was noticeably slower and less economical ! It is not easy locating performance parts or remaps for the 3.0t so it is not ideal for a tuning project - especially when the lineup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx238241 38232 @qwx238232 <p> Superb braking is standard across the range with the ABS , Handling would need some attention so uprated springs and dampers will dramatically improve handling . <p> The 2.2TiD offers 120bhp in standard form but a remap can lift this to an impressive 160bhp . One of the best value mods around has to be a remap for a modern diesel . It is worth noting that the recent 52 plate model can not be remapped so earlier cars are better . <p> The 1.9 TiD offers 150bhp in standard from and this can be remapped to 190bhp . <p> The 2.0 V6 TiD starts at 166bhp and with a remap will produce around 217bhp . <h> Saab 9-5 intake and exhaust modifications . <p> Before you start doing engine mods you have to get the breathing right and remove any restrictions in the system that could inhibit air flow.Derestricting the airflow into the engine is the primary part of tuning so get a better flowing air filter . Induction kits sound great with the induction roar they create but due to the warm air in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually rob you of power . ( The standard 9-5 airbox is NOT RESTRICTIVE unless you have achieved a massive power hike ! Panel filters are all you need performance wise . ) <p> A good high performance sports exhaust is an essential to balance your engines need for free flowing air , just adding an induction kit on it 's own will do little to increase your power . See our article on performance exhausts for details of the issue around large bore exhausts and how to choose the right size for your engine . <p> Gas flowing the head will allow you to maximise your air/fuel charge but TorqueCars suggest you refer this job to a professional though who has a proper flow bench and machine tools Your 9-5 clutch can sap a lot of your power if it starts to slip and the standard clutches are only ever good for power gains of up to 40 or 50% . Fit a performance clutch ( double or triple plate ) to avoid power losses through the transmission if the clutch does start to slip after a performance mod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . <p> On NASP engines the benefits are doubtful . However a remap on a NASP engine will help unleash the potential if you have done a lot of mods . Adding forced induction will see big power gains but this is usually too expensive to be cost effective . It is easier to bolt on a supercharger than it is to get a turbo working . With a turbo the boost curve is related exponentially to the engine speed making it hard to map . It is easier to map a supercharger because the boost is proportional to engine speed on a linear curve . Adding forced induction will usually require a lower compression ratio or water injection . <h> Saab 9-5 Wheel modifications . <p> Alloy wheels will help the brakes cool down and are usually lighter than the steel ones . The downside to large alloy wheels on your 9-5 is that you alter your effective final drive ratio and this will have a detrimental effect on acceleration and performance .

@@24423809 @4423809/ <h> Boxster Tuning <p> " BOXterING Clever " <p> Although the 911 has the top end power and prestige , TorqueCars was surprised at the cornering abilities of the Boxster . <p> It is beautifully balanced and poised and is probably a better car than the 911 if it was going to be your daily driver . It is much easier to live with and considerably more forgiving than a 911 when pushed hard . <p> When it was released it was unfairly hailed as a poor mans 911 , or the sensible sports car . <p> To be fair it is a stunning package and more accessible to the average driver than more exotic specialist cars . <p> With the right mods a Boxster can give a 911 a serious run for your money ! <p> Running costs are lower than a 911 and you will still get many smiles per gallon from it . <p> This is mainly due to the fact it has a mid mounted engine offering a near perfect balance , where the 911 engine is at the rear . On a short twisty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boxster would do more than just hold its own . <p> In fact we would go so far as to say the only thing lacking in the Boxster is power , although there is certainly enough in the standard car to make it fun . With a bit of clever Boxster tuning you can create the perfect car . <h> Engine tuning <p> The engines are very solid and reliable performers and Porsche have done a good job in tuning them . Some of the pre 2000 engines were prone to cylinder liner failure but this is a problem addressed in newer engines and most of the early ones have now been fixed or have stood the test of time . In fact the manufacturing process ensures that the Porsche engines all lave the factory meeting the quoted power figures . <p> The 3.2 litre engines are the best in terms of power output but even the early 2.5 litre engines have a lot to offer the keen tuner . <p> The question we get asked the most is what Boxster Tuning methods work the best . A lot depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend taking a look at improving airflow both into and out of the engine . <p> It is worth noting that the standard gearbox and clutch is a relatively weak area . Pushing an extra 50bhp through this has caused some owners a few problems . <p> A good quality sports exhaust with a sports cat will do a lot to lift your peak power . Match this with a full induction kit with a cold air feed . We would recommend a partition or box arrangement around the air filter to shield it from the high engine bay temperatures . <p> Getting a remap , performance chip or similar will also make quite a difference - especially if you are willing to restrict yourself to the higher octane fuels around . A remap should be done last and take into account all the other tuning mods you 've had done . <p> The Boxster is a brilliant package . It has supreme handling and is a true everyday sports car <p> Getting a little more technical we start to look at internal engine tuning and starting at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are fairly noticeable power gains to be had from gas flowing the head using a method known as a " spiral flow " . This creates a swirl in the air to enable better fuel atomisation and flow into the cylinder . A 3 or 5 angle valve job will also improve the air flow effectively increasing the duration or valve open by widening the air intake at partially open/closed settings . <p> Many companies are now offering various stage 1,2 and 3 tuning parts . A fast road cam is probably the most significant change you can make along with a lighter flywheel . <p> A full low down engine rebuild tuning project should look at balancing the internals and if you decide to go with forced induction we would recommend lower compression pistons . Going the supercharger route makes a lot of sense and is somewhat easier to setup but a turbo will give much greater power gains . <p> We have a few members who have added superchargers on low boost settings with fantastic results . Source a supercharger from a breakers yard and as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a massive hike in power for a " relatively low " outlay . <h> Handling &amp; braking mods <p> When it comes to handling you should get an uprated suspension kit but lower the car no more than 30mm . Any more than this and you risk compromising the excellent handling . Stiffer springs and a harder damper will give a sporty feel but many consider this too much for a road car and opt for something a little softer . <p> Never overlook the importance of being able to stop the car . If you are increasing the power of your Boxster , TorqueCars recommend that you uprate your brakes . There are quite a few options open to your from its bigger sister the 911 or the many aftermarket parts suppliers . If you can afford it go with ceramic disks and a 6 or 12 pot caliper for the ultimate stopping power . Do n't forget that the Audi and VW group share similar hubs so you actually have quite a large range of aftermarket parts . Bigger discs will usually require larger wheels so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to discuss the Boxster tuning options in more detail please join our friendly forum and feel free to swap tips with a resident Porsche enthusiasts .

@@24423810 @4423810/ <p> Be very cautious about dumping the DMF . They are not just there for refinement . It 's also there to reduce the torque ' reversal ' which happens every 180 degrees on engine rotation in a four stroke four cylinder engine . Basically all four pistons are stationary every 180 degrees . This is less of a problem with 5 or more cylinders . <p> Removing the DMF means that the entire drivetrain is subjected to that stress . It also subjects the crankshaft to extra stress because the solid FW couples everything from the wheels back to the engine itself . <p> Celtic will get your car to about 180bhp ( if it 's the 136bhp at the moment ) and over 300lbft .

If you are not going that route you will also need to redo the fueling and remap the ecu so that 's another reason for the above suggestion <p> Problems will mainly be if your curent compression ratio is too high - turbos run lower compression ( well usually ) <p> The " overboring to compensate " is only for when you are fitting a bigger turbo as more cc 's will spool up the engine quicker . Turbos will make the engine run hotter ( hence the different model specs ) so a decent intercooler will be needed . Again its best to duplicate ( or fit ) the VR4 system as it will fit without grief and you will have enough of that anyway <p> Please note that I do n't think it is worth adding a turbo to an old car with a small capacity engine . There is nothing stopping you but the money and hassle will just not be worth the power gain you get . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project . <p> Adding a turbo is a major engineering task and without a kit with full instructions and all the parts you need there is a big risk of blowing up the engine . Expect to spend 50 hours upwards on a project of this type . <p> This is not the sort of modification you should undertake unless you are mechanically competent and know what you are doing . <p> It is worth looking at superchargers as these are generally much easier to install than a turbo is . <p> Oky mate cheers , i cant really find many vr4 engines about as i like the 2002 modle the best and would rarther have a 2002 galant with a turbo engine in it . is there any other engines i could put in it easyer like for a evo or anything like that ? and if i was to put a vr4 engine in it what else other thn the engine and wiring loom would i need ? ? or is tht all i would need ? <p> I do n't  know specifically the details with your model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many engines . They do n't  change anything for the sake of it cos it costs them --------s <p> The point is yours is a V6 so fitting any other engine configuration will mean mucho grief . Its likely that the ecu will plug in - same engine type so probably same loom but different ecu Re the capacity a v6 2,4 litre will take a turbo set up - there is one already made by mitsibishi for a start <p> I m not surewhat you mean by " ratios " gearing - fuel mix ? I suspect its the latter <p> Any car with an ecu needs a new map or some way of changing/tuning the new fuelling requirements . This will always be an issue if you do anything to significantly increase the performance . More power must have more fuel This is especially true with bigger turbos . <p> Whether you need other parts will depend on what you do . You need specific advice from a mitsibishi tuner or try the vr4 forum . As the VR4 is a sequential turbo system I 'm not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Plus if you upgrade to non standard turbos it will involve major work as the available bolt tubo parts you will need wont be any use and you will be starting from scratch . <p> The VR4 will AFAIK tolerate around 30% more power on the standard block which is quite impressive for an already powerful engine . Turbo upgrades are the way to go for this along with a remap . The easiest turbo upgrade would be a hybrid , using the standard housing . <p> Gearing is ok to leave and the box and clutch are already quite strong . A remap alone should push the standard cars power up 15-20% on the standard turbo . <p> Ideally you would want to alter the final drive ratio to get the most from a higher power band , but if you put on some larger wheels ( 18 's or 19 's ) this will achieve a similar result at the price of worse handling .

@@24423818 @4423818/ <h> Tuning the Jaguar S Type <p> " It 's definitely your Type ! " <p> The S Type had a long production run and due to heavy depreciation there are some real bargains to be had . These make great tuning projects although the car was designed as a luxury car it is possible to turn them quite cheaply into track day cars . <p> One of the best things you can do to an S Type is some weight reduction , the more you lose the faster it will go and the better it will handle . In this introduction to tuning we 'll look at the most popular mods for your S Type and highlight the best performance parts for your project . <p> Improving the handling should be your first priority in your S Type tuning project . Drop the car by as much as 35mm and fit stiffer dampers , bigger drops will need other modifications in most instances . <p> Turning our attention to the S Type 's engine we need to get a bit more power out of the top end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your S Type into a hot hatch , beating more powerful cars on the track . 38238 @qwx238238 <h> Engine tuning mods . <p> The following modifications are usually performed by our members , decide how far you want to push your car before you begin . <p> Getting the correct grade of mods for your planned usage of the car is a time and money saver . Stage 3 ( competition ) mods just do n't work well on the road as it makes the car hard to control in slow traffic . <p> Peak power is all well and good , but for a daily driven car you need a wide torque band and perhaps extending the rev range . In this article we shall give a brief overview to the best performance parts for your car , but we 'd encourage you to spend some time on the site looking into the details of each type of performance part . <p> One of the most cost effective mechanical modifications you can do on your NASP engine is to fit a fast road cam . The intake and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power band , but be careful here , getting this wrong can upset the idle and make the car hard to drive in traffic . You 'd need to follow a cam upgrade with other mods and finish with a remap for the best performance gains . <p> Do n't forget to uprate the fueling when you are increasing the power as this makes the car more thirsty . Using high octane fuel is another option if you find you are suffering from detonation or premature ignition on your Jaguar project after fitting other modifications . <p> To get sufficient fuel you may need to uprate the injectors on your engine . A fuel pump will only deliver a finite amount of fuel , so you may need to uprate this if your injectors are demanding more fuel . 38228 @qwx238228 <p> Now we move on to the intake and exhaust and ensure proper flow through the engine . Induction kits are only beneficial to boost performance if the car 's air intake is struggling ! Adding an induction kit to most standard engines will see NO POWER GAIN AT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its need for air INCREASES DRAMATICALLY then an induction kit is the answer and will help remove this restriction . Induction kits can work well on turbo engines and larger engines ( if supplied with a suitable cold air feed or air box ) , generally though we 'd just recommend for S Type engines you should settle for a sports panel air filter preferably made from cotton . <p> Sports exhausts will certainly help air flow from the engine but avoid an exhaust that is too large or you could reduce the flow rate . Stick to twin 2 to 2.5 inches as a rule of thumb , but this will depend on the engine you have and the sort of power gains you have wrung out of it . <p> Head porting and polishing the head will allow you to maximise your air/fuel charge . Leave this to a professional though with a proper flow bench and machine tools In nearly all cases of S Type tuning your clutch will start to slip and this needs to be uprated - read our article on clutches for more information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will see phenomenal power gains on most modern turbo engined cars including diesels making a remap one of the most cost effective modifications for your money . <p> We 've also seen some tuners experimenting with twincharging applications and making some seriously high power gains . <p> Adding forced induction will see phenomenal power gains but this is usually too expensive to be cost effective . Turbos are usually harder to add than a supercharger . It is harder to map a turbo as the boost increases exponentially with rpm . It is more straightforward to map a supercharger because the boost is proportional to engine speed on a linear curve . Decreasing the engines compression ratio will allow you to add forced induction , water injection may also help prevent detonation. 38226 @qwx238226 <p> Alloy wheels will help the brake cooling and are usually less heavy than the steel ones . We should point out that , although they can look cool on the S Type , large alloy wheels will actually decrease your performance . The larger you go the lower your acceleration will be - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive ratio . For this reason try to keep the overall rolling diameter of the wheel the standard factory sizes . In all cases without going larger than 18-19 inches . 38231 @qwx238231 38235 @qwx238235 <p> This @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234

@@24423822 @4423822/ <h> heat shield , protect the bumper from exhaust ? <p> Hi ... Just got my self a 2nd hand rear bumper and a sports stainless steel back box . Only prob is the person i bought it off cut a whopping big untidy hole in the rear bumper for the exhaust . I can tidy that up no problem , but what i cant find is something i can use for the exhaust bumper proctor . As i want to get the exhaust to fit nice and close up into the bumper . Just do n't  want to melt the bumper . The only things i have found are carbon fiber heat shields protecting rear bumper . Anything else i can use like " plastic heat prof strips " in black Thanks for your time doj <p> That 's the spirit - the only way you 're likely to have a heat problem with a 1.2 Clio is to torch it . <p> Incidentally , I 'm not suggesting that either . <p> What you could do for looks is to shorten the tailpipe so that it terminates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflector attachments . That way there 's no tailpipe visible to the rear at all . <p> Well look here ... I got these for a very good price ... Havent fitted them yet ... but that hole looks a mess and need tiding up .... Do n't  know how they going to fit on the car yet so looking for the Protector trim just in case in going to need it .. or a bit of black or chrome trim ... doj <p> If you can mount the exhaust tail pipe so it does n't interfere with the bumper then you wo n't have any need for heat shielding . <p> Even engine mountings can impact upon this . Too much flex can cause the exhaust to move a little under hard acceleration ( or , as hard as a 1.4 litre car can accelerate might be enough anyway ) and thus contact the bumper . <p> When I put the exhaust on my old Primera it was only a few mm away from the bumper and I had no issues whatsover . I made a bracket that went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It still had a little movement but not enough to cause any problems . I even had to take the heat shield out around the spare wheel well cause it was banging on the exhaust and that too caused no problems whatsoever . <p> i had a fiberglass bumper on my escort and the exhaust kept touching this ( was a bit of a ropey affair connecting the Ashekly exhaust onto the old system and flexed heavily when driving ) it did n't  crack but did get scorch marks on the fiberglass. suggest to get some polished stainless steel and , as mentioned earlier , make it yourself . if you do n't  want to screw it on your bumper you can get some good quality sealant and glue it on . <p> Why not buy some edging strip to tidy the edges ? Plenty of places offering said items . Or better still pay your local scrapyard a visit and get some boot/door or hatch seals and trim the rubber off leaving the push on edge part ?

I always thought panel filters worked better on a diesel . To get an increase in bhp from your filter you need to remove the resinator box that is attatched to your air filter an run a cold feed pipe front your front bumper straight to your airbox . You still wo n't see much gain from just replacing the filter anyway . A filter works best with the exhaust being upgraded as well . <p> I 'm lookin at having a decat pipe made for the car at the moment , aparently its rather involved ... ie there 's an EGR valve that ill have to have remaped to turn it off so the car does n't  start having a fit .

It 's badged Eolys by the manufacturer Rhodia , previously Rhone-Poulenc . <p> The burnoff process is call regenaration and typically occurs every 300-400 miles . This varies , depending upon driving style and usage . <p> The lifespan of the FAP is alleged to be around 50,000 driven miles . This , too will vary with fuel quality , driving style etc . <p> So ... leaving this point about the EGR valve an cat buiness ...

You will definitely need an IC before uprating the turbo . <p> There is a limit to how much boost you can apply before you need to start modifying the engine - lower compression pistons etc . <p> Again , make the remap the last thing you do . <p> I would n't go too mad as these type of mods get very pricey . If you really do want to go mad then you 'd be better off hunting down a 2.2HDi to start with . The 2.2 engine is very different to the 2.0HDi internally and the tuning scope is larger .

@@24423825 @4423825/ <h> Jetta Tuning <p> First introduced way back in 1979 the Jetta has had quite a few revisions over the years . <p> It was a similar size to the Golf and offered the budget concious executive an alternative to the more expensive larger cars . <p> Early models benefit greatly from tuning and looking at the options around for the Golf particularly the GTi you will get a wide selection of options . <p> The Jetta is badged as a Bora - especially in more recent years in most countries since 1998 so we will focus on the pre 1998 Jetta tuning options and leave the newer models to our Bora article . <p> Many Golf engine options were available in the Jetta line up . The Mark 2 in 1984 had a nice 1.8l engine although an engine swap to a more recent engine is usually your best bet . Our current best pic for your JettaTuning project is the 1.8T engine offering upto 180 bhp in standard form . With a remap and the upgraded KO4 turbo you will see power gains nearing 300-350bhp ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tuned output over 250bhp fitted to the 1992 model revison . The VR6 then is the best engine in the Jetta lineup for tuning , at least until better and newer engines came along . It certainly makes a great sound when it 's being driven hard . <p> VW Jetta tuning is relatively easy with the huge range of parts on offer from it 's little brother the Golf . <h> Engine tuning <p> VW often skimped on the performance options compared to the more powerful Golfs options.So in all cases we suggest that you fit at least Golf GTi spec mods such as brakes . The suspension is also skewed towards a soft comfortable ride , we would recommend getting some adjustable shocks fitted and lowering the car by about 30mm but remember to get a Jetta Specific kit as the weight of the car is very different to the Golf . 38241 @qwx238241 38232 @qwx238232 <p> Stage 3 mods : Engine balancing , adding or upgrading forced induction ( turbo/supercharger ) , Internal engine upgrades ( pistons/head/valves ) , competition cam , sports gearbox.Whilst a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really need is a dyno plot showing the full torque curve . One of the most significant with the best cost to power gain , engine mods you can do is to fit the car more thirsty . Using uprated injectors and a bigger capacity fuel pump deals with the fueling issue . <h> VW Jetta intake and exhaust modifications . <p> Do n't overlook the intake and exhaust . when it comes to car tuning as it is essential to get the cars breathing right.Derestricting the airflow into the engine is the primary part of tuning so get a better flowing air filter . Induction kits sound great with the induction roar they create but due to the warm air in the engine bay they will not add noticable power and actually rob you of power . Fitting a high flow sports exhausts will certainly help air flow through the engine but do not go too large or you will reduce the flow rate . Stick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article on performance exhausts for details of the issue around large bore exhausts and how to choose the right size for your engine . <p> Getting a professionally flowed head with larger valves can fully release the engines power . Your clutch can sap a lot of your power if it starts to slip and the standard clutches are only ever good for power gains of up to 40 or 50% . Fit a performance clutch to avoid power losses through the transmission . Turbo engines are just begging to be remapped . You will see big power gains on most turbo engined cars including diesels making a remap one of the most cost effective modifications . <p> The later diesel turbo engines have a lot to offer as well but for some reason the 1.9 TDi from the Golf GTi with 150bhp was not an option . All the larger powered diesel engines respond very well from a remap. 38244 @qwx238244 38245 @qwx238245 38234 @qwx238234 
@@24423826 @4423826/ <h> Suspension tuning - lowering and stiffening . <p> " Shocking and absorbing stuff " <p> On the track your priority is fast cornering and suspension plays a large part in this . Track conditions are quite forgiving and you can make some compromises like using hard suspension and lowering the car for optimum aerodynamics and a low centre of gravity . <p> This works well because tracks are fairly flat and you do not have a carrier bag full of eggs in the car from your return trip to the supermarket . So what factors do you have to take into account when setting up and choosing your cars suspension if it is also used as your daily driver . <p> Manufacturers have to take speed bumps , uneven road surfaces , passenger comfort and road noise into consideration when setting up a cars suspension . Most production cars have a soft comfortable suspension that does little to maximise handling and driving experience . <p> Track cars are set up for driver preference and style so the perfect setting is not just different for each model of car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taken into account . The aim of a good suspension system is to keep the tyres on the road at the best angle to create the largest possible contact area . Body roll needs to be minimised and the cars center of gravity should be as low as possible . <p> Torquecars would not recommend going lower than 35mm for hot hatches which tend to have uprated suspension I recommend just a 30mm drop . <p> Common mistakes . Going into the local part store and buying a non adjustable suspension kit that lowers the car 30mm and expecting this to be the perfect set up . Most kits are very general in nature and sometimes the suppliers imply that they can be fitted to all or many models in a cars range . Different engine weights , wheel sizes and car weights need different suspension characteristics so this one fits all approach is very misleading . <p> If you go too low you also risk damaging the drive shaft and gearbox if the angle from the final drive to wheel hub is wrong . The way the suspension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride height and this can cause scrubbing or premature wear on your rubber ! <p> It is also a mistake to buy lowered springs and fit them to standard dampers or get uprated dampers and then apply them to standard springs . The entire suspension system should be viewed as a complete unit and parts matched up . <p> Ride Height adjustments . Cars look good when slammed to the ground . But you reduce your ground clearance and can cause problems with tyres rubbing in the wheel arches and speed bumps can become insurmountable obstacles . <p> Remember that roads have speed bumps and , instead of slowing a lowered car down , they will grab the sump and rip off the bottom of the engine and most of your front skirt . Lower does not automatically mean better handling . <p> For most road cars TorqueCars would not recommend going lower than 35mm , and for hot hatches which tend to have uprated suspension we recommend just a 30mm drop . If you have changed the wheel size then these tolerances could be much lower with a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK but if you lower it as well you may get all manner of problems . <p> The aim should always be to improve handling and with the car being lower there will be less air going under the car and this can help with stability . Remember lower springs should be fitted to matched shocks . <p> Just cutting the springs is really bad idea you are asking a piece of metal designed to a tolerance to work effectively with a big chunk of its structure missing . You should expect cut springs to break or shatter without warning . <p> Ideally you will get a suspension kit that can be easily adjusted on the car and this will enable you to tune the handling to suit your driving style . Ride height and damping force are nice adjustments to have but in competitions you will need to set the bound/rebound and other characteristics as well . <p> We have another article on suspension settings which deals with the many other adjustments and recommend that you also read this .

@@24423837 @4423837/ <h> RS4 Tuning <p> Once again Audi show the world they can make a supremely quick car that handles like it is on rails . <p> The early RS4 will benefit from a set of uprated shocks all round and the turbo engines have a lot of potential for tuning up . <p> The later RS4 is pretty much perfect from the factory but you can still add a bit more power ! ! <p> TorqueCars recommend that you get adjustable shocks and set them up to suite your driving preference and style . <p> It hardly seems like there is any point tuning one of the fastest cars Audi has turned out in while . That is , until you realise just what is on offer and how much of a power gain there is waiting for you . <p> As with most VAG engines the RS4 engines are over engineered and can cope with bigger power gains without affecting reliability . <p> The RS4 is a stunning car from Audi but you can make it even better with a few simple to apply performance modifications . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a quick overview . The B5 chassis RS4 built in 2000-2001 had the powerful 2.7 V6 twin cam twin turbo engine . The two blocks on offer were the ASJ and AZR . These are very interesting propositions for the tuner needing only a turbo conversion and remap to boost power levels by another easy 40% or so . <p> Then we come to the B7 chassis built around 2006-2008 with its 4.2 litre V8 Twin Cam Fsi engine went back to Nasp engines . Factory performance figures actually seems pessimistic with most owners squeezing the 0-62 run in around 4 seconds . This model handled much better than it 's predecessor . <h> Audi RS4 Tuning modifications . <p> Your aim when tuning should be a nice flat torque curve and a wide power band . On the NASP engine TorqueCars recommend that the best mechanical mods you can do is to fit a fast road cam . Apply a remap and some intake/exhaust mods to maximise this but you will end up with a powerful and reliable car . <p> The Turbo engine is just crying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large single turbo for big top end power or a larger Twin turbos . Twin turbo upgrades are available from Garrett based twin turbos and a number of hybrid options are around that use the standard Audi RS4 turbo and add uprated internals . <p> Oil changes need to be more regular and you must let the turbos cool down a little after a run or you risk turning the oil to sludge , with oil pump blockages or the turbos will prematurely wear as the oil delivery stops with the engine switched off . <p> Engine cooling should become a priority and if you have uprated the power by more than 30% it would be a good idea to uprate your clutch to handle the power . <h> Audi RS4 Intake and Exhaust Tuning . <p> Now we move on to the intake and exhaust and ensure proper flow through the engine . The standard RS4 setup is pretty good on both engines . For the NASP RS4 engine TorqueCars would say to go with a washable high flow cotton panel air filter . On the turbo engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air feed and preferable housed in an air box . <p> Miltek offer a great range of performance exhausts and it is also worth sourcing a sports catalyst to release the maximum potential from the engine . <p> With the NASP and to a lesser degree the turbo engine , airflow through the head can be dramatically increased with some professional porting and ' polishing ' . The flow rates for each port should match and be setup to take into account any other engine mods you have had done . <p> When you start tuning your RS4 you will find that the standard clutch starts to complain so get an uprated clutch . The excellent turbo engines are just begging to be remapped and can cope with pretty impressive power gains without any undue issues provided you shorten your service schedule . <h> Audi RS4 Wheel modifications . <p> Alloy wheels will help the brakes cool down and are usually lighter than the steel ones . The downside to large alloy wheels on your RS4 is that you alter your effective final drive ratio and this will have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone larger we would stick to a 17 inch rim size as the maximum . <p> The RS4 is pretty heavy , although the Quattro drive system makes it feel very nimble and responsive you should always fit good quality tyres . Some RS4 owning TorqueCars members have rated the Goodyear Eagle F1 but tyre choice is subjective and we suggest you join our friendly forumwhere you can discuss RS4 tuning options in more detail . <p> It would also be worth reading our unbiased Audi tuning articles to get a full grasp of the benefits and drawbacks of each modification . <p> This <h> Feedback 38237 @qwx238237 <p> HI Saleh , we are only an online magazine so we do n't  supply parts or kits .

@@24423839 @4423839/ <p> Hi Niall and welcome to TorqueCars . Why not do an engine swap with a 2.2 S6 turbo engine - these are very tunable indeed . <p> The 2.4 is farily high compression and I doubt whether a turbo could be safely run at more than a very modest boost level . <p> To fit a turbo you would need to change the pistons ( lower the compression ) I would certainly recommend gas flowing the head . You will also need an intercooler , custom remap and will need to get bigger injectors and better fuel pump . There is also quite a bit of extra piping , Diverter , Wastegage and exhaust header that need to go in . If I remember rightly there is not a lot of room in the 2.4 engine bay as it stands ? <p> On your standard car . A remap will get you another 20bhp to play with match this with better headers and a sports cat and you might be able to get another 30bhp on this engine . <p> The 2.2 S6 would be one option but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( small population , not so many S6s ) . <p> So the standard engine remapping is realistically the only option I have and I 'd be more than happy with 20bhp more than the current 177bhp . <p> I 'd have to get the remapping done professionally as I 've never touched engines other than for minor servicing . <p> I presume a basic remapping implies no mechanical modifications , only uploading a custome software update to the engine 's CPU ? <p> What about increased stresses from 20bhp or 30bhp more on drive train and Tiptronic gearbox ? My assumption is there wo n't be any significant increased stresses since torque will not increase so much anyway .

Whichever cable you remove first will break the circuit . Hopefully I can learn something here . Never taken them off in a particular order and never had any problems . <p> On the odd occasion I have had to jump start a car ( thankfully not mine ! ) I connect +ve to +ve firstly . If you do -ve to -ve firstly then you will create a circuit if you inadvertently touch bodywork with the red lead . <p> But for this purpose I ca n't see the difference .

But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit . <p> Sometimes I think these things are prescribed simply for the avoidance of doubt rather than any technical benefit . <p> Because if your negative is still attached to the chassis and you slip with a spanner while removing the positive with a spanner then you will create a short circuit with the path created . If the negative is removed first and you have this accident then a path will not be available for the short circuit to occur . For this exact reason if you reconnect the positive first with your spanner then connect your negative afterwards and touch earth by mistake then nothing will happen and you or should I say the car electrics will be fine . <p> Well A friends ( mechanic ) 911 had a flat battery , His wife changed the battery for a good battery and it screwed all the clocks up , The whole binnacle had to be replaced , I did read than when you disconnect a battery that current still remains in the circuit ( which makes sense ) So it is a good idea to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between ( 12v lamp or something ) to drain the circuit ...... <p> The battery does not supply the electrons in wire , they simply pump them , so disconnect the battery and you have simple disconnected the pump , the electrons remain in the wire just as fluid would remain in a pipe .

I am convinced that TD engines are deliberately detuned to give the petrol models a fighting chance . <p> If I had the petrol TFSi I doubt I would remap it , at least not for a while . <p> On paper the TDI is slower that my car to 60 by about 1 second , but in reality I 'm sure I 'd hardly notice the difference . Plus the quattro would really help when the snow comes down and on damp roads . <p> The good thing is that I 'm not in any hurry to buy a car . My main motivation is that mine is hitting 100k miles and I 'm starting to get little niggles with it ( nothing major but just the odd little thing but I take this as a sign that things are not as rosey as they once were . ) <p> Fair enough , but resale value does n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car over the cost of replacing it . <p> That 's from me , and I 'm a VERY fussy driver . I maintain my cars meticulously - ( or , more correctly , I have them maintained meticulously ) and I still find it more economic to do this than to replace them . <p> OK Waynne , that 's fair enough . But derv 's do attract their own costs . They can batter DMFs and the emission controls , although no longer problematical , can incur some pricey routine servicing work . <p> None of this will trouble you if you 're buying new or nearly new from a franchised dealer ( with a manufacturer supported warranty ) . <p> But if you 're planning to keep the car for few or more years beyond that 3-4 year warranty period then I suggest that you do get the oil swapped more frequently than the servicing indicator lights or the schedule suggests . <p> ( Applies to petrol cars as well , but diesel fuel , despite its lubricity , does violate engine oil very savagely because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore are more likely to remain ) . <p> As I 've said for ages , do n't buy derv for fuel economy alone - I do n't think the long term savings ( TCO - total cost of ownership ) are that impressive . <p> I 'm not saying that derv cars will cost more to run overall , just that the similarities outweigh the differences . <p> But if you like the drive , as I do , then why not ? <p> A remapped A3 2.0 TDI CR will give you more torque at 2000rpm than an XK8 can muster at 4000rpm . And it will feel that way in general driving . Muscular and effortless . <p> i do n't  think VAG is that bad for the petrol /diesel servicing . just watch the turbo if you go for the 140 models , there has been some issues with them spewing guts when mapped while others are fine . there does n't  seem to be as much trouble with the 170 models . <p> Waynne - be careful to consider more than just the franchised dealers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fine over the first 3-4 years with a makers warranty in place .

@@24423866 @4423866/ <p> What ratio of diff are you after ? I 've heard good things about Quaife and had one on my Rover with no problems . Did they give a reason about the Quaife diffs ?

It is nice to have you along and it looks like there is a lot you can contribute . What you really need is a diff which is electrically adjustable - this I think is a hole in the market . Audi have a semi-locking diff which actually works quite well , but this is probably not suitable for drifting . I 'll scout around a bit and see what options you have to choose from . What sort of power are you running ? <p> I am at the moment only at 350bhp and 240lb/ft , the 2.8 is coming out and i am going to drop the compression to 8.5:1 I want to run around 20psi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only on industial vehicles , I was working on the developed for the new Landy 's going to Iraq and we installed them this i can probably replicate onto a diff but i need to get a pneumatic air pump , <p> I was thinking about a new idea that i saw a tuner company doing as a bit of a demo , They were running 4 tiny turbos off a Smart Car one a RED Top , I may do something along these lines maybe 3 medium size ? <p> I am a BMW and Kit car tuner , i have a full machine shop at my workshop and we can build custom parts etc , I am also a tig , mig welder and can do modifications and rollcages , I also have with sister companies an engine dyno and rolling road , I am going to become an MOTEC ecu tuner as well , <p> I have often wondered about a large and 1 small turbo setup .

Rather , the BMW 328i E36 Quaife ATB Helical LSD differential automatically biases the torque away from the spinning wheel across the axle , to a constantly varying degree , and never locks . 38230 @qwx238230 <p> Get someone to rebuild your oem BMW lsd to a good spec , buy a kaaz or weld it . <p> Powerful mig welder used by someone who knows what they are doing on a well cleaned and prepared diff should be more than ok .

Btw , it is currently the most powerful , quickest and fastest in Europe . <p> As you have a 91 TT it is most likely sporting the 2 bolt main block which has the cast crank as opposed to what is dubbed as the forged Gen 2 crank . You can tell as the earlier engines have a CAS on the timing belt side . The only reason you may have the 4 bolt main is if someone has previously swapped the engine . <p> The bad news is only minor in that 450 BHP is probably your real max to safely tune . <p> The good news is that 450 BHP is a fairly well trodden path . Depending how much your budget is will determine which path to follow . Personally , your best and safest route is to go stand alone ecu ( about 1500 fitted and mapped for a VIPEC ) , if not you can go with piggy backs but whilst this works , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doing something different than it really is , so you always have to compensate here and there . For piggy backs you will need to be able to control boost , fuel and timing . Stay away from manual boost controllers . <p> Probably the best turbos to get you to 450 BHP will be either 13Ts or 15Gs . The former come as a kit as they require slight modification of certain bits to fit ( very minor though ) , the latter simply bolt on but will be a little dearer . 13Ts I believe are around -800 a pair . <p> Fuelling : any of the following pumps . Walbro hot wired , Walbro 400 or 450 , Supra turbo pump . Injectors either RC550 or a set of 450s from USA for a DSM . <p> Fuel lines should be fine but change the stock loop that joins the 2 fuel rails for a higher flowing one . <p> Plugs , go 1 range colder . <p> You can achieve 450 BHP with the stock MAF so should be ok <p> Depending on the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Options are bigger side mounts or a front mount inter cooler . <p> Stock rad and fans will be fine . <p> Adjustable fuel pressure regulator . <p> I recommend at some point changing the output shaft in the gearbox for either a Quadco or 300M . <p> I 'm sorry but those figures ca n't be right tbh I would probably have queried 100 .

Ca n't hurt trying though . They would probably sort the pedal box out tbh . As for the change , it 's just a case of swapping the box ( may be able to use an earlier Clio ) , and probably fabbing a couple of brackets . <p> I suppose really all they need to do is adjust the manifold slightly and tweak the mapping , if it was a completely different engine then I guess they would take you up on the offer , but who know they could in the end deside that a new kit would be the way to go and they may e-mail you balc with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think turboing a cliosport would spoil the character of the car .

Also when you make holes in the bulkheads for the cables you must protect the cables with a rubber grommit . If you do n't it will rub and wear through and eventually short causing a potential fire or at best intermittent electrical problems . <p> I did n't  know about needing a sealed unit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take into consideration though . i was just going to basicaly relocate by current battery box into the trunk then run all the cables back so thanks for the info .

One thing that is essential is putting a fuse in the positive line , as near to the battery positive terminal as convenient . If anything shorts out , you want the protection of a fuse/breaker tripping to stop the live cable setting fire to the car .

I 'm also looking to add a turbo conversion or supercharhger so any feedback on this would be appreciated . <p> 106 all the way they always look phat and there lighter too i 'm looking into a supercharger , for a gti swap ( with flowed head and cams ) ect <p> i was reading up there best thing for these light cars and there not as much presser on the engine as a turbo i think its the way to go but the only down fall is the dump vavle dosnt make that atrative psssst noice <p> i 'm looking to find one that dose as iv heard thers ones that do it any of u know of one <p> i think if u were to even get 200 hp out of that car u could beat almost anythink as i have a stock 1.4 atm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad honda civic 1.6 sport <p> You can get 200BHP out of a ' charged 106GTi engine quite easily .. There is a ' charged 106GTi lump in an AX GTi pushing 297BHP , but I have the suspicious feeling this reading was measured at the fly , not the wheels . <p> Most people tend to go down the charger route , rather than having a blown VTS/GTi lump , I think this is mainly because of the turbo lag , but I suppose it 's down to the individual driver , and your style of driving . <p> It 's worth trying to get yourself a copy of Performance GTi magazine , as it features lots of modified Saxo 's and 106 's , as well as other French cars . Quite hard to find though so you might have to go to a main WHSmith 's , or wait till the next issue comes out in late April .. Really worth reading for inspiration ! <p> Because turbo 's keep spinning after you come off of the throttle , a dump valve releases all of the gasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you shut off the throttle and the gas had nowhere to go , it would try to backwards and the turbine would seize up . <p> Superchargers recycle the air in the inlet ( I think ! ! ) and the build up in back-pressure is not as dangerous .. Although I 've heard you can fix a dump-valve ( or bypass valve ) to a charged lump , you lose alot of pressure and the end result in sound really is n't very impressive ! More like a fart than a sexy hiss ! You could always go down the charger route an attach an electronic dump valve ! Saber manufacture these and they work off of a sensor linked to a speaker under your bonnet ! A bit tacky if you drive a 1.1 but I could justify it if you are actually gon na charge a GTi lump ! <p> If you want a good option for a car to modify , get hold of a 406 or Coupe with the 2.2 HDi16 diesel engine . Check it 's in good order and get a full service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get them to apply a custom re-map to your fuel and boost ECU settings . This is good for 178bhp and over 300lbft of torque which is delivered cleanly from below 2000rpm all the way to about 4500rpm . It 'll destroy any 106/206 GTi in any gear . The only problem is that you 've got a D badge on the back , but it 's good fun watching BMW 330i 's disappear in the mirror . <p> You could always go down the charger route an attach an electronic dump valve !

The money could easily be better spent . <p> I 'm sticking to my guns here and recommend the 2.2 HDi diesel over the 3.0V6 petrol . Driven both and several other lively cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit , it really is not an issue with these excellent 16 valve units . <p> I can see your point about smaller lumps . It 's true that a diesel engine , regardless of the torque or power on offer , is heavier than a petrol unit , which can compromise handling , especially in front wheel drive cars . <p> It 's not just outright grip ( which is very good on any Peugeot - it 's been a family trait for decades ) but you 've still got the momentum of all that mass over the front ' axle ' . For me , it 's not a problem as my car never sees a track - it spends its miles on motorways and fast A roads where the re-mapped diesel 's mid-range clout is invincible . <p> Try and extract 309 lbft from any non-turbo petrol this side of four litres and you 'll have your work cut out . Manage it and you 'll have a big overdraft and a job keeping the thing idling below 2000rpm <p> I 've never set much store by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative 8 seconds . Flat out , no idea but it 's pulling hard still at 130mph , although diesels do n't like massive revs so that will compromise the result . Again , it 's the mid range stuff that I think really counts . Try 40 to 70mph in fourth in about 7 seconds ! ! ! <p> No - it 's in stock factory form - apart from uprated front and rear pads ferodo DS in this case . I am genuinely impressed by the custom re-map that Celtic Tuning did for me . The MPG is exactly as you 'd find in stock tune unless you use every last ounce all the time , when you 'll be down to low 30ish mpg . But then , I suppose a standard car is gon na use more if you clout it constantly . <p> At the age of 36 ( yep , oldie ) I 'm no stranger to lively motors . I regularly drive Boxsters and MGF 's , so I do have a fair table upon which to lay my claims . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to use the best fuel available - BP Ultimate is my choice - stick Tesco 's stuff in it and you do n't get the best from it . For sure - better than stock tune but ..... what 's the point ? <p> The only bitch with just about any diesel engine is that you still are never gon na get that 7500rpm hysterical scream that a tuned petrol will give , so the aural delights are not on the menu . <p> Truly though , you find that changing up at 3000rpm gives you ample shove - equates to about 97mph in fifth anyway . <p> Again ( must be an age thing ) but I love the prospect ( and reality ) to chew up three litre petrol Mercs uphill and in silence with a diesel badge on the back . <p> i like the idea of tuning a big efficient diesel lump , but i think my preference would be supercharging a 106 gti .... ooooh , i 'm dribbling at the thought of being able to afford to do that .... but until then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any turbocharged car , diesel or petrol is that there is a lways going to be a degree of lag whilst exhaust gas velocity spins up the turbo . The turbo also acts to restrict the flow of exhaust gas at this time , thereby negating all your work gas flowing heads and fitting big bore exhausts etc . <p> For me the fun bit is being able to compete on a level field with petrol cars with engines well over 3 litres in capacity . But , the fact remains , turbochargers are a compromise . Superchargers are driven mechanically , so those engines respond immediately . <p> In the ' old days ' diesel pundits spoke of ' torque and real-world performance ' . This was an excuse for a car that was slow and noisy - I hated diesels at that time . <p> Fact is now , that we 're dealing with real numbers too - 0-62mph in under eight seconds . 40-70 in FOURTH in about FIVE ! ! <p> In addition , I 'm not sure that diesel is the ultra economical fuel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive servicing thatn is required by a petrol engine . Having said that , I would swap to petrol unless a good V8 of about 3.5 litres was on offer and someone else was paying the fuel bill ! <p> He could be correct - I know VW/Audi had entered a TDi powered car . I 'm a fan of good diesel turbo engines for road use . I do mean good ones , not some dodgy 100bhp mid nineties thing . In a racing situation I still think that a petrol powered vahicle is preferable simply because the engine is smaller and lighter , thereby impinging on the suspension/handling setup less that a heavier diesel unit . I think PSA ( Peugeot-Citroen ) has plans for a Le Mans diesel next time round .

@@24423876 @4423876/ <p> The basic reason for forced induction ( turbo or supercharger ) is not to increase compression or the maximum pressure in an engine cylinder , it is to increase volumetric efficiency ( the efficiency of the engine at drawing in air ) although forced induction is the most effective method of upping compression . <p> In computer games we just tick a box , and within seconds our car is fully turbocharged and running much faster . In the real world things are very different . <p> We look at Anti lag systems in cars and how these keep the turbo spinning ready to provide boost from low RPM speeds . When you lift off the throttle the engine power cuts and the turbo starts to spool down . <p> From this low spool state there is a delay while the turbo spins up again before it can provide any useful boost .

High compression NASP engines are quite efficient but when adding forced induction you want to lower the compression ratio . The compression ratio has a dramatic effect on an engines performance and the problem of knock , ( where the air fuel mix prematurely ignites ) is controlled to a large degree by the compression ratio . <p> To low CR in a turbo car makes it sluggish off boost but can cope with higher boost levels . My car has 8.7-1 static CR and if 's fine off boost .

Buddy , with a new set of discs and pads it is always wise to replace the brake fluid , plus there is a bedding in procedure of the pads which must be followed to the letter . Did you buy the right pads and not buy a set which states race or track on the labelling ? I would also take off the wheels double sharpish and make sure you have fitted the pads correctly and to triple check that the callipers have not seized on due to something you may have done incorrectly . <p> Pads vary widely in quality . Bedding in is actually best done savagely rather than gently . In which what you have done here ( assuming decent pads , not Eicher rubbish ) is the best way to burnish them . Some smoke is to be expected during bed-in . The smoke will diminish provided you 're not driving at full bore all the time . <p> got apec disks and pads i done a 400 mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or back.i do have a heavy foot but like i said was fine before . ive checkd calipers and are not binding or seem to be sticking even when smoking and jaked up wheel is free . ive also checkd and double checked pads . ive done brakes so many times before with no probs. ive had this happen 3 times now in a week . brakes start to smoke but both brakes smoke the same then pedal goes soft/not very responsive . i 'm going to go for a fluid change tomorow see how it goes and i shall report bak with my findings . thanks guys <p> Yes , fluid change is definitely worthwhile but will have no impact upon the smoking problem . <p> Do you know what pads were in previously ? Some work on abrasive friction but current road materials generally rely upon transferring a thin layer of pad material EVENLY to the disc surface . This is known in the friction trade as adherent friction and it 's this which give modern brakes that lovely progressive grab and bite at low pedal forces . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic of the APEC pads you are using . 400 miles is probably enough but I would try half a dozen 60mph - 5mph applications - quite hard , hold it just behind where the ABS inervenes ( expect some more smoking ! ) followed by gentle driving to cool things off . Try not to stop and do n't hold then pedal down when the car is stationary otherwise you risk transferring pad material unevenly which will cause judder and vibration . <p> thanks for the info . the pads before were factory pads.i cant post links yet but read that if fluid has got water in it it will boil and effectively cause steam in the caliper when hot causing brake caliper to put pads on from expanding steam.but it may be dribble what i 'm reading.could it be the abs computer because my speedo do n't  work and it runs off the abs sensors but the clocks have been tested and are working fine and has new abs sensors all round <p> Water absorption will lower the effective boiling point of the fluid in the calipers but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you had boiling fluid issues then the brakes would be super soft underfoot and give very poor stopping response . <p> Large people carriers such as your Espace can be heavy on front brakes . <p> I truly think this is a pads and discs issue , not a hydraulic issue or ABS issue . You have proven that nothing is binding ie. the wheels spin freely when the car is jacked up . <p> As I have described it is very probably a non issue but new fluid is always a good plan every couple of years . <p> I will have a look at APEC , I have heard of APEC but I have no idea where it sits as a brand in terms of quality/performaance . You do n't need boiling fluid to get the soft pedal &amp; no braking feeling . <p> This can be very readily caused caused by smoke building up between the discs and pads , thus preventing the proper contact required for effective braking . Which is where I think my thoughts are heading . I had a very similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peugeot 406 2.2 HDi a few years ago using Eicher pads and discs . Took them off ( well , had them taken off ) and replaced with ATE discs and pads . ATE is a Continental Teves brand and the braking settled immediately . <p> What is the Renault OEM fitment ? I am guessing from amongst these : <p> ATE Jurid Bendix Textar Pagid . <p> Do n't dismiss OEM parts - in my 28 odd years of driving I 've always found OEM to be the best way to go with friction parts . <p> Air in the lines will cause soft pedal so I would have the lines bled starting with the wheel further-est from the MC . The sequence is passenger side rear , driver side rear , passenger side front and finally driver side front . <p> DOT 5 is silicone based and I would avoid totally ( it does not absorb water and is more compressible than DOT 4 ) .

@@24423881 @4423881/ <h> Wheel spacers , what to look for ? ? <p> Hi guys I am finding difficult to get the rims I want with the offset correct for my car so looks I will have to use some spacers . What to look for ? ? What 's the difference between 10pounds 5mm spacers and 50pounds 5mm spacers etc ? ? ? <p> Hi Marc ! General thought is lighter equals better . If you gon na put spacers make shore they are hubcentric model . It means they got edge around center holle to support your wheels just like your wheel would be suported without spacer . Do you need spacers for moving wheels further than stock or you just compensate for inapropriate wheel offset ? When you move them further than stock setting you change camber , your springs feel a littlebit softer and in my suspicion you change ackerman angles . Also car is more prone to bump steer and if your tire get empty precise steering could be compromised . It is related with " scrub center " and I 'm sorry for my english is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with technical terms . Hope this post got you some more questions , because in right questions lies the answer . <p> Cheaper ones are not always very well balanced and they often come in a one size fits all stud patterns . You need your spaces to be rotationally balanced and light but they will also need to be strong . <p> It is an idea to get the suspension checked after fitting and just make sure all the alignment is spot on . You will 90% of the time be perfectly fine with 5mm spacers but it is a good idea to have all the suspension properly set up and can really improve cornering and handling . <p> Guys , THANK YOU ! ! ! First of all I will focus on getting wright wheels , 20 ' ' 9J 35-40 offset Then I will get new bolts or nuts . Spacers I will use only in the worst case scenario . I have now 45offset . For 9J recommended is 39 due to the air suspension . But I found source which says 35-45 . The wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but ... The one in UK which I like very much are either 29 which is to much out , or 50 so there i will have to use 10-13mm spacers which I 'm not keen on . As per my original thread ' Alloys upgrade ' I am starting to thinking back again about the ones from US/Canada . I found someone already in Canada , cousin of my work mate , who is keen on sending them to me as a Gift , can they pick on wheels as a Gift and ask me to pay duty which is 250quid+ ? ? ? The one from us are exactly what I want , Hartmanns manufactured for Audi , 20 ' ' 9J 40offest and 1500dollars seems to be not that much on the end of the day , but it all depends from the cost of getting them send to UK . I really want to get it right with no spacers and wheels I want . <p> With an offset of ET40 I ca n't but think they will look lost in the arches still . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body . But using spacers wo n't have any adverse effects ( lots of people use them ) . <p> No , that 's the thing , there is not many A8s D3 so you can just look at them like that ET40 will take them 5mm out than what it is now . ET35 would be ideal , but the set I 'm thinking about back again comes with ET25 as well . 25 looks like at least 10mm to much from all the specs I 've checked so far , I assume is all to do with the air suspension , which as I said I want to keep as it is more a family car so custom suspension is not the option at the minute . There wont be a issue in Comfort mode , but the problem might be when its set to Dynamic where suspension is on the lowest setting therefore is they are to far out it will scratch the wheel arches . If not that , I could get them from UK , exactly same ones , but ET29 and in gloss silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color of the car , and they are cheaper by 250quid , and no hassle with getting them to someone in Canada and them DHL to UK . But the ones in UK have no clear branding , Hartmann is known and you have got some guarantee of quality . <p> Idea is , if I get rims with ET40 ( the only one set with this specs is the one from US ) , I can always use the 5-10mm spacers as a worst case scenario . If I get 25 or 29 offset , there wont be a way back to slightly higher offset . But just know , I 've checked once again the fitments for each model on that page ( link above ) , and it says A8 V8 2003+ ET40 and ET25 for 20 ' ' ! ? ! ? Would they be aware of the suspension matter where it says all over the place ET35/39 - 45 for this car ? ? ? ? <p> This is the car and the rims from US It looks like 25 offset , but same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the original S8 Wheel 20 ' ' ET46 9J ! ! ! <p> And that 's mine on 18 ' ' ( 8.5J ! ! ! ) ET45 <p> I understand that 9J will still be slightly more off to outside than 8.5J as is wider or ... ? ? ? <p> If not late , I found that calculator pretty accurate . You can see what hapens when you change ET , rim wide and diameter:http : //www.willtheyfit.com/ 38230 @qwx238230 <p> Cheers , yes that was the first one I found and used , but it 's obvious and a common sense really that if you buy wider wheels with smaller offset they will come out more . Then I used that one as LONG ... <p> Both clearly show that overall diameter of the whole wheel wont change comparing 255/45/18 to 255/35/20 . My problem was how , much smaller offset would work with the air suspension , that 's it , I do not want to buy new wheels new tyres and on the first run cut/scratch all of the tyres on wheels arches . But I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is just between 25 ( Hartmanns ) and 35 ( max in all other guides ) .

The large turbo , solid flat four engines have a lot to offer . <p> There are thankfylly also many aftermarket parts around for the Impreza from suspension and handling kits and off the shelf performance flowed heads to turbo conversions , stroker kits and generally speaking the more you pay the better the return on your investment . <p> The WRX and STi both appeal to those with family obligations as they are such good all round cars . The engines are very solid and can tolerate a great deal of tuning . <p> One of the highest performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who still want a sports car but have to be a bit sensible ! <p> There have been reports of a small problem with the early Impreza fuel pickup in the fuel tank which causes fuel starvation on long fast sweeping bends . To fix this you can fit the new design pickup/pump and these cornering problems will be gone . <p> The flat four boxer engine is certainly one of the most distinctive sounding engines around , and the engine configuration means that the weight is carried low down in the engine bay which helps the handling characteristics . <p> Due to the engine shape the exhausts are a work of art and the various twists and bends allow equal lengths of pipe from each cylinder . Performance exhausts cost a fortune and we suggest you get a good quality exhaust as some cheap upgrades are inferior to the OEM setup . A decent exhaust really enhances the sound of the engine and can make another 10% power gian or thereabouts . <p> The early ( 1992 ) WRX came with a very solid and sweet sounding flat four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revisions over the years and we see the power steadily increasing with various limited edition tuning packs from Prodrive . <p> From around the year 2000 JDM models received regular revisions and cosmetic enhancements , with a few handling mods thrown in like the 2003 Transmission upgrade and the 2005 WRX being fitted with the better viscous rear slip differential . Other markets followed the Jap Spec upgrades and had various limited edition models introduced . <p> Most limited edition cars were produced in very small numbers of around 400 and in most cases these were customisable by the buyer with various performance , handling and styling packs . It does pay to do your research before buying and decide which options and year model you really need rather than buying a car at random and spending your way to the spec you want . <p> TorqueCars would recommend the following tuning modifications for the Subaru Impreza WRX and STi . Firstly the turbo can fairly easily be upgraded with one which has re-machined internals making it spool up faster and provide more boost . If you get an ECU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best left as your final modification so you can wring out the benefit of all of the other modifications you have done to the Impreza . If you increase the power you will certainly benefit from an uprated intercooler which is mounted at the top or the hottest part of the engine by Subaru , indeed many owners of standard Impreza WRX and STi report a power increase from adding a quality front mounted intercooler . <p> A sports cam profile will lift the power in the upper part of the rev band , however this will affect the smooth tickover of the engine so this is only really recommend for serious track day use . <p> If you fit a lighter flywheel your engine will be more free revving and will feel more powerful . You will also certainly want to uprate the clutch although the original clutch should be good for 350 bhp , unless it is particularly worn . <p> The engine capacity can be increased to around 2.5 litres . This should not overly affect the reliability of the engine but we would recommend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalyst and sports exhaust will help the breathing of the engine .

@@24423898 @4423898/ <p> So ... I own Fiat stilo 2002 1.6 16V for like 4 years now . And recently i decided to add turbo for this car ..... <p> Hmmm you might say ... WHY ? why not buy 2.4 stilo abarth or something . That are some reasonable questions wich i could not answer . . I Really love this car , besides that its fiat and its ... quite cocky sometimes . <p> So back to the subject , what can you guys say about turbo to this engine . Where should i start , what should i buy , and what i should look after . <p> Most important thing , that i want turbo not for high HP boost or something . I 'm curious to have that ..... sound under the hood ( when turbo sucks in and releases the air ) ( Yeah i know its childish and stupid ... but the hearth wants what the hearth wants , right ? ) <p> You know in your case it may not be that much of a problem , since you not interested in any crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and money . You have to buy a turbo , in your case the smallest cheapest one even 2nd hand then you need to find a place to make you a once of outlet manifold , to fit the turbo to , since there are none for your car and this might be a bit pricey . Then decide to either have the boost just blow into atmosphere like you said kinda weird but it 's the sound you want not the power or boost the inlet manifold at say 1 or 2 psi very low to be safe and use a piggy back remap to compensate for the extra air flow . Now fitting a cone shaped air filter and dump valve you 'll have all the sucking huffing and puffing and whistling sounds you would like . And hopefully someone that knows what they are doing reads this to fill in the gaps I probably left here . Does this help in any way ?

The liquid nitrogen is added to the sealed tank in very precise measures , too fast and you risk causing stress fractures in the metal . <p> After you have reached around -350F the engine temperature is slowly raised up again to over 300 F over a 12 hour period or so . <p> This process is repeated 3 or 4 times over the course of a week . The process will work on any metal engine part with popular use for hardening the block , pistons and crank . <p> The camshaft is also a high wear area of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is best that the parts are Cryo treated separately and then assembled . <p> Extreme cooling and heating has a massive effect on the engines durability and reliability . <p> The cooling and heating of the metal aligns the ' metal molecules ' and allows them to be much more tightly packed together . This cooling and heating actually traps carbon atoms that do not have time to diffuse out of the crystal structure . <p> It forms a more symmetrical crystalline lattice which is much tougher than untreated metal . Known as a Martensitic structure this process has been used to strengthen blades and cutting surfaces and is now being applied to engine tuning . <p> It allows the head gasket and valves to seat better and this will also improve engine efficiency and power .

The relative cost to benefit ratio is fantastic and will give you a distinct advantage in the competitive motorsports arena allowing you to raise the bar of your engine power . <p> Not only will you gain power and a longer engine life you will also get better fuel consumption as the engine is more efficient with less internal friction .

@@24423908 @4423908/ <p> Dan you can not remap these ECU 'S . If your car is an import it is fitted with smaller 9b turbos which will never give 400bhp . Our best efforts are 370 bhp on 9bs. with standard 360cc injectors std intercoolers . auprated fuel press reg and the most important .. a good electronic boost controller . If your looking for 400 you need to change the turbos i 'm afraid for either the uk spec 3000gt units known as 13 g which are good for 425 max or aftermarket units . If your fitting bigger injectors you need something to control them and the stock ones are good for 400 horse anyway its the turbos that are not . Bruce <p> The stock clutch is on the limits at 400 bhp . The stock sidemounts will suffice as long as they are in good condition . You will need separate fuel and boost control .

Unfortunately it does n't work like that and if you try , you will be bitterly disappointed by how quickly your pistons melt .

@@24423914 @4423914/ <h> Catalysts - how do they work and what do they do ? <p> Some mistake the catalyst for a filter , it is clearly not . It merley causes a reaction in the exhaust gases that turn harmful emissions into more friendly ones . <p> In an ideal world a car engine would efficiently burn all the petrol supplied to the engine and emit nothing but carbon dioxide and water vapour . <p> Sadly , the internal combustion engine is not a very efficient beast , as a result several different pollutants are emitted in the exhaust gases . <p> Catalytic converters were made mandatory in the UK for all new cars from 1st January 1993 in order to reduce pollution . They are frequently blamed for a loss of power which is something we address in our sports catalyst article . <p> Catalysts are a dating agency for exhaust pollutants <h> What are the harmful components in exhaust fumes ? <p> The incomplete combustion of the petrol gives rise to carbon monoxide and various Volatile Organic Compounds ( VOCs ) . This problem is worst when idling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas . Volatile Organic Compounds are harmful to health and some are linked to cancer . <p> The very high temperatures in the engine ( over 1500C ) causes nitrogen from the air to react with the oxygen from the air to form nitrous oxides . These cause various problems , nitrogen dioxide for example reacts with the water in the atmosphere to form dilute nitric acid which gives rise to acid rain . <p> The action of sunlight on this mix of pollutants gives rise to photochemical smogs and the formation of other pollutants such as ozone . <h> So how does the catalyst convert these elements ? <p> You can think of your catalytic converter as a dating agency for exhaust pollutants , helping them meet their ideal partner and converting them to carbon dioxide and water vapour . Some of the chemical reactions that take place in the catalytic converter are shown below . <p> Above a standard Catalyst cross section and below a performance sports catalyst . You can see the sports cat flows much better and is less restrictive . Various grades of cell size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converter is a marvel of engineering design . When you turn on your engine it needs to cope with a rapid temperature rise of several hundred C in less than a minute . Operating temperatures are up to 1000C , on a highly tuned TorqueCars members engine this becomes more frequently at the upper end of this range . <p> The catalyst needs to make good contact with the exhaust gases without impeding its flow . The speed at which the exhaust gases flow means the catalyst has a matter of milliseconds to work its magic . <p> The answer is a ceramic lattice with around 400 channels per square inch coated with a mixture containing the precious metals platinum , rhodium and palladium as well as other metal oxides . <p> One of the main causes of damage to catalytic converters is high temperatures . The usual operating temperature is 150-600C , but misfiring and high driving speeds can lead to temperatures of up to 1000C . This damages the surface of the catalyst reducing its efficiency and in extreme circumstances can melt the ceramic . <p> Another problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sulphur in the petrol or phosphorous from engine oil can both permanently damage the effectiveness of the catalyst . <p> Please join us in our friendly forum to catch up with the latest trends in catalysts and exhaust systems for your car . 38242 @qwx238242 38233 @qwx238233 <h> Feedback 38237 @qwx238237 <p> iT would be hard .

@@24423916 @4423916/ <h> How to : Maintain your Paintwork . <p> This article is intended to serve as a guide on how to best maintain the paintwork of your vehicle . I 'll try to keep things as brief and user-friendly as possible but it 's perfectly possible to create whole guides just on individual areas ( such as machine polishing ) . <p> Let 's start at the beginning : <p> Washing Your Car <p> Sponges are evil . Remember that . All they do is trap dirt between themselves and the paintwork and become more like sandpaper : <p> You will need a good quality lambs/sheepswool or microfibre mitt . These trap dirt within the fibres and keep it away from the paintwork until you rinse it out . <p> Meguiars do a good quality lambswool mitt , which i use : <p> You will also need a shampoo of sorts to wash your car with . This is more to provide a lubricant when usurping any dirt rather than to have pretty bubbles or smell nice . Your mitt should be able to glide nicely over the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household detergent . Most will strip any protection from the paintwork and leave the surface dull . Some even contain salt which can cause corrosion ( ie rust ! ) . What you ideally want is a pH neutral shampoo to leave all of your lovely wax in tact . For example : Dodo Juice " Born to be Mild " . <p> You need to wash your paintwork with care . First , rinse the car . This is to remove as much loose dirt as possible before you even touch the car . Best done with a jetwash but can also be done with a hose . Keep jetwashes to low pressure to avoid blasting loose dirt and grit into the paintwork and scratching it . <p> Now ... have you ever heard of the " two bucket " method ? The idea here is to fill one bucket with your water/shampoo mix ( cold or warm is fine ) and another with just water . You first dip your mitt into the bucket with the shampoo in , then proceed to wash some of the car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then go back for more from the shampoo bucket . That way you have a bucket of dirty water to clean your mitt in and another to use clean water/shampoo to clean the car . You can get grit-guards but that 's not feasible for everyone . <p> Start from the roof and work your way down . The motion is n't important so much as the pressure . Apply light pressure not pushing too hard or " scrubbing " in one particular area as this usually creates scratches or swirls . Repeat until the whole car is washed including the wheels , keeping your mitt as clean as possible . <p> Now , rinse the car completely with a hose or jetwash on low pressure . Lovely . It is now advisible to dry your car with a microfibre cloth or drying towel , not a leather chamois . <p> You should wash your car at least once a week to keep the paint in top condition . <p> Claying <p> An additional step in cleaning your paintwork can be done by " claying " your paint . Rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that normal washing can not remove . Even on what you think is very clean paint , you will find that your clean clay bar gradually becomes dirty as above . <p> You need a clay bar and a lubricant . Water can be used but a proper lubricant is preferably . Meguiars do a good kit avaliable from Halfords etc . Knead the clay into a usable shape and then spray the lubricant on both the clay and on the panel to be clayed . Next gently rub the clay along the surface of the panel . You may feel it drag slightly as it picks up the contaminents , too much drag and you are not using enough lubricant and so risk damaging you paint . <p> Once the surface of the clay becomes dirty , re-knead it so you are using a clean part of the clay . And do n't forget to keep it lubricated . This is to avoid scratching your paint and prevent marring . Wipe the panel dry with a microfibre cloth , repeat throughout the whole car and then wash the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clay your car about once a year . <p> Polishing <p> In short , polish is an abrasive chemical used to remove surface grime and layers of clearcoat/paint from the vehicle . There is a huge range of polishes that vary in how abrasive they are , what they contain , how they are designed to be applied , etc etc . <p> You can either polish a car by hand or using one of two machines : <p> A Rotary Polisher : Rotates in one direction only , very easy to burn through the paint in all but the hands of an expert . Completely superceded by the existence of ..... <p> Dual Action polisher ( DA ) : The pad orbits randomly . This generates far less heat and is a lot kinder on the paintwork . Very easy to use and get good results , even for a beginner . <p> However , I 'll assume most people wo n't be interested in machine polishing their vehicle and full correction work . How to polish your car by hand : <p> 1 . Ensure your paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good quality foam applicator or microfibre cloth work the polish back and forth or round and round . ( or both ) . Direction is n't important . What is allowing enough time for the abrasives to properly break down and that the polish has been worked in firmly and evenly . The polish will generally turn clear or to a haze when it has broken down . 3 . Buff off with a microfibre towel . <p> Simples ! When polishing by hand I 'd recommend Autoglym Super Resin Polish as it is easy to get good results with using the limited hand polishing method . <p> Machine Polishing by DA : <p> Finish and correction ability over a large area is n't even comparable to applying by hand . DAS-6 is a good option if you want something that is good value . You need to polish small areas at a time ( 18 " x18 " for example ) for correction work and stay away from the edges of the panels where the paint is thinner . Apply light pressure and you want to be moving only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want to use the least abrasive polish and pad combo that still removes the defects if that makes sense . This will minimise the clearcoat/paint removal . Something like Dodo Juice Lime Prime is great at removing light swirls and minor defects . Anything more serious will need something with more cut . Megs #83 would be ideal . <p> You wo n't burn the paint with a DA and nothing too aggressive unless you 're a complete tool . There 's no need to keep the head wet with any modern polish ( not G3 for example ) in fact DO N'T keep the pads wet as it will affect the working of the polish and may lead to it splattering everywhere . If you are using a dry , dusty polish a couple of quick spritzes with water onto the pad is helpful though , but nothing more . <p> the mitt and shampoo can be picked up frm any motor factor type shop can they ? <p> what about wax and polish ? 38230 @qwx238230 <p> The mitts and a half decent shampoo can yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waxes and polishes . Avoid T-cut , there are much better things on the market . If you 're polishing by hand Auto Glym Super Resin Polish is the best easily avaliable all-rounder . As for wax some protection is better than none at all but generally speaking proper solid carnubua wax is better than that liquid spray on stuff . <p> and 1 for tjay56 the snowfoam is that the stuff i have seen that the people put on first and let dissolve the dirt ? ? if so where can you get it ? ? i openly admit car cleaning is n't my forte i like to leave the dirt to hide the defects <p> More added , need to change/add some of the pgarners pictures when I get round to it . Will split the polishing section in hand polishing and machine polishing once I 've written a brief segment about machine polishing . <p> They are a bit savage I agree . There 's one here at the Total garage where the rubber cone from the lance has gone walkies . If I hit the paintwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metal . <p> Last time I used as jetwash I plastered the car in the detergent foam firstly to soften the ' blow ' a bit . It looked like we 'd had freaky July snow <p> a mate borrowed a jet wash to do his car . cleaning the sills he got a bit too close to the car and off came the paint , so i try and stand a metre or so away if i 'm ever using a jet wash . that 's a metre from end of jet to the car .

The car has been built for motorway cruising and reliability which is why is seems " down " on power . I met a guy at the BHPperformance show who has had a supercharger fitted on standard engine internals . He had the M series which had BMWs uprated fuel and injectors .

I searched on the web for fast road cams , but there seems to be some concerns that you gain power at higher revs but loose low end torque . <p> I think the first step is to try and fit a heat shield around my cone filter , I already have a duct fitted to the front of the car , but its pulling in too much hot air from the engine as well . <p> Next thing I might look at is a free-flow exhaust . Once I can get cold air into the engine and hot exhaust gasses out easier would it then be time to tweek to it with a re-map ? <p> That looks nice ! I love the wheels ! A remap will not give much in the way of power gains - I think you would be dissapointed . A good cam selection will definately help power - see our articles on cams in the Tuning section and see what works best . A bad cam selection will make the car terrible in traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities tuning it could be intake manifold , and single throttle body injection . both available at dbilas dynamics:dbilas dynamics but that stuff happens to be expensive . <p> btw , the engine was " detuned " , i think every other bmw engine in this time had already 4 valves per cylinder . that should be the main reason of having little power . 
@@24423918 @4423918/ <h> Adding Turbo and Super to a single cylinder engine <p> Hello friends and automobile experts .... I am into my final year of graduation in Engineering and its this project that I am doing- " Implementation of Turbo &amp; Super Charger in a Single Cylinder Engine " . So , I would like to seek ideas and advices regarding this project .. Guys , do help me ... <p> I 'd love to see this project going ahead and wish you all the best but I do n't think it is practical . I ca n't see a way around the technical problems you will encounter . A supercharger is probably the way to go , but combining this with a turbo is pretty tricky , even if you stage them to overlap rather than coming on sequentially
