" <p> " There 's something obscene about our lust for sentimental suffering , in which the awful , meaningless deaths of children will become the fodder of tear-jerking tabloid pages , " he writes . " The cheap emotion of it distracts us from the hard work of real compassion , the daily grind of kindness .

At least one ofSince our chief deputy was here , he has armed security with him , and fortunately , they reacted immediately . Came out onto the field in harm 's way to try to fire back .

@@98412949 @2612949/ <h> The Creepy History Behind the Ouija Board " and Why Many Christians Warn to Avoid It At All Costs <p> Its Halloween , so its no surprise to see a few holiday themes trending on Twitter today . Among them : Happy Halloween , #BadHauntedHouseThemes and- #MyOuijaBoardSaid . <p> The hashtags have offered- up- some benign quips- throughout the day , though the- latter hashtag " which did employ- some jokes about the popular Ouija game that 's infamously known for terrifying Americans " - certainly deserves a bit more attention . <p> Ask yourself : How much do you know about the history behind the- Ouija Board ? As it turns out , despite gaining popularity- over the past 100 years , - the game- was apparently shrouded in mystery , with details only reportedly- coming to light in recent years due to the work of a historian named Robert Murch . <p> WHATS THE HISTORY ? <p> So , let 's start with the name " Ouija . " Murch , who specializes in tracing the origins of the board , - told the Guardian that the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peters ; she was reportedly using the board at a house in Baltimore , Maryland , one day in 1890 when she- asked the board what she should call it . <p> That 's when Peters reportedly received a response : " Ouija " " a word that apparently means- " good luck . " And , from there , the name stuck. - As it turns out , Elijah Bond , Peters brother-in-law , was among the original investors who came together to try to turn the idea into a product back in 1890 , the Smithsonian Magazine reported. - And on Feb. 10 , 1891 , - the Ouija Board- " which looked almost exactly like what toy stores sell today " was given a patent and- soon went on sale for $1.49 . <p> It was businessman and inventor William Fuld who soon aggressively marketed- the board . He was reportedly put at the helm of the Kennard Novelty Company , the boards first manufacturer , which figured out how to successfully sell it- to the masses . <p> Of course , at this point you might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to become to popular in the first place ? Before we continue , let 's go back a bit further to the late 1840s when spiritualism " the idea that the living and dead could communicate " gained popularity . It was this very development that paved the way for the popularity of the Ouija Board . <p> And its also that detail about its intended use " as well as the ongoing use of the board even today " that leads most Christians- to avoid engaging in it , as well discuss later on in this piece . <p> Spiritualism- was truly popularized , some say , by the- famous Fox sisters , who claimed they could connect with the dead ; they said the deceased would tap on the walls to communicate , and soon became well-known for their apparent spiritual antics . Others across the nation then tried- to replicate their model , as people " especially during the Civil War " became consumed with the idea of speaking- to deceased loved ones , as Smithsonian Magazine reported . <p> With people seeking easier methods and tools- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ouija Board started to come together , and , by 1886 , The Associated Press was reporting on the existence of a wooden board with letters , numbers and a device that would point to each tidbit to spell out messages . <p> Without getting into too many of the details ( and in case you do n't  know much about the board ) , the idea is that two or more people touch a planchette ( a device that sits on the board ) , with that device purportedly then moving to letters of the alphabet to spell out messages . Some believe those messages come from the spirit realm , and not from people moving- the- planchette . <p> Or , as the patent from 1891 reads : " The operation is as follows : The table is placed upon the board , and the hand of the Operator is lightly laid or held on the table , when in a few moments the table will move and point to certain letters on the board , spelling and forming sentences , answering questions put by the operator or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> A carved Donald Trump pumpkin on display at Rise of the Jack OLanterns at Los Angeles Convention Center on October 13 , 2016 in Los Angeles , California . ( Photo by Tara Ziemba/Getty Images ) <p> Let 's start first with the creepy details . First and foremost , legend has it that the board was taken to the U.S. Patent Office and that it was demonstrated to work " something apparently required in order for the patent to be issued . There 's not much known about that event , but the fact that it was accepted as a product seems to indicate there was at least a perception of authenticity . <p> Second , Fuld apparently died in a freakish manner back in 1927 . His demise began while he was standing atop a- Ouija Board factory in Baltimore as he oversaw the replacement of a flag pole . It was on the roof that the iron support he was holding gave way , and he fell. - Fuld , though , reportedly grabbed onto an open window sill to try and save himself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed and he fell to the pavement below " but that 's actually not what killed him . While he broke some ribs , it was a bump he hit on the way to the hospital that sent one of his bones through his heart . <p> Oh , and equally creepy ? - He claimed at the time that the board had told him to build that very building he fell from . <p> Now , for the ironic twist : Peters , who apparently named the board , eventually came to hate it , telling everyone not to play with it , as she said it was prone to telling lies . Her stance was apparently shaped by a family rift after the board purportedly told her a member of her family stole some Civil War heirlooms ; it was a claim that forever divided her relatives . <p> Anyway , the boards origins as a tool to speak to spirits- quickly morphed into a game that groups and families would play . And , in 1966 , Parker Brothers purchased the board ; - the- company was later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sells the board to this day , appealing to the masses by marketing it as a tool with the power to connect them to the spirit world . <p> IS IT REALLY ALL FUN AND GAMES ? <p> But while many say the- Ouija Board is good ol- fun , others warn against using it , saying its akin to inviting in evil . Christian website GotQuestions.org warns Bible-believers to avoid playing the game at all costs , saying it is occultism and " is- definitely not an option for a Christian , " as it is " clearly forbidden in the Bible . " <p> " No matter how innocent Ouija boards may seem , playing with Ouija boards can be an opening for demons to invade our hearts and minds , " the website proclaims . <p> GotQuestions.org cites verses in Leviticus , Deuteronomy , Isaiah and Galatians as precluding believers from engaging . Leviticus 19:31 reads , - " Do not turn to mediums or seek out spiritists , for you will be defiled by them . I am the LORD your God . " <p> Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than spiritual encounters , people are instead experiencing something called the " ideomotor effect . " <p> Vox described this as " unconscious , involuntary physical movement , " and offered up a scientific theory . <p> But there are a multitude of stories from individuals who have played with the game and who claim that , as a result , they have experienced demonic forces that have profoundly impeded and impacted their lives . I 've personally spoken with countless individuals " some reluctant- to admit so publicly " who felt they needed to seek faith leaders help after using the Ouija board . <p> Again , not everyone will believe it . But either way , many faith leaders have made one thing clear : Christians should avoid the tool , whether or not they believe its real , as it does appear to be a form of engaging in occultism " - regardless of how fun or lighthearted it might seem .

It has since been taken around the world by The Jesus Film ministry , part of Cru ( formerly known as Campus Crusade for Christ ) . <p> And , remarkably , the nearly 40-year-old movie- has been translated into 1,500 languages , viewed by billions and has specifically- led 200 million people across the globe to become Christians " a pretty startling figure . In fact , the movie has been so rabidly translated that it was- recognized by- The Guinness Book of World Records in 2012 as the " Most Translated Film " in history . <p> Naturally , the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plethora of reasons . First , there 's the stunning notion that a decades old movie- can still- resonate so profoundly . But , beyond that , there are the countless stories of life change that continue to emerge as a result of the movies inspiring and transformational- content . <p> Josh Newell , director of marketing and communications for Jesus Film , recently told Faithwire about an- incredibly moving story- surrounding a Jesus film missions team that went into a rural area of the Andes to share the film with a people group that- was so separated from modern culture that its inhabitants- literally lived in the rocks . <p> " They were cliff-dwelling people ( the missionaries ) - along with a team went up to the rock people and were showing the JESUS film on a- 16mm set , " he said . " And people were literally crawling out of the rocks and , viscerally , you have this experience that you watch people that should n't be behaving like animals , ( they 're ) - people . " <p> But because The Jesus Film crew had translated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , which they had likely never heard before , came to life in a deeply profound way . <p> " As they watched the JESUS film and heard Jesus speak in their own language , it was more than movie at that point . It was a visitation of God and of hope into their lives , " Newell explained . " And over the course of the movie you can come see people become erect and stand differently and behave differently , and so life changes happening at a really personal level , but also at a societal level too . " <p> And that 's just one of the many stories the ministry has seen- inside communities across the globe , with Newell explaining that The Jesus Film has conducted- deep explorations into the impact the film has on communities in both Africa and India and has found that cultural practices surrounding alcoholism , sexual infidelity and other issues have actually been curbed as a result . <p> Right now , The Jesus Film is working on its- Mission 865 initiative , an effort aimed at reaching 865 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that do n't  yet have access to the " JESUS " movie . In sum , they represent 323 million people , with most of those individuals currently not being engaged with the gospel . <p> " Weve taken an approach recently in the last six years called Mission 865 and - in 2010 we identified the languages that needed a gospel tool in their language above a speaking population of 50,000 , " Newell explained . " Why 50,000 ? That cutoff - pretty much guarantees that you 're going to reach 99.7 percent of the worlds speaking population . The next 5,000 languages make up that next .3% . " <p> Newell , who estimated that there are 7,000 languages across the globe , said The Jesus Film ministry , from the start , has been systematic in how it has chosen its language translations . <p> " Weve taken a pretty systematic approach and have just chunked off the worlds largest speaking groups and so you start with the biggest ones : Tagalog , Arabic , Russian were amongst the first , and as time goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall under a million people , " he said . " Now you have to be fairly strategic about who it is you are going to go after because there are some languages that are spoken by a guy and his brother . " <p> The Jesus Film currently translates the movie into- around 100 languages a year , coming out with a new translation every three and a half days or so . And bringing these films to small and remote people groups is- clearly no easy feat , but as technology has changed , so have the tactics employed to- reach these remote people groups . <p> There are a variety of ways in which- the films are brought to these people , including solar-run backpack systems that missionaries can take into tough-to-reach locations . Despite the difficulties , Newell told additional stories of people encountering Jesus , tears welling up in their eyes as they visually see the gospel story unfold for the first time . <p> One of the key questions at the core of The Jesus Films success is how and why a movie that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The reason why it does live on is because its not predicated on sales , its predicated on the power of partnership , " Newell explained . " There is actual need for ministry tools that are easy to use in peoples heart language and in a way that lifts up Jesus very clearly and also fairly comprehensively , - because- its from the gospel of Luke , and one of the most biblically accurate movies about the life of Christ , so I think its kind of like that convergence that helps give it the lifespan .
