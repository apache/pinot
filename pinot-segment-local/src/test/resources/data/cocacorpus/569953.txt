Other times , it 's the near-panic attack of worrying that you missed something vital in your student 's education . <p> Some stress is normal , but no one wants to feel like that all the time " or even in that moment . The next time you 're feeling stressed , ask yourself these important questions . Hopefully , the answers will help you get a handle on homeschool-related stress . <h> 1 . Is it really that important in the grand scheme of things ? <p> Often , the quickest way to alleviate stress is to put the situation into perspective . Consider how important your current stressor is in the grand scheme of things . Your 12-year-old still struggling to read ? Yeah , that 's genuinely stressful . Your three-year-old is insisting on wearing leopard print pants with a rainbow striped shirt to co-op ? Not so much . <p> ( That 's a true story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photo I took has become one of my all-time favorites . That kid always has had her own sense of style . ) <p> Do n't stress over a lesson or two not getting completed this week . It 's not going anywhere . Even some of those things we think are a big deal often are n't . I stressed that my oldest never was going to get the hang of long division . We wound up putting the math books on the shelf until after summer break that year . When we came back , all of a sudden it just clicked with her . <p> Sometimes kids just are n't developmentally ready for a skill or concept . Other times , the lessons just need to percolate in their minds a bit . Over the years , I 've been quit being surprised by the fact that sometimes the quickest way for a kid to learn something is to put it aside for awhile . <h> 2 . What can I do about it ? <p> Sometimes , your current stressor really is something to worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often ease the stress by coming up with a plan . <p> When Josh was still struggling to read at age 12 , and I was fairly sure he had dyslexia , it was such a relief to discover Lexercise . He was tested and began therapy . The results were phenomenal . <p> When Brianna was struggling with math , and I was n't sure how to help , I enlisted the help of a friend who teaches math in public high school . They met once a week for tutoring until Brianna was back on track . <p> If some aspect of your child 's education is stressing you and it 's a legitimate concern , take an honest look at what you can do to rectify the situation . Do you need to hire a tutor ? Maybe it 's time to change curriculum . <p> A friend had a student who did n't score well on the math portion of her college entrance exam . Instead of stressing , they made a plan for shoring up math ( one-on-one time with Dad ) and worked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Even if you do discover that you 've overlooked something essential that your student needs to know , there are plenty of options such as tutoring , dual-enrollment , make-up time during school breaks , or one-on-one focused instruction . <h> 3 . Have I overscheduled ? <p> One of the biggest stressors for homeschooling moms is a packed schedule . I say that it took me years to learn the benefits of a 4-day school week , but looking back I realize I had an inkling early on . When Josh and Megan were both in music class , we did n't try to get our regular schoolwork completed on music class day . <p> Instead , we went to class , had lunch as a family or with friends ( Socialization 101 ) , and did nature study at a nearby park . While she waited on her siblings , Brianna hung out with the other older kids who were along for the ride . It was at music class where she learned to knit from a friend . I ca n't knit , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things happen when you build a little white space in your calendar . You do n't  need to fill every second with something . If you 've overscheduled to the point of stress , consider what could be eliminated or scaled back . <h> 4 . Do we need a break ? <p> Sometimes you just need a break . Other than building a make-up day into each week , one of the best things I ever did for my overall stress level was going to a year-round homeschool schedule . <p> Starting a new unit every six weeks and knowing that we had a break week within site at any time did wonders for our attitudes and sense of motivation . Even if a year round schedule does n't work for you , a few long weekends peppered into your homeschool calendar can be vital stress-relievers . <p> I usually go to bed on Sunday night thinking that I need at least one more day in my weekend to accomplish everything on my endless to-do list . A long weekend can provide that extra time and a much-needed opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical environment like ? <p> I find clutter extremely stressful . If I 've let the house or school clutter get out of hand , I have a hard time concentrating . That 's when that long weekend can come in handy . Get everyone to pitch in and help straighten up . ( Unless , like me , you find cleaning and organizing therapeutic , in which case feel free to work alone . ) <p> If you ca n't afford to take a long weekend , institute a life skills day . Not only is a life skills day a sanity-saver , but it teaches kids valuable skills like cooperation and household management . <h> 6 . What is going on in our lives ? <p> Sometimes stress is caused by things going on in our lives over which we have little or no control . Life events such as a birth , death , move , divorce , or new job are undeniable stressors on a family and its homeschool . <p> Guilty thoughts may arise when you consider the fact that if your kids were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrupt their education . While that may be true in some cases , your kids are n't in public school . Sometimes you just need to cut yourself some slack and take some time off . You may be surprised at how much your kids learn naturally by walking with you through life events . <p> You might try some homeschool sick day ideas , such as listening to audio books or watching documentaries . Those are ideal for low-key learning and helpful for keeping everyone occupied and on a predictable routine . <p> Do n't stress if even that does n't happen , though . What you 're going through wo n't last forever . The flexibility of homeschooling allows you to get back on track when everyone is mentally , physically , and emotionally ready to pick up where you left off . <p> What questions do you ask yourself to put things into perspective when you 're feeling stressed about homeschooling ? 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

My six-year-old nephew spent a few days with me recently. - One evening after dinner , we spent some time walking around my neighborhood . I was able to sneak learning into our walk simply by noticing and discussing the things around us . <p> Next time you take your young children on a walk around the neighborhood , see if you can naturally introduce some of these ideas .

Teach your child the real name for things . Its not just a flower ; its a tulip . That dog is a Husky . The neighbors tree is an oak tree . <p> This specific naming helps young children expand their vocabulary and helps them begin to see differences in the things around them . <p> What is your favorite way to sneak in a little learning as you walk around the neighborhood with your kids ? <p> You know what some of the most high-interest subjects with young kids are ?

@@108016736 @3416736/ <h> 5 Ways to Cope with Teen Apathy <p> Confession time : occasionally I get hyper focused on the belief my 13- and 14-year-old sons should care more about their direction in life . Maybe it 's because they 're both taller than me now . Maybe it 's because I often think of them as being older than they actually are . <p> Or maybe it 's because , after all these years of homeschooling , I still get stuck worrying how others tie my parenting ( and teaching ) to my sons ' attitude and performance . <p> After a recent mini freak out that began with one of my sons declaring that YouTubing was quite possibly his main career goal , and another son admitting all he really cared about was that his future place of employment had a night shift , I had to take a Mom Time Out . There was deep breathing . There was self-talk . There was also chocolate . <p> Youll be happy to know that instead of collapsing into a puddle of frustration , I actually had an epiphany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their future . I want them to think about where they really see their life headed after graduation . I want my sons to understand what incredible talents and abilities they have and use them to their fullest potential . <p> But seriously ? Let 's get real here . Is it normal for a 13-year-old to be mega concerned about their future , college plans , or what career path they should suit up for ? <p> Be careful how you answer because this is where I got tripped up . At 13-years-old , was any of this your main concern ? <p> If I 'm honest with myself , I have to answer no . Although junior high certainly brought its own set of responsibilities , and I gave occasional thought to the future , let 's be honest " one of my main concerns revolved around a recurring nightmare about forgetting my locker combination . <p> I also spent a lot of time wondering about the fate of an elementary friendship because my bestie was on the junior high cheerleading team and I was n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be when I grew up was n't nearly as concerning as whether or not I could get Totally Ca n't Even Remember His Name Now to look my way . <p> If I take the behaviors my sons are currently exhibiting " which as a mom , I sometimes misconstrue as complete apathy " and compare them to how I felt at the same age , I have to admit there are quite a few similarities . <p> Do you remember being that age ? Because in the grand scheme of things , it was n't that long ago . Are we really so removed from our teenage years that we do n't remember how it felt ? <p> So how do we deal with this parenting road bump ? Here are five tips to help : <h> 1 . Think back to when you were their age . <p> Remember life as a teen ? What did that look like ? What was in your room ? Who were your friends ? What was school like ? What did you do for fun ? What kind of music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you worried about ? And what things were n't anywhere near your radar ? <p> It does n't take me long to remember the sights and sounds and feelings of early teenagerhood . I remember getting to the age I just wanted to be in my room . I wanted to listen to music , play music and write . It had nothing to do with not wanting to be around my parents . It had everything to do with wanting to get further and deeper into my own things . I was exploring and working towards independence in my own way . <p> College ? Career ? The future ? Sure , I thought about it . But not nearly as much as I assume my boys should be doing at the same age . <h> 2 . Do n't assume that because you homeschool , your kids will be different . <p> Kids are kids . People are people . Some of us ( author included ) occasionally fall into the trap of thinking that because we homeschool , everything about our kids is going to be different. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's be honest " eye rolling and heavy sighs are not side effects of public school , nor is wanting to shut yourself in your room to work on your own stuff . <h> 3 . Serve up boundaries and expectations with a side of grace . <p> Just because your kids are growing and changing does n't mean you toss your hands up in the air and get rid of all boundaries and expectations . It 's still important your kids know the world is n't going to end if they have to wake up early to be somewhere . <p> It 's still important to discuss the possible paths your kid 's future might take . It 's still important to offer assistance in navigating the world when necessary . But if we take a moment to be honest , I think we 'll find that our kids ' occasional apathy is n't much different than any other kids ' occasional apathy , or ( gasp ) ours when we were the same age . <h> 4 . Focus on what your kids are doing . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  doing and fail to see what they are doing . I can get stuck on the fact my sons still ca n't rattle off some multiplication facts and fail to remember they were instrumental in setting up all the technology in my new office . Sometimes our kids are learning and preparing for the future , but it just looks completely different than what we think it should . <h> 5 . Respect the fact they 're becoming more of themselves and less of you . <p> These amazing creatures are growing and becoming who they are and who they will be right before your very eyes . They 're shedding the skin they 've been in and wrapping themselves in a new skin called Who I Am . Along the way , there will be misinterpretations , chaos , and stress , but you know what 's awesome ? You can be there to help them with it all . 148232 @qwx1008232 <h> About Amy Dingmann <p> Amy Dingmann lives in Minnesota with her husband where they have been homeschooling their two sons since 2007 .

You 're probably aware that the stereotypical image of a weird , unsocialized homeschooler does n't fit most homeschooled kids . However , if you 're new to homeschooling , have recently moved , or live in an area without an active homeschool community , you may have legitimate reasons to wonder how to help your homeschooler find friends . <p> I remember wondering the same thing eons ago when we were a new homeschooling family " and even more recently before Megan met her BFF . Over the years , I 've found resources that have worked us and other homeschooling families that I know . <p> 1 . Join a support group . An excellent way to get involved with local homeschoolers is to join a support group . Most organizations offer a variety of opportunities to get together , such as field trips , play dates , co-ops , and holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Search for homeschool support groups by state on Homeschool Legal Defense Associations Home School Organizations page . You can find more groups listed by county when you click on the link for your state . You can also go directly to your statewide support group 's website to find local listings or try searching your state name plus the keywords " homeschool support group . " <p> 2 . Check out online groups. - For many years , my local source of homeschool support was a Yahoo-based email group . It began with a few friends the first year we homeschooled . Within a few years , it grew into a huge group that became an incredible source for making friends , both online and off . The group moved to Facebook a few years ago , and I am now part of a few local homeschool groups through Facebook . <p> Check your local group 's website for links to their social media accounts or search for local groups directly on Facebook . One of the benefits of an online support group is that members can get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can accompany meeting in person for the first time . <p> Online groups are also a fantastic way of making connections with the homeschooling ahead of time if you 're going to be moving to a new area . <p> 3 . While most kids are at school , visit kid-friendly places . Head to your local playground , library , indoor play area , childrens museums , or other places where kids congregate . If there are school-aged children there during regular school hours , there 's a pretty good chance that they 're homeschoolers . Do n't  be afraid to ask . Weve made friends a few times that way . <p> 4 . Join classes or co-ops for homeschoolers. - While the emphasis may be on learning in these settings , there 's always a little time for kids to chat before or after class . Suggest a group play date or schedule something with the parents of a child or two that child clicks with . If you 've got older kids , you may not have to do much of anything . My teens usually come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some numbers in their cell phones for texting . <p> 5 . Host a get-together. - Whether its a book club , an art show , a nature club , or just a play date , if you invite them , they will come ( usually ) . If you 're not comfortable hosting an event in your home , try a local park , a kid-friendly restaurant , a library , or even a bookstore . Many bookstores are open to allowing groups to host book club meetings in their stores . <p> 6 . Go to homeschool events . Megan met her BFF at a homeschool dance hosted by a local organization . It was n't our support group , but a group that hosts social events for homeschoolers throughout the year . The girls had a few mutual friends , so they wound up hanging out chatting during the dance . Josh met his BFF at one of our early email-based group 's homeschool outings . ( His mom had gotten to know some of the other moms via email before their move here from out of state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know not everyone attends church , and you should n't go just to meet friends . However , we do attend church , and ours has been a fantastic place for meeting friends . Josh met his other BFF there , and it 's where Megan met her boyfriend . They also have lots of other friends in their life groups on Sunday morning and youth group on Sunday night . Because it 's a large church with students from a variety of local schools ( public , private , and home ) , we do n't have to deal with too much of the clique-iness that can happen when all the kids know each other from school . <p> 8 . Pursue hobbies . Pursuing your child 's hobbies can be a fantastic way for him to meet friends . Your kids will have opportunities to meet others with common interests while enjoying activities such as : <p> sports <p> drama and community theater <p> dance <p> homeschool or community classes such as art , photography , music , or baking <p> volunteering <p> 9 . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance , it was n't until her mom called and suggested a hang out ( or whatever you call it when they 're teenagers and too grown for play dates ) that they really cemented their friendship . The mom and I were acquainted through homeschool circles . When she learned that Megan and her daughter had talked and discovered some common interests , she called me and arranged a time for them to get together , and the rest is history . I think they 've spent the weekend at each other 's houses nearly every weekend since . <p> If your child hits it off with a potential friend at an event and they 're unlikely to see each other on a regular basis afterward , take the initiative to provide opportunities for them to get to know one another . <p> 10 . Maintain friendships . If you 're transitioning from public school to homeschool or moving to a new area , make an effort to maintain your kids ' current friendships . Arrange visits and play dates or let the kids chat over Skype or FaceTime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , text , email , or chat over Facebook . <p> Most kids just need an excuse to get together to start forming friendships . Fostering those friendships may take a little more work for homeschooling parents than it would for parents of children in a typical school setting , but the results are worth it . 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> This- " If your child hits it off with a potential friend at an event and they 're unlikely to see each other on a regular basis afterward , take the initiative to provide opportunities for them to get to know one another . " is key . I 've found that because I model organizing social gatherings for my children , they are now taking the initiative to plan their own gatherings . Theyre young enough that they still need my help , but often create , plan , and mostly execute clubs , playdates , and parties . The parent saying yes to the socialization is also a big part of all this ! <p> One of the best ways I have helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playdates . " Every Friday he has 2-3 kids that are siblings over . Every Thursday he goes over to another persons house . When you are n't  in school with the same kids every day , its hard to build the level of familiarity with other kids to make real friends . Occasional homeschool meet-ups do n't  cut it . And you have to be proactive , do n't  assume that other peoples kids already have too many friends . Often they are in the same boat as you . 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234 
@@108016743 @3416743/ <h> How to Make a Salt Dough Map <p> Easy and fun to make , salt dough maps are a great visual aid for learning the geography of a country and a fun , hands-on tool for making history come alive . <p> We like to make our maps on pizza boxes . Theyre sturdy , easily accessible ( most pizza places are happy to give you one if you just ask ) and the perfect size . <h> Ingredients Needed to Make a Salt Dough Map : <p> flour <p> water <p> one or two boxes of salt <p> a map of your country , enlarged to 11X17 <p> tape <p> a pencil <p> a Sharpie marker <p> paint <h> How to Make a Salt Dough Map : <p> Step 1 : Color the entire back of your map with a lead pencil to make the transfer to the pizza box easier to see . <p> Step 2 : Lightly tape the map , pencil-shaded side down , to the inside of the pizza box ( note from experience : do n't  use packing tape ! ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . <p> Step 3 : Remove the map to reveal a light pencil outline . Trace this outline with the Sharpie marker . <p> Step 4 ( optional ) : Spray paint the inside of the pizza box blue to create an ocean effect . If yours is a land-locked country , you might want to use a tan or green color to indicate land . You can paint over the Sharpie marker . As long as you do n't  paint heavily , the outline will still be visible . <p> Step 5 : Mix equal parts flour and salt together to make the salt dough . Mix just enough water to create a dough that is a Play-doh-like consistency . I usually use the entire box of salt , approximately 3-4 cups . <p> Place the dough on the pizza box and shape into the outline . When you 're finished , you can build the dough up to depict mountains and valleys , using a topographical map as a guide . <p> While most of your map should be basically to scale , having traced a printed map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , Brianna added The Leaning Tower of Pisa to our map of Italy ( its the brown protrusion you 'll see ) and she added Mt . Fuji to Japan last year . <p> You can also add toothpicks at points of interest , to which you can later add labels to make flag markers . <p> Step 6 : Place the map in the sun for several hours to dry or place in the oven on 200 degrees ( F ) . If you use the oven , be sure to supervise carefully since you 're baking a painted pizza box . The dough should become hard enough that it does not " give " when you press on it . <p> Step 7 : Paint your map ( we use tempera or acrylic paint ) . <p> That 's it ! You now have a wonderful tool for studying your country of choice and a really awesome keepsake of your studies .

Thanks for a great tutorial ! <p> I originally used salt maps when I home educated my four children almost thirty years ago .

@@108016750 @3416750/ <h> 10 Fabulous Homeschool Field Trip Ideas <p> June 28 , 2016 By Kris Bales <p> Field trips are one of the best hands-on learning opportunities around . The best part about homeschooling is that you can go on field trips as often as you like with no limits ( other than financial restraints ) on how far you can go . <p> As you 're planning your upcoming school year , be aware of opportunities to take your learning on the road by planning homeschool field trips- to tie in to the topics you 're studying or just for fun ! - Need some ideas ? Some of our favorites have included : <p> 1 . K-9 demonstration . Two officers from our local police department came to a church gym that wed secured for the day and brought their K-9 partners . That was such a cool experience ! The officers did several different demonstrations and we learned about how the dogs are trained . I highly recommend setting up a demonstration with your local police station if they have police dogs . <p> 2 . Doughnut shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever for one of our groups field trips. - I mean , really , a doughnut shop . Need I say more ? We got to see the entire process of how the doughnuts were made " and we all got a free doughnut ! <p> 4 . TV stations. - I think we managed to hit all three major network affiliates in our area " and we learned something every time . Once we went specifically to visit- the meteorologist and learn about the weather . This is especially interesting- during hurricane or tornado season , when your kids can learn more about severe weather events . <p> 5 . Radio stations . As with TV stations , it 's fascinating to see what goes on behind the scenes at the radio stations we listen to every day . <p> 6 . Coca-Cola Bottling . We did this- very early in our homeschooling journey , but it 's still one of our- most memorable field trips . I 've never seen a place as clean as that Coca-Cola plant . - It was fascinating to learn how- the cans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have a Coca-Cola plant near- you , any beverage bottling plant would probably be similar " except , you know , they wo n't give you yummy Cokes at the end . <p> 8 . Walking tours . One of my favorite field trips was a walking tour of our city . So often we miss the learning opportunities that are all around us , especially as relates to the history and interesting sites in our own city . A walking tour slows you down and allows you to catch things you miss when you 're driving- through . <p> 9 . Grocery stores . It 's often a joke that homeschoolers can turn a trip to the grocery store into a field trip , but we really have gone on an official grocery store field trip . It was arranged through The Field Trip Factory , a nifty little site with all sorts of field trip opportunities . We learned about nutrition and food safety , - and the kids got to taste test a variety of fruits and vegetables . <p> 10 . Zoos and aquariums . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about animals , habitats , and geography . One time , we took a map of the world and tried to find at least one animal from each continent . You could get really creative and put together a little scavenger hunt or bingo board for your next zoo or aquarium visit , too . <p> Gregg Harris has a great book called A-Z Guide to Homeschool Field Trips that makes a great homeschool field trip resource. - I think it 's out of print now , but if you can get your hands on a copy , I highly recommend it . It lists all sorts of ideas for places you can go " and places you might be going anyway , such as the doctor or dentists office . <p> The book also suggests lots of questions students might want to ask and topics you might want to research further after the trip. - Those question ideas are perfect for avoiding the uncomfortable silence that so often follows the inevitable query , " Does anyone have any questions ? " <p> What are some field trips that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> We live very clost to a tv station and several radio stations , yet I never even thought of going on a fied trip there . I guess I always thought those places were off-limits to us plebians . : ) We also have a Pepsi bottling company near us , along with Nestle and Josh Earle Candy Company . I never thought of going there , either . Did you call ahead of time to set something up ? <p> Those are all great ideas ! ! We love field trips and have gone on a bunch of very fun ones . Recently I set one up with our local public transporation company and it was awesome ! Thank you for sharing your ideas . : ) <p> These are such great ideas ! We love a bakery , too ! We 've watched donuts falling off the machine belt and helped add sprinkles . Nothing like a fresh , warm donut to make a memory solid ! ! ! <p> Volunteering at pet centers or the vet is a real eye opening e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit over the years Houston , Denver , Dallas , Tulsa , Austin . and so every time I call around . We have one that wants to be a vet now ! <p> Your imagination is the limit ! Call and ask . Most companies are excited to have someone interested in what they do all day ! We take this into consideration when we travel as well . Once in Morocco , the kids helped the local kasbah baker bake bread . Now THAT was awesome and of course we had to compare and contrast the experience there vs the experience we had our local bakery . I taught language arts for 15 years in the public school system and my favorite activities after any outing involve writing ! : ) 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

@@108016759 @3416759/ <h> Chemical Reactions with Seashells <p> One of our favorite family vacation destinations is the beach . I just love it ! The sand , the waves , and the sun are all glorious . I just ca n't get enough ! <p> When we do take- a trip to the beach , we usually spend as much time in the sand and water as possible . We dig in the sand , snorkel in the shallow water when the waves are calm , jump the waves when they are high , and nap under our beach canopy when needed . <p> One of our favorite things to do as a family on the beach is collect shells . We find them on early morning walks on the beach and as they wash up throughout the day . By the end of our vacation , we usually have a sand bucket full of them . <p> When we get home , we sort them according to their types . We sometimes use a shell guide to try and identify them . We might also put them in jars to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use them for a chemistry experiment ! <h> What Is A Seashell ? <p> Who is n't mesmerized by shells being washed up on shore by the crashing waves ? Their shapes and colors make them like treasures pulled from the deep mystery of the ocean . Collecting shells on the beach can be addicting . You never know what the next shell might look like . <p> But what are seashells ? <p> Seashells are exoskeletons formed by soft-bodied mollusks such as oysters and clams for protection from the environment and predators . These mollusks secrete a material made mostly of calcium carbonate which builds up and hardens to create the shell . As the animal grows , more shell is created . <p> Some people think of the shell as the home of the mollusk . This is kind of true . The animal does live in its shell . However , the shell is actually attached to the animal 's body , so the animal can not leave the shell unless it dies . These are the empty shells we find on the beach . <h> Seashells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition of something , we test it . Doing various simple chemistry experiments and tests can positively identify some substances and rule out others . An easy test for the presence of calcium carbonate uses vinegar . <p> Place a shell in a glass and add enough vinegar to cover the shell . Observe . <p> See the bubbles accumulating on the surface of the shell . These are carbon dioxide bubbles created by the chemical reaction between calcium carbonate , a base , and acetic acid in the vinegar , an acid . The shell is breaking down in this process . If you leave the shell in the vinegar for a few days , the vinegar will visibly breakdown the shell . Whatever is left of the shell would be thin and brittle . <p> Geologists use this type of test to determine the presence of limestone in rock . Limestone contains calcium and will react to an acid in the same way . <p> Try this easy experiment at home to see how the calcium in seashells react to acid or test rocks with acid to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , homeschool mom , science geek , softball coach , ice rink mom and blogger , who needs her morning coffee , hair done and make-up on before attempting of those things .

My daughter has a bucketful of shells from when she went to Atlantic City with my brother in the basement . I love that we have something to actually DO with them now . And I had no idea that the shells were attached to their bodies .

@@108016760 @3416760/ <h> How to Make a 3D Model of the Skin <p> This 3D model of the skin is simple , inexpensive , and very effective in helping younger students to understand the layers of skin. - Most of the items used can be obtained from around the house and you could easily substitute some with something you already have . The kids loved these models and they can be done by little as well as big hands ! <h> Supplies Needed for Making a 3D Model of the Skin : <p> Thick sponges or foam cut into a square <p> Pipe cleaners <p> Rubber bands <p> Raffia <p> Toothpicks <p> Paper lunch bag or grocery bag <p> Labels " pre-made and cut <p> Hot glue gun <p> Scissors <h> How to Make a 3D Model of the Skin : <p> Step 1 : The first thing you will do is take your sponge and cut it into a square about 5 ? on each side , making sure your sponge is at least 2 ? in height. - If you buy the thick sponges from a dollar store , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them rectangular if you would like but I felt it made a better model being square in shape . This will be the dermis layer . <p> Step 2 : Cut your paper bag into a single layer square that matches the size of your sponge or foam. - You will lay this over top of the sponge and tack it down with glue on the center and corner edges. - This will be the epidermis layer . <p> Step 3 : Using scissors , cut the pipe cleaners into about 1 ? sections. - ( I used brown to demonstrate the color of hair " your kids may enjoy matching the colors to their hair color. ) - Stick the pipe cleaners sporadically around through the paper bag side of the sponge or foam , as shown in the photo . You should n't need any sort of glue if you stick them down deep enough . This will represent the hair follicles . <p> Step 4 : The next step is to take a different colored pipe cleaner ( I used yellow ) and roll it around as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glue it to the side cross-section you are creating . Ours took about a 2 ? section of pipe cleaner . <p> Step 5 : Taking a blue and a red colored pipe cleaner about 2 ? long , twist them together so that they resemble an intertwined vine . Next hot glue them on to the side of the sponge as well . Use the photo for reference on placement . This represents the blood vessels . <p> Step 6 : Using a 1 ? piece of raffia , take your scissors and carefully split it down the center a little ways so you can fray it . Hot glue this to the side as well . This represents the nerves . <p> Step 7 : Taking a 1/2 ? rubber band ( I used green ) , draw a black dot on one end with a permanent marker and then with scissors split the end just a little bit and pull the split apart a little . Hot glue this to your side cross section . This represents the touch receptor . <p> Step 8 : Taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag covering and make additional holes all around the bag. - These will represent pores for the skins epidermis . <p> Step 9 : Lastly , using toothpicks where needed , hot glue the labels on and place them accordingly. - The cross section items should be able to have the labels hot-glued directly onto them . Use the photos for reference on placement and labeling . <p> When you are done , you will have a very nice looking 3D cross-section of skin ! <p> Colleen Leonard can be found at Solagratiamom where she blogs about her classical education adventures with a creative twist !

I Want to Be Homeschooled . <p> October 25 , 2016 By Kris Bales <p> I know the homeschool nay-sayers will think Im making this up , but it is not uncommon for me to hear from kids who want to be homeschooled but do n't  know how to broach the topic with their parents . If that 's you , try these tips . <h> Talk to your parents . <p> Every parent is different , so I ca n't speak for all of us , but I 'd say that most parents want to know what 's going on with their kids . Talk to them . Your parents may have no idea you 'd like to be homeschooled or maybe you 've mentioned it before , but they did n't realize you were serious. - Start the dialogue . <p> Wait until a time when they can give you their full attention . Teens , particularly , like to talk about important topics late at night . I 'll speak to my kids anytime they need to talk about something that 's weighing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they 'd approach me when I 'm still coherent . <p> Some good times to talk may include : <p> In the car when you 're running errands together <p> At the dinner table <p> On a parent-kid date night <p> Sometimes my kids find it easier to broach an awkward topic when we 're not face-to-face , so you might consider sending your parents a text or a Facebook message or leaving them a note letting them know that you 'd like to talk or even giving them a little heads-up about the topic . <h> Let them know why you want to be homeschooled . <p> Homeschooling is not a decision to be made lightly or on a whim . Being solely responsible for your child 's education puts a lot of pressure on parents . If you really want to be homeschooled , your parents will likely want to know why .

Be open with them about what 's on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you struggling academically or not being challenged ? <p> Would you like more control over your education ? <p> Would you like the opportunity to study something specific that is n't offered at school ? <p> Is there a problem with a particular teacher ? <p> Are you being pressured about alcohol , drugs , or sex ? <p> I know some of those topics can be difficult to talk with your parents about , but the vast majority of parents really want to know when things like that are going on . They 'll want to work with you to determine the right solution , even if it 's not homeschooling . <h> Find out what their objections are . <p> Many parents probably are n't going to immediately jump on board with homeschooling . Find out what their objections are . Some parents do n't feel qualified to teach their kids . Others worry that their kids are going to miss out on some of the rites of passage of growing up in a traditional school setting . <p> You can find- solutions to most common homeschool objections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are co-ops , online classes , and tutors . You may be a very motivated student who can direct the majority of your own learning . <p> If you can find out what your parents objections to homeschooling are , perhaps you can brainstorm to overcome them or work out a solution with which everyone is comfortable . <p> If you want to be homeschooled , but do n't  know how to talk to your parents about it and I have n't addressed your concerns , leave them in the comments .

I started browsing through curriculum websites just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year later , after some more prodding by my son and some school-related issues , we finally took the plunge and I 'm so glad we did . <p> The point I 'm trying to make is , even if your parents do n't  immediately jump on the bandwagon does n't  mean they are n't  contemplating it or that it will never happen . There 's always hope ! <p> This is such a great article Kris ! I always have my sons friends saying , " I wish I was homeschooled ! " or " Will you homeschool me too ? " I 've even had other parents ask if I 'd homeschool their kids lol ! <p> Excellent post . So often we see the initial interest stemming from the parents but forget that there are two parties involved in the homeschooling adventure .

Sometimes we parents are lost in our own world and do n't  see right away and this gives the kids a way to take the initiative . <p> I get this from just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great resource for kids looking to bring the topic up to their parents .

I think we homeschool moms can be pleased by the simple things in life sometimes . I thought it would be fun to compile a list of the little things that can make a homeschool mom happy with a couple of big ones thrown in for good measure . <p> 1 . A library with Wi-Fi . A couple of weeks ago , I took Megan to a social event at a local library . I was wondering what I was going to do for two hours since there are n't too many places to hang out in that particular part of town . I really had some things I needed to work on online , so I took my laptop hoping they had Wi-Fi , but knowing that there were things I could work on off-line if they did n't . <p> I ca n't even tell you how happy it made me to discover they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet library alone for two hours . <p> 3 . Those ah-ha moments . I ca n't imagine there 's a homeschool mom around who does n't relish those moments when a kid fully grasps a new concept for the first time . <p> 4 . Independent learners . This one makes me so happy ! We 've been at this homeschooling thing for over 11 years now . My youngest two are both in middle school and I 'm finally seeing the fruit of all those years invested in building the foundation to move them to independent learning . <p> Moms of littles , hang in there ! The day will come when they do n't need you for everything . <p> 5 . Homeschool conventions . They 're mom socializationwith books . <p> 6 . Enjoying the read-aloud as much or more than the kids . I would read The Adventures of Robin Hood even if something happened and the kids did n't have to finish it . <p> 7 . A clean house . <p> 8 . Folded laundry . Those two seconds when the laundry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day at home alone . <p> 10 . An evening out friends . <p> 11 . Take out . <p> 12 . Flowers to brighten the schoolroom ( which may or may not also be the dining room or some other main living area of the house ) . <p> 13 . A beautiful spring day . <p> 14 . Chick-Fil-A tea . ( That might just be me . ) <p> 15 . The smell of new books . <p> 16 . Freshly-sharpened pencils ( or a brand-new box of crayons " or just new office products , in general ) . <p> 17 . When the hands-on project or science lab turns out just like you expected . <p> 18 . The UPS truck . <p> 19 . The first day of school . <p> 20 . The last day of school . <p> 21 . A snow day . <p> 22 . A field trip that someone else planned and organized . <p> 23 . Little checks by all the boxes on the lesson plans . <p> 24 . When the dog eats the lesson plans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <p> 25 . Spending all day with your favorite people in the whole world ( with the possible exception of your husband because , you know , you 've got to pay the bills somehow ) . 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> Great list ! I love those a-ha moments there 's just something amazing about seeing your kids eyes light up when they get it . <p> I 'd add quiet mornings to my list . I 'm not usually a super-early riser but those times when I manage to get up first I relish those few minutes of peace and quiet ( my kid is a full-throttle talker the minute she 's awake ! ) . <p> To go along with folded laundry , I 'd have to say folded laundry that 's put away where it belongs . I also love those rare , brief moments of utter silence when all I can hear is the dryer going and the crickets chirping . Paradise ! <p> Agreed ! Spontaneous moments when you realize your child learned something a while back , AND remembered it , AND applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . My oldest , who is 5 , told me the other day " Mom , I want to quit lying , but I just ca n't ! " It was an amazing confession and realization on his part , and very random ! <p> Loved the simplicity of this listreally , the simple pleasures are the best . Thank you for writing so clearly , concisely , appropriately and practically . I love reading here . Truly one of my favorite blogs .. you have a great handle on the teens and I 'm in the middle of that ! ! Two there and two to come . <p> I love this list ! What makes me happy is when he shares something he s learned with others . He gets excited and cant wait to tell his grandparents , uncles and friends some cool **32;42;TOOLONG . I know he not only got it but also loved learning it . <p> I 'd add coming back home on the odd and rare occasions I go out without the family , to five children who throw themselves at me telling me Im @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , and then proceed to talk nonstop filling me in on all their news ( that might have occurred in the hour or so Ive been gone ) . When they have finally finished their renditions , I am able to finish walking through the door ! I always marvel at how key both their father and I am in their lives and I thank God for the privilege of being at home all day with these amazing little human beings . <p> Yes , definitely that . I 've got to tell you , not to make light of your remark ( because I 'm not ) , but that scenario immediately made me think of my dog when I 've been away a couple of days . Its really funny . I 've learned not to be wearing anything that he could pick with his claws , because he will literally climb me like a cat on a tree if I do n't  acknowledge him quickly enough . I think he would cry tears of joy if he could . The kids often have to wait until he s had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what I needed to hear right now ! I guess I have too high expectations about my kids becoming independent learners right away . Oops . I guess its a process , like everything else wo n't happen overnight . So thank you for the encouragement ! For me , this first year has been hard . But when I hear my kids tell their cousin ( who is the same age and in school ) about ancient Greece and how cool all that was , I know then they are learning for life . : - ) <p> Yes , I love #4 ! It seemed like the day would never come when I could expect the level of independence I 'm seeing in my kids now . I 'm still directly guiding them maybe 60% of the time , but that continues to decrease . Its amazing having some time during the day when they 're working independently and I can work with relative peace and quiet . <p> I loved this list , Kris ! I 'd have to say that living just 3 blocks from the beach makes me happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ) We usually head to the beach for math and reading for our two youngest at least 3-5 times a week . It is truly my happy place : ) <p> When my husband takes ALL the kids out on errands I am in heaven with the house to myself ! And erasers ? A new box of those is like gold ! As for the best re-charge ? Morning workouts ! I function so much better when I take the time to schedule in time for just me . <p> It is certainly not my intent to alienate homeschool dads . I 've met plenty of homeschool dads at curriculum fairs , so I typically do n't  assume moms are the only at-home parents . However , I 'm already taking a leap when I speak as though I 'm speaking for all homeschool moms . Its very likely that I have n't a clue what makes homeschool dads happy . : ) <p> Thanks for this . I 'm certain the exact same things make homeschooling Moms happy also make homeschooling Dads happy ie. independent self-led learning , genuine progress , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creations become more and more complex . <p> And we have the same fears and doubts too . Some days we drown in them , other days we march forward with confidence . <p> Ive been saying " do n't  forget about us Dads " since the first meeting we ever had with a doctor when we were expecting our first baby . I feel very invisible sometimes despite playing a very keen and hands on role in parenting . <p> Keep up the good work and make sure you slip as many Dad/parent references as possible ; ) 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

Focus on diligence , not progress . <p> The first time through I kept focusing on progress . Were we at grade level , were the kids ahead , were we on schedule ? The moment we fell behind , I started to push . Maybe we can double up lessons , do a page a day . <p> Work , work , work , we have a schedule to keep ! <p> And you know , it did n't  work .

Sure the progress has been slow , but its been steady . <p> And I stopped calculating how quickly we can finish the book . <h> 2 .

We have been doing Level 2 in Early Modern this year and I really like it . I love that all the worksheets and maps are right there . I wanted to mention a few things that I have done . <p> First , I did order the e-book .

So , I try to get some of them from the library on CD . In fact , my kids just listened to Kidnapped by RL Stevenson on a trip to PA and back . <p> Finally , I am getting frustrated with Kingfisher . I like that it acts as a kind of timeline , but some of the individual topics are very choppy and hard to make sense of . This is not a complaint with Pandia Press . There is not much out there that is comprehensive enough . I ended up buying a World History textbook so that some of the readings would make a little more sense . Often I will get other library books out , but sometimes I ca n't find one appropriate to the subject . <p> Thank for the review ! I 'm looking forward to doing Modern Times next year . <p> Great idea about the books on CD . Do n't know why I did n't think of that .

Then , when the school year rolls around , you can transition the morning learning time to more formal learning activities if you decide to homeschool . <p> One thing to remember is that homeschool groups often suspend the majority of their activities during the summer months , too , due to vacations and crowded venues .

@@108016796 @3416796/ <p> Ed Emberlys Picture Pie is one of those experiences I 've been anxiously looking forward to introducing . At age 8 or 9 , I discovered the book in the arts and crafts section of the library and ( as dramatic as it sounds ) that book , plus some scraps of construction paper changed the way I thought about shapes . Experimenting with circles to create my own designs " shaped " the beginnings of an artist in me and kept me occupied for days . I even remember designing a set of homemade Picture Pie-inspired " stationary " for my grandmas Christmas gift . <p> Ed Emberlys old-school idea book is so fun for an afternoon of craft time with the kiddos , or even a sneaky-mommy math lesson . The sample art ideas are perfect for manipulating circles , creating patterns , and visualizing fractions . <h> Supplies for hands-on math activities <p> To turn this activity into a math learning experience for all ages , we gathered : <p> Cutting circles with punches is of course optional , but will save a lot of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of circles from different colored card stock scraps . And though we only used a handful during our supplemental " math " lesson , my kids have enjoyed Picture Pie long past the initial activity , so its nice to have a stash of already punched circles available . Turn on a Netflix re-run , scoop a bowl of ice cream , and get the punches out after the kiddos are in bed . ( Yes , this is a peek of my life and what I do in my " spare " time ! ) <p> Since Picture Pie walks kids through the steps of creating designs with circles , exactly how you proceed with your math activity will depend on the age/level of your kids . But I 'll show you what I did with my 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9-year olds . <h> Math activities for a three-year-old <p> She loves " school " and wants to be involved in everything the big kids are doing , so I have to get creative and adapt activities to include her . We practiced preschool concepts by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine-motor skills to glue . Give this girl a glue stick , and she 's easily occupied for 10 minutes ( or more ) while I work with the older kids . <h> Math activities for a five-year-old <p> She loves all things animals and was immediately drawn to the dog and cat samples in the book . And since she insisted they were her favorite and was not able to complete the semi-complicated designs on her own , I went ahead and helped with the cutting and arrangingletting her just glue and embellish the little pet shop . <p> This circle-gluing activity is also a fun way for this age to practice creating repeating patterns . Just make sure you have various colors and/or sizes available for pattern-making . <h> Math activities for seven- and nine-year-olds <p> We reviewed what each fractioned " pie " slice looked like , and discussed and manipulated the pieces to kinesthetically review fractions . Then I turned them over to create . I love the intricate kaleidoscope-like designs featured in the book . <p> Pam Odd is a homeschooling mom of five , graphic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life she taught first grade . She believes we all have some spark of creative ingenuity in us and because of that , every day life " even with potty training , electricity bills , and dirty dishes " can be creative .

I used the drawing books in my fourth and fifth grade classrooms , and my students enjoyed using them when they had finished other assignments .

" - Anna Botsford Comstock , Handbook of Nature Study <p> Each week , when we do our nature study , - I wonder if this will be the week when we really do n't  see much when its really uninteresting. - And , each week , I leave thinking that this weeks nature study was better than the week before. - I really never dreamed that our nature study time would become our favorite time of the week . <p> Weve been following the Outdoor Hour Challenges from Handbook of Nature Study. - Its suggested that , if you 're just starting , you do at least the first five lessons , then , join in wherever the group is. - It just so happened that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lesson 4 is to choose an areas of focus. - Since the current nature study challenge series is trees and this is the perfect time of year to study trees ( or , at least , my favorite , as all the leaves will be beginning to change soon ) , we chose trees as our focus area . <p> An especially cool thing about the nature center that we go to is that there is a section where most of the trees are labeled with their common name and scientific name. - Additionally , many of them are also labeled with their Cherokee name in the Cherokee alphabet and with what the tree was used for by the Cherokee. - It had been my plan to let everyone choose whichever tree they wanted in the same general area , but , after discussing it a bit , we decided to all study the same tree . <p> We chose our tree for a few reasons. - First and foremost , because the tree is not native to our area. - It was planted at the nature center somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it would be really cool to study a tree that we cant find anywhere else in our area. - The second reason we chose this particular tree was because its in the meadow that sits just before the various trails split off. - So , if we want to observe the tree for a bit , then , go off on a trail to do something else , it will be easy to do so . <p> So , are you dying to know what tree we chose ? - Its a dawn redwood ( metasequoia glyptostroboides ) . - It was n't until I looked it up to get the link that I realized one more really cool thing about this tree its a deciduous conifer ! - I never knew there was such a thing. - So , it has cones , but well also get to watch the leaves change color this fall ! <p> It was really neat to read the online description of the dawn redwood , because I noticed that , amateurs though we are , we noticed a lot of neat things about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as : <p> Its feathery , fern-like leaves : <p> Its cones : <p> And its stringy bark that grows horizontally on bulk of the trunk , but vertically and almost swirl-like near the base : <p> Another thing we noticed was its odd , pyramid-like shape , which I never could get right on my sketch. - Before I show you my journal entry , I refer you back to the quote at the top of last weeks nature study post. - I figure that you can at least tell what most of it is supposed to be. - With the tree , I was only trying to get the shape of it sketched , since I knew trying to sketch a realistic tree would be more than my not-so-artistic , perfectionist nerves could handleand I still got frustrated ! <p> As you may notice in my journal entry , we also saw a blue jay , several cardinals , and a chipmunk , but I could n't get a picture of them . <p> The caretaker of the property , who is of Cherokee descent , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped to talk to us about the trees for a bit. - Later , when we sat at some picnic tables to draw , he began pointing out the chestnut hulls to us. - We had no idea what they were until he showed them to us. - He found some that still had the chestnuts in them. - There seemed to be two or three chestnuts to a hull . <p> Then , he cracked one of the nuts to get the meat and cut off chunks for us to taste ! - They were very moist , unlike the chestnuts I 've had from the store. - I do n't  know that I was crazy about the taste , but what a cool experience . <p> He also showed us the blue jay , woodpecker , and red-tailed hawk feathers ( which are covered under the eagle feather law , so you wont be seeing one of them in my possession ) hed collected : <p> After talking a bit , he showed us the dream-catcher that hed made. - When I commented to Megan that the inside looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was supposed to be. - Then , he asked if we knew the story of the dreamcatchers. - We did n't  , so he told us. - It was really cool because he told it with such knowledge and familiarity the stories of his ancestors . <p> I also discovered this creepy little guy crawling across my journal : <p> The best I can tell , he s a jumping spider , in the family Salticidae. - I would try to offer you a specific species , but after looking at a few dozen pages of hairy-looking , eight-eyed spiders , I got a little creeped out , so you 're officially on your own for that one . <p> It was a very cool day at the nature center ! - I cant wait to see if next week can top this week ! 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> Ok , can I come hang out with you ?

So entirely cool . I lived outside Atlanta a few years ago and this is as far north as I 'm going here in KY ! <p> You do n't have to roast them first . They can be eaten raw . However , the guy said that he 'd collected tons and tons of them for an upcoming Native American festival , where they will be roasted . I would hazard to guess that roasting them would make them taste better . <p> He and Megan collected a small bag full of chestnuts in and out of the the hulls ( or burrs ) for Megan to take and show her friends . I 've considered attempting to roast them . <p> @ Mamosa My kids really enjoy it . Megan grumbles some when we 're not going to go " hiking .

Nature study time is supposed to be a privilege and kids who do n't want to willingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> Of course , that is for a classroom setting , so I 've told Megan , when she grumbles ( and it would apply to anyone else ) , that I can bring her regular schoolwork and , if she does n't want to participate in our nature study , she can just do her regular work while everyone else does nature study . That usually works pretty well . <p> As far as their journals go , I only posted pictures of mine this week because the kids did n't really do anything . They did some leaf rubbings and bark rubbings , but they were n't defined enough to get a decent photo . I try to just let that go . I encourage them to draw or write something in their nature journals , but I try not to make it something that they have to do . I want them to be excited about it , not look at it as just another school assignment . 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234 
@@108016799 @3416799/ <p> When cold weather strikes , all I want to do is stay snuggled up in the house . That 's not always the best idea , though , because that 's when cabin fever starts to set in . Instead of holing up in your house all winter , try these ideas for 10 fun winter field trips ! <p> 1 . The zoo . Bundle up and head out to your local zoo . It may not be the first thought that comes to mind when thinking of winter field trips " because brrrr ! " but we 've been to the zoo a time or two when the weather was cooler than we 'd anticipated and the animals were all much more active than we 'd ever seen them . I would n't suggest going when the temperatures are frigid , but a moderate winter day field trip to the zoo can be a fantastic experience . An aquarium makes a great winter field trip destination , too . <p> 2 . Ice rink . Arrange a group trip to the ice rink to learn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for guests . If you 've got a professional or minor league hockey team , try to arrange to watch a game . If not , schedule some time to skate . <p> 3 . A children 's museum . Okay , any museum is a good idea when it 's cold outside , but we used to love going to the local children 's museum . The windows in the water play area were usually foggy , reminding us how cold it was outside while we were snug inside enjoying a day of fun and educational exploration . <p> 4 . Ski lodge . If you 've got a ski lodge within a reasonable driving distance , that can be fun , too . Arrange to take some lessons and learn how the lodge operates . <p> 5 . Movie theater . Head to the movies ! Ask if you can arrange a behind-the-scenes tour to see what goes into running a theater . Learn how the movies are delivered to the theater and check out the projection room . Plan some related activities for the movie you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a book you 've read . <p> 6 . YMCA . You can learn about health , nutrition , and exercise " and swim in the indoor pool ! See if you can arrange a tour and/or a sample class and a chance to chat with a personal trainer about keeping healthy and active during the cold weather months " or ask about tips for safely exercising outdoors during the winter . <p> 7 . Planetarium . Visit a planetarium to learn more about the winter constellations . <p> 8 . Public Works/Department of Transportation . Ask if your group can visit to learn how roads are prepared for winter weather . If you 've got teens , you might also ask about safe driving tips for icy or snowy road conditions . <p> 9 . TV station . You can , of course , visit a TV station any time of year , but winter is a fun time to visit your station 's meteorologist to learn about how snowy or icy- weather is forecast . <p> 10 . Virtual field trips . If the weather is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip ! Some sources include : <p> Recently my family and I made a four-day stop in the Washington , D.C. area . Honestly , we only stopped because we happened to be in the area ; D.C. was not a place we would have considered staying otherwise . <p> However , after staying for a few days , we were all in agreement that our nation 's capital city was definitely worth our time , and a place we would likely return. - There are at least 3 reasons why Washington D.C. is the ultimate homeschool field trip . <h> 1 . It 's affordable . <p> This is a huge one for our family . I know its important for many other homeschooling families as well since so many are single-income . The decision to keep the kids at home for their schooling often comes with a financial sacrifice . Although the sacrifice is well worth the return on investment , it does make money a consideration when planning a vacation . <p> For this reason , Washington , D.C. is the ideal vacation destination for homeschoolers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area . In fact , we did n't pay for a single attraction during our stay , yet each day was filled to the brim with fun and learning . <h> 2 . It 's family-friendly . <p> Most people do n't think about fun for kids when our nation 's capital comes to mind . However , the city is teeming with fun , family-friendly attractions . <p> So , where should you visit with the kids ? It really depends on the interests , ages , and maturity levels of your brood , but in general , you wo n't go wrong choosing to visit any of the following free attractions : <h> 3 . It 's overflowing with educational opportunities . <p> History <p> Opportunities to learn about the history of the world and of our country are everywhere in Washington , D.C. The many history museums , as well as various parts of several other museums , offer incredible historical information . <p> Additionally , the many monuments and memorials scattered across the National Mall work in tandem with The National Archives , to introduce visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current knowledge . <p> Science <p> From the life science learned at The National Zoo to the incredible lessons in physics offered by The National Air and Space Museum , there are plenty of science concepts to be explored in the great city of D.C. <p> Other science learning opportunities can be found in almost every museum in Washington , D.C. , so be sure to keep your eyes peeled when you go out exploring ! <p> Government <p> Obviously , the capital city of America is the perfect place to spark a child 's interest in the inner workings of our government . <p> Take a free trip up to the Washington Monument for a lesson on our nation 's first leader , and visit the White House to start a discussion about the work our president does each day . The National Archives are a great place to discover the reasons why our country 's government was built the way it was and why it has worked for us . <p> Geography and cultures of the world <p> Much can be learned about the geography and cultures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the D.C. area . <p> For instance , the National Museum of the American Indian offers some amazing insight on the various Native American tribes . The Museum of Natural History also chimes in with some lessons on geography as it relates to various plants and animals throughout time , and the National Postal Museum offers opportunities to discuss U.S. geography at various times throughout your visit . <p> Finally , the Discovery Theater often holds presentations that involve folklore from around the world , making it the perfect tie-in to a geography unit study . <p> These are just three of the many reasons we fell in love with Washington , D.C. during our short visit . We hope this article inspires your family to hit the road and take the ultimate field trip to our nation 's capital city . We promise you wo n't regret it ! <p> Have you visited Washington D.C. ? What would you list as must-see sites for homeschooling families ? <p> Many may consider a trip to Walt Disney World a time to relax and take a break from school . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Earth , I noticed something I had n't  really seen before : Disney World is a giant classroom . <p> If you are planning a trip to Disney World and would like to take full advantage of the amazing learning environment that awaits you " and get away with calling your vacation a " field trip " " keep reading . I have compiled a list of fun learning activities and great opportunities , located on Disney World property , to begin a dialogue with your child . <p> Take this list and run with it , add to it , and make it your own . <h> Math <p> Spending money . To avoid the " I wants " and to help teach your children budgeting , bill/coin values , and self-discipline , give each person in your family a bit of spending money to manage on their own . <p> Wait times . Long wait times at Disney can be good for something after all ! Use the estimated wait times as conversation starters to help young children understand time . <h> History <p> Tom Sawyers Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book as a family before your trip . This will make a visit to Tom Sawyers Island much more fun and meaningful . <p> Liberty Square . Discuss and find the Liberty Bell and Paul Revere 's two lanterns in an upstairs window while visiting Liberty Square . Also , be sure to see the Hall of Presidents show for a fun history lesson . <p> Big Thunder Mountain Railroad . Use your time in line for this ride to discuss the history of coal mines and the ( very real and very serious ) meanings behind some of the queue distractions , such as the canary and the many references to funerals . <p> Carousel of Progress . On this attraction , learn about the many wonderful ways our day-to-day lives have changed since the turn of the 20th century . <p> Pirates of the Caribbean . Discussion of the history of pirates and the facts about them would be a perfect addition to a ride on Pirates of the Caribbean . <p> Epcot countries . Every country pavilion in the Epcot World Showcase has a small history lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Movie Ride . The Great Movie Ride is the perfect way to introduce young children to the many Hollywood legends we know and love . <p> One Mans Dream . This mini-museum is located in Hollywood Studios- and is a fun way to learn about the man behind the magic , Walt Disney himself . <h> Science <p> Living With The Land . A great lesson on taking care of the environment and our ecosystem , this is an interesting ride through the gardens of Epcot . <p> Circle of Life . Another eco-educational attraction , this short video feature is a great way to show children the importance of caring for the Earth . <p> Spaceship Earth . A dark ride that travels through time and shows riders all of the incredible technological advances the human race has made throughout the years , Spaceship Earth is a must-ride when visiting Epcot . <p> Test Track . This ride gives guests a chance to design their own vehicle and see how it stands up to the rigors of the test track . <p> Mission Space . Get a feel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship as you blast off on Mission Space . <p> Innoventions . This childrens museum-like space in Epcots Future World offers lessons on fire safety , roller coaster design , and health , to name a few . <p> Kilimanjaro Safari . Check out some amazing animals and learn some fascinating facts as you travel through various habitats in a large safari truck . <p> Rafikis Planet Watch . Learn more about your favorite animals and how to care for them at Rafikis Planet Watch . <p> The Dinosaur Ride . While much of this ride is obviously fictional , there are plenty of little dino fact gems to be found in both the ride and the queue . <p> Wilderness Explorers . Join the Wilderness Explorers in Animal Kingdom to learn some amazing things about animals and nature , and earn badges while you 're at it ! <h> Geography <p> Adventureland . Adventureland in Magic Kingdom features landscapes from a few very different parts of the world . Discuss with your child the possible origins of these views . <p> Soarin Around the World . The Soarin ride in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . <p> Epcot countries . The countries in the World Showcase also offer some fantastic geography lessons . <p> Visit Animal Kingdom . Visit Animal Kingdom and discuss Africa and Asia and the incredible history and culture found in each . <p> Have you been to Disney ? What are some of your favorite learning opportunities there ? <p> Field trips are one of the best hands-on learning opportunities around . The best part about homeschooling is that you can go on field trips as often as you like with no limits ( other than financial restraints ) on how far you can go . <p> As you 're planning your upcoming school year , be aware of opportunities to take your learning on the road by planning homeschool field trips- to tie in to the topics you 're studying or just for fun ! - Need some ideas ? Some of our favorites have included : <p> 1 . K-9 demonstration . Two officers from our local police department came to a church gym that wed secured for the day and brought their K-9 partners . That was such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we learned about how the dogs are trained . I highly recommend setting up a demonstration with your local police station if they have police dogs . <p> 2 . Doughnut shop . This tour resulted in one of the- biggest turn-outs ever for one of our groups field trips. - I mean , really , a doughnut shop . Need I say more ? We got to see the entire process of how the doughnuts were made " and we all got a free doughnut ! <p> 4 . TV stations. - I think we managed to hit all three major network affiliates in our area " and we learned something every time . Once we went specifically to visit- the meteorologist and learn about the weather . This is especially interesting- during hurricane or tornado season , when your kids can learn more about severe weather events . <p> 5 . Radio stations . As with TV stations , it 's fascinating to see what goes on behind the scenes at the radio stations we listen to every day . <p> 6 . Coca-Cola Bottling . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's still one of our- most memorable field trips . I 've never seen a place as clean as that Coca-Cola plant . - It was fascinating to learn how- the cans are filled and the lids put on. - If you do n't  have a Coca-Cola plant near- you , any beverage bottling plant would probably be similar " except , you know , they wo n't give you yummy Cokes at the end . <p> 8 . Walking tours . One of my favorite field trips was a walking tour of our city . So often we miss the learning opportunities that are all around us , especially as relates to the history and interesting sites in our own city . A walking tour slows you down and allows you to catch things you miss when you 're driving- through . <p> 9 . Grocery stores . It 's often a joke that homeschoolers can turn a trip to the grocery store into a field trip , but we really have gone on an official grocery store field trip . It was arranged through The Field Trip Factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip opportunities . We learned about nutrition and food safety , - and the kids got to taste test a variety of fruits and vegetables . <p> 10 . Zoos and aquariums . We always enjoyed tying aquarium or zoo visits into studies about animals , habitats , and geography . One time , we took a map of the world and tried to find at least one animal from each continent . You could get really creative and put together a little scavenger hunt or bingo board for your next zoo or aquarium visit , too . <p> Gregg Harris has a great book called A-Z Guide to Homeschool Field Trips that makes a great homeschool field trip resource. - I think it 's out of print now , but if you can get your hands on a copy , I highly recommend it . It lists all sorts of ideas for places you can go " and places you might be going anyway , such as the doctor or dentists office . <p> The book also suggests lots of questions students might want to ask and topics you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question ideas are perfect for avoiding the uncomfortable silence that so often follows the inevitable query , " Does anyone have any questions ? " <p> What are some field trips that you and your family have really enjoyed ? <p> Field trips are pretty common among elementary-aged homeschoolers . However once kids hit middle and high school , the field trips often come to a screeching halt . I do n't want there to be any false pretenses here " I 'm just as guilty as the next mom of not taking my teens on enough field trips . I 'd like to rectify that , though , so I thought I 'd brainstorm and share a few field trip ideas for middle and high school students " and maybe you can suggest any ideas I may have missed . <p> Hospitals " Lots of hospitals offer different types of classes or presentations for groups . First aid and germ prevention are still relevant to teens and could be part of a health class credit . <p> Symphony performances <p> Plays <p> Art museums <p> TV and radio stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very relevant to older students . Your local TV station 's meteorologist might really enjoy having an older group of students with whom to go more in-depth . <p> Living history museums " I know they have these at sites such as Williamsburg , Jamestown , and St. Augustine , just to name a few of the well-known options . I 'm an adult and I love them , so they 're definitely suitable for teens . <p> Courtrooms " I always find it interesting to see how our judicial system works " and teens are old enough to be quiet in a courtroom . <p> Aquariums " Many have programs specifically for older students . <p> Amazon fulfillment centers " Unfortunately , we missed one of these recently because Josh was sick . <p> Planetariums <p> Historic cities " Older kids are often easier to travel with , which means you might could do some extended field trips to places such as Washington D.C. , Boston , the Alamo " there are so many possibilities for those who are able to travel . <p> History museums <p> Civil War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Artisans " If there are any types of local artisans in your area " blacksmiths , artists , etc. " see if they 'll let your teens come watch them work . This could even become an apprenticeship opportunity for the right student . <p> College campuses " Sure , you can refer to it as a campus tour if you like , but it 's still a field trip . grin <p> Caves and caverns <p> Wildlife refuges <p> Local businesses " The entrepreneurial spirit seems prevalent among homeschoolers . Ask a local small business owner to give your teen a tour and explain the ins and outs of business ownership . <p> Amusement parks " Yes , they 're fun , but some are willing to give students a behind-the-scenes tours , and many do have an educational component . Epcot is famous for its Showcase of Worlds and you can watch a whole host of craftsmen work at Dollywood . <p> A location of the Federal Reserve <p> Music recording studio <p> Foreign countries " Yeah , such a field trip probably is n't in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amazing opportunity that would be . <p> Historic homes <p> I 'm sure there are many other ideas that I 'm overlooking , but that 's okay " that 's where you come in . <p> What suggestions would you add for non-cheesy , not-too-babyish field trip ideas for teens ? 148234 @qwx1008234

@@108016802 @3416802/ <h> Weekly Wrap-Up : The one with the surprise <p> June 16 , 2017 By Kris Bales <p> Happy Friday , y'all ! Did you have an amazing week ? Mine was busy and included a surprise . <p> Brian was off- on Monday and Tuesday . We took Josh and Megan to Chick-fil-A for lunch on Monday " their last good meal before a week of camp food . They had to be at the church around 12:30 to leave for camp around 1:00 . <p> Usually , we wait until the buses pull out to leave , but the last couple of years the kids have been okay with us going ahead and leaving . This year , I said I had to leave before they called for the senior boys to board the bus . They always call them by the grade they 're going into . That means Josh is a senior boy . <p> I 've already graduated one kid , so I do n't know why I 'm having such a hard time with Josh being a senior . It may be because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how close I 'm getting to the end of our homeschooling years . <p> Whatever it is , I 'm having a really hard time . <p> We had a couple of errands to run after we dropped them off . Then , Brian asked if I wanted to go to the Ford place to see these two Mustangs he has been drooling over . <p> He 's been wanting a new one for a couple of years and has been holding out for the right car , the right deal , and the right time . I guess two out of three is n't bad . We 'd planned to wait until next spring , but he found a deal he could n't pass up . <p> He is now the super-proud owner of a 2015 Ford Mustang . This is the second time we 've been fortunate enough to happen upon a fantastic deal where someone with exceptional- taste in cars felt the need to replace their two-year-old model with a brand-new one . Were happy to take a new-to-us car and let someone else eat the depreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this before they get home because they do n't know yet . I think we 're going to pick them up from camp in it today . <p> Josh will be psyched because now he 'll be able to drive the older Mustang more frequently . His plan is to start making payments on it and buy it from Brian . <p> The only thing about getting the car , though , was that it wound up taking up the better part of the week . We drove the two Brian was considering on Monday and talked to the sales guy at length about them . <p> He went back up there Tuesday while I stayed home and got some work done " and responded to approximately 3 million texts from him about the two cars . He finally decided on the red one , which was the better deal and had fewer miles and more options . However , they did n't get everything finalized in time to get the loan before our credit union closed . <p> That meant another day off and another day of errands " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . <p> Belle does love her person . <p> Wednesday was supposed to be my full day at home alone to get stuff done . It did n't  happen . <p> Thursday I had a hair appointment , lunch with a friend , and errands to run . I did manage to get some school stuff done , so there was that . <p> I 'd say that I 'd catch up next week , but Monday starts with a vet appointment and a doctor 's appointment , and Tuesday is wisdom teeth extraction day for Josh . <p> I 've just about resigned myself to the idea that my life is just perpetually busy .

I could have come home and gotten some work done Wednesday , but I thought how often does my husband get the car he s been dreaming of and searching for for years ? So , I opted to spend the day with him instead . I think it was a great choice . : ) <p> That car is GORGEOUS ! Mustangs are my favorite cars . Even the color is absolutely beautiful . Good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My oldest is flying to Wisconsin today for an army trip . He was n't sure if hed be able to go because Wednesday he impaled his thumb with a huge piece of wood .

The attending physician said it was the worst " splinter : he s ever seen and asked if he could take a picture of it . Sonow the army has to let my son sleep in a building with a medical staff nearby instead of the tent he was supposed to be in . I 'm sure they 're not happy . <p> I have a six year old and am still feeling sad that Thomas only has one more year left of homeschool . It kind of feels the beginning of the end .

@@108016803 @3416803/ <h> All About Spelling and Dyslexia <p> We started using All About Spelling about 3 years ago when I had an opportunity to review it . We loved it ! We used Level 1 and started on Level 2 . <p> Then , we quit using it for awhile . <p> Spelling fell by the wayside near the end of my burnout year . Then , we started using Trail Guide to Learning . It includes spelling and I wanted to start out using the complete program , just like it was laid out . <p> I like the way that Trail Guide approaches spelling . It 's integrated with the curriculum and is presented in a way that makes sense with words grouped by concepts , such as word families or similar digraphs . It 's a very effective method of teaching spellingfor a typical learner . <p> I only have one of those . My other two kids are dyslexic . <p> When Josh was diagnosed last spring , one of the things his clinician noted in his report was that Josh needed to be taught spelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I knew that All About Spelling was developed with dyslexic kids in mind , based on the Orton-Gillingham methods , which are highly regarded in the dyslexic community . So last July , as we prepared to begin working with Tori , our therapist from Lexercise , I asked if she would look at the two spelling programs I was considering " All About Spelling being one of them " and give me her opinion on which would be best for Josh . <p> After looking at All About Spelling , she told me that it looked like it was straight out of Orton-Gillingham . It was very reassuring to me to hear that from someone who is actually familiar with those methods . <p> After talking with Tori , I decided to start back at the beginning of Level 2 because the scope and sequence of that level meshed well with the order she was going to be introducing concepts in Joshs therapy , which makes for great reinforcement . <p> ( On a related note : I 've also noticed that the phonemic awareness concepts that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josh practices in his therapy games each week . ) <p> The letter tiles that are such a huge part of All About Spelling are part of what makes it perfect for a dyslexic kid , I think . It sounds like such a simple concept , but it 's hugely beneficial to Josh ( and Megan ) to be able to move the letter tiles around as he 's figuring out how to spell different words . The fact that the consonants are blue and the vowels are red is a helpful visual tool , as well . As more concepts are introduced , those tiles are also color-coded in various ways . <p> The syllable tags are great , too , because they 've helped to reinforce concepts that he 's working on in therapy " open/closed syllable , r-controlled vowels , and vowel-consonant-e syllables are all concepts he 's been working on these last few months . <p> It 's not just Josh who 's benefiting , either . Megan is a great reader , but not the best speller . She seems to have something against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ( Does it bug you as much as it does me that we have to hang our white board vertically , rather than horizontally , meaning that our AAS letter tiles wo n't fit across the top of the board ? It 's one of the drawbacks of our home 's unique floor plan " we do n't have much wall space in our dining room . ) <p> All About Spelling is a mastery-based program with cyclical review . You work on a concept until the student has it and move on , always reviewing previously learned concepts . They make it super-easy , too . Each level comes with a kit of perforated cards . There are four card types : <p> Phonogram <p> Sound <p> Key ( spelling rules and concepts , basically ) <p> Word <p> There is a card for each sound , phonogram , spelling rule , and spelling word that the students learn . Each card is then sorted in one of three ways : <p> Review ( daily practice ) <p> Mastered ( occasional review ) <p> Future lessons <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the cardstock dividers that come with each level or , for long-term use and storage , you can purchase the Spelling Review Box and laminated dividers ( or they come with the Deluxe Interactive Kit ) . The spelling box has room for each card in all seven levels of All About Spellingand it has little foam spacers to fill up the empty spots when you 're just starting out . <p> It 's been slow going for us , but that 's okay . Just this week , Josh has to do a 15 minute writing sample for Tori . The first couple of times I read through it , I was a little disappointed at the spelling mistakes I saw . Then , I started noticing the words he spelled correctly . I realized that some of the concepts that Tori , All About Spelling , and I have been pounding in his head are starting to stick . Its exciting to see those spelling concepts finally starting to become second nature to Josh . <p> Yes , we 've still got some work to do and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength , but I 'm starting to have confidence that he is beginning to master the concepts and learn the tools that will help him to be successful in those areas . <p> This post contains affiliate links . 148233 @qwx1008233 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> I am glad you found AAS . I was advised against it once when my daughter was at the climax if her struggling . I was too new in homeschooling to know any better . In hind sight I think the person had a personal reason get in the way of educating me about what options I had . Anyway . After tons of research and two years later all signs pointed to AAS . It has been a perfect fit and I have seen marked improvement . My daughter never got an official diagnosis . That is a complicated and long story but regardless she is 10 times improved all around . <p> I just thought I 'd mention I actually prefer having our board vertical . We have limited wall space too , and its forced me to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our setup . I arrange the letter tiles vertically on the left side of the board , making it easy to slide to the middle of the board . The syllable tags , prefix , and suffix tiles are on the left . All the consonant and vowel teams , sounds of /er/ and other tiles are at the bottom . Were in Level 4 , and so far this arrangement has worked great . I have n't been blogging lately , but I really should take some pictures and post . We even found some cheap Ikea stools that we use just for our spelling time . <p> We are also blessed to homeschool with dyslexia and All About Spelling really works well for both of my sons . It goes along very well with what DS2 is doing in tutoring . It works so much better than having a weekly spelling list . We have our board in the vertical position too . Like Kellie we put the alphabet down the left side . I really like having tiles for blends and vowel teams because it makes it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a long o ? " and with the kids looking at possible combinations . <p> I 'm just starting using All About Spelling with my younger set of kids . I 'm glad to hear that it is working for you Kris . Spelling is definitely a difficult thing for dyslexic kids , even after they are reading well . Looks like it is working for other families too ! <p> My oldest has something against vowels , too . Just wanted to chime in on the vertical board issue . We had to hang ours vertical in our new home . I put 13 letters on the top left and 13 on the top right . The teams and extras are hung on another chore chart wed stopped using . I 've heard of folks hanging a cooking sheet next to the board , too . We keep everything up high on to keep the two-year-old from " spelling " or eating our tiles . If you have no Toddlers you could just run the alphabet down one side depending on what hand they write with . <p> Though I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great success . All three of my kids enjoy the program except for the one thing you love.the tiles . They hate using them . Its funny because those tiles were one of the main reasons I bought the programI thought it would help my sons who do not enjoy the physical act of writing . HOWEVER , they hate the tiles so much that they prefer to actually write on the white board than deal with the tiles . HA ! This is still a win for me ( and them ) because now they are getting some extra writing practice . I wish they would make a letter tile app for the ipad because I think my kids would love using it and then they would still get the visual representation of the different colored tiles . <p> I 'm so glad I found this review ! I 'm getting a bit desperate for my little 4th grader . She dealt with amblyopia during her first grade year and even though she has corrected vision with a contact lens , her year long patch use and lack of vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wads up her spelling tests and throws them at me . Bless her . Weve tried Spelling Workout , R&amp;S , and even the R&amp;S 1st grade phonics that her little brother used . Im excited to give this to her ; shell love the tiles and manipulatives . I wish I 'd known about it sooner ! ! <p> I used All About Reading and Spelling , however I found that by level 3 there were some rules that did not make sense and had too many exceptions , so I stopped using it . I since have discovered that my daughter which would have been labeled as having dyslexia had an eye convergence issue . Since then we have used Spelling U See which I liked , but I feel I need something a little more intense . Does anyone have any suggestions ? Also , just to put this out there , this journey has really opened my eyes to misdiagnosis in the field of special education . My eye doctor who specializes in pediatric eye care has told me that many children that are diagnosed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with glasses or eye therapy . I was a former English teacher and I often think back to many of my students that were at a third grade reading level in ninth grade even though they have had remedial education . So if things seem really difficult , getting a specialized exam from an optometrist that specializes in eye issues such as convergence might be something I would check in too . Although All About Reading has helped my daughter a little , finding out about her eye issue has advanced her three reading levels in one year , and she is still improving . This has been something many moms I know have discovered with amazing results . We were just lucky to have a reading specialist living close by ( Columbus , OH ) who has experience in this field .

Honestly , we only stopped because we happened to be in the area ; D.C. was not a place we would have considered staying otherwise . <p> However , after staying for a few days , we were all in agreement that our nation 's capital city was definitely worth our time , and a place we would likely return. - There are at least 3 reasons why Washington D.C. is the ultimate homeschool field trip . <h> 1 . It 's affordable . <p> This is a huge one for our family . I know its important for many other homeschooling families as well since so many are single-income . The decision to keep the kids at home for their schooling often comes with a financial sacrifice . Although the sacrifice is well worth the return on investment , it does make money a consideration when planning a vacation . <p> For this reason , Washington , D.C. is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of free and inexpensive activities in the area . In fact , we did n't pay for a single attraction during our stay , yet each day was filled to the brim with fun and learning . <h> 2 . It 's family-friendly . <p> Most people do n't think about fun for kids when our nation 's capital comes to mind . However , the city is teeming with fun , family-friendly attractions . <p> So , where should you visit with the kids ? It really depends on the interests , ages , and maturity levels of your brood , but in general , you wo n't go wrong choosing to visit any of the following free attractions : <h> 3 . It 's overflowing with educational opportunities . <p> History <p> Opportunities to learn about the history of the world and of our country are everywhere in Washington , D.C. The many history museums , as well as various parts of several other museums , offer incredible historical information . <p> Additionally , the many monuments and memorials scattered across the National Mall work in tandem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our country and expand upon their current knowledge . <p> Science <p> From the life science learned at The National Zoo to the incredible lessons in physics offered by The National Air and Space Museum , there are plenty of science concepts to be explored in the great city of D.C. <p> Other science learning opportunities can be found in almost every museum in Washington , D.C. , so be sure to keep your eyes peeled when you go out exploring ! <p> Government <p> Obviously , the capital city of America is the perfect place to spark a child 's interest in the inner workings of our government . <p> Take a free trip up to the Washington Monument for a lesson on our nation 's first leader , and visit the White House to start a discussion about the work our president does each day . The National Archives are a great place to discover the reasons why our country 's government was built the way it was and why it has worked for us . <p> Geography and cultures of the world <p> Much can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country by visiting the museums in the D.C. area . <p> For instance , the National Museum of the American Indian offers some amazing insight on the various Native American tribes .

You can read more about their adventures at Wonder Wherever We Wander . <h> Comments <p> I had n't  been to Washington D.C. since I was a kid , so I had no idea there were that many free attractions there ! My brother and sister-in-law did take a few of my kids to the zoo there several years ago , so they got there at least . Thanks for giving me a great idea for something to do when my husbands plant is on shutdown . Anything free is good for me ! <p> I 'm from Northern VAI grew up 20 minutes from DC , and were still in the area . There is so much to do ! You covered a lot of it . This blog is a great resource for kid friendly DC area attractions/activities http : //kidfriendlydc.com/ . My personal favorites are just outside of DC in Arlington National Cemetery and the Iwo Jima Memorial . The changing of the guard at Arlington is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Vernon , and his step grandaughter Nelly Custis home , Woodlawn Plantation . The George Washington Parkway is beautiful , and has biking/walking trails that run parallel with the Potomac River . If you 're into Marine Corps history , in Quantico VA there is the National Museum of the Unites States Marine Corps . In DC there 's Yards Park , which has a wading pool and fountains . <p> We just went ( got home October 2 ) and while there we did this : LONG ... You have to purchase and deliver the wreath , but anyone can do it . Oh and Washington Monument is closed for the foreseeable future while they install an entirely new elevator , so do n't  plan on that . Also , there is a new White House Visitors Center that you can go to even if you do n't  have a White House Tour and do n't  forget all the junior ranger programs you can doWhite House , Presidents Park , Fords Theater , and the monuments . We also loved the tour of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 16 years ago , and I 've been ready to back since they day I got home . We only got to spend three days and that was not enough for me . I 've always loved history and could have spent 3 days just in the American History Museum . My kids are a little young for this trip and the drive right now but I have big plans when they get older . <p> Because our family lives in our RV , we stayed in the Greenbelt National Park Campground . It was beautiful ( my son woke up the first morning we were there and could n't get over how green it was ) and affordable , and they did offer tent camping , However , it was definitely camping , and only offered very basic bathhouses and no other amenities . The bathhouses were not the worst we have experienced , but the bugs did tend to make themselves at home there despite regular cleanings . <p> If you are looking for a hotel , I recommend finding one through Orbitz . They often put out coupon codes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back a well . We are not loyal to any one hotel chain and always find great deal by using the Orbitz/coupon code/Ebates method . <p> The public transit is excellent in DC , so getting where you are going should n't be a problem even if you are staying a bit off the beaten path . <p> There 's a free performance EVERY DAY at 6 pm at the Kennedy Center . The military bands sometimes play . My parents were visiting DC once and attended a free concert by the National Symphony Orchestra .

@@108016815 @3416815/ <h> Free Online Piano Lessons : A Hoffman Academy Review <p> A couple of years ago our family was gifted with a new-to-us piano , and like most kids , mine enjoyed plunking on the keys , making their own " music . " After the initial novelty of the " new " piano wore off , my elementary-age son showed particular interest in learning to play real songs , so I enrolled him in beginning piano lessons . <p> The lessons went well , and he really enjoyed them , but we needed to take an extended break when our piano teacher had a new baby . Then I had a new baby , and schedules became more difficult to coordinate . <p> I received this product free for the purpose of reviewing it . I also received monetary compensation for the time invested in writing the review . The opinions expressed are my personal , honest opinions . Your experience may vary . Please read my full disclosure policy- for more details . <p> My now 9-year-old still sits at the piano occasionally , making up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons again . But most of the time the piano sits lonely in the living room , collecting dust ( and school papers that need to be filed ) . <p> And so when given the opportunity to try Hoffman Academy and then write an honest review , I jumped at the chance , thinking that online lessons and setting our own pace would be a good fit for our current season of life . <h> How Hoffman Academy Works <p> Hoffman Academy has a very through website , with well-written explanations and details on the nitty-gritty of the program . But as a quick overview : you begin by watching a short ( 5-15 minute ) video lesson . The videos are all accessible for FREE on the website and can be viewed as many times as you wish , with no purchase required at any time . <p> During each lesson , kids are given specific practice instructions and goals so they know what to focus on between lessons . Lessons are self-paced , so they can go as fast or slow as needed , and can always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review . <p> Kids can further and apply their learning with optional but recommended supplemental reinforcement materials which include printable activity pages , sheet music , practice instructions , and MP3 listening tracks . These supplemental materials cost $19 for each unit of 20 lessons . <h> Why We Liked Online Piano Lessons <p> Piano lessons are expensive . Where we live , lessons for my three oldest kids would cost $60-75 per week " quite an investment for our one-income homeschooling family . While I do n't  mean to undervalue the work and expertise of a piano teacher , taking a more affordable route for this beginning stage of piano lessons works better for us . ( At least until we know how the kids like playing and if were going to keep pursuing lessons . ) An entire unit of Hoffman Academy online lessons and supplemental materials costs me less than one lesson for one child . <p> The online , self-paced format of Mr. Hoffmans piano lessons was a relief to this busy mom . When we tried the traditional lesson method early on , loading all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the actual lesson . And then there was that much needed break through my very sick pregnancy and postpartum recovery . <p> As a busy homeschooling family , I get that sometimes life just " happens . " Sometimes you cant get to a lesson at a set time . But with the Hoffman Academy , there 's no calling to cancel . You just pick up where you left off , when you can . While testing out this curriculum , it definitely worked best for my son to have a set day/time for our online lessons ( to keep things consistent ) , but since we were testing it during the summer , there were days we just did n't  get to it , and it was n't a big deal . The flexibility of self-paced lessons was much appreciated . <p> Joseph Hoffman is a natural teacher . My son thought he was hilariously entertaining and I was impressed with how creatively Mr. Hoffman explains the complex concepts so clearly and simply . Lesson threes " eating a bowl of cereal " and " Tyrannosaurus arms " piano-posture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one example of the way Mr. Hoffman engages kids through the lessons . The short , interactive lessons often include a game , joke , or silly explanationmaking them fun and kid-approved . <p> I 'm learning to play the piano right along with my kids ! Expanding my own education is by far one of my favorite benefits to homeschooling and parenting . As a young child , I took a handful of piano lessons , but my mom says I threw such a fit about practicing that she pulled me out and ended my piano career . I 've always regretted not sticking with it , and occasionally top-hand tinker through a few beginning piano books we own . But I suppose pride has held me back from pursing lessons in my older years . Mr. Hoffmans lessons have allowed me to quietly learn along-side my kids . Maybe you really can " teach an old dog new tricks . " <h> What We Did n't  Like <p> In order to round out this review , I thought I should include some " cons " of this program as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I asked my son if there was anything he did n't  like ( knowing an honest answer would come from this glass-is-half-empty 9-year-old ) and the only thing he said was , " I wish I would have learned more . " <p> Considering the context , this is really more of a positive than negative ! He enjoyed learning through Mr. Hoffman and is ready to move onto Unit Two ( and " learn more " ) which we plan do to ( and no , were not being paid to do or say that ! ) , as soon as our new school year gets underway in the next few weeks . <p> If piano lessons is something you 've been considering , or if Hoffman Academy sounds like something that would work for your family , be sure to check out the website , try a sample lesson , or find Mr. Hoffman interacting on Facebook , Twitter , or Pinterest . <p> I hope your experience with piano lessons through Hoffman Academy is as positive as ours was . <p> Pam Odd is a homeschooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover . In her pre-mommy life she taught first grade .

My suggestion is to go to Hoffman Academy LONG ... and take a look at the lessons to see if you think it would be a good fit for your highschooler based on previous experience . All the video lessons are free , so you could preview any ( currently goes through unit 6 ) to see what you think . The self-paced feature was definitely my favorite ! Pam <p> This was a great review . I was looking piano instruction for my younger kids , but although I can appreciate the value of a teacher , we are just unable to afford it right now , either . Ill definitely look into this . 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

A very personal look into both sides of WW2 . Also for older teens , Morgan Llywelyn has a series about the Irish Rebellion that spans the 20th century . Very interesting . <p> Thanks for the great list and quick summaries of the books .

@@108016824 @3416824/ <h> Field Trip Ideas for Middle and High School Students <p> March 17 , 2015 By Kris Bales <p> Field trips are pretty common among elementary-aged homeschoolers . However once kids hit middle and high school , the field trips often come to a screeching halt . I do n't want there to be any false pretenses here " I 'm just as guilty as the next mom of not taking my teens on enough field trips . I 'd like to rectify that , though , so I thought I 'd brainstorm and share a few field trip ideas for middle and high school students " and maybe you can suggest any ideas I may have missed . <p> Hospitals " Lots of hospitals offer different types of classes or presentations for groups . First aid and germ prevention are still relevant to teens and could be part of a health class credit . <p> Symphony performances <p> Plays <p> Art museums <p> TV and radio stations " These are popular with younger students , but still very relevant to older students . Your local TV station 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whom to go more in-depth . <p> Living history museums " I know they have these at sites such as Williamsburg , Jamestown , and St. Augustine , just to name a few of the well-known options . I 'm an adult and I love them , so they 're definitely suitable for teens . <p> Courtrooms " I always find it interesting to see how our judicial system works " and teens are old enough to be quiet in a courtroom . <p> Aquariums " Many have programs specifically for older students . <p> Amazon fulfillment centers " Unfortunately , we missed one of these recently because Josh was sick . <p> Planetariums <p> Historic cities " Older kids are often easier to travel with , which means you might could do some extended field trips to places such as Washington D.C. , Boston , the Alamo " there are so many possibilities for those who are able to travel . <p> History museums <p> Civil War battlefield locations <p> State and national parks <p> State capitols <p> Artisans " If there are any types of local artisans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if they 'll let your teens come watch them work . This could even become an apprenticeship opportunity for the right student . <p> College campuses " Sure , you can refer to it as a campus tour if you like , but it 's still a field trip . grin <p> Caves and caverns <p> Wildlife refuges <p> Local businesses " The entrepreneurial spirit seems prevalent among homeschoolers . Ask a local small business owner to give your teen a tour and explain the ins and outs of business ownership . <p> Amusement parks " Yes , they 're fun , but some are willing to give students a behind-the-scenes tours , and many do have an educational component . Epcot is famous for its Showcase of Worlds and you can watch a whole host of craftsmen work at Dollywood . <p> A location of the Federal Reserve <p> Music recording studio <p> Foreign countries " Yeah , such a field trip probably is n't in my future , but if you can swing it , what an amazing opportunity that would be . <p> Historic homes <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm overlooking , but that 's okay " that 's where you come in . <p> What suggestions would you add for non-cheesy , not-too-babyish field trip ideas for teens ? 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> Thanks for this list ! I just forwarded it to the gal in our homeschool group who organizes most of our field trips . We do live in another country so just about every day is a field trip but I would add on personal interest of the kidslike mine helped me brainstorm the following : <p> College campus tour : could even break this out into different field trips like their science lab and science teachers , the life of a librarian , sport team , etc . <p> While visiting a hospital or a doctors office sounds like an amazing idea , it really is unwise . I even say this as a mother who has a daughter , who so far chooses to be a surgeon . She is only 9. so we will see . We own an IT company . Most of our clients are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught many illnesses working in the office areas of ghese places . We request our techs wear gloves and keep hand sanitizer with a drop of bleach in their company trucks . We provide them for them . My husband has brought home two variants of mono home to share with our family and caught an antibiotic resistant form of C-Diff from one of the nursing homes we service . He spent 2 months a the mayo clinic succumbing to a not so pretty and unconventional treatment for c-diff . I will let you research that ( good discussion for high schoolers about how God makes natural properties in our bodies to heal itself ) . <p> I would n't completely dismiss visiting these place . They are an awesome learning ground ; especially for those who are interested in medicine . However , I would certainly be extra cautious about germs , touching things , etc . And bring hand sanitizer with a drop of bleach , for sure . <p> This is a GREAT list ! What I struggle with , though , is the fact that high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the time away for a field trip . My teenagers are basically ALWAYS behind maybe that 's just us ? Have you figured out a way to make it all fit in ? I 'd love some advice . : - ) <p> Hi , Ann . As I confessed , I 'm as bad as the next mom about not making time for field trips . I 'm trying to do better , though . We still try to keep a light Friday usually their quizzes for the week so that we can use that day for outside activities or make-up days if we did activities during the week . Sometimes , I 'll scan the kids lessons for the week and see if there are some not-so-important things they can skip to make room for outside activities . I know its easy to feel behind , but I like to remember that I make the schedule , the curriculum is a tool rather than the master , and field trips can truly enhance learning for teens , so they should be viewed as part of a students education , not blowing off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope it helps ! <p> It does , thanks ! I keep thinking that by keeping our noses to the grindstone I can actually have a SUMMER but maybe its a good idea to plan some variety along the way and not be so concerned about when the school year ends : - ) <p> I have this same problem . I 'm trying to think logically , as in , no high schooler can possibly know everything about ancient Rome , so if we do n't  finish reading Shakespeares Antony and Cleopatra so we can go on a field trip , I think that 's ok . I struggle with feeling like I 'm not making her do enough worknot enough science or writing , this year in particular . <p> So many great ideas ! I agree that field trips are important for our teens . Mine recently enjoyed attending a national meeting of the College Mock Legislature . It is a program sponsored by YMCA , and they have middle and high school programs in 34 of our states in the US . Here is more info on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field Trip Fridays even with just middle and high school kids . My kids learn so much better hands on . As far as Walt Disney World , they have a Youth In Education Series at the parks that take you behind the scenes . <p> I feel the same way with feeling behind . My husband was i 'll and we ended up renting an apartment in Rochester , Minnesota while he was being treated at The Mayo Clinic . My daughter was with us since she was homeschooled . We tried to do as much school as we could but we ended up spending most days in prayer or wandering Mayos magnificant Childrens Library , reading books , checking out DVDs , and attending their daily childrens activities . When we got back home , I had to go back to work at our company . We brought her to work with us but I just knew she was getting lost in this tornado . I put her in Veritas Press Scholars Academy for quite a few classes this year . When she was tested to figure out where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her reading comprehension was 5th grade ! ! ! Mind you , I thought she was surely behind due to nearly two insane years . Praise God , she was learning in between . We let her play on Time4learning.com when I was knee deep in work . Our IT technicians tought her about networking , web design , wiping hard drives and changing power supplies . I guess every day is a field trip nowlol . I would advise from my new experience , do n't  fret . You really are n't  as hehind as you think . God made us homeschoolers for a reason . We are not supposed to school like the PS sytem . Our babies are learning so much by just being free .. free to explore what their hearts desire in their free time . My daughter loves music ; even has her own youtube channel . I woke up this morning hearing her singing in her bed . It was like waking to an Angels voice . Their " non-school " time is when they real grow . I know this now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed . I hope this helps those that feel like they may be not getting enough school time in . Blessings to all of you mommas ; we all work so hard to give our babies our all.and with unwavering faith , we know God has them in his hands ! <p> Colonial Williamsburg has homeschool days but two other places our teens liked was Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village in Dearborn MI and also Sturbridge Village about 90 minutes from Boston and the Freedom Trail in Boston , 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

But nature did n't  agree with my high hopes and our hot , dry Midwestern summer scorched the seedlings and my wonderful " real life " homeschooling plans. - However , " flexibility " has become my motto of homeschooling with little ones , and the need for a plan B inspired this simple craft and writing project . <p> This craft is not only fun and easy , it integrates several subjects ( science , writing , art ) , and is easy to adapt for different ages and stages . <h> Youll Need : <p> Pumpkin <p> Pumpkin Parts Printable <p> White or orange card stock ( or paper ) <p> Crayons , pencil <p> Scissors <p> Piece of yarn or string <p> Glue ( liquid or glue stick ) <p> Stapler ( optional ) <h> Observing , Describing , and Writing <p> First , we spent some time looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We talked about the color , texture , shape , etc. , and made a list of the features on the Describing a Pumpkin sheet ( included in the free printable download ) . Depending on the age of your children , this would be a good chance to sneak a little grammar lesson in and talk about using strong adjectives to describe the noun ( pumpkin ) . <p> Then we cut into the pumpkin so we could also observe and write about the inside . <h> Coloring , Cutting , and Gluing <p> When we finished observing , describing , and writing about the pumpkin , the kids colored pumpkins while I took a few minutes to dry off some of the pumpkin seeds for the second part of our project . My kids love to color , so I printed the pumpkins on white card stock , but you could easily skip this step by printing on orange paper , if desired . <p> After coloring , we cut out the pumpkin pieces , traced the pumpkin part words , and cut out the labels . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named the parts of the outside of the pumpkin by gluing labels on each part . <p> Next we glued dried-off pumpkin seeds and a piece of yarn to the oval piece of the Pumpkin Parts printable to recreate the " inside " of the pumpkin . Naming labels finished off the inside of the pumpkin craft . <p> My five-year-old is really into making books and cards lately , so we finished our craft by turning it into a " book " by stacking the outside of the pumpkin on top of the inside of the pumpkin , then stapling along the left side . <p> Pam Odd is a homeschooling mom of five , graphic designer , and childrens literature lover .

@@108016832 @3416832/ <h> 10 Lessons I 've Learned About Homeschool Planning <p> July 5 , 2016 By Kris Bales <p> I gave myself until July to start thinking about planning our next school year . It 's July . I 'm not really quite sure how that happened . <p> Since that means it 's time for me to starting thinking about homeschool planning , I thought it 's probably about that time for you , too . So , I wanted to share with you 10 lessons I 've learned about homeschooling in the last 14 years . ( I 'm also not quite sure how that happened . ) <p> 1 . Write in pencil . Trust me on this one . Write in pencil ( or my favorite erasable pens ) and buy a pack of those nifty clickable erasers . Or do your lesson plans on the computer so you can copy and paste because the biggest thing I 've learned about homeschool planning is that plans will change . Scratched-out pen is messy looking and Wite Out can be time-consuming ( and expensive if you opt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Planning too far in advance is a waste of time . You want to know a secret ? There was a time , when my younger two were in early elementary school , when I had science and history planned out through high school . True story . <p> I mean , I did n't have all the lesson plans written out , but I did know what materials I was using each year and what topics the kids would be learning . Nope , that 's not even close to what we 're doing now . <p> Before we started using workbooks , I typically planned 2-3 weeks out . Any more than that proved to be a waste to time most of the time because life happens . Rewriting weeks ' worth of lesson plans ? Ai n't nobody got time for that . <p> 3 . Failing to plan may not be planning to fail , but it does mean forgetting important things . I 've had some moms tell me they do n't need a planner . That 's fine . Some people do n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are probably under the age of 40 because , y'all , senior moments are no joke . ) <p> I 'm not one of those people . If I do n't write down a general outline , I forget important things " like reading or math . I am not a detailed planner by any means , but I do like to list out what lesson the kids should be on in math or what chapter they should be reading . <p> Yes , they 're teens and are responsible for their own work , but I like to have it written down so I can make sure it 's getting done . Because they 're teens . <p> And , really , some days your lesson plans may look like this : <p> That 's okay . <p> 4 . Find a planning method you love . It does n't matter if you 're a pen-and-paper gal or if you prefer the latest planning app with all the bells and whistles . Just find a planning method you love ( or can live with ) so that planning is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'll be working my way through my shiny new homeschool teacher planner from A Plan in Place over the next week or two . <p> 5 . Leave a day for catching up . I did n't do this for the first several years that we homeschooled . It 's no wonder I was stressed ! I ca n't emphasis enough the benefits of a homeschool catch-up day . <p> These days , I leave Fridays fairly open for catch-up , enrichment , or outside activities . My kids plan their reading assignments based on a four-day week so that they can use Fridays to get caught up if needed . <p> 6 . Do n't let your lesson plans dictate your life . There may or may not have been a time in our homeschooling journey when I would turn down play dates and impromptu learning opportunities because they did n't fit in with that day 's lesson plans . <p> School must be a priority . I do n't ever want the fact that we homeschooled to be a disservice to my kids . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson plans in favor of a unique learning or socializing opportunity . ( We do n't really want them to be weird and unsocialized , right ? ) <p> Also , there will be times when you realize that you 've planned too much or your kids are struggling in an area . When they 've been working hard , but not getting everything completed , it may be time to adjust the lesson plans and cut you and your kids some slack . <p> 7 . Meal planning is important . You may not consider meal planning part of homeschooling planning , but unless you like eating out a lot or dealing with a stressed , hungry family ( including yourself ) , it really should be . I like to keep meal planning as simple as possible . <p> One of my best tips is to consider your weekly schedule when planning . If you know it 's going to be a busy day , plan a crock pot or freezer meal . Save the more time-consuming family favorites for the days when your schedule is a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing of same-day activities . If you have more than one child ( or one child and multiple outside-the-house activities ) and the majority of their outside classes and activities fall on the same day , consider yourself blessed ! <p> When my kids were much younger , Josh and Megan had a music class on Wednesdays . Brianna 's art class fell on the same day and was just down the road . <p> We would eat lunch out and schedule other appointments ( like the- orthodontist , who as in the same area ) and activities ( such as nature study- at a nearby nature preserve ) for the same day . We did n't get any regular schoolwork done on Wednesdays , but we were able to be home the rest of the week . <p> It was n't until the kids were older that I realized how spoiled I 'd been . If you find yourself in that position , embrace it ! <p> 9 . Include field trips . Like I said , if I do n't write things down , I tend to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful to plan one day a month for field trips so you remember to include them . Need some ideas ? <p> 10 . Leave lots of white space . It can be easy to fall into the trap of wanting to cram your schedule full of the all fun things you want to do , but that can quickly lead to feeling overwhelmed . Fill out the basics and jot down some great ideas that you do n't want to forget , but leave room for rabbit trails , impromptu activities , and the inevitable interruptions . <p> It 's much less stressful to fill in those white spaces with spontaneous activities than to stress over unchecked boxes . <p> How long have you been homeschooling ? What lessons related to homeschool planning have you learned over the years ? 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> Were starting our 8th year next week . I think the biggest thing we 've learned-which you covered- is to be flexible . I am a very Type-A person . I love lists and schedules , and I love to stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we first started , I used to get so stressed out if something would come up and we would n't get to do everything . I 'd do everything I could to make it up from assigning extra work every day to schooling on weekends . ( Yes , I did that . Mean mommy . ) Now if we miss something , I assess its importance . If its not essential , we just do n't  do it- unless its something we are looking forward to . Then we do n't  mind making room for it . In all honesty , I just might throw out another non-essential to make the room ! <p> Such a great post in so many ways ! One year I planned almost the entire year , what a waste ! My planner now has no dates and is only planned a few weeks at a time . Meal planning is also a must in our home . I meal plan better than I lesson plan ! ; ) <p> We are heading into our 11th and last year of home schooling our youngest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn all of them the hard way ! My favorite of yours , #2 . I learned that it was helpful to have benchmarks to reach through the year such as being on chapter X by Christmas break so I would know how to adjust our goals and schedule at those points . My failure this year , #3 . I left our plan far too loosey-goosey , and we completely dropped the ball on an entire class-Government ! So she is catching that up over this summer . I am always learning ! <p> Amen to the pencil ! This will be our 3rd year and while I will ( eventually ) have a broad plan for the year , I will only plan one week ahead for our daily work . BIg field trips ( Williamsburg ) are about to be put on the calendar but the little ones around the Atlanta area I will plan a month or so out .

@@108016833 @3416833/ <h> R.E.A.L . Science Odyssey <p> We have absolutely loved R.E.A.L . Science ! - R.E.A.L . is an acronym for Read , Explore , Absorb , and Learn and that 's exactly what you and your kids will be doing with this curriculum. - Its full of great , fun , hands-on science experiments in every lesson . <p> Each lesson begins with a read-aloud page , called For My Notebook , to introduce the concept. - I make a copy of this page for Josh and Megan so that they can read along and pick up on new terms , which are introduced and casually defined in the lesson , with pronunciation helps in parentheses . <p> After I read the lesson , the kids use highlighters to mark the " big idea " and some of the " small stuff . " - The big idea is the main point of the lesson that all grade levels should understand. - ( Level 1 is geared toward 1-4 graders. ) - The small stuff are those points that older children would do well to know , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and highlighting it has been great reinforcement . <p> The lessons are then followed by hands-on experiments that get kids excited about studying science. - I do n't  think we 've come across an activity yet that my kids have n't enjoyed. - From getting outside observing life in a " plot study " to looking at cells ( eggs ) to piecing together a paper skeleton , the hands-on activities are the variety that teach while still being fun . <p> I love that R.E.A.L . Science : Life author , Terri Williams , realizes that parents , like their children , have different learning/teaching styles and she makes it easy to use the book based on your style. - There are several pages of useful websites for those who like to get online to read more and supplement the activities in the book . <p> There are several pages of book suggestions for each lesson for those who like to use the library to supplement. - There are even tips on keeping an optional nature journal . <p> A friend had commented to me that they had used Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a collection of labs without enough substantial teaching. - I have n't found that to be the case . <p> Pairing the For My Notebook sections with supplemental material from the website or book resource pages provides a very thorough elementary science program. - I had thought that we might pair Science Odyssey with a separate **30;136;TOOLONG science program , but I 've found that has n't  been necessary. - Science Odyssey seems to be providing exactly what we need . <p> You cant buy the Science Odyssey books directly from Pandia Press , but they offer a list of retailers. - The price varies depending on the retailer from whom you purchase. - The list price is $58 , but Ive seen it for quite a bit less than that . <h> History Odyssey <p> I was anxious to try the Level 1 History Odyssey. - Brianna is using Level 2 and I really like it. - Shes not too crazy about it , but only because its a little more work than shed like to be doing and she 's found the reading somewhat challenging. - As the mom , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> I like that all of the History Odyssey books take a classical approach to history , learning through living books , our preferred method for studying history. - The required spine book for Early Modern : Level 1 is The Usborne Internet-Linked Encyclopedia of the World , with one of our favorites , Story of the World , as an optional resource . <p> The lesson plans are written for children in the grammar stage ( ages 6-10 ) , so there are suggestions as to how to use the guide with both independent and non-independent readers. - The lessons are well laid-out , though its important to realize that each part of the lesson is designed to take about a week to complete . <p> Even though it says that right in the book and is laid out accordingly in the accompanying suggested weekly schedule , I kind of forgot about the suggested schedule and missed that line about one week and really pushed my kids attentions spans a bit the first couple of weeks. - Hows that for being real with yall ? - In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of days , but three or four days would make a lot more sense . <p> In each lesson you will do several activities , such as : <p> Read an overview in The Usborne Internet-Linked Encyclopedia of World Hisotry <p> Read from one or both of the optional spine books , A Childs History of the World or Story of the World- <p> Do a writing activity such as looking up and copying one or more vocabulary word definitions or writing a simple outline summary of the days lesson <p> Hands-on activity project <p> Coloring page and/or map work <p> Do an activity from one of the two History Pockets books you 'll use with this course ( only for the American history portions of the guide ) <p> Read your choice of supplemental literature <p> We have already dropped the outlining portion of the lessons because my kids hated it. - I now have them do an illustrated narration sheet for most lessons. - They do n't  really like that either , but they like it better than the outlines . <p> I really like following up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides a nice foundation upon which the corresponding Story of the World chapter can build . <p> When I first read the reading list ( which you can see for each level by clicking on the History Odyssey tab and scrolling down a bit ) I thought the book choices were a bit light. - Then , I realized they were chosen so that a grammar stage independent reader can read on his own. - More in-depth books can be chosen as read-alouds from the suggested literature in the guide . <p> The only thing I dislike about History Odyssey Level 1 is that there are n't  enough hands-on activities for my taste. - I mean , there are the coloring pages and map work , but there are only eight projects included in the guide . <p> I know it can be hard to come up with meaningful projects , but I 'd love to see one for each lesson even if they were listed as optional suggestions , rather than hard and fast assignments. - As a matter of fact , weve just started our first project , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I do n't  have any photos for the history portion of the review like I do with science . <p> Overall , I 'm pleased with the History Odyssey series , both Level 1 and Level 2. - Again , Pandia Press does n't  sell their resources directly , but you can purchase from any of their suggested retailers for a retail price of $36-45 , often lower depending on the vendor . <p> I received these products free for the purpose of reviewing them. - I received no other compensation for this review. - The opinions expressed in this review are my personal , honest opinions. - Your experience may vary . 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <p> This is our second year of History Odyssey . We used it for 5th grade last year ( Ancients Level 2 ) and are using it for 6th grade this year ( Middle Ages Level 2 ) , and we LOVE it ! As you mentioned , sometimes my daughter will complain a little that it 's too much work , but as a mom/teacher I think it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to use it next year as well with my son who will be 1st grade ( Ancients Level 1 ) . <p> Thanks for the REAL Science review . I 'd been wondering about this one . <p> Nice to see you are enjoying the Life Science program as I 'm leaning towards it for next year because we are doing R.E.A.L . ' s Earth &amp; Space this year . My 1st grader is loving the constant experiments &amp; when she developed a specific interest it was easy as pie to just break off for a week or so to concentrate on that to give her what she wanted &amp; then hop back into reg. scheduled programing.I was worried about the lack of reading at first , but we 've been hitting the library &amp; net hard following the recommendations made by R.E.A.L . &amp; feel it has been very thorough . <p> Hi ! I realize it has been a few years , but I am interested in using History Odyssey . I looked through the samples for level one and two on their website . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the main references are out of print/hard to find/not available at the library . For the cost , I would expect the references and suggested readings to be fairly current . We are currently using SOTW Ancients with student and activity pages .

Any suggestions would be much appreciated ! <p> Were currently using History Odyssey Level 2 and I have n't had difficulty finding any of the books . As a matter of fact , I was able to find one of the ones I needed free on Kindle , so I suspect there may be more . I order my books from Amazon because we like to use them longer than our library allows us to keep them .

Prime Climb is a favorite of his , and it encompasses addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division ! Board games during the summer help kids practice those math facts ! <p> Playing games provides ample opportunities for teachable moments , too. - These teachable moments include sharing , listening , early literacy skills , and following directions . <p> Some of the other advantages of board games are that children get to practice their verbal communication skills , cooperation with others , taking turns , and learning to handle wins and losses .

There are many non-traditional ways our kids- can practice counting , adding , subtracting and such . <p> By incorporating movement , games , and even candy , we can keep the drudgery of learning math facts at bay . Who knows , your kids may even begin to look forward to math practice if you try these fun ideas . <h> 1 . Play games . <p> There are so many board- games and card games that you can play to help your kids practice beginning math skills . Uno and Go Fish are great for number and/or color recognition . Candyland and Chutes &amp; Ladders will have your children practicing their counting skills . <p> Older kids can enjoy a rousing game of War while practicing greater than and less than . Many games can be adapted to practice addition , subtraction , or multiplication , as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got leftover candy from the- holidays or you 're looking for a fun new way to teach a lesson , you cant go wrong when you incorporate candy into your daily math lessons . <p> Hershey bars are great for showing fractions . Marshmallows and gumdrops , when paired with toothpicks , can be used to build shapes , both 2D and 3D. <h> 3 . Toss those facts around . <p> Blow up a beach ball and use a permanent marker to write numbers all over it . Now , you can play a game of catch with your child . For preschoolers and kindergarteners , play " What Comes Before/After . " Toss the ball to your child , and have them name the number that comes before and/or after the number their thumb is touching . <p> As your kids get older , you can continue playing the game while practicing basic math facts . Call out a number , 2 for example . Have your child add , subtract , or multiply that number with the number their thumb touches as they catch the ball . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your childs knowledge base grows . The possibilities are endless . <h> 4 . Take it outside . <p> Grab some sidewalk chalk and head outside for math . Draw a hopscotch board on the sidewalk , and fill it with math problems or numbers . <p> Use rocks or twigs for counters as you practice addition and subtraction facts or even just counting . <p> Draw numbers with chalk . Call out a math problem , and let your child squirt the correct answer with a water gun . <h> 5 . Have a scavenger hunt . <p> Scavenger hunts are great indoors or out . Call out instructions for your preschoolers to find three items . Or , have them find two- round- objects. - Can they find a- red- object or something that is- a square ? This is a great way to reinforce colors , numbers , and shapes with your youngest learners . <p> Summer is almost here . While some homeschoolers choose to continue schooling right on through the warmer months , many families take a break . <p> A break from formal schooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , by planning the right kinds of- activities , you may find that your kids are learning more than ever . As an bonus , theyll be having a blast doing it . <p> With this in mind , begin planning your summer right away . Look for fun activities to fill your time as a family , and then find the learning opportunities within them . Almost any activity you do contains little nuggets of knowledge . Find those nuggets , expand upon them , read about them , and create your own summer learning adventure . <p> At a loss for what sorts of things your family should do ? Couple these- popular summer activities with ideas for adding extra educational value to them . <h> #1 : Swimming <p> Everyone loves a good swim on a hot day . Swimming allows you to to cool off and get in some exercise . It also gives kids an opportunity to experiment with water . <p> Show the kids how to make a wave pool or a whirlpool and discuss the science behind how they work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which boats float the best or move the fastest , and talk about why . <h> #2 : Movies <p> Take advantage of- movies in the park - and special deals at local movie theaters , and see a good flick during your summer break . Although watching movies might seem like an entirely mindless activity , this is n't always true . <p> Depending on the movie , you may find the experience educational in and of itself . If not , there are plenty of ways to add to the experience and make it educationally worthwhile . <p> For instance , before watching a movie based on a book , read the book . Then , use the time after the movie to compare and contrast the two . <p> Before watching a movie- set in the past , learn a bit about the era . If its a science fiction film , your kids may find it interesting to look into the feasibility or accuracy of the scientific ideas presented . <p> You can learn a lot when you use summer movies as the jumping-off point for digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing quite as thrilling as sleeping in a tent surrounded by the sounds of the forest . Stargazing , fishing , and hiking are all wonderful camping activities that your family to enjoy as a family . Additionally , each of these experiences provides little explorers with a wealth of new information . <p> Turn your hike into a nature scavenger hunt . See what kinds of animal tracks you can find and discuss the ecosystem of the location . Learn about various birds and see how many you can find on your hike . <p> Fishing is a great life skill in and of itself . However , you can add to the experience by learning about the kinds of fish in the lake , discussing the ecosystem of the area , and reading about the history of fishing . <p> Stargazing is a great way to learn about the universe around us . Pick up some good books about constellations or outer space before heading out on your camping trip . Read them around the campfire as you gaze up at the stars . <h> #4 : Museums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational summer outing . However , this does n't  have to be the case . Most cities have hands-on science and childrens museums , and some even offer living history exhibits . These kinds of museums are geared specifically to the younger crowd . Choose a kid-friendly museum , and you can be confident that your little ones will have a blast . <p> At the museum , take note of what piques his- interest . Perhaps its the big exhibit or the hands-on rocket building station . Whatever captures your childs interest , make a note of it . Expand on the topic when you get home through discussions , reading , internet searches , and YouTube videos . <h> #5 : Bowling <p> Many bowling alleys offer a Kids Bowl Free program for the summer , making- summer a fantastic time to introduce kids to bowling . <p> If bowling itself is n't enough to get you to the alley , consider the lessons to be learned there . Younger kids can get in some addition practice by keeping score on an old-fashioned scorecard . Meanwhile , older kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those laws in action as they knock down some pins . <h> #6 : Library <p> Escape the summer heat and keep your children reading over summer break with a visit to the local library . <p> From chess clubs to sewing classes , most libraries offer a variety of fun , educational activities in addition to summer reading programs . Regular access to new books and videos will give the kids an opportunity to study whatever captures their interest . <p> With this list in hand and a bit of creative thinking , you and your family can plan a summer full of fun and learning ! <p> Vocabulary. - We often think it applies to social studies and science.but some math units have a boatload of vocabulary . If they do n't  quite grasp or get this vocabulary , our kiddos wont be successful . <p> My oldest has just reached his geometry unit , and we are surrounded by words that he has never heard of .

@@108016836 @3416836/ <h> Product Review : ALEKS <p> August 15 , 2009 By Kris Bales <p> I remember last school year hearing lots of buzz about ALEKS and wondering what it was . I never wondered enough to actually seek to find out becausewell , I do n't  know . I 'm weird like that . I knew it had to do with math and that it was done online , but that 's about it . <p> Now , after spending some time reviewing it , I know that ALEKS is an acronym that stands for Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces and that its an online math curriculum for grades 3 through 12 . Having recalled hearing people say how much their kids enjoyed the program , I was really looking forward to getting my guys started on it . <p> They were not impressed . I admit that their lack of enthusiasm for the site was probably directly related to my bright idea that , since we were given access to the ALEKS site two weeks before starting school , that would be the prime time to try it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me . I now realize what a foolish thought that was and how it probably unfairly tainted my kids entire perception of the program . <p> The first thing we did which was probably the beginning of the end , as far as my kids were concerned was the assessment . Students are given 25-30 problems so that ALEKS can determine what they know , what they do n't  know , and where they should start . According to the website , ALEKS " uses adaptive questioning to quickly and accurately determine exactly what a student knows and does n't  know in a course . " <p> The assessment portion was really interesting to watch . I decided to input both Josh and Megans grade level as 3rd for a starting point . You would think , then , that they would be given similar problems on their assessment , but they werent . The program seemed to begin honing in on their individual strengths and weaknesses right away . I noticed that , if they got the answer to a particular type of problem wrong , that same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though often worded a different way . I guess that was the adaptive questioning at work . <p> Once the kids completed the assessment , they were taken to a page with a pie chart that explained how the different colors on the chart showed what they know and what theyd be learning . The program worked with them interactively to show them how the pie chart worked , then , they could click on one of a few choices from each area of the chart basic operation , fractions , etc . <p> They then worked through a set of those problem types with their " online instructor , " a little onscreen character that instructs them as they go . Each week , I got a detailed report showing me exactly what the kids had done that week , from how long they had spent working online to what they had mastered , including a percentage of overall mastery . <p> One of the aspects of the program that I was most excited about was the Quick Tables feature . Its set up like a multiplication chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been mastered , are being practiced , or have yet to be introduced . I was looking forward to the kids being able to practice multiplication drills online . However , Josh got really frustrated at the outset , trying to gain access to use the Quick Tables . <p> He was supposed to input sets of numbers ( not answer a problem , just key in the number that he saw onscreen ) as quickly as possible . However , he was asked to do this several times ( I guess trying to either get him up to a certain speed or get a baseline for how quickly he could input the numbers ) before he could access the Quick Tables . I think he would have enjoyed it more if he could have just jumped in and started answering problems . <p> If you 're looking for online math games to help your kids improve their skills while playing video or arcade-like games , ALEKS is probably not it . However , if you 're looking for an actual online math curriculum that builds up to new concepts in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're looking for . It is an online math curriculum , not a game . <p> Actually , ALEKS offers a variety of curriculum , not just math . You 'll find everything from algebra and geometry to calculus , chemistry and physics . Additionally , some ALEKS course products are American Council for Education ( ACE ) credit-recommended , meaning students may be eligible for college credit at participating colleges . Costs for the program range from $19.95 per month to $179.95 per twelve months for an individual child with family discounts available . 148233 @qwx1008233 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <p> I was tempted to do the 30-day-trial just , you know , to see where my kids are but based on your and Jane 's comments , I think I 'm going to pass . My kids are pretty unenthusiastic about math as is . Any that further dampens their excitment could be disastrous ! <p> Both of you can feel better knowing that it was n't just your kids . My kids did n't like it either . In fact , my 11 yr old who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like school . We were done after that ! lol <p> We 're in the middle of our free one-month trial of ALEKS Geometry . My son ( 14 ) and I are extremely pleased . We used Teaching Textbooks for Pre-Algebra and for Algebra I. Prior to that , we used k12.com math . ALEKS has helped my son gain much deeper understanding of Algebra 1 concepts that make up about 20% of the Geometry pie . My only debate is whether we 're going to go month-to-month , six-month chunk or full 12 month subscription . <p> I am currently using it for my college course in chemistry . It is the schools first time using this program and my class happened to be the guinea pigs . I can not stand this program . It has a bunch of useless extra work that teaches you nothing . It piles a bunch of unnecessary junk . This is the worst online software I think ever to be used . I do not recommend it what so ever . At one point it kept marking me wrong , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to the answers they gave me.it was word for word the exact same answer . I am not sure what is up with this program but I despise it like nothing ever before . -frustrated student . P.S. This software has taught me nothing . <p> My son has used Teaching Textbooks 7th grade &amp; Pre-Algebra . I like it in that he is learning at his own pace with good instruction from the program . I have always been worried that he is n't retaining the material . After researching math programs ( again ) , I read online someone saying that they used Aleks for their kids with Teaching Textbooks just to make sure they learned everything well . So , I found a 2 month free trial of Aleks . My son recently took the assessment and found that his pie is mostly incomplete ( even though he is making As and Bs on his tests in TT ) ! I am so happy to have found Aleks now I do n't  have to worry about whether he will actually " know " Pre-Algebra after completing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears of him being able to do well on his ACT test in a couple of years . <p> I love using ALEKS for my 6 children I have used Abeka , ( lower levels ) Teaching Text Books ( upper levels ) , Video Text ( Algebra and Geometry ) and was starting on Saxon ( upper level ) . I used the curriculum that best fit my children individually . ALEKS has filled in the gaps that I had no idea were missing . My children love the program and cant seem to stop doing math problems . They love the challenge of filling up the pie graph . I give them rewards for every 50 lessons they complete . Then they will receive a grand prize at the end of each subject completed . The reason I chose to use their trial was I have two children that needed their math to finish off their Associates of Science Transfer degree ( dual high school courses for high school ( home schooled ) . Here in Washington state they offer this for free if your child can test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school . They will not graduate with out college algebra . In spite of taking the above courses my daughters were not able to test past the high school math even with a near 4.0 GPA . ALEKS is helping them to fill in the gaps . My other children will not run into the problem as I intend to stick with ALEKS as long as I can come up with the money to pay for this program . My children are signed up for 3rd grade , 6th grade , beginning and intermediate algebra ( 2 children ) and 2 oldest high schoolers are in college algebra . I highly recommend you give it a try especially if the math program that you are currently working on is not flowing for you or your child . My children ages range from 8 to 18 . Teresa <p> I have to use aleks for my homework assignments given by my professor ! IT IS HORRIBLE ! if you write the wrong answer it adds on a whole bunch more to answer . It also forces you to read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . not to mention , the assessments they give you are extremely long ( they take about an hour or more ) . <p> We love ALEKS it is perfect for my math gifted child often she never even looks at the explanations and she only has to do 3 problems right to move on . She enjoys the freedom to choose what to work on next . I like that though she only has to do a couple of problems to move on it does make her review it and on a schedule but again only 1 or problems is gets it right . We did hate the quick tables for the same reasons you stated so we just do n't  use that option . 148234 @qwx1008234 
@@108016837 @3416837/ <h> Review : Hank the Cowdog <p> July 28 , 2009 By Kris Bales <p> I 've heard about the Hank the Cowdog books for years , but I 'd never read any of them until I had to opportunity to review them recently . We received a package to review that included the book , Hank the Cowdog : The Case of the One-Eyed Killer Stud Horse , the CD , Tales and Tunes from Hank the Cowdog , and the game , Tornado . <p> Although my family is new to the Hank series , the series is not new to fans or libraries across the country . The series , about Hank a cowdog and head of ranch security is written by John Erickson , a cowboy himself . Erickson wrote the first book over twenty-six years ago as a series that the family could sit down and read aloud together . Written through the eyes of the often witty , sometimes surly canine , Hank , the books have since sold more than six million copies . Each of the fifty-four books is available from the website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $13.49 ) . <p> The dialogue between Hank and his dim-witted companion , Drover , is often fast-paced and sarcastically comical , while showcasing Hanks dry wit , such as when he points out that , " it does n't  hurt to repeat yourself repeat yourself once in awhile . " Although the book started off a bit slow , I found myself laughing by the second chapter and was impressed with the authors ability to share the story through the eyes of a dog in such a believable way . <p> The Case of the One-Eyed Killer Stud Horse ( and , I 'd guess , the other books in the series ) are written at around a mid-third grade level , with an interest level of probably 3rd 5th grade and , although they 're written for the entire family , may really pique the interest of any reluctant reader boys you may have . One word of caution : many families may be offended by some of the language used in the book . While there is , of course , no profanity , there are words such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " murder " the dog . <p> The CD , Tales and Tunes from Hank the Cowdog ( $3 ) , features story excerpts from ten of the books , and is read by the author , John Erickson in the old radio show style , complete with sound effects . Although the audio series won the 1993 Audie for Outstanding Childrens Series from the Audio Publishers Association , some parents may not be impressed with the language ( dumb , stupid , heck ) or the themes of some of the songs such as A Pox , a Pox on Emily Post or We Do n't  Give a Hoot . <p> We loved the game , Tornado , which is played very much like one of our family favorites , Aggravation . Tornado is for 2-4 players , ages 5 and up and is available for $12.99 . It makes the perfect travel game because the plastic playing surface also serves as a locking storage case . Everything fits inside and it has sliding tabs that keep the case securely locked . <p> The playing pieces are pegs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you " roll " your turn with a spinner housed in a plastic bubble . The entire game folds to a little larger than 4 X 8.5 , making it the perfect size to carry into restaurants or doctors offices where there may be a long wait . The game also comes with a bonus cassette tape featuring the award-winning audio , The Case of the Swirling Killer Tornado . <p> Visit Hank the Cowdogs Official Website for more information about the entire series , as well as other Hank the Cowdog products . 148233 @qwx1008233 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> John Erickson had an article in thie month 's Texas Homeschool Coalition 's Magazine . He talked bout his writing process and NOT being a tortured writer , lol . That he has a steady routine and approaches it like other work . pretty neat . <p> Some how or other , my 11 year old son started reading these books a loud to my 6 year old son , with all the voices . They have read ALL the copies in the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like my boy . <p> We listened to our first Hank book this evening on audio cd and I was shocked and saddened by the use of the words dumb , stupid , hag , moron , idiot and so on You warned readers in your review but that was the first I heard anything negative about the books .

- I do n't  think so. - The very first year we homeschooled , a veteran homeschool mom gave me a wise piece of advice that I 've never forgotten : - when we teach our kids something , were not trying to teach them everything about a given topic ; were giving them hooks upon which to hang later information . <p> Its my opinion that if I cover things like chemistry and physics when my kids are young , accepting the fact that they are n't  going to retain it all , theyll have a point of reference for when they hear this information again in later grades. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 're older. - Besides that , many of the topics covered in Christian Kids Explore Physics are things that kids are naturally interested in and curious about. - Just look : <p> States of matter ( looking for an excuse to make some Flubber/Oobleck , anyone ?

The general idea is that Biblical teaching is supposed to begin at home . The body of the church should be centered in the home . <p> Our faith should be taught and shared in our homes ( and not just with our families , but by opening our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show up at a building on Sunday mornings and expect to be fed , then going on about their way for the other six days of the week . <p> The emphasis is that our homes should reflect our deep and abiding love for Christ , rather than simply reflecting our favorite hobbies , sports teams or interests .

Does that mean that we should just write off the possibility of changing that ? Nope ! <p> Change . <p> That 's my word for the year . Brian wants to change our lack of family Bible study . I want to change our weakness in corporate prayer . I want to change my self-centeredness . <p> I have encouraged each of the children to pray about what God would have them change this year .

@@108016843 @3416843/ <h> What Is Lattice Multiplication ? <p> June 19 , 2014 By Kris Bales <p> When my oldest was in elementary school , she had trouble grasping multi-digit multiplication done the traditional way . I think it was keeping all those columns straight and remembering when and where to add zeros . Thankfully , we discovered lattice multiplication . It looks much different than the way most of us learned to multiply multi-digit numbers , but it makes sense " and it makes it much easier to keep all those columns straight . <p> After several months of using the lattice method of multiplication , Brianna was able to go back to the more traditional method and use it successfully . Lattice multiplication was a fantastic tool for helping it all make sense , though . I 'm a firm believer in the idea that all kids do n't learn the same and if there are different ways to reach the same answer , why not explore them ? <p> So , if you have a kid who is struggling with traditional multiplication methods , I 'd encourage you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> I 'm one of those visual , hands-on sorts , so I thought this YouTube video would do a much better job of explaining lattice multiplication than I could . <h> Why does lattice multiplication work ? <p> I 've got to be honest . I never really cared how or why lattice multiplication worked . I was just glad it did . For those left-brained types , though , this video from Kahn Academy does a good job of explaining the hows and whys of lattice multiplication . <h> Resources for lattice multiplication <p> When Brianna was regularly using lattice multiplication , we found a couple of really useful tools . First , it was much easier to work problems on large square graph paper ( we like the 10X14 size ) . All she had to do was box off the correct number of squares and add the diagonal lines . <p> Next , we found this printable for creating lattice math quick sticks that essentially create a lattice math calculator . Those were handy once she had the technique down . <h> Lattice multiplication with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just as simple as the regular method .

( Have I mentioned that I 'm not a fan of painting ? ) We used three different colors , but only had two rollers , so we had to clean rollers at least once between color changes . I discovered a technique that worked really well for thoroughly drying the rollers and immediately thought that it would make a great tip to share for Works for Me Wednesday . <p> First , I completely rinsed out all the paint . Then , to dry the roller , I first took an old towel and stuffed the towel edges into the roller . Then I rolled the paint roller up in the towel and gave it a few good squeezes .

We 've been doing a lot of painting lately , too , and like you , I DREAD cleaning the rollers . They just hold so much paint even when you 've been washing for a considerable time and think you must have washed it all out ! <p> Yeswhat I have decided after years of washing roller covers is that it is just . not . worth . it . I throw them away and put on a new one . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that I wrap the roller up in between coats and put it in the fridge . Brushes go in ziploc bags and in the fridge .

That 's probably because teenagers want a bit of freedom and a voice in their educations and electives allow them to follow their interestsand get high school credit for it . <p> Ive shared- 10 home ec skills all kids need to know . Today I wanted to offer 10 fun elective ideas for teens- based on my experience with the teens in my life ( and not just the ones who live in my house ) . <p> 1 . Photography . Megan got a good starter camera for Christmas and seems to have a natural eye for composition . She is excited about fostering that with some photography classes , either online or local . We 're still searching out our options , so if you have suggestions for online courses , please leave them in the comments . <p> 2 . Music . If you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gifted musician . He 's already teaching his craft to others . We chose local classes , but there are a variety of online music class options . <p> Because Josh has a high interest in music , we 've broken down his electives into music instruction ( guitar ) and music theory ( guitar ) , so far . If you have a talented student who will be playing the same instrument for several years in high school , too , consider narrowing their focus each year so that they can take credit for each year . <p> 3 . Film making . Two of my teens ' friends are very interesting in film making . One of them really hopes to pursue a career in the industry . She has taken several local classes , including one summer class through a local community college . <p> Brianna dabbled around a bit with video game design using Freshi Learning Online ( FLO ) , but they also offer courses in film making . All of their courses are self-paced , video-based classes that use industry-standard texts and software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of mediums and interests .

Some ideas include : <p> Sculpting <p> Pottery <p> Painting <p> Animation <p> Drawing <p> Textile arts knitting , sewing , crochet , quilting , etc . <p> 5 . Drama . If community theater is as big in your area as it is in mine , there is no shortage of options for teens to get involved in a variety of plays . We are fortunate in that we generally have a couple of types of plays available at almost any given time " the kid-friendly ones in which everyone who auditions gets at least a small part and the more serious shows in which only a handful of potential actors secure a role . <p> In most areas in which community theater is popular , - there should also be plenty of behind-the-scenes jobs for teens who prefer painting and building sets ; helping with costumes and make-up ; operating lights and sound ; or apprenticing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teens will be excited about taking a driver 's ed course because having a driver 's license is the gateway to mobile independence . There are options from various curriculum providers . Our state produces a handbook for parents to work through with their teens , plus we opted for Josh to take a class ( with both classroom and driving time ) at a local driving school . We 're hoping the investment will be returned in insurance discounts . <p> 7 . Woodworking . If you 've got a teen who loves to work with his or her hands , consider a woodworking class . Josh has also done leatherworking and blacksmithing because we are fortunate enough to have places for both in our area and a homeschool dad friend who is into stuff like that . <p> 8 . Entrepreneurial skills . If you 've got a young entrepreneur , capitalize on that . Look for some classes on business math and management . You might even combine some of your student 's other interests with an entrepreneurial endeavor " let your woodworker , artist , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Psychology . Hands-down , my favorite class in high school was psychology . It could have been the teacher , who was fabulous and a favorite among all the seniors , or the fact that you had to be a senior to take the class , so there was a little status involved . Either way , it was a fascinating class and I still remember quite a bit from it . I 'm keeping some homeschool resources in mind for my kids , such as : <p> 10 . Archery . We have a local shop that teaches archery courses and , being smart business owners , they have lots of daytime classes for homeschoolers . It 's still on our to-do list because we 're trying to coordinate everyone 's schedules since it 's a class that all three of my kids and my husband and I are all interested in . I blame it on The Hunger Games . <p> It does n't matter if it 's an archery class , karate , swimming , or whatever . Any sport or activity that your student is interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I recently wrote about why blogging and video-sharing make sense for school credit . There is a local class that my youngest is very interested in . It 's a novel writing class and at the end the students ' books are published and are presenting at a book signing at a local bookstore . How cool is that for budding writers ? <p> I hope this has given you some creative ideas for electives . If not , just look at the ways that your teens choose to spend their free time . Is there a way to turn those interests into an elective ? If so , capitalize on that . Do n't take their hobby and make it school . Instead , just consider all of the educational aspects of their hobby and run with it . 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <p> Your comment about putting knitting , sewing , and other handicrafts under the " home ec " umbrella is giving me flashbacks to 7th grade , when the boys got to do the cool stuff like woodworking and the girls were stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Deserved or not , the term " home ec " is the kiss of death . Oh , its home ec ? No thanks . I 'm 43 years old and stay-home mom with 5 kids who makes quilts , and I still have a kneejerk reaction to avoid home ec stuff . <p> On the other hand , if knitting and sewing and similar crafts were presented as a form of art , just as valid a pursuit as painting or theater then were in business . That 's why I started making quilts because they 're a beautiful form of art . Having a blanket for your bed is just bonus . So when discussing elective options , YES ! List handicrafts ! Encourage knitting and crochet and other forms of handicrafts as the arts ! Not home ec . <p> That 's an excellent point . I honestly was n't denigrating handicrafts at all . The pieces that my daughter and cousin ( who knit and crochet respectively ) are most definitely works for art . And quilts ? Do n't  even get me started . I so wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges might view handicrafts on a transcript . Would knitting get raised eyebrows where home ec would not ? <p> After thinking about it a bit because I saw your comment right before leaving the house to run an errand it occurred to me that all of those handicrafts would fall under the heading " textile arts . " I 'm going to go back and edit the post , because I think that would give some parents and their teens much more confidence in awarding credit for the hours spent on projects like quilting , knitting , crocheting , sewing , etc . <p> Kris , I always enjoy your posts !

Eventually , the copper will react with the oxygen in the air and the rinsed penny will dull . This will take a long duration of time . <p> However , the salt and vinegar left on the unrinsed penny causes a different reaction between the copper and the oxygen in the air . As a result , copper oxide was formed and the penny turned a blue-green color in just a couple hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vary the amounts of salt and vinegar and test the reaction time . <p> Marci is a Christian wife , homeschool mom , science geek , softball coach , ice rink mom and blogger , who needs her morning coffee , hair done and make-up on before attempting of those things .

I 'm not necessarily the follow-through type , but that 's another post for another day . I 've compiled 10 of my favorite posts with tips for organizing your homeschool from over the years . <p> We 're not necessarily still using all of these tips , but all have been instrumental in helping me stay organized , at one time or another , over the last ten years of homeschooling . <p> 1 . Create a Mom Binder . I started my mom binder back when I was writing and planning my own unit studies . Since then it 's served as a home for my lesson plans , a place to store my weekly planner printouts , my prayer journal , and , now , more than anything else , my blog planning calendar . <p> Through all its changes , though , the central theme is that my mom binder has provided a place to store the stuff that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . Finding creative spots to store your stuff . We homeschooling moms like to collect curriculum and school supplies . It can become overwhelming , so its very helpful to find creative ways to store your homeschool supplies so that you 're not in danger of being featured on something like Hoarders : The Homeschool Edition . <p> 3 . Use milk crates . A few years ago , I was using milk crates for our version of workboxes . I quit using them a few years ago because they did n't really work well with what the kids were doing for school at that time . <p> However , Brianna asked to start using them again this year when we moved away from Switched on Schoolhouse . She says that it helps her stay on track and keep focused on what she needs to do each day . Hey , it works for me ! <p> 4 . Top Ten Uses for Index Cards . There are so many uses for index cards . I do n't think there is a day that goes by in our homeschool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fashion . This old , but still-relevant post shares some of our uses , past and present , for index cards . <p> 5 . Color Coordinating Supply Boxes . Depending on how many kids you have , this may not work for you , but it worked well for our three for a couple of years . We even had rulers , scissors , protractors and compasses to match ! - Toss in character pencils in each person 's favorite ( we had Spider Man , Pirates of the Caribbean and Barbie , if I recall correctly ) and you always know whose stuff is whose . <p> 6 . Tips for prolonging the life of your homeschool texts . Let 's face it " if you have more than one child , you need for your homeschool books to last as long as possible so you can pass them down to the next kid . This post shares my favorite tip for helping your school books last longer . <p> 7 . Homeschool Scheduling and Planning . This is an older post that explains the method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guide came along and made my life so much easier . Still , it stood me in good steed for many years , so it might help you , too , if your current curriculum requires some lesson planning . <p> 8 . Grab-and-Go Bags . Having pre-stocked bags for certain types of outings can make getting out the door in a hurry without forgetting something much more doable . Find out what bags we keep stocked and ready to go . <p> 9 . Tips for Encouraging Independent Learning . I think , for all of us , one of our ultimate goals with homeschooling is to produce life-long leaners who know how to expand their knowledge base independently . This post shares simple tips for helping kids gain the confidence to take charge of their education . <p> 10 . Lesson Plans . Finally , just know that , no matter how well you plan , some days your lesson plans will look like mine did in this last post . <p> I hope you picked up some new tips that you can use .

Still not " official " this year , but it will be official come spring . <p> These are great Kris ! I am just now FINALLY learning how to implement all my great organizational ideas I 'm a great organizer , but I stink at actually USING what Ive organized : D HEE HEE Totally pinning this post ! <p> Great tips ! ! Even when my kids were in public school I used to color coordinate their stuff . Usually with their favorite color . For one than I knew what I had to buy from year to year and what child was n't bringing stuff back home . : ) <p> Oh good ! I 'm not the only one that LOVES making the plan but totally stinks in the follow through . Lightbulbs were lighting up when I read Cynthia Tobiass " How They Learn " . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand why Im good at making the plan but not so good at sticking to it . <p> Thanks for all the links , maybe I 'll find something to help me in my weak points ! <p> The best way is by having a vision that it can be done and by working with your own personality . The hardest part is starting up , but as time goes on , you 'll learn and get used to the things that needs to be done . 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234 
@@108016876 @3416876/ <h> What to Do When Your Child Wo n't Do His Schoolwork <p> March 21 , 2016 By Kris Bales <p> What do you do when your homeschooled child wo n't do his schoolwork ? That can be a frustrating situation for both the parent and the child , - but how to handle it really depends on why its happening . In most cases , resistance to doing schoolwork is n't caused by blatant defiance . <p> First , determine the cause of the resistance . The response will obviously vary if there is- a discipline issue rather than , say , a readiness issue . <p> Resistance to work may mean your child is n't ready for formal learning. - Just because traditional schools start formal learning at age 5 does n't mean that all kids are developmentally ready at that age . One of the biggest benefits of homeschooling is being able to customize each childs education to his needs . For some kids , that may mean delaying formal learning . <p> If your child is crying or acting angry , frustrated , or bored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spend time exploring the world through active play , hands-on learning and reading great books . <p> Resistance to work may result from subject-specific readiness issues. - We went through a period with my oldest when it was clear that a formal spelling program was a waste of our time . She was n't retaining what she was learning and was clearly not ready for the material . <p> Although it made me nervous to do so , we put spelling aside for a year or so . When we came back to it , her retention improved and her attitude toward the subject had remained positive because I had n't  made- it a battleground . <p> If your child is n't retaining what he 's learning or appears frustrated , you may need to put the material aside for a few weeks or months to give her time to reach a level of developmental readiness . <p> Resistance to do schoolwork can be related to difficulty staying focused. - When my oldest was in 3rd or 4th grade , it used to take her forever to complete one simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the work , she just did n't  enjoy math and found it difficult to maintain focus . <p> For us , a reward system for completing her work in a timely fashion proved to be an effective solution . After determining that she should be able to complete the work in about 30 minutes , I gave her a goal of 45 minutes , allowing a little buffer time . <p> For each day that she finished her work before the timer went off , she got to put a sticker on a sheet. - She could trade a few stickers for a small prize , such as a candy bar at the grocery store checkout line , or save them up for a bigger prize , such as a date night with Mom or Dad . <p> It was n't long before she figured out that she had much more time to do what she wanted if she did n't drag her feet over math , and we quit using the reward system . <p> If your child is procrastinating over his work , it could be a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curriculum or approach to learning , or try something like our reward program . <p> Resistance to work may be an indicator that your child is feeling overwhelmed . If your child is dragging his feet in one or more subject areas , it could be that he is struggling with understanding the material , managing his time , or feeling overwhelmed with the amount of work . I have known more than one kid " and not all of them my own- " who dealt with those issues by just shutting down . <p> Do n't require him to complete all the problems ( Remember how excited you used to get when your teacher assigned only the odd-numbered problems ? ) <p> Resistance- to work make indicate that your child is bored . If your child is procrastinating or dawdling , it may be that she finds the work tedious or boring . If you 've got a quick , ready learner , he may need more more challenging or engaging materials or a different approach to learning . Some kids may prefer video-based teaching . Others may prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a character issue. - How to proceed in this case is going to vary from family to family- and based on the root cause of the behavior. - I would begin with prayer and discussion with my spouse about how to handle the situation . <p> I used to think that homeschooling parents who would encourage others to put schoolwork aside for a time while dealing with character issues were crazy . I mean , that was just going to teach the kids that they could act out and get out of schoolwork , right ? <p> Not necessarily . <p> Sometimes you need to stop what you 're doing to have a heart-to-heart talk with a child . Often this will uncover what it actually going on and you can reach a solution and sometimes , stopping to talk it over will get you nowhere . <p> On those- occasions , I would sometimes send the defiant kid to his ( or her ) room until Brian got home to discuss the problem . Then , that kid finished schoolwork with Dad while everyone else went on with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dads should be the heavy disciplinarian or that moms ca n't handle a kids ' bad behavior on their own . However , sometimes it helps for the child to have a different parent with a different style to work with . <p> And sometimes it 's better for everyone involved to do some tag-teaming with the parent who 's not already frustrated with the child and his behavior . <p> Like us , kids may need to work out their frustrations . Taking a walk or giving them a job to do can be effective . Picking up sticks or trash in the yard , for example , gets kids away from the source of their frustration , gives them a physical outlet for relieving it , and offers them a sense of accomplishment . <p> And , yes , we have taken away privileges and/or electronics for bad attitudes and done early bedtimes and such . <p> Resistance to work may be related to an emotional issue. - Sometimes emotional struggles manifest themselves during school time. - If your child has dealt with some major upheaval in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and someone ( you , a family friend , another relative , or even a counselor ) to talk with to learn more effective coping skills . <p> Thankfully , we really have n't had many issues with a kid refusing to do work in a defiant manner , but we have dealt with learning struggles , readiness issues , feeling overwhelmed , and emotional issues . It 's been my experience that taking time to address these , even if it means working through the curriculum at a slower pace , usually resolves the issue without any lingering negative impact . <p> What suggestions do you have for dealing with a child who is n't completing his schoolwork ? 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> Thank you for the timely post . We have this same issue because my son is dyslexic and there seems to be a struggle in certain subjects . I initially thought the issues were because he just flat out refused to do the work however I began to see he was simply struggling . <p> Thanks for answering my question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do all these things and are going to start the ADD evaluation process now . I am hoping not for a magic cure but at least for some sound medical reason with other options to help him ( drugs are an option but not our automatic choice ) . <p> Deanna , I know that ADD is extremely over-diagnosed and kids over-medicated in traditional school settings , but I do n't believe that to be true among homeschooling families . I think most homeschooling families use medication as a last resort , but I 've seen medication do wonders with kids who really need it . <p> I hope you get some answers . Sometimes just having a diagnosis helps you know where to start in finding workable solutions for your family . <p> You might want to check out a couple of helpful books such as " How to Get Your Child off the Refrigerator and on to Learning , " by Carol Barnier or " Right-Brained Children in a Left-Brained World , " by Jeffrey Freed . I gleaned some wonderful ideas from each . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOT a behavior problem , but has ADD , and her grades improve dramatically when she is on her medications . My brothers have ADHD , and it 's immediately apparent , visiting the evenings , if they 've refused their meds that day . Not all kids are like that , and there are non-meds things that can be done to help ( I recommend the book " Transforming the Difficult Child : the nurtured heart approach " ) , but meds can make a huge difference . <p> The other thing I 'd add to the list of things that Chris listed is a quick check to see if the child is tired , hungry , or sick . Last week Monkey felt grungy almost all week , and the resistance to doing school was large all week long , even though he usually enjoys the things we do . When I asked him to get his socks at one point , telling him I wanted to take him on a walk , he cried and asked for a nap . He loves going outside , and nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first things I like to check when he 's giving me static about doing things is , " How is this child feeling , physically ? " <p> My ds has anxiety issues and possibly Aspergers ( in the testing process right now ) , and for him , sometimes it 's that he gets anxious and upset when he does n't immediately understand something . Many times , once he is at that boiling point , he ca n't be reasoned with , so I let me go and do something that relaxes him for 20 minutes or so and usually he 'll come in later on and be ready to complete his work . Another thing that has helped him is making a chart with pictures and words that shows each step of the school day . He knows that after piano is break time , etc . Frequent breaks help a lot too , though they make the school day much longer . <p> My son was diagnosed as being bipolar two years ago ( imagine a.d.h.d , anxiety , depression , o.c.d. , o.d.d. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normalcy cycling several times a day ) . We 're doing much better now than we were a year ago , but let me tell you that we have been through a lot and tried a lot of different things . <p> When I come across articles or posts on this subject I usually find very little that is applicable in my situation . Your thoughts here , though , are right on . I second everything you said ! <p> p.s . I really like your term " heart issue " sometimes those are the hardest to figure out , but a kid with a " heart issue " just is n't going to learn until that heart is healed . Thanks again for your post . <p> Oh , I had one of those major battles of the will with my youngest today . She is not adjusting to big school verses preschool well . We always have a TON of dog poop to clean up LOL One of the best ideas Ive heard in awhile ! Seriously , though , this is a great post .

I have been homeschooling ( or rather trying to homeschool ) my 13 year old daughter for 8 months and I am really frustrated , since I can-t seem to reach her . It is as if she thought homeschooling means no-schooling at all . I have her until december to adapt to not atteding school and didn-t push her to do schoolwork , but I think it really is time for her to start learning . She used to make very good grades at schol , but if I ask if she wants to go back , she says no . She definetly needs time management skills , but is not very open to learning them . 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

This year I asked my nine-year old to choose a subject hed like to learn more about . He chose cooking . <p> Since he s our oldest child , as well as the pickiest eater of the five kids , I was n't sure what to expect .

Then divide the batter into the squeeze bottles , and tint each bottle with food coloring . We prefer the gel-type food coloring for brighter colors , but liquid drops work too . <p> Lightly oil the griddle , and turn to medium heat . When warm , gently squeeze patterns of colored batter onto the griddle . <p> ( I know this is probably obvious , but please , please be careful when cooking with kids and heat . Supervision and age-appropriate abilities should be factored into this activity . My younger ones are just as fascinated by this project when they sit back from the heat and watch . ) <h> A few pancake art tips : <p> Sometimes a glob of batter will get stuck in the tip of the squeeze bottle , so keep a toothpick or something handy to quickly unclog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pop , and edges look cooked , pancakes are ready to flip . <p> Were no professionals , and usually just go with whatever designs we can swirl up .

@@108016885 @3416885/ <h> Review : Nutrition 101 <p> September 22 , 2009 By Kris Bales <p> When I was first offered the opportunity to review Growing Healthy Homes Nutrition 101 : Choose Life , I was n't especially excited. - Were not exactly a health conscience kind of family around here. - I mean , we eat at fast food places at least once a week. - What was I going to do with a healthy-eating cookbook ? <p> I immediately realized that Nutrition 101 is n't a cookbook. - Yes , it has recipes. - Yes , they 're healthy ( and pretty tasty ) . - But , Nutrition 101 is n't a cookbook at all. - Its a complete , biblically-based health and nutrition curriculum for all ages. - The 448-page , colorfully-illustrated , fact-filled book covers all these topics : <p> The Brain and Nervous System <p> The Digestive System <p> The Respiratory , Olfactory , Auditory and Visual System <p> The Muscular and Skeletal Systems <p> The Cardiovascular and Immune Systems <p> The Endocrine System &amp; Emotions <p> Each of the six units in Nutrition 101 contains four chapters that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it is intended to work and how proper nutrition ( or improper nutrition ) affects the performance of our minds and bodies. - - Each unit will help you and your family put into practice what you 're learning with : <p> Discussion questions <p> Activity suggestions for a variety of ages and abilities ( which allows the curriculum to grow with your family so that you can use it year after year ! ) <p> Additional resources for further study <p> A " power recipe " for you to try <p> I 'm looking forward to continuing with Nutrition 101 next school year because I think it will make the perfect resource for a high school health class , as well as a wonderful supplement to biology and home economics. - I know well be pulling the book out to explore the wonderful , high-quality illustrations , which are better than I 've seen in most science books. - I learned as much as the kids did in our first unit , the brain. - I was fascinated learning which part of the brain controls which functions of the body. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry science facts. - And , all the kids enjoyed the activity that had them trying to brush their teeth , eat and write with their non-dominant hand . <p> The huge appendix section in the back of the book is an incredible wealth of information in and of itself. - Its also the part , along with the recipes , that would make Nutrition 101 a great supplement to a home economics class. - Some of the topics covered are : <p> How to choose fresh produce ( I took notes on that one I had no idea how to choose many of the fruits and vegetables on the extensive list . ) <p> Kitchen safety <p> Nutritional Recommended Daily Allowances for Men , Women and Children <p> Fiber-rich Foods <p> Baking with Whole Grains <p> Other appendix topics would be great to supplement a health class , such as : <p> Reproductive Health <p> Cancer <p> Sleep <p> Nail Health Care <p> Asthma <p> Labels and Household Toxins <p> One the most useful things about Nutrition 101 for me , as the teaching parent , was that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple suggestion about which parts of each chapter you might want to do for each day of the week , but that simple breakdown of the chapters and activities really made it easy to plan my week. - I also really like that this curriculum has activity suggestions for elementary and secondary students , as well as suggestions for further study , so its something that whole family can enjoy together . <p> Nutrition 101 : Choose Life , whose co-authors include two homeschool moms and a home ec teacher , is sold as a CD-ROM for $79.95 , a printed book for $99.95 , or a CD/book combo for $129.95. - You might also want to take a look at the other products offered by Growing Healthy Homes . 148233 @qwx1008233 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <p> It sounds interesting but I suspect I 'd pass unless I could get a second hand copy somewhere . <p> ( I know , it 's detailed and has lesson plan suggestions and everything , but it just does n't sound like something I 'd be willing to spend that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Prolly LOL .. it just seems expensive ) <p> Yes , I was definitely blessed to receive this to review because the price tag would have been a deciding factor for me , as well . I think that 's good feedback for the publishers , though , so thanks for mentioning it . <p> And , the truth is , I 'd *much* rather have a printed book than an eBook , which drives the price up even more . *sigh* <p> I am very grateful that I 've had the opportunity to review it , though , because it *is* going to make an excellent resource in the coming years . Who knows ? We may even start eating healthier . ; - ) <p> Even with the price tag this looks interesting . My 14 year old loves to cook and create in the kitchen , something like this might help count this as Home Ec. , for both him and me . LOL . I 'm not a terribly creative or healthy cook so it 's difficult for me to guide him . Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the review . <p> I think that 's good feedback for the publishers , though , so thanks for mentioning it . .. <p> Yeah that 's why I figured I 'd go ahead and say what I thought about the cost I debated for a few minutes , but figured it would be silly to not say anythingthe publishers benefit from knowing what their target audience thinks . : - ) <p> It does sound awesome though it 's just the price that takes away from the appeal . <p> I happened to get this at a convention special of $99.95 for the printed book along with the cd version . I have to say that I love the book , the information inside , the pictures are beyond wonderful , accurate and detailed . I would not consider this as JUST a curriculum but as a REFERENCE book to be used for years to come . <p> I 'm sure the cost of self pubishers is high compared to major curriculum companies . 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

So just how do you keep your kids motivated to achieve their SMART goals this year ? <h> Keep Kids Motivated to Achieve Their SMART Goals <h> Marble Jar <p> Have you ever set up a marble jar for the family ? First find yourself a fancy jar or a quart canning jar to keep on the counter . Place a bowl of marbles next to the jar . Make sure you have enough marbles to fill the jar . <p> Now brainstorm a long list of activities which will bring your kids closer to their goals .

Every time one of your children does an activity which will bring them closer to achieving their goals , drop a marble into the jar . <p> Gradually the jar will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much closer they are to achieving their SMART goals . <p> When the jar is filled , do something fun as a family .

The kids have to check up with each other about their progress towards their goals . Did they practice violin today ? Stress that the children must be polite and civil to one another . Name-calling is not allowed . <p> Another method is to make all your kids accountability partners with yourself . You choose a different personal goal for each child to track for you . The goal could be staying on top of the laundry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you hold each child accountable to you for achieving one of their SMART goals . <p> My favorite method is simply to add accountability to the family dinner conversation .

Brainstorm solutions as a family when setbacks appear . <h> Make Goals Fun <p> After the first excitement of goal setting wears off , kids are left looking at a year of tedious tasks . So instead of watching your kids wander back into their old habits , brainstorm ways to make their goals fun . <p> Perhaps your children can walk while playing Pokemon Go , find their favorite book in French and begin translating it , or stick a smiley face on the calendar each time they complete a task towards their goal . <p> Sometimes just seeing how far they can go before breaking a winning streak is enough to keep kids motivated . <h> Make Alternate Plans <p> When kids are setting their SMART goals , they forget to plan for the inevitable setbacks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week . The language DVD breaks . Outside commitments take up every spare minute . <p> The reason for the setback does n't  matter . What does matter is that your kids will hit snags along the road . Its as inevitable as laundry . <p> Before the setbacks arrive , brainstorm alternative plans with your kids . Make a list of ways to study French without a language DVD . Devise a simple method of practicing music without actually having the instrument in hand . <p> Make alternate plans for achieving goals before the problems arrive . <p> With these simple tips , you 'll be able to encourage your children to stay motivated through the year and be part of the small percentage who actually keep their New Years Resolutions . 148232 @qwx1008232 148231 @qwx1008231 148235 @qwx1008235 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

@@108016893 @3416893/ <p> Homeschooling is a big commitment . It can seem overwhelming at times . Lots of people have advice for how to make your homeschool successful . Today , I want to offer you 10 ways to ruin your homeschool . You know , in case you ever feel a need to purposely sabotage your efforts . <p> 1 . Expect all of your children to learn the same way . Just like they all have different personalities , each of your children probably has a different learning style . If you really want to ruin your homeschool , be sure to fail to recognize how each of your children learns best and do n't allow for their strengths and weaknesses . <p> 2 . Compare your homeschool to someone else 's . Your family is not someone else 's family . You can make great strides toward ruining your homeschool by overlooking the fact that God put your family together for His purposes . Be sure to look for any opportunity to compare your home , your school and your family to someone else " housework and schoolwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your homeschool by forgetting that homeschooling is more than a means of educating a child ; it 's a way of life . Do n't leave any room for flexibility during those times when life happens . <p> Different teaching and parenting styles will result in different needs when it comes to planning , but I need a basic outline for the year , the week and the day . A flexible homeschool planning schedule keeps me sane and on track . It also helps me get going again when things inevitably get off-track . <p> With that in mind , a good tactic for ruining my homeschool is being so flexible that I do n't have any sort of plan . <p> 5 . Let the curriculum dictate your day . I guess this kind of goes with flexibility , but letting the curriculum dictate your day is a quick way to ruin your homeschool . Do n't let your curriculum be a tool for you to use , but rather , allow it to be a master for you to follow . <p> Make sure you follow your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that do n't fit well for your family or with your available time . Never , ever skip things , put them off until another time , or supplement other resources that might be a better fit . <p> 6 . Never make it fun . If you really want to ruin your homeschool , do n't ever make it fun . Do n't go on any field trips . Do n't do any hands-on learning activities . Do n't read any historical fiction or biographies . Just stick with textbooks . Keep those kids ' noses to the grindstone . Make sure every textbook is completely finished every year . No matter what . <p> 7 . Try to make it all fun . You can also quickly ruin your homeschool by trying to make it all fun . It 's your job , homeschooling parent , to entertain your kids . They should n't have to learn that not everything in life " or school , or home , or homeschool " is fun . Make sure they do n't discover that some things you do just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to be your kids ' ongoing entertainment . <p> 8 . Never leave the house . Stay home . All day , every day . If you have a basement , that 's a good place to store your kids . Do n't go on play dates or field trips . Do n't do co-ops or outside class . Make sure you never leave you home during the school day . Ever . <p> 9 . Never stay home . If you do n't want to always stay home , then , another option for quickly ruining your homeschool is to never stay home . Make sure you 've got something going on every hour of every day outside of the house . Do scouts , sports , band , outside classes , clubswhatever you can think of as long as you 're not at home . <p> 10 . Do n't pray over your homeschool . If you really want to wreck your homeschool , make sure that you never seek God 's will , wisdom , and guidance . Make sure you 're doing this totally on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't bother God with your questions or concerns . <p> Those are my suggestions for ruining your homeschool What tips would you add ? <p> ( Not everyone seems to get my particular brand of humor . In case you did n't get it , this was meant as a joke , so there 's no need to leave ugly comments about what a horrible parent I am . Unless it just makes you feel better to do so . ) <p> 1 . Not having enough time to eat lunch . I cant tell you how many times my daughter came home from school with a lunch box still full of food . She still ( six years later ) says that one of her favorite things about homeschooling is that she has time to eat lunch . <p> 2 . Getting up early . We are so NOT morning people . My kids grumble about having to get up at 10:00 . <p> 3 . Homework ! My oldest would come home from school with 2 or 3 hours of homework each nightin first grade ! When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Or , its ALL homework if you 're a " the glass is half empty kind of person . " ) <p> 4 . Field trips . We do n't  miss them because we still take themonly , we actually get to enjoy them since we have time to really look at things without 29 other kids in front of us . <p> 5 . Class parties . Yeah , we have those , tooexcept we just call them parties and they 're with our support group friends . Last year , my poor , unsocialized homeschooled kids exchanged Valentines with fifty or sixty of their closest friends . <p> 6 . Square pizza . My oldest missed that for about four months . Then , she told me and I started making our pizza in a rectangular pan . Problem solved . <p> 7 . After school tutoring . Funny thing about a self-paced , customized , one-on-one education . You do n't  really have to stay after school to stay caught up . <p> 8 . The big playground . The park that 's about ten minutes from our house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ourselves during the week , though we do like to share it with a few friends . <p> 9 . Friends . We do n't  miss those because we have lots of them , too . Good friends with whom we share actual interest , not just desk proximity . <p> 10 . School food . Seriously , is there any need to elaborate on that ? <p> 11 . The extras . We have a music class , a music/art/nature study co-op , rec league sports .

However , I 've often been asked for suggestions on activities for homeschooled teens when- a local homeschool group is n't available . <p> I 'm going to offer the ideas that came to my mind and I hope y'all will add others in the comments " particularly if you live in an area without an active homeschool group and you 've been able to come up with activities for your teen . <h> Sports that are n't school-based <p> If you 've got an athletic teen , look into sports that are n't school-based . These activities can be fantastic opportunities for homeschooled teens , who can join leagues or teams that practice and play outside of typical school hours . Some ideas include : <p> Tennis <p> Golf <p> Archery <p> Fencing <p> Swimming <p> Bowling <p> Gymnastics <p> Dance <p> Surfing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative for athletic teens because it 's not difficult to find races in most places during the spring and fall . Check to see if your town has a track club if your student would like to get involved in running clubs that meet during the week to train together . <h> Sports with travel teams <p> There are also a variety of team sports that we typically think of as school-based , but which also boast travel teams for talented kids who do n't play with their schools . The downside to these options is that the travel part of travel teams can get expensive . Still , if you 've got a sports-minded teen , it may be worth the expense . Plus , you have the added benefit of being able to take school on the road . <p> You can often find travel teams for sports such as : <p> Baseball <p> Softball <p> Volleyball <p> Basketball <p> Soccer <h> The arts <p> If your teen is more arts-minded than sports-minded , consider the following possibilities : <p> Drama . Most cities have a local theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art . Check local arts and crafts stores . Most of the ones in our area have a variety of classes for teens and adults . Check with rec centers for pottery or sculpting classes . <p> Speech . Does your town have a Toastmaster 's Club ? See if your teen can participate . We had a lady from the Toastmaster 's Club do a speech class for a small group of homeschooled teens at our local library a few years ago . <p> Photography . Check with your local community college to see if they offer any continuing ed classes for photography ( or art ) . You might also check with individual photographers to see if they might be interested in an apprentice . You can also look for online classes . There are many wonderful online photography courses . <p> Music . Private music lessons are available all over the country . If you 're having trouble finding someone , ask at the area music stores or check the bulletin board at your library . <h> Family activities <p> One of the benefits of homeschooling is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teen may be as simple as spending time together as a family . Some fun ways to get active with your teen are : <p> Bicycling <p> Hiking <p> Camping <p> Kayaking/Canoeing <p> Fishing <p> Hunting <p> Horseback riding <p> Rock climbing <h> Other activities <p> Check your local rec center , YMCA , church , or community college for other options . You might also ask around at coffee shops . There used to be a group of deaf and hearing teens and adults who would meet once a week at a local coffee shop for the hearing folks to learn and practice sign language . You never know what might be available if you just ask around . <p> I 'm sure I 've left out some wonderful ideas . What other suggestions do you have for activities for homeschooled teens when a local homeschool support group is n't an option ? 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> If your teen has hobbies , there may be community groups for those- a woodworkers club , an astronomy group/stargazing club , etc . Granted , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that can be good too ! <p> Our library has a lot of great programs , like an anime club , computer classes , gardening clubs , book discussion groups , etc . There is also a camera store nearby that holds photography classes . I also want to encourage people who may not have the financial means for a lot of these programs . We have one income and 11 kids , so we obviously have to try to work our way around the cost of the more expensive classes . My advice is to inquire if there are financial scholarships available if your child is interested in something . We have utilized the scholarship program at the local art school . Because of it , our oldest daughter has been able to take classes in drawing and painting , flash animation , and narrative illustration ; our 11 yr. old has taken a ceramics class . They never would have had the opportunity had I not inquired about financial assistance because the school does not advertise this . <p> One of the things my teens have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council in structure it gives the teens opportunities to serve , lead and have fun . As an added bonus it looks great on college applications . They have done things like help at city events , Pass out water at city sponsored races and they also have had the chance to attend statewide leadership conferences . <p> My daughter who is turning 12 this fall has been involved with 4H since she was 6 and loves it . She has made many friends through 4H and as she gets older its broadening her horizons even more . She is learning baking , sewing , forestry , hiking safety and photography at the moment . The fair is this week and she not only entered projects but is finally old enough to work as a junior superintendent in the 4H building . She has also done a ton of community service this year through 4H . I cant say enough about the program or the kids involvedits awesome ! <p> A woman at my church started a group for girls so her homeschooled daughter , then aged 9 , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is focused on faith , friendship , activities and crafts . The group ( including my daughter ) has been meeting for 7 years now , has an average of about 10 girls attending every week from ages 13-16 , and they are all each others best friends . The added bonus for me , I have an awesome group of mommy friends now , too ! <p> This is such a great list ! I have n't even thought of most of this stuff because my kids are still early elementary age . We live in a small town ( and are lucky to have a great homeschool communitybut not a lot of activities during the summer ) . So I just called up a bunch of friends and organized a few summer camps for the kids myself . It took a lot of planning but it made my kids SO happy and only cost me $20 to put it all on . <p> If you have older children volunteering could also be a great option . Its free , it looks great on college and job applications , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar interests . My oldest 2 volunteered at a local animal shelter . One of them ended up being a veterinary technician . The other is a " certified " " cat behaviorist " . The Shelter they volunteered at offered both of them a job after 6 months as a volunteer and provided most of the education and certification free ! Another child volunteered at a homeless shelter . He s grown and married now with his own small children &amp; he takes them with him as he continues to fit in volunteering at food banks and homeless shelters as an adult . What ever your childs interest or passion is there 's a place or organization that could use volunteer help . 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

I was offered the opportunity to review two of Grapevines Bible study courses . My first choice was Biblical Feasts and Holy Days , about which I was very excited because that 's an area of study in which I 've recently become very interested . For my other selection , I chose one of my personal favorites , Esther . <p> We began with Biblical Feasts and Holy Days . Right away , I picked up something that has greatly enhanced our Bible study time : letting the kids illustrate what I 'm teaching . As my regular readers may recall , my family has a Bible study curriculum that we 've used for years and I 've mentioned before that my kids favorite part of our weekly study is when I teach that weeks lesson and illustrate it on the white board . It never occurred to me that they might enjoy illustrating the lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using Grapevine Studies , I 've set up a Bible notebook for each of the kids and they do their own illustrations for each lesson I teach . Grapevines slogan is " stick figuring through the Bible , " so you do n't  have to be an artist to create a visual representation of each Bible lesson . And , let me tell you , what you draw , you rememberat least , that 's the case with the kids and I. <p> This method of illustrating the lessons being taught engages each child , no matter their learning style . They 're hearing the lesson , seeing the lesson , and drawing the lesson , so it is , at once , auditory , visual , and kinesthetic . Its fun , too ! <p> One of the things that I appreciate about Grapevine Studies is their " teacher-directed doctrinal approach . " The lessons are presented in a non-denominational way so that each individual teacher can explain his or her specific doctrinal beliefs as it applies to the lesson . <p> I also really like the way that Grapevine Studies start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , in the Biblical Feasts and Holy Days book , we started off with a timeline that gave us an overview of when each feast or holy day was celebrated before going into detail about each . This has already given me some interesting insight into my own personal Bible reading because it gives me a frame of reference whenever any of the feasts and holy days are mentioned . <p> Grapevine Studies offers a variety of Bible study options for children and adults , including multi-level studies perfect for a variety of ages learning together . The studies range in length from the 50-lesson Old and New Testament studies to the 9-lesson study of the book of Esther , and they are perfect for use within your own home or for leading a Sunday School class or Bible study . <p> Prices vary , depending on the products selected . We used the Biblical Feasts and Holy Days teacher book ( $19.95 book , $12.95 eBook ) and student book ( $14.95 ) and the Esther teacher book ( $19.95 book , $10.95 eBook ) and student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books would provide a wonderful stand-alone Bible study , we 've found that theyve also proven to be the perfect complement to our regular Bible curriculum . Since our other Bible curriculum only provides material for three days a week ( the way we use it ) , Grapevine is a wonderful resource to round out a full week of quality , meaningful Bible study . 148233 @qwx1008233 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Trackbacks <p> We did n't  use Grapevine Studies for a long time , but I did really enjoy the simplicity of it and the concept of " stick figuring through the Bible . " My kids always enjoyed having me draw out our Bible lessons , no matter what resource we were using . They may have enjoyed teasing me about my artistic abilities , though I do draw a pretty awesome sheep . Drawing out stick figures helps keep kids interest and gives them a point of reference for remembering the lessons . Drawing the figures for themselves helps reinforce what kids are learning .

Back in their day we had an adorable kid-drawn calendar for marking the days and learning the months of the year and days of the week . We had the alphabet on the wall and cute little bears that helped them practice the concept of yesterday , today , and tomorrow . <p> We had a bulletin board where I displayed the letter , color , shape , and number of the week and cute little things related to the week 's theme .

I thought it turned out really well and I must have been right because Josh and Megan were both upset that I did n't make anything like that for them . The fact that we put the same stuff up on a bulletin board did n't matter to them at all . <p> Our portable preschool learning center featured a spot for shapes , letters , numbers , and colors . Typically , I changed the letter weekly , the number every other week , and the shape and color once a month . <p> I included photos of items whose name started with our letter of the week . Until we got to higher numbers ( and ran out of room ) , I used the number of photos of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I cut the letters out of the border with my handy-dandy Sizzix die cutter . <h> Online resources for preschool <p> I used printables from a variety of sources , but following are the primary sites that I used .

The insights your kids have can be staggering if you take the time to let them show you . Some of the stuff my kids picked up on and understood took my breath away ! <p> 6. - After discussing , take a few minutes to pray. - It is so important to give the kids a chance to pray , so they can learn how to pray with confidence as they approach God . <p> As time went by , I found myself drawn more and more to this kind of study. - Not only were my kids slowly being transformed by their Bible study , but I was too .

" - It seems , so often , that when books or programs make the kind of claims that College Prep Genius does , its expected that success will take little effort on the part of the student. - Thats not the case with College Prep Genius. - Its expected that the student will begin taking practice tests during their 9th grade year and will take multiple practice and actual SAT tests over the course of their high school career in order to achieve their highest results . <p> Although well begin putting most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brianna enters 9th grade , well are going to be using the course over the next few weeks to start laying the foundation for next year. - I 'll be posting a complete review toward the end of the month. - In the meantime , you can read some of the authors articles on topics such as : <p> Ten Terrific Tips To a High SAT Score <p> 13 Common SAT Myths <p> Prepare Your High School Student for College <p> You might also consider hosting- a SAT Prep Workshop in your town led by College Prep Genius author , Jean Burk. - There is a minimum of 10 students , if you 're in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and 25 students for other locations. - The workshop is 10 hours of instruction , designed to be covered in a two- to three-day format , covering math , writing and critical reasoning and includes the lecture , textbook and student workbook for $99 per student . 148233 @qwx1008233 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

It feels good does n't it , to have such a big chunk under our belts ? ! <p> Or does it ? <p> Some of us might be feeling like we are rocking this homeschool thing . Others of us might be feeling like we have n't gotten far enough . Maybe we feel like our progress is lacking or we need to put the nose to the grindstone right now . <p> And maybe we 're right . <p> Feeling the mid-year pressure is normal this time of year . I usually start to feel it after we return from our holiday bliss . After a couple weeks off school , the need for a return to routine is very obvious . I 'm usually quite ready to get back at it . About a week or two after that , the missed spelling words and having to repeat instructions for the same math concept yet again gives me pause . <p> Wait , how do they not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times ? <p> It can be a little dishearteningrealizing there 's things we 've been working on so hard that have n't yet sunk in . Here are a few things I do to remedy that feeling . Because being the mama and the teacher all at once can sometimes cloud my judgment on our progress . <p> I listen to my kids play . The conversations between my kids when they play is almost always something to marvel at . Things that we 've learned and read about come out in conversationsometimes when I least expect it . Eavesdrop . You might be surprised about what comes out of your children 's mouths . <p> I ask my kids to read aloud from a book they 're loving.We all have more passion about things we are truly interested in . Maybe we just need to hear our kiddos in an area they are really excited about . Sit in on your child 's next chapter of Harry Potter or Pippi Longstocking . You might be surprised at how well they 're reading .

You know how you do n't notice how much your kids have grown until you look back at old pictures or they spend a few days at Grandma 's house ? Well , it 's the same with comparing old papers . You are sure to see some amazing progress . <p> I take a look back over my old lesson planning pages.I 've started doing something life-changing this year . Each evening , I 've started recording exactly what we covered or accomplished that day . Sometimes there 's a lot to list and sometimes not so much . I 'll write down things like : - baked cookies and talked about fractions , watched Little House on the Prairie and discussed famines , finished a math lesson , went through flash cards four times.This record-keeping tool has been so great to look back on . But if you have n't been journaling what you 've done each day , look back at your lesson planning pages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll see dates for zoo visits , field trips , lesson plans for math and language arts . Look over those lessons and make mental check marks of what you 've accomplished . It 's a great feeling to see all of that on paper ! <p> After you 've taken some inventory on where you kids are , you might still feel like there are some areas that need work . This is totally normal ! There probably are areas that need some attention . <p> So give those areas all your attention for a while . <p> Push other things aside for a while and only work on multiplication tables or nouns . Hang out there till it clicks or improves . As homeschoolers , exercise this amazing freedom that we have to focus on the problem areas . Exercise all the learning areas visual , auditory , hands-on . Immerse yourselves in the problem area till you see improvement . You will . <p> A good homeschool mama is a conscientious homeschool mama . You are doing an amazing job . 148232 @qwx1008232 <h> About Alicia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teenager .

Once again , this does n't  have to be the case . While some kids have a natural talent in this area , many more do not . To me , writing is n't an area to stress over or to push . <p> I really like what Susan Wise Bauer has to say about writing . She encourages parents not to push journaling unless a child just really enjoys it . She also discourages having a child do a lot of writing until they have had a lot of experience with copywork and dictation first . Her theory is that there is much more involved in writing than most of us realize . First , you have to get in your mind what you want to say . Then , you have to hold that thought in your mind long enough to get your brain to tell your hand to write the words . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having homeschooled for over five years and having talked to many other homeschooling parents , writing is not something that I would feel compelled to really push until about middle school or even high school , at least not in the sense of reports , research papers and things of that nature .

Then , I would move on to dictation somewhere around second or third grade , depending on where the child is with his reading and writing skills . In my opinion , a child should be reading fairly fluently and writing somewhat independently before beginning dictation . Here is a great article explaining dictation . <p> Once you 're ready to move on to the child writing more independently , I highly recommend setting up a Writers Workshop notebook .

I know that there are those who think that , because our kids are homeschooled , they are not being exposed to things to which they should be exposed , so that theyll know how to deal with these things , you know , in the " real world . " <p> I saved an article from The Old Schoolhouse Magazine newsletter on the topic of " sheltering " our kids that was shared by someone in our homeschool support group a while back . I saved the article , because I knew that I would need to be reminded that were raising our kids in a way that , although often misunderstood , is how we feel God would have us to raise them . <p> The article says , in part <p> Were finding that " sheltering " is a bad word in some circles . Something is creeping into the church ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biblical . It is an " anti-sheltering campaign " of sorts , and its full of holes . Think about it . What does it mean to shelter ? Protect . Defend . Guard . Preserve . Watch over . Shield . Safeguard . Hmmmm , so far so good , right ? Sure , until " pop psychology " comes in and tells us we should allow our children to taste a little of the world in order to understand it or pray for it that we should not " over-shelter " them . Nonsense . <p> What 's the opposite of shelter ? Expose . Endanger . We parents are called to be like our Father in Heaven . He is the greatest " Shelterer " there ever was , and it is us He shelters or watches over ; protecting us , preserving us , shielding us . Praise Him for this ! Glory to God who knows how to parent ( shelter ) us perfectly . May we as parents follow this model His model . Let 's continue to shelter ( love ) our children as He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " like beauty , is in the eye of the beholder . What is overly permissive for one family is just right for another . What is over-protective for one family is just protective enough for another . <p> I agree that children do not need to be naive about the things of the world , but they can be taught about worldly things from the basis of our familys beliefs and value system in an age-appropriate manner based on the individual childs maturity level , which only the childs parents are in a position to determine . <p> In my entire 38 years , I have never been offered or pressured by friends to try drugs , smoking or alcohol . I have never tried drugs or cigarettes . I have tried , but never cared for alcohol and years ago signed a covenant not to consume it . Am I naive , innocent or sheltered ? Perhaps . And , I praise my God that it is so ! <p> And , I will continue to do all that is within my power to shelter , protect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and safeguard my children until it is time for the Holy Spirit to take over that job in their lives by giving them the wisdom and discernment to make godly choices . I will do my best to raise my children to be " shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves . " ( Matthew 10:16 ) And , I will refuse to believe Satans lies that God would have me to do anything other than that with the lives to which He has entrusted me. 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <p> I loved this post .

I have two teens who went to public school and if I culd change one thing Ive done in my life THAT would be the thing I would change . BTW , I voted for you ! <p> As knowing you and your children personally , I do n't  think that you are " sheltering " them . They know about the negatives of life . You are just making sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a lot more than they would get at public school . There they just get an " oh well , that 's life " I hate that . <p> I agree . I think that the opinion that children need to know how to deal with the real world is overrated . I know that if we raise our children with their eyes , minds , and hearts focused on Christ there is NOTHING in the real world they wo n't have an answer for . <p> I remember when you wrote about this before , and I think its a great topic . Call it sheltering , call it protecting , I 'm happy to be doing it for my children . I like that I am there with them to guide them through life experiences . I want there to be no doubt in there minds where their parents stand on the issues you bring up in your post , as well as handling issues of bullying , friendships , etc . I want them with me while they are young and developing those strong convictions , so that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , they have that " shield " to carry . Sometimes I worry about my 5-yr. old , whom we 've chosen to send to ps this year , because I know he has n't  had as long to learn the values that are important to us . I know he s not yet ready to be tested , if you kwim . Our family is not Christian , but I think this is similar to how many Christian , homeschooling families are choosing to raise their own kids . <p> Amen ! I was thinking of the Matt 10 verse while I was reading . Once in a while , my husband is amazed at the slang terms that I do n't  know ; often , I tell him I do n't  want to know what they mean . I prefer being sheltered . There is evil out there that I do n't  need to know about . : ) <p> We are not new to homeschooling but rather returning to homeschooling . Your post just summarized everything I have been feeling and exactly why I have decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake ! If it is ok I want to link to this on my blog so family and friends can read it . <p> Earlier I was reading Toast Floats at Alasandras Blog and I thought she pretty much covered what irks homeschoolers the most until I read this entry . Make this #11 and my pet peeve ! <p> I tell people that we should start making our toddlers cross the street by themselves because , " they have to learn how to deal with that kind of stuff . " Paleeese , not until we have fulfilled our Godly parental responsibility to prepare them for what is out there . And in this day and age , that takes a loooong time . <p> Thanks for a great post ! I 'm glad to be " sheltering " my child as well . I wrote a bit about " socialization " a few months back here . And then of course , some of what you said here is listed among the reasons why I homeschool ! <p> I once read a quote , although I can not remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child educated in Hell , or ignorant in Heaven ? " <p> Now I am not saying that by homeschooling your children they will be ignorant , as my husband and I plan to homeschool our children . The point the author of this quote was trying to make is , do you want/need your children to be educated in the " things of this world " if they will be exposed to so many unnecessary things as well ? Sheltering our children can be good , as long as we shelter them from the right things . <p> well I 'm not christian but agreed on main point . Why do I need to expose them to crap and bad influences ? The dangers and miseries of life creep in no matter what you do .

That may or may not be so . <p> Single parents homeschool and work , right ? So do many homeschooling moms who are married . It happens . It can be done . <p> But the fact is , single parents are doing it all and usually on a single income . So how does a single parent afford to homeschool ? <p> First , I want you to realize if a family of four can homeschool on a single income ( usually dad 's ) , then surely a single parent can homeschool on a single income . That 's simple logic . If you 're a single mom making $60,000/year , then I guess you 're set . But for most of us , the matter requires a bit of creativity . <p> Here are some practical ways I 've found for homeschooling my kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I 've homeschooled for as little as $200/year . That 's only about $16 per month . So if I put that back , I 'm good ! ( One year , I homeschooled for about $6 , thanks to my Kindle . ) <p> 2 . Free/Frugal Resources. - One perk of being a homeschool blogger is that I get products and curriculum free of charge . That helps a lot ! If you are not a blogger , however , take some time to hang out on sites like Free Homeschool Deals and enter curriculum giveaways when you see them . It can be a great way to get the supplies that you need each year . <p> 3 . Income tax returns. - I know , I know . Not everyone gets a return . But for those of us who do , it 's a great time to stock up on homeschool curriculum . In fact , this is my #1 way of affording the things I otherwise could n't afford . <p> 5 . Take advantage of local opportunities. - Look around your area for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museums are great for homeschooling . Zoos , aquarium , and marine centers have a lot to offer in the way of learning . Nowadays , many of these places conduct classes for homeschoolers . Some places offer reduced cost or even scholarships for annual passes . <p> These are just a few ways to offer your children a quality education without breaking the bank . <p> Do you have any additional thoughts on it ? What other ways could you save money or better afford homeschooling ? <p> Michelle Cannon is a single mom homeschooling children who have dyslexia and bipolar disorder . She is also a parenting and homeschooling consultant . You can find her blogging at The Heart of Michelle . <p> I have worked all sorts of shifts . I 've worked 1st , 2nd and , yes , even 3rd shift as a call center employee then manager . I 've owned by own cleaning service , which was a hybrid of at-home and outside-the-home work .

Suddenly , you 're once again worried about how to teach this or that , where to find the perfect curriculum , and what if you forget something really important . <p> Homeschooling high school does n't have to be intimidating , but it does help to have a plan. - I like to map out all four high school years before we start 9th grade , so that I have a plan in place and know that nothing important is going to be overlooked . <p> Alternately , you may be able to find your county or state 's graduation requirements online to use as an outline . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 or more needed for college prep . <p> If you are graduating your homeschooled student independently , you can determine the credit hours required yourself , but if you have a child planning to attend college , but sure to check their admissions guidelines to ensure that you 've met the minimums . <p> The general guidelines that I 've found to be fairly consistent are : <p> English " 4 credits <p> Math " 4 credits <p> Science " 3-4 credits ( at least 2 with labs for college prep ) <p> History " 3-4 credits <p> Physical education " 1 credit <p> Health " 0.5 credit <p> Foreign language " 2 credits ( of the same language ) <p> Electives <p> To make sure I do n't miss anything , I have a table set up for my kids , listing the grade level , subject , and required credits for each . Then , I plug in the specific courses they 'll be doing each year ( or some general ideas if we 're not sure ) . That table looks something like this : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using " for example , we 'll probably do an astronomy course instead of physics and I 'm leaning toward American Sign Language instead of Spanish , but it give you some ideas of what you can do for each . <p> You may also be wondering about the English 9 , English 10 , etc . Some sources I read suggested not listing out literature , grammar , and composition as separate courses . We 're basically hitting a little of each in each English course , so if the secondary schools my kids may be attending are used to seeing titles like English 9 and English 10 , I can do that . <p> For us , there will be much more music in the electives column since that is Josh 's passion . For 9th grade , we listed it as performance , since that was his focus last year . For 10th grade , we 'll list it as music theory since that 's his focus this year . <p> Similarly , if you have a student who plays sports , you may have more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll want to list out specific titles , such as gymnastics , volleyball , and swimming . <p> Planning for homeschooling high school does n't have to be intimidating or overwhelming .

When you do , chances are your curriculum is going to encourage you to build a cell model . If it does n't , do it anyway because it 's lots of fun ! <p> There are lots of different ways to build a model of a cell " plant or animal " but these are ten of the best , most awesome ways to make a cell model . Some are edible , some are not , but they 're all really cool . <h> 1 . Cell Cake <p> The cell cake we made when my kids were in middle school was probably one of the most fun , most popular projects we 've ever done . It was simple and tasty . You ca n't go wrong with simple and tasty . <h> 2 . Jell-O Cell <p> We made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not very pretty or particularly appetizing because we used what we had on hand .

This one from 123 Homeschool 4 Me is much prettier and more appetizing than the one we made . <h> 3 . Cookie Cell <p> Another tasty edible cell model option is a cookie cell model . Start with a large chocolate chip cookie ( made in a pizza pan for an animal cell or in a jellyroll pan for a plant cell ) . Then use candies for the organelles or shape them out of fondant . <h> 7 . Sandwich Cell <h> 8 . Shrinky Dinks Cell <p> Because my oldest used to love Shrinky Dinks , this Shrinky Dink cell idea is one of my favorites ! I wish I 'd found it when she was younger .

Sometimes when I watch him getting ready and compare his shiny suit and tie to my holey jeans and sweatshirt , I think our daily lives couldnt be any more different . <p> Or are they ? <p> We both manage things him , bankers ; me , children and a home . We both have to have a good plan for the day or we wont accomplish much him , meetings with clients and conference calls ; me , dinner menus and lesson plans . <p> The more I thought about it , the more I realized our days really did have more commonalities than I at first noticed . My husband has brought home many stories and business scenarios and usually when I ask him for advice , his response is something he s learned along the way of years in the business world . <p> When we recognize that we mamas are the boss of our homeschools , we can be totally empowered to fully take the reins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what someone else is doing . We do n't  have to compare our homeschools to someone elses . We do n't  have to wait for approval from the school board . Its just us - we- are the boss . <p> Does n't  that feel good ? ! <p> But to be really successful bosses , we need to remember a few things about our little people were managing and the homeschool were running . <h> Have a Vision <p> Every good owner/boss/manager has a vision for their business . They know what they want to end result to look like and they work backwards to get there . Lay out on paper your goals , your plans , and your proposed steps for getting there . <p> Have- one-on-one meetings with your children every quarter or so- - like a quarterly review bosses do ! to see how your child is feeling , talk about what they are doing great at , and what needs tweaking . <h> Be Prepared for the Day <p> If you were going to an office job every day and your boss came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrange her papers , clear off her desk , and get her day going , it would be difficult to stay on task yourself . You would n't be sure what the standards really were if she was always unprepared . Be a good homeschool boss and be prepared for your days . <p> Hve your kids assignment books filled in <p> Set your coffee to brew as soon as you get up <p> Make sure your desk is cleared off and ready for the new day <p> Clean up messes right after school <p> Start on time if you have a start time <p> Greet your " employees " with a happy smile <h> Know That YOU are the Boss , Not Your Curriculum <p> We have a tremendous blessing in that we do not have to wait for the school board to approve new curriculum if ours- is n't working. - If you and your kids are struggling in your current curriculum , change it . Before you toss it though , make sure you do n't  dislike it because of user error . Have you tried it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the teacher manual to make sure you 're using it correctly ? <p> Whatever you decide , - do n't  let your curriculum boss you around . <h> Set the Expectations <p> Once , after we were having a particularly difficult time getting our kids to remember to do their chores , my husband asked me this , " Do the kids even know exactly what their expectations are ? " <p> Ummmm , duh . And , no . <p> Make sure your children know exactly what you expect of them . This goes for house chores , school work , extracurricular activities , manners , and more . If they do n't  know what you want from them , they probably wont be doing it . <h> Be Able to Conduct a Great Meeting <p> Every good manager knows when his team needs a huddle . As my friend calls it , " circle the wagons . " Be able to sit down with your kids and discuss things all things . <p> We use our morning meetings for this . We discuss everything from what 's on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read about , Halloween costumes , school goals for the day , who did or did n't  do their chore very well , and whatever else comes up in discussion . <p> We need to know how to have regular meetings like this , how to get conversation going , and how to know when to reel it in and get moving on with the day . <h> Know How to Delegate <p> Delegating in a house full of kids that never leave is so very important . The boss of a business does n't  do everything . <p> The boss is good at- overseeing- everything . Because shes- trained their people on what their expectations are and she has- good dialogue with them , the- boss is- able to leave a lot in the hands of her- employees . Shes trained them to be great at their jobs , and she knows that if she tries- to do everything , she will fail because its not possible to do so . <p> We need to know when its time to delegate . Our kids will be better for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are Happy <p> When your husband is unhappy in his job , it hurts the whole family . Sometimes people are unhappy in their jobs because of the actual work , but I 've found that more times than not its because their boss is n't a good leader . <p> Maybe they micromanage too much and wont let people do what they are good at doing . <p> Maybe its because they do n't  give clear instruction and then are upset when the task is n't done according to what they expected . <p> Maybe the goals are unattainable and its not even motivating to work towards because the employees know they can never make the boss happy . <p> Maybe the employees do reach the goals and the hoopla of reaching it is so short-lived because the boss is already focused on the next goal . <p> To be a good boss , your employees must be happy . - They need regular praise and encouragement . They need to know you 're rooting for them to succeed . A good boss needs to show respect in order to gain it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business , but some of the managerial skills do overlap . I have lots to work on when it comes to being a good manager , but I do know what I 'm working for every day . Brave on , boss-ladies ! <p> Have you ever worked in the business world ? What skills have you learned that can be applied to your homeschool ? 148232 @qwx1008232 <h> About Alicia Hutchinson <p> Alicia is mom to four kiddos from toddler to teenager .

Of course , there is much to be learned through such life experiences , but it can still be stressful knowing that academics are taking a back seat . <p> It 's nice when other homeschooling families can come alongside and help in practical ways . Try these ways to help a sick homeschooling family if you know of one who is experiencing sickness or a hospital stay . <p> 1 . Take them a meal . When your kids are sick , getting a meal on the table can be even trickier than usual . When you 're sick , it probably means too much take-out . And , if you 're at the hospital with a sick child or spouse , it almost always means take-out or , even worse , cafeteria food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical help ideas for a sick homeschooling family . <p> 2 . Help with carpooling . For a sick homeschool parent or one who is spending a lot of time at the hospital with a family member , getting everyone else where they need to be- can be difficult , if not impossible . An offer to help chauffer kids around can be a lifesaver . <p> 3 . Help with school lessons . It can be much easier for one homeschooling family to fold in a few more kids than it can be for a non-homeschooling relative to try to help keep the daily homeschool schedule going . Even if the other family 's kids do n't use the same materials , a family accustomed to the daily routine of homeschooling may be better equipped to make the adjustments than anyone else . You could even give everyone a break from their regular schoolwork in favor of a fun unit study to get everyone involved . <p> 4 . Invite the kids on field trips and play dates . We once had some friends who needed to spend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . We picked their other child up for a day at the local children 's museum . He had a blast and the mom was so thankful that he was able to get out and have some fun while she spent some one-on-one time with her sick child . <p> 5 . Help with childcare . Even if you ca n't help with school or a fun outing , an offer to keep the kids while a sick homeschool parent rests , makes a hospital visit , or even runs some errands will be greatly appreciated . <p> 6 . Rally your support group . Sometimes a group can rally together to do something that a single family could n't do . Enlist your homeschool group 's help to do meal rotations for a week or two , stock the freezer with meals , or purchase gas cards and gift cards to local restaurants to help during an illness . <p> 7 . Help with household chores . Okay , do n't do this if the family has the stomach flu or something equally horrible and contagious , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple loads of laundry , run the vacuum cleaner , or wash some dishes may endear you to your homeschool friend forever . <p> 8 . Offer to run errands . Help a sick homeschooling family by returning their library books , picking up stamps , or running to the grocery store . <p> 9 . Paperwork . If your state requires filing paperwork for homeschooling , it can be very helpful to offer to do as much of that as you can for a homeschooling family who 's experiencing sickness . <p> 10 . Pack a bag . If your friend or her family member 's illness requires long days at the hospital or doctor 's office , pack a travel bag for her . Fill it with snack foods , magazines , pens or pencils , quarters for the vending machine , activity books ( word searches , crosswords , or Sudoku ) , a grown-up coloring book ( I love those things ! ) , and some crayons or colored pencils . <p> Sometimes it 's the simplest gestures that have the biggest impact .

I took him out of p.s. 2 months into ninth grade last year and he still has not completed what he needs to do for that grade ! Help ! <p> In our family , what works is that I just give the kids their stuff and make them accountable for getting it done in a timely manner . I do n't  care what time they do their math , as long as they get it done . We talk about what it will take to get their schoolwork done . Math should be one page per day , they should complete one chapter in their science text every two weeks , and so forth . It works pretty well to tell them my expectations and then let them make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple years when she sometimes could n't get her work done on days she felt especially crummy . I gave her freedom to take time off if needed , but the school year did n't  end until all the work was done . On good days , she was able to do extra to get caught back up . <p> There 's a certain amount of teaching about priorities and responsibilities that has to place . How is time being spent ? Students are responsible for completing their schoolwork . If they 're not doing it , then what are they doing ? There were days that my daughter slept and read , and I was okay with that . I occasionally allowed educational movies ( history usually ) . We also had some educational games . No TV , though , or other time-wasting entertainment . <p> Another of my children is in the lengthy process of being diagnosed .

@@108016938 @3416938/ <h> Homeschool Mom 's Night Out Ideas <p> August 25 , 2015 By Kris Bales <p> If I could identify the one thing that has helped me maintain my sanity over the last 13 years of homeschooling ( and my husband and chocolate did n't count ) , it would be mom 's nights out with the ladies in my homeschool support group . I ca n't tell you how many times I did n't want to go because I knew I 'd be a downer , only to come home so refreshed and encouraged after spending time with ladies who truly understood . <p> I 've also been blessed to be able to be the encourager many times . There is just nothing like that moment when you realize that you 're not alone and you 're not the only one who has ever experienced that thing that is driving you batty . <p> It 's so important to get out and spend time with other homeschooling moms " but what do you do ? Following are some of my favorite homeschool mom 's night out ideas : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably goes without saying , right ? We used to close down some restaurants , y'all . We would typically throw out a few choices and vote to choose a favorite . Sometimes it was a casual dining place . Other times , we 'd choose a place with counter service where we could sit and chat for hours without driving the servers crazy . <p> A few tips : <p> Check to make sure the restaurant you 're considering is n't running a crowd-drawing special . A couple of times we made the mistake of trying to go to a Mexican restaurant unaware that it was $0.50 taco night . Not a good idea when you 're trying to seat a small crowd yourself . <p> Tip your servers well . When you 're taking up the majority of their station for an extended period of time , plan on tipping enough to compensate them for additional tables they would have served . <p> Most places do n't allow reservations , so try to arrange to have a couple of moms arrive a bit early to get your group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Pot-luck dinners were not our favorites because most of the time we all wanted a night off from cooking . That being said , we never regretted a quiet pot-luck dinner at someone 's home or a church fellowship hall . These gatherings allowed us to mingle more than we could at a restaurant and we could all hear one another much better . It also made it possible for the entire group to listen to one person " something extremely difficult to accomplish in a noisy restaurant . <h> Play games <p> Another benefit to meeting somewhere other than a restaurant is that we could play games . Some of our favorites were : <p> Non-musical chairs . I 've heard this game called a number of things , but it is so much fun " and slightly dangerous ! You start with everyone sitting in chairs in a circle with one person standing in the middle . The person in the middle states a fact about herself . Everyone who shares that fact has to get up and move to a new chair with the person in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Whoever is left standing becomes the next person to be in the middle . If I have n't explained it well , click here for a better explanation . We laughed until we cried every time we played this game . Tip : Be careful when you play with pregnant moms. - <p> Pictionary . We always played this Win , Lose , or Draw style on a white board with two teams . Tip : Do n't put the Sharpie markers near the dry erase markers . That 's how I learned how to remove Sharpie from a dry erase board . <p> White elephant gift exchange . At Christmas time , it 's always fun to host a white elephant gift exchange ( click the link for the rules and variations ) . Tip : This is an excellent opportunity for re-gifting items you 'll never use and chances are , someone else will love it . <p> Considering the fact that I 'm the introverted homebody sort , I 'm probably overlooking lots of good ideas . The ones I listed are tried-and-true ideas from our group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might work for your group are : <p> Make something " Go to a paint-it-yourself pottery or art class . <p> Host a curriculum swap . <p> Arrange for dance lessons and make it a couple 's night out . <p> Go bowling . <p> Host an overnight or weekend event at a bed-and-breakfast or scrapbook/quilter 's retreat <p> Meet for ice cream . <p> Whatever you do , for our group the key to success was making sure there was a chance for moms to talk , commiserate , and laugh . Anything else is just a bonus . <p> What mom 's night out events have worked well for your circle of friends ? 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <p> How often , and *how* did you manage to schedule the moms nights out ? They sound like a brilliant idea , but in 4 years homeschooling I 've managed to go out for dinner with other homeschooling parents exactly twice , both times for Christmas dinner . I love the idea of the games , too . I wonder if that could work with reserved Brits without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When our group was doing this regularly , we had a regularly scheduled moms night out the second Monday of every month at 6 PM . Since everyone knew when it was , it was easier to plan into their schedules . Hope that helps ! <p> I have a girls night out tomorrow night ! Unfortunately I 'm the only one who homeschools ( I think a few of my friends try to make me " feel better " by telling me theyll probably homeschool once their youngest kid knows how to readIm confused by this , but nod and smile ) . But I agree whole-heartedly that mommy time , especially when its with good friends , is SO NEEDED !

@@108016940 @3416940/ <h> What About Math ? <p> May 19 , 2007 By Kris Bales <p> There are , apparently , a lot of math-phobic people out there because math is another subject that is worrisome to homeschoolers and would-be homeschoolers . Math is one of the few subjects for which my family uses formal curriculum . When choosing a math program , it is wise to first attempt to determine if your child learns better with a cyclical style or a mastery style . <p> Cyclical Style Math Programs <p> Cyclical style math programs continually introduce new concepts while practicing formerly introduced , but not yet mastered concepts and reviewing concepts that have been mastered . Cyclical style programs offer a lot of daily variety and allow students to move on to concepts that may be easier or more enjoyable for them while still allowing them to practice concepts that are proving more difficult to master . An example , from Horizons Math 1 would be that on a given day , a student might be introduced to the concept of subtraction , but he would also work on telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers and adding two two-digit numbers . <p> Two examples of cyclical programs are Saxon Math and Horizons Math . My family uses Horizons . Both programs are good , solid math programs . Horizons is a bit advanced compared to Saxon . From our personal experience , Horizons is nearly a full grade level ahead of Saxon . One of Saxons strong pros , for the math-timid , is that it is completely scripted for the parent . <p> Mastery Programs <p> Mastery programs focus on one concept until it is mastered and the student is ready to move on . This type of program does not allow for much variety , but is well suited to the student who works better when she is able to focus on a single concept until she understands it . Some examples of mastery math programs are Math-U-See and Mastering Mathematics . <p> Another math program that I feel I must mention due to its immense popularity among among homeschoolers is Singapore Math . I have not used or seen Singapore , personally , but have heard excellent reviews about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all around us . Many people choose to teach math , with or without the aid of textbooks , through living books , much as they would teach history or science . I was so afraid of math , at first , that this was a foreign concept to me . However , an excellent website Living Math helped me to see that math is all around us and the teaching of math can easily be incorporated into every day life . I still like to have the safety net of a math curriculum , but I now also incorporate math across our curriculum , as much as possible . I also look at games , books and other fun ways to introduce living math as having as much importance to learning math as textbooks . <p> We do like to use games as much as possible . We made a board game for ourselves several years ago . You could use an existing game board , such as Candy Land or Life , or you could make your own game board as we did . We just drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , path-style , on a posterboard . Then , we made cards out of cardstock ( index cards could be used ) . The cards had addition problems ( and later subtraction ) with no answers . The players would take turns drawing cards and the answer would determine how many spaces forward they moved . Sometimes , we 'd play with a variation in rules players had to move back the number of spaces equal to the anwser to the subtraction problems . The first player to reach the end of the path is the winner . <p> Bingo is another great way to practice math concepts . You can put number words in the squares and use the numeral for the call card or vice versa . You can put answers to addition , subtraction , multiplication or division problems on the bingo cards and use the problems as the call cards . Most of this can be done as a memory/matching game , as well . <p> There are many card games that you can play for math . In War games , each player draws two cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer ( determine the operation to be used prior to beginning ) . The first player to get the correct answer wins all the cards in that turn . The player with the most cards at the end wins . <p> Sums of Ten is one of our favorite games for elementary students . From a standard deck of cards , you remove all the face cards ( except the ace ) and all the tens . You place face up , one each an ace , two , three , four and five . Then , each player is dealt five cards . To play the cards in your hand , they must , when laid upon a discard pile , equal ten . For example , a nine can be played on an ace because 9+1=10 . Then , an ace can be place on that nine . A players turn continues until he can play no more cards in his hand . Then , he draws two cards . The first player to play all the cards in his hand wins . <p> There are many comercially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make yourself . <p> What about teaching upper-level math ? <p> Algebra . Trigonometry . These words strike fear into the hearts of many homeschool moms . I must confess that I am not there yet with my own children and these were not strong subjects of mine when I was a student . However , there are several options for teaching these higher level math courses . The most obvious option is learning alongside your student . I cant tell you how much Ive learned in the areas of history and science with my children already and the oldest is just entering sixth grade ! I feel confident that math is another of those areas in which we can learn together . <p> Other choices are tutoring , homeschool co-ops , classes specifically for homeschoolers ( often taught by teachers or former teachers ) , dual-enrollment at local colleges or universities , and even student teachers/tutors at local colleges and universities . Homeschoolers are a creative , inventive group of people ! We do n't  have to let the fear of upper level math dissuade us from providing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support groups or homeschool newsletters for options in your area . <p> Some of the math programs that I 've heard recommended among homeschoolers for upper level math are : Saxon , Math-U-See and Lial Algebra .

Division was explained much the way our regular math text explains it and I like the way it clearly illustrated to the student that division is simply the opposite of multiplication. - There were a lot of clear , visual explanations and the material was explained in a variety of ways. - Overall , I thought the Division 1 book was a good resource for extra practice in division . <p> Multiplication 2 was another matter altogether. - I found some of the activities lacked sufficient explanation or were simply confusing. - That may be due to the fact that the problems were explained in a very different way than our regular math text or it could be that it was just simply not the right level for Megan. - At any rate , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . <p> One thing I did like about both books is that they offered links to different websites where kids can play online , interactive math games. - We found some helpful sites through those links , so I greatly appreciated the authors inclusion of those sites. - The bottom line is , while there was some helpful information in the books , I was n't blown away by them . <p> However , they are very reasonably priced and I know that many kids benefit from seeing something explained in a completely different way than they 've seen before , so if you 've got a child struggling with math concepts , or you 're looking for a reasonably priced full curriculum , you may want to visit Math Mammoth and see for yourself what you think . 148233 @qwx1008233 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> I purchased the Math Mammoth Algebra set and was very disappointed .

Mexico ? <p> No. - I kinda wish , but no. - Were taking a break because burn out . <p> I felt myself slipping into this burn out phase a few weeks ago . Everything annoyed me . I was crabby and snippy with- the kids and especially my husband because- " you do n't  get how tough this is ! " The thought of getting up and trudging through another boring day of lessons was getting harder and harder as the weeks wore on . <h> The Reason Behind It All <p> Alicia of the past would have pulled herself up by the bootstraps , pulled everyone along with me , and- made- school/home/family life work if it killed me . <p> But I know now that pushing through is n't always the answer . ( Sometimes it can be , but not for this . Not right now . ) Towards the middle of last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I was totally burned out . <p> It had been a really busy few weeks with birthdays , appointments , outings , husband working out of town , and a cold snap after a hint of spring in Minnesota sending us all back indoors to stare at the same four walls we 'd been staring at for months . <p> Burn out is a real thing . <p> As homeschool parents , we give and give and give . And when were depleted of rest , proper nutrition , and personal fulfillment like time to recuperate or enjoy something for ourselves we give some more . We pour out from the bottom of the barrel . When there 's nothing left to give out , instead of serving our family with contentment , joy , and fulfillment , were edgy , angry , and unmotivated . <p> I realized that I had n't  exercised in two weeks , I 'd been staying up till midnight most nights and getting up late , and was n't taking any time in the evenings to take a bath , read , or plan for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . <h> The Remedy : A Break <p> There 's a time to push on , and theres- a time to pull back , and everything in me told me it was time to pull back right now . <p> Every July/August when I 'm planning an outline for my school year , I create a framework for the year , marking off days I want to take off from school , and the days I want to start and finish . Looking over my calendar , I realized that there was a week marked off for spring break . We never take a spring break . Ironically , the week marked off was the one we were about to go into . <p> I balked at first , thinking that- taking a week-long break would set us back . But it really would n't .

Megan , why do you always ask me , every week , why I stop and get a sweet tea every week ? Because I just want to know.Well , what did I tell you last week ? <p> I could give her the standard , weekly answer : I love sweet tea . In particular , I love this McDonalds sweet tea and its not too likely that I 'm going to drive by this McDonalds and not buy a tea . Or , I could dress it up a bit and tell her that I 'm making a memory . <p> My mom used to stop at a little Mom &amp; Pop grocery store on the way home from church every Sunday . Shed buy a newspaper and I 'd get to pick out some candy . During a certain phase in my life , I bought a pack of Star Wars cards with a little , hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected well over a hundred of them and kept them rubber-banded together in numerical order . Now , they belong to my son and are placed neatly in the slots of a baseball card organizer . In mostly numerical order . <p> I can still remember what that grocery store looked like on the outside , where the newspapers were kept , the lighting and how it felt to squat down in front of the wire candy stand , picking out my cards . <p> My mom just thought she was picking up a paper . She did n't  realize that she was making a memory . <p> Maybe my kids memories of my weekly tea wont be as sweet to them since I do n't  buy them a drink ( Hey , 32 oz of sugar and caffeine would NOT be appreciated by the kids staff at church ! ) , but it will be a memory just the same . <p> I used to go to my dads house every other weekend . Each Saturday , my step-mother would fry an entire pound of baconfor three people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with either one of her famous plate-sized pancakes or my dads yummy omelets . <p> They thought they were just making breakfast . They did n't  realized that they , too , were making memories . <p> I know , though . So , now , I try to make memories with my kids . Sometimes they 're really simple , but memories nonetheless the little seemingly trivial rituals of life . Sometimes they 're more complex the once-in-a-while big deals that the kids will remember and treasure and tell their kids about some day . <p> Every Thursday night , we go to my sisters house for dinner . My aunt lives with my sister . Her two sons and their wives and her two grandsons come , as do my mom and step-dad . Every week , we spend a couple of hours eating dinner and making memories with family that we might otherwise only see at major holidays . <p> Every Friday night , my kids camp out in the living room , watch movies and eat popcorn . <p> Nearly every Saturday morning , I fry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chef-in-training , fries bacon or Spam and makes the scrambled eggs . <p> Those are the more simple of our rituals . <p> Sometimes Dad breaks out the tent and he and the kids camp out in the basement on the air mattress . <p> Or , he might start a campfire in the front yard while I get the ingredients for Smores together . Yes , we live in a subdivision . Yes , the neighbors probably think were a little strange . I do n't  care . They probably already think that since we homeschool. ; - ) <p> Those are some of the more complex of our memory-makers . <p> None of them seem like that big a deal in the grand scheme of things , but they 're the rituals that will tie our kids together when they 're grown and gone . <p> Do you remember how we used to camp out in the living room every Friday night , one might say to another at a Christmas dinner some day . <p> Yeah , or how about when we 'd roast Smores out in the front yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of growing up " at home " that tie my kids together once they reach adulthood .

I 'd have taken history over math any day . <p> Now , I understand his passion . History is so much more than dusty , dry textbooks . It 's the story of the people who came before us . Now , there is nothing I love studying more than the stories of people and places . That 's why I love combining history , geography , and literature and these are some of my favorite resources for doing so . <p> 1 . Truthquest . I 've got to say that I did n't care for Truthquest as a complete , stand-alone curriculum because it is very teacher-intensive when it comes to planning .

Eat Your Way Around the World and Eat Your Way Through the USA are two great geography-based cookbooks , and Our Food Recipes is a nifty little website with recipes from a variety of historical periods . <p> 9 . Journaling . Journaling obviously is n't a specific resource , but it 's a fun way to tie in writing .

That fact coupled with attention difficulties such as ADD can make it hard for teens to focus and work well independently . If you have an easily distractible teen , try these tips to help him or her focus . <p> 1 . Limit distractions . One of the best ways to help teens focus , right out of the gate , is to limit distractions . My one big no-no is watching TV while doing schoolwork . <p> It 's also wise to limit social media and texting . Have a designated spot for phones and electronic devices during school time . I 'm not as strict about that as I used to be , but for awhile we had our designated spot and my teens could take a 5-10 minute break between subjects to read and reply to texts . <p> 2 . Try workboxes . My oldest found our modified workbox system helpful all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very visual system with each subject in a separate folder , it was easy for her to see exactly what she had completed and what still needed to be done . <p> 3 . Create a study area . All teens can benefit from a dedicated study area , but it 's especially helpful for highly distractible teens . A study area does n't have to be elaborate , it just needs to be well-stocked with the items teens need for school such as paper , pens , pencils , a pencil sharpener , eraser , and books . <p> When my oldest used workboxes , I attached a zippered pencil bag designed for a 3-ring binder to her work crate with binder rings . <p> 5 . Hold them accountable . It 's wise to have a method for holding teens , particularly highly distractible ones , accountable . Meet with them daily or weekly to review their assignments , making sure that they 're being done and being done correctly . <p> At our house , I check math daily . On Thursday , I 'll check everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We use Fridays as a catch-up day , so that works well for us . <p> 6 . Establish a routine . A regular routine can help with distractibility because kids know what they need to do when so tasks do n't get overlooked as easily . Some kids find that timers also help because they can focus on a task if they know it 's only for a set time . Some distractible teens find that they like the challenge of completing an assignment before the timer goes off . <p> 7 . Noise-cancelling headphones. - A good pair of noise-cancelling headphones can be expensive " but they can also be oh so worth it . I love listening to the ambient background noise of Coffitivity , but some kids work well with music . Let your teens choose what works best for them as long as it 's effective and not more distracting than the background noises you 're trying to eliminate . <p> 8 . Take breaks . Distractible kids of all ages can benefit from frequent breaks . Ten or fifteen-minute breaks between assignments tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stagger more attention-draining assignments with more enjoyable ones . Josh will often play guitar for awhile after completing his math assignment . <p> 9 . Try a stress ball . For some kids , having a fidget object helps keep their minds busy . Brianna focuses much better on videos or lectures when she 's knitting . Some kids find pencil-tapping helpful for focus ( often much to the annoyance of the people around them ) . A stress ball can be a fantastic " and quiet " alternative . <p> 10 . Encourage healthy habits . Diet , exercise , and sleep habits can play a huge role in distractibility. - Make sure your teen is eating well and getting adequate rest and some physical activity each day . <p> These tips can help your distractible teen focus . If you suspect your teen suffers from ADD or ADHD , check with your doctor . While these issues are often over-diagnosed in our society , kids who truly deal with them can greatly benefit from medication and/or changes in their diet . 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that at your recommendation I bought The Plan in Place Planners for my kids .

@@108016962 @3416962/ <h> 5 Things Not to Worry About this School Year <p> A new school year is upon us and we homeschool mamas tend to be very good at the art of worrying . I 'm not downplaying that one bit there is a lot on our shoulders . Educating our children is a big deal and should be treated as such . <p> As our children get older and their academia becomes more intense , the worry pool may grow larger , even though our experience has grown as well . I get it , homeschooling can be a trigger for many of us to worry . <p> But here are a few things you can let go of todayI give you permission : <h> 1 . My child is n't reading well . <p> If there 's one thing I 've learned on this homeschooling journey , it 's that reading is super individual . I 've taught three kids to read and all three of them were different ages and different grades . Do n't try to exhaust the subject of reading to death . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great phonics curriculum ( we love Hooked on Phonics ) , reading to your child a lot , and starting small . Just because a book says that it 's 2nd grade level , does n't mean your child will automatically know know to read it . Give them books they can figure out without getting frustrated . ( We love Bob Books . ) Work on it a little each day and they will get it . Lay it down . <p> Save your worry-brain-cells for something else . Now , if your child is a 6th grader and still not reading , you should probably explore some other avenues of help , but even then , your child will learn . They will feed off your anxiety , so just chill . They will too . <h> 2 . We 're not involved in a co-op . <p> Do n't get me wrong , I love being a part of a homeschool co-op . There are many benefits , such as your kids finding other homeschooled friends and you being around other homeschool mamas . But sometimes life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I found that we were going to enrichment classes all day Tuesday , doing gymnastics Thursday afternoons , Boy Scouts on Tuesday nights , church on Wednesday nights , and usually a couple other random field trips or outings with our group throughout the month . That did n't leave a whole lot of time home to do well , school . <p> In order to homeschool , you have to be home at least for a little bit of it . Some seasons call for a more mellow schedule " like a schedule with nothing at all . We took a year off of our co-op and it was just a nice break . Do n't worry if you just moved and you 're not involved yet . Do n't worry if you just had a baby and you do n't want extra pressure to run around . Just do n't worry about the co-op thing . Your kids will be okay . <p> Maybe you 're not involved because you do n't have a co-op in your community . If it 's something you feel is missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's just one other family . Keep it regular , but not rigid . Meet a couple times a month . <p> If you 're new to and area and there 's not a co-op available to you , just be patient . I 've been the newbie to the community and it can feel like you 're the one that does n't know any of the in 's and out 's . It will come . It 's okay to lay low this school year . Explore your new community , love on your kids , enjoy the freer schedule . Do n't worry about the co-op today . <h> 3 . Our routine is n't working . <p> Here 's the thing about routinesthey change with the season we 're in . Sometimes I find I 'm forcing a routine that only worked when I had tiny kids . If your routine is n't working , there 's no use worrying about change it . <p> Or maybe you just need to tweak it . Observe where you continuously get off track is it right away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your evening routine to make the morning go smoother ? Are you starting later with school than you 'd like to ? Check out your expectations . Are they way more audacious than your family can handle ? Is the toddler disrupting every single school day ? Maybe naptime would be a better time to do school . <h> 4 . Our insert subject here curriculum is n't working . <p> This is one huge reason I 'm thankful for homeschooling as opposed to regular schooling : we can choose the curriculum ! This is such a huge blessing and here 's why : not every kid was cut out for Saxon , Abeka , or Spelling Power . Choices can be a headache when trying to order your list of curriculum at the beginning of the year , but it can also be a major plus ! If you 're curriculum is n't working , do n't worry about it change it ! <p> I would suggest that you use it for a good , solid month or two to make sure it 's not just user error or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten overwhelmed with new curriculum because I was n't familiar , but it ended up being great . On the other hand though , sometimes a certain curriculum just is n't made for our kid . Regular schools are stuck . They do not have the luxury of reordering mid-year , but we do ! <p> Evaluate why the current curriculum is n't working and search for something to fill that hole . <p> Check into selling your old stuff online . It makes the switch a lot less painful if you just spent a lot of money on something that you now do n't want to use . <p> There 's a whole sea of curriculum- out there . Do n't worry about it just change it . <h> 5 . We do n't have a designated school room . <p> We have done school in an extra bedroom , a corner of our family room , the dining room , and a room in our basement . All have worked . My kids learned in each place .

A garage space , a corner of a large living room , or a den could all work for a school room . Think about doubling spaces up like a guest room/school room or a laundry room/school room . <p> We do n't live in a large home , so I understand the struggle . Often I 've found that when my house feels too cluttered , we have too much stuff .

I 'm using the same math book with #2 that #1 absolutely lovedbut they are such different learners that I 'm worried it is n't going to work out for himand its only our first day ! But I 'm going to make sure we have more manipulatives on hand when we whip out the old math book and I 'm hoping that hell be more engaged . <p> Many of your great points are applicable to public schoolers , too .

They 're not locked into " sit at a desk for X-hours and do prescribed assignments " for 13 years straight . <p> Thanks for the tips Alicia !

@@108016963 @3416963/ <h> In All Things Give Thanks <p> Its easy to complain and look for the negative . Sometimes , we get so accustomed to complaining that it simply becomes a habit .

Thessalonians 5:16-18 <p> Wow . That 's a tall order . <p> The truth is , however , when you think about it , there is probably something to be thankful for in all circumstances . My parents were divorced and both remarried when I was just a toddler . Divorce is not Gods perfect plan and I would have enjoyed growing up in an intact home . However , if my parents had n't  divorced , I would never have known my second dad . My step-dad was a good man and I know he loved me . And , I loved him . <p> He died of cancer in 2001 . This was not the answer to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he passed away . That was a huge prayer answered . He touched many lives in the short time he was a Christian . I 'm thankful for that , too . I am thankful that he is in heaven , whole and healthy . <p> I remember hearing a story in church when I was a young teenager . It was about some Christian women who were thrown into prison , persecuted for their faith . I do n't  remember the time period or the details . I just remember that , according to the story , there were fleas that tormented these women . They could find nothing to be about being in a dank , dark , prison cell , covered in fleas to be thankful for , but they gave thanks anyway . <p> It turns out that the guards hated the fleas , so they only came to where the women were when they just had to , leaving the women free to talk openly about their faith , to pray and , generally , to be safe in an otherwise unsafe situation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can rest in the knowledge that He loves us and has a plan for our lives .

It always seems to inadequate to simply say that you miss thembut you do . <p> My stepdad really loved Christmas . He s always on my mind a lot this time of year . <p> I used to struggle with that . It seemed like I was supposed to say , " Gee , thanks , God ! " even when things were horrible . And it felt like I was being sarcastic .

I challenged myself to find NEW things , even the smaller , hardly seen things . <p> This post was a reminder that I should try and do that again . <p> God is so very good , and He blesses us sometimes with enormous , knee-shaking miracles and sometimes , He just gives us comfort and peace during affliction . <p> What a great reminder ! !

@@108016964 @3416964/ <h> What About History <p> May 31 , 2007 By Kris Bales <p> I prefer teaching history in a classical/Charlotte Mason style chronologically and with lots of living books . We had tried many different ways of studying history , but it always felt like we were just brushing the surface in much the same way I 'd complained about the public schools doing . It was n't until we read Johnny Tremain during our study of the American Revolution that the link between living books and history really clicked for me . Living books make history come alive ! Historical fiction , biographies , picture books these are all fantastic tools for teaching and learning history . Ive been amazed at how much Ive learned since we began studying history this way . <p> One of my favorite resources for grades K-5 or 6 is Story of the World . SOTW is a history text written like a story book that follows history chronologically through four volumes The Ancients , The Middle Ages , Early Modern Times and The Modern Age . Each volume has an accompanying activity guide filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplemental reading suggestions . <p> Another fantastic resource are the TruthQuest History Guides . TruthQuest guides offer literature-based history study from a Christian worldview . However , if you prefer a secular history program , the TruthQuest book lists could effectively be used , leaving out the authors commentary . The guides vary in the age-range toward which they are geared , though most contain some literature suggestions for either older or younger siblings to join in on the study . There are guides for each period in history , corresponding well with the SOTW books , making it easy to combine the two books to teach a wide age range in your own home . My family will be studying Ancient Egypt and Greece with TruthQuest and SOTW this year , my younger two primarily using SOTW and my middle schooler primarily using TruthQuest . <p> In our home , we try to read one historical fiction book and one biography with each history " unit . " I basically decide what constitutes a unit . With Truthquest , for example , it was each main topic . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of our units . During this unit we read Across Five Aprils , which I highly recommend and a Sower Series biography on Abraham Lincoln .

With over 1,260 figures , its really hard to find something that youd like to study for which there is no corresponding figure . This wonderful site also offers one of the best timeline helps guide that Ive ever seen . Whether you prefer wall , notebook or file box timelines , this site has some ideas for you ! The figures are also nice for notebooking or enhancing a written narration page . <p> I 'm often asked about teaching geography . One of the best ways to do that is by using maps when studying history . My favorite resource for historical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every period in history , many featured in the SOTW activity guides .

You can read my previous reviews : my first overview and my spotlights on English , geometry , and biology . <p> Despite some of the annoyances of Switched-on-Schoolhouse " and I 'm sure every curriculum has them " we 'll be using it again next year . After more than a year using it ( thanks to a restart following a computer crash ) , Brianna still says that she likes it best of all the other high-school-level curriculum we 've tried . <p> I think she likes that it 's straightforward and no frills . She knows what she 's got to do and she can just do it . <h> Subject Spotlight : World History <p> As an adult , I love history . I did n't enjoy learning it as a kid , though . It was all boring dates and dry textbooks . I prefer teaching my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been surprised at how much Brianna enjoys SOS world history . It 's basically textbook on the computer without the literature that I prefer . <p> Enjoy it , she does , however . When I asked her why , she said that it 's presented in an interesting way . She also stated that she really likes that it meshes world history with Biblical history when applicable . Brianna said she gets a good sense of what was going on in the world as a whole at the same time that familiar Biblical events took place . <p> I understand why she likes that . I have this tendency to think of the events I read about in the Bible as happening in some sort of bubble , so I really love when they are put in the setting of other world events . This makes the Bible and history make so much more sense to me since world events shaped the lives of Biblical figures . <p> Since Brianna is using the SOS curriculum independently , I 'm not intimately familiar with the scope and sequence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen on the work that I 've had to manually grade , I think it 's covering what I would expect a high school level history program to cover . <p> I know that one thing she 's learned about has been the fall of Rome . We 've had some very interesting discussions " many of them initiated by Brianna " about how our current society mimics much of what was going on in Rome before it fell. - To see Brianna learning about history in such a way that she can see and understand those parallels is very rewarding . <p> I think one of the most compelling reasons to study history is to avoid making the mistakes of those who came before us . So , to see a student make those connections tells me that their study of history is doing one of the most important things it should be doing . 148233 @qwx1008233 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

@@108016973 @3416973/ <h> Get a Head Start on Planning for Next Year <p> June 11 , 2012 By Kris Bales <p> I confess , I 'm not quite ready to start planning for our next school year " of course , since we 're trying year round schooling this year and starting the second week of July , I 'm going to have to think about it soon . <p> I know some of you school year round and have already started , but others probably are n't starting until August or September . If you 've got a couple of months before you start your next school year , it 's not too early to get a head start on planning . <p> You do n't have to do any heavy-duty planning yet , but there are four simple steps that you can take right now to lay the right foundation for a great school year next year . <p> 1 . Assess . Think back over the last year and answer a few key questions : <p> What worked really well ? <p> What could have gone better ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a complete overhaul ? <p> What fell by the wayside ? Of those , which ones need more focused attention this year ? Which ones do n't need to be picked back up ? Which ones are fun extras that you want to include to some extent ? <p> Answering these questions will help you bring your academic and curriculum needs into sharper focus , so you can begin to decide what your school day is going to look like in the upcoming year . It will also help you figure out which curriculum needs to be tweaked or replaced and which will find its way back into the lineup . <p> 2 . Reflect . Our state , Georgia , requires that parents write an annual progress report for each child . These reports do n't have to be turned in to anyone , but must be kept on file for three years . ( Yeah , it does n't make sense to me either . ) <p> One of the things that I really like about writing these progress reports is that it helps me to reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day-to-day , you do n't notice the steady progress " particularly in your child 's area of struggle . <p> However , when you look back to where your child was at the beginning of the year and see where he is now , you can often see more progress than you initially realized . Writing a progress report , even if you 're not required to , can be one way to assess your homeschooled child 's progress . <p> 3 . Ask . Get your kids ' input . Ask them what they liked best and what they liked least . Find out what they remember most from the school year and what made it so memorable . <p> Maybe it was the hands-on projects that stuck out in their minds . That might mean that you have a kinesthetic learner who would enjoy more hands-on activities . Perhaps it was a writing assignment that your wordsmith dove into , letting you know that you need to plan for more creative cross-curricular writing opportunities . <p> Maybe it was a particular book , indicating that you might want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature in your school day . <p> Find out what pieces of curriculum your kids did and did n't like . While kids do sometimes have to do things that they may not like , getting your child 's input may help you to pinpoint the curriculum that is the best fit for him or her . <p> If your child is old enough , you may allow him to pick out ( or help you choose ) his curriculum . Having this level of input can give your child a sense of ownership that will encourage him to put forth his best effort in the coming school year . <p> 4 . Plan . I like to have a basic skeleton for each school year . It 's helpful for me to plan out our school year calendar , so that I can make sure we 're staying on track to complete our state-required 180 days within our preferred timeframe ( read : We have to be finished with the school year before my older daughter 's birthday in May . ) <p> I do n't plug in exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does help to know which days are going to be school days and which are going to be holidays . It 's also helpful to be able to plan for known events , such as homeschool group activities , outside classes , extracurricular activities , vacations , and as many appointments as I know about at the time I sit down to plan ( like those dental appointments you know about six months in advance ) . <p> Knowing which days we 'll be able to have a focused , at-home day helps me to know when to plan for lighter days versus heavier days . <p> These four steps " assess , reflect , ask , and plan " do n't require deep thought or in-depth planning , but they can really help sharpen your focus for the upcoming school year and make it easier when the time does come for more detailed planning . <p> If you do this type of pre-planning , what tips have you found helpful ? How much planning do you do prior to the start of the school year ? 148232 @qwx1008232 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Paths of Settlement this year ?

@@108016974 @3416974/ <h> WUHS Top Picks : First and Second Grade <p> April 21 , 2010 By Kris Bales <p> This week I offer you the Weird , Unsocialized Homeschoolers Top Picks for 1st and 2nd grade. - In case you missed it , last week I offered my top picks for Kindergarten. - You may notice a few favorites popping up again , but I 've added several that werent on my Kindergarten list . <p> Math. - Maybe I should stop right here and just say that Horizons is my top pick for math for K-6. - Youll see me making an additional side note beginning in 3rd and 4th , but we 've used all K-6 levels of Horizons math. - Its a solid , slightly advanced program. - My only gripe with Horizons is that my kids are constantly " behind " because each book has 160 lessons , plus tests every 10 lessons. - So , if you 're not doing math every single day , you 're going to be behind . <p> However , as I mentioned last week , Horizons is advanced , so even if your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8th grade , he s still going to be in good shape for going into Pre-Algebra or Algebra . <p> Grammar. - I love , love , love First Language Lessons for 1st/2nd grade grammar ! - The gentle approach , the memorization , and the short , mom-guided lessons make it a perfect introduction to grammar at this age. - To make it even better , Jolanthe , at Homeschool Creations , has created free , beautifully illustrated printables of the poems your kids will memorize in First Language Lessons , Volume 1. - I wish I 'd had these when we went through FLL . <p> I am also a huge fan of all theEasy Grammar and Daily Grams products. - It did n't  take us the full two years to complete First Language Lessons , Volume 1 and I found Easy Grammar 2 to be the perfect follow-up to First Language Lessons. - Its a daily guided review , so its intended for the parent to do with the child. - We did our Easy Grammar lessons on the dry erase board each day. - I feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids had learned in FLL and in introducing new topics in an easy-to-understand way . <p> Reading. - My picks for reading for 1st and 2nd grade are the same as K Scaredy Cat Reading System ( Level 2 ) and Rocket Phonics. - I am also a fan of the Explode the Code books. - I love these books because , for the most part , my kids can do them independently. - Explode the Code is great for reinforcing phonics-based reading instruction and I have often been amazed at how well the books mesh with and reinforce my pick for spelling . <p> Spelling. - Hands-down , All About Spelling is my pick for 1st/2nd grade and up ! - We received it to review this year and I cant tell you how much I wish I 'd had this program years ago. - They have just released Level 6. - Additionally , theyve just released two new books in their line of readers that correlate with the spelling program : - What Am I ? and Queen Bee . <p> All About Spelling is a multi-sensory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who may not know , the Orton-Gillingham principals are highly regarded for helping dyslexic kids learn to read and spell. - Having one dyslexic child and another one who probably is , I was ecstatic to find All About Spelling and I 've been impressed with how well it works . <p> History. - We love Story of the World. - I love that it reads like a story book and makes history interesting and easy for kids to understand. - I 've often had people ask me if the Activity Guide is necessary. - In my opinion , yes. - The activity guide offers hands-on activities , comprehension and narration question , supplemental reading suggestions ( both fiction and non-fiction ) , maps , and more. - It takes the planning out of teaching history . <p> Science. - For first and second grade , I 'm still a big fan of fun , interest-led science. - We love using The Magic School Bus books as a jumping off point. - Some of The Magic Tree House books are suitable for science too ( or make a fun supplement to history ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Even my kids will admit they enjoyed the A Reason for Handwriting series. - In this series , kids practice a Bible verse all week. - For the first three days , they 're practicing key words from the verse. - On Day 4 , they practice the verse in its entirety. - Finally , they write the verse in their best handwriting on lined paper that has a picture to color. - They can then give the completed verse and picture to a friend or relative. - Grandparents love getting these , but it also makes a great way to share Jesus with those in our circle of influence . <p> What are some of your favorite choices for first and second grade ? <p> This post contains affiliate links and I will receive a commission on any sales purchased using said links . Please see my disclosure policy for details . 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> I totally agree with several of your picks . I love All About Spelling , The Story of the World , Easy Grammar , and a few others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a loose leaf format and uses real books . We did n't do the pages in order , but skipped around and let it be interest led . I tried Horizons Math and did n't like it due to the teacher 's manual not being as descriptive as I would like . I HATE math and wanted more instruction . We have been using Saxon Math for 3 years and love it . <p> I 've never heard of Living Learning Books . I 'll have to check that out . <p> Funny thing , we used Saxon for the first year or so that we homeschooled . To me , it 's very similar to Horizons , except with a much more scripted teacher 's manual , which I liked . It just had a few quirky things that got on my nerves , which is why we switched . It would be my second choice for math , though , if we were n't using Horizons well , maybe third choice , but more on that next week . ; - ) <p> I love FFl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ( 2nd grade ) . I 'm a big fan of Math U See so far . <p> The hand writing you shared looks interesting , I might be switching to that . We 've been using a copybook , but each verse is only copied once in the book . I 've been having her copy the same verse all week on separate paper , then do a dictation on Fridays . <p> I loved that list . This year I 've had a 1st &amp; 2nd grader . We 've used Apologia Astronomy for science this year . My kids have totally loved it . I have FLL . I think I need to look into SOTW . I see great reviews for it all over . <p> We 're just starting homeschool this year , but we 've decided to use Math-U-See because it is so visual . Also , Apologia for science . I 'm excited for both of those ! The other classes we will be doing through k12 's program . We 'll see how it goesgreat post ! <p> Hi Kris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grammar together with First Language Lessons ? I plan on using this for 2nd grade and wondering if the Easy Grammar is extra or a necessary addition. - <p> Easy Grammar does n't start until 2nd grade . Back when we used FLL , volumes one and two were in one book . We covered that book in one year and then moved on to Easy Grammar for 2nd grade because I preferred it over the rest of the FLL series . <p> Just stopped in bc I have a K , 1st and 2nd grade kiddos ( and three others who are younger ) I love several of your picks hands down Real Science for Kids Pre-level books are amazing . We started with chemistry and my kids beg for it ! I had been planning on Apologia , but right now were adoring this ! <p> Thank you for such a great list ! I just started homeschool my 7 yrs old ( first grade in Japan ) and I am still stragling with curriculum . I guess I can forcus only L. A. , math and Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science . Since he has to learn two language from the beginning no matter what , I am super ultra slower pace and I tell myself that is fine . Homeschooling gives us choices and switching books , so until we find good ones for him , I keep looking . But your list is so great and helpful a lot . Thank you . I thought L.A. has to be all in one program , but I can pick anything I want to add for his level . Thanks to reminding me again . <p> Do you have any ideas for social studies ? I have n't have one yet . Oh well ! ? <p> My oldest daughter will be finishing up public school first grade then plan is to home school . However i am a bit confused b/c she did K and will have completed first grade thru public school do i need the letter of intent or not b/c she is 6 . ? In Pa ? I am seeing hearing mixed things . Meanwhile i am currently looking quite seriously at ciriculum . What subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a bit of my favorites thus far but what is neccessary and what is supplemental / optional ? THANK YOU ! ! ! Any insight welcomed . <p> I would suggest you check http : //www.hslda.org for a synopsis of the laws governing your state . I can only speak to what I know of the law in Georgia . In addition to answering your question about compulsory attendance , the legal synopsis for PA may give you some insight on what subjects you should include , as well , since some states include that information as part of their homeschool laws . For example , in Georgia , if a child has been enrolled in public school for more than 20 days , the parent must file a Declaration of Intent , even if the child falls below the compulsory age and we must include reading , language arts , math , science , and social studies as part of our homeschool curriculum . I have no idea about the laws in PA , though . <p> I love your picks Kris ! I 'm coming to this page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are still relevant today . We do a lot of outdoor math , and the kids love it . When the weather is bad , the kids also play math LONG ... or LONG ... on the computer . Of course I do make sure they spend limited time on the computer . In spite of its drawbacks , online games are good resources for poeple who have limited access to other resources .

@@108016976 @3416976/ <h> Math Mini-Offices <p> November 11 , 2008 By Kris Bales <p> This weekend , I updated Josh and Megans math mini-offices . I think I 've mentioned these in passing before , but I 've never really posted about them . I made the first ones about two years ago and Josh and Megan have used them more than I thought they would . As a matter of fact , the main reason I decided to update them is because they 're so tatteredthat and I thought the kids would appreciate a multiplication table . <p> If you 've never used or maybe never even heard of a mini-office , its simple two file folders stapled together , middle to middle , so that they stand up to create a little " office " area in which the child can do his or her work . It affords a little privacy , as well as resources for the subject . <p> Inside , you paste helps for that subject , be it math , writing , spellingwhatever . For example , inside Josh and Megan 's math mini-offices are : days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , multiplication table , shapes chart ( with shapes and their names ) and an ordinal number chart . <p> The mini-offices are the same premise on which I based the writing center that Brianna used for a couple of years ; we just made the writing center on a bigger scale . As I mentioned , you can do mini-offices ( or a bigger " center " ) for math , writing , spellingand probably more with just a little creativity . <p> Do you use mini-offices in your home ? If so , for what subjects and with what resources ?

In order to get young students engaged in writing , homeschool moms need to make writing useful . For many kids , writing needs to have a purpose , because they do n't  enjoy it . <p> To make it a little easier to teach your children to write a how-to paragraph , I 've created a writing pack that you can download . <p> First , have your student cut out the pictures theyll need for their writing assignment . Discuss with them the order in which they would complete that particular task . For instance , what steps would they use to make a smore ? Put the picture cards in that order . <p> Next , have them glue each of the images on the writing page . There are two styles of writing lines included in this pack to accommodate your writer .

@@108016986 @3416986/ <h> Pass the Bean Dip <p> August 25 , 2008 By Kris Bales <p> I need to start by saying that the idea that I am about to share is not my own , original idea . It is one that was shared on the iVillage homeschool message board where I was a community leader years ago . I wish I knew to whom to give credit . <p> Edited to add : After many years of searching , credit appears to be due Joanne Ketch . Thanks to those who commented and pointed me in the right direction . I really like the last paragraph of Joannes article . You should go read it . <p> I believe that it had been previously shared on another board , but it quickly became something of a rallying cry for homeschoolers beleaguered by unsupportive friends and family . To this day , most of the people on the message board would know what you were talking about if you told them they should " pass the bean dip . " <p> It is not uncommon for homeschooling parents to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choicesor for any parents to find themselves being questioned about their parenting choices , for that matter . The problem of unsupportive family and friends is not unique to homeschooling parents . <p> The problem is n't really the unsupportive family and friends , however . The point where the problem really starts tends to be the point where we , as parents , begin defending our choices and trying to convince the other party that our choices are right when we try to make them agree with us . This sends the signal that the choice in question is open to debate . If the choice is open for debate , then , feel free to go ahead and have the conversation with the opposing party . <p> However , if the choice is not open for debate , its time to pass the bean dip . <p> Why are you all homeschooling little Suzie ? What about socialization ? <p> Suzie has many friends of all ages . Could you pass the bean dip ? <p> What if you do n't  teach little Johnny everything he needs to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Youd be surprised at how many options Johnny has for college . Could you pass the bean dip ? <p> What about all the things that Mary is going to miss out on by not being in school ? <p> Mary is enjoying a very well-rounded childhood . Could you pass the bean dip ? <p> Of course , if the questions are being asked by well-meaning loved ones who really do have your childrens best interest at heart , there 's nothing wrong with explaining your choices . Often , I 've found that the support comes a couple of years into homeschooling when the grandparents begin to see that you really can teach your child at home and he really does have friends . When the support does n't  come , though , or the discussion becomes a debate , its okay to pass the bean dip with even the grandparents . <p> Its okay to say , " We love you and we know that you love little Suzie , however , we are her parents . This is not a decision that we have made lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our family . We would love your support , but our decision is not open for discussion or debate . " <p> Somehow , though , its a lot more fun to say , " Could you pass the bean dip , please ? " 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> I loved this post . This is our first year homeschooling and to say that my family was not " fully on board " would be an understatement . Its good to know I 'm not the only one that gets those doubtful statements and questions as if I 'll change my entire course of action based on whether or not my child will attend a PROM or HOMECOMING ! <p> I know this post is old but just had to share that I use this strategy in more that just our homeschooling choices ! When someone wants to make negative comments about how our marriage is not going to work , or how I discipline ( or do n't  discipline ) my kids I just change the subject and pass the bean dip ! <p> I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this phrase . She wrote quite a bit on her blog about how to set boundaries . I believe that I read her blog was compromised and is off the internets for now . Word is she plans to put it back up when she has the time to fix things . <p> Yeah , I have no idea who originally coined the phrase . I first heard it on a message board about a decade ago way back before most of us ( including me ) even knew what a blog was . Wherever it came from , it makes sound , practical advice for dealing with nay-sayers . <p> Yes , it is Joanne , also of GOYB Parenting , which also appears to be offline right now . : -/ She originally came up with the bean dip idea in relation to attachment parenting , and then applied the concept to homeschooling . I have used the proverbial bean dip for years , and has spared a lot of stress . : ) <p> Forgive me for sounding like a total ignoramus , but I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say " Pass the bean dip " no matter the context and ride on the laughs ? Or are you just advising that you change the subject quickly ? <p> Thank you so much for this , we live just outside of Detroit , MI in a nice suburb and Michigan is a right to home school state . Sadly , a few months ago there was a women from the city who had killed 2 of her children and put them in a freezer for at least 2 years . It was even more horrific then it sounds when you realize she also had 2 other children living in the home ( all with different fathers none of who cared ) , and nobody noticed till she was evicted . However while its a terrible crime , were we live people have completely taken the situation the wrong way , rather then simply saying well she was a very sick lady and the fathers horrible fathers they are trying to point the finger at the fact the lady claimed to be homeschooling her children and thus in their opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were required to be in a class room or have a member of family services come to visit home school families . While I have always faced questions , I have been able to use logic and am happy to take my younger kids to school for things like speech , this has became a major thing with people locally . " Well if we did n't  allow home schooling this would n't of happened like this " said a local politician , another stated " We need to require families who refuse to send their children to our schools to undergo psychological testing and DHS visits " this ignores the fact that the neighbors did n't  think of the fact they never saw the kids . Homeschooling was simply thrown in a dark corner and attacked . I point out my kids who are Home Schooled are very social , we go to all kinds of local events at zoos ( Toledo has an amazing program ) and museums designed for families like ours . I think I will just have to start saying to pass the bean dip from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knowing this is a good and acceptable way to handle the situation makes me feel more confident especially when speaking to neighbors and family . <p> I really , really hate those type of arguments/comments when things happen to kids who are homeschooled ( or , in this case , supposedly homeschooled ) . People completely ignore the fact that horrible things happen to kids who are in traditional school settings all the time . We recently had a case where a child was abused and subsequently killed by his parents . The abuse had been reported numerous times by the teachers and nothing was done about it . Just as often , the abuse goes unnoticed or unreported by teachers . It is unspeakably horrible when things like that happen to kids , but they are n't  prevented by having kids in public school . <p> We have a situation where a major childrens charity is using half a dozen " serious case studies " where the children were officially homeschooled , to argue that homeschooling renders the children isolated and invisible to authorities , and therefore homeschoolers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in spite of the fact that in every single one of those case studies , the families were already known to the relevant authorities social services , the educational authorities and " serious " things STILL happened to the children . Those children were not isolated or invisible at all , but they were failed by the system which was supposed to protect them . But blaming homeschooling is easier than admitting and fixing faults in the system , of course . <p> We started homeschooling this week . - I never really planned to homeschool Nasko ( or any of our children ! ) , but when we were shown his classroom options for the year , we realized that none of them were good fits for him . - Nasko has always shown the most progress cognitively at home , so we decided to play on his strengths and homeschool him . - Please pass the bean dip 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

I ca n't believe I 'm saying those words again already . I 'm at a loss as to how this week has passed so quickly . I guess because we picked the kids up from camp last Friday and have had something going on every day since . <p> On Saturday , Josh worked behind-the-scenes at a local music festival for the school where he teaches ( and used to be a student ) . He also got to perform a couple of songs . Megan commented on Sunday about what a good mood Josh had been in over the weekend . It happens every time he performs . It 's his gift and passion . <p> I 've heard this rumor that he spoke to the youth at church on Sunday morning , too , as part of a follow-up to camp . This is my kid who used to be so super shy . <p> For Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Six Flags with my brother-in-law . They had fun , but I know at least one of them is not as young as he used to be . ahem They were home about 2 hours earlier than I expected them . It stinks to get old . <p> On Monday Megan had a doctor 's appointment , and Josh had one on Tuesday . Following Megan 's on Monday , the whole family had lunch out together . It was Brian 's last day of vacation and our make-up Father 's Day outing . <p> Before Megan 's appointment , Brian and I made an early morning run to Lowe 's to shop for a- new washer since the pump went out on ours over the weekend . We debated fixing it because Brian could have , but it would have been the 2nd pump replacement and the washer was having some other issues , so we decided to just get a new one . <p> It was delivered on Wednesday and on Thursday afternoon , I found myself pondering the fact that a washing machine may be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hurry to try out . I 'm sure I 'll get around to washing the inaugural load later today or tomorrow . <p> There was a youth event at the church on Wednesday night , but Megan got a ride with a friend since our washer was being delivered , so I managed to not have anywhere I had to go one day this week . I 'm happy that Josh can drive . He spent the day at the lake with some friends , but he drove himself to their house . He had a blast driving a jet ski for the first time . <p> Wednesday afternoon I got a box o ' books for my personal summer reading : the most recent 3 Julie Garwood books that I have n't read ( actually , I think I may have read one of them , but I never did buy it and I ca n't remember for sure if I read it , so I might as well read it again ) , Wonder ( which came highly recommended " I started it last night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miss Peregrine 's Home for Peculiar Children . The last two I thought Megan might enjoy , too . <p> Thursday morning , Megan had a meeting at the church for the high school mission trip- ( I cant believe my baby is starting high school ! ) that she just decided to go on Wednesday night . Actually , she started asking about it on Monday , but we finally had enough details to give her the go-ahead Wednesday night . <p> I love that our church has wi-fi and comfy couches because it was a long meeting , but I was able to take my laptop and get some work done since parents were n't expected to be at the meeting " you know , we just provide taxi service . grin <p> Today is grocery-shopping and maybe some laundry .

@@108016991 @3416991/ <h> 13 Hands-On Activities to Enhance Any Study <p> March 28 , 2016 By Kris Bales <p> Learning and retention are almost always enhanced with- hands-on activities that engage the body and mind . I prefer using open-ended , versatile , and easily-adaptable . Try some or all of these 13 hands-on activities to enhance any study . <p> 1 . Build a map . Creating a 3-D map is an excellent tool for better understanding and visualizing history and geography . Doing so helps you understanding things like why Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt look like they 're in the wrong spots on a flat map . Over the years , we 've done everything from salt dough maps to paper m+ch+- maps to cookie maps . <p> 2 . Make costumes . Kids love costumes , simple or elaborate . I 'm not a seamstress , so our costumes always tended to be super-simply DIY affairs or store-bought . If you sew , use costume-creation to cover basic math skills as you measure , figure out how much material you 'll need , and cut . Plus do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 3 . Do a puppet show or play . From writing the script to building the set , kids can practice many different skills as they prepare a play . Then , they can reinforce what theyve learned about scientists , inventors , historical figures and more as they act out scenes from the lives of the people they 're studying . <p> 4 . Create presentation . Your kids can review and showcase what they 're learning with an oral presentation or try their hand at Power Point , a slide show , or photo journaling . <p> 5 . Make a paper m+ch+ model . These are great for science and history studies . You can build a model of the earth or even the whole solar system . Way back when , we used paper m+ch+ to make a model of Leaning Tower of Pisa when we studied Italy . I remember my cousin making a model of the Liberty Bell when he was a kid . There are so many creative possibilities ! <p> 6 . Have a themed dinner . A themed dinner is easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some creativity , it could apply to science , math and more . <p> 7 . Do a " paper bag " book report . These are so much fun ! You simply place into a paper bag items that are representative of some aspect of the book ( or a persons life , a time in history , or an invention ) . Then , you pull out the items , one by one , using them to present the report orally . <p> 8 . Make a lapbook or notebook . Lapbooks are a very popular method of showcasing concepts kids are learning . If , like mine , your kids are n't fans of lapooking , try a story notebook or notebooking instead . <p> 9 . Build a diorama or other model . Dioramas are really fun for doing studies of different biomes , but can be adapted for many different purposes . In addition to dioramas , we 've done models of all kinds of things such as : Earth 's layers , Roman roads , and cells . <p> 10 . Create a collage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be elaborate . Just choose something that represents some aspect of your topic . For example , a collage of various types of animals if you 're studying mammals , or a painting of sea creatures if you 're studying marine biology . <p> 11 . Build a time machine . Visit an appliance store and see if theyll give you a large box . Then , go home and get creative building your time machine . Once its complete , you and the kids can climb in and travel back in time as you read about people , places and events in history . Of course , building a castle is a lot of fun , too ! Our library made a really elaborate castle one year with multiple boxes . <p> 12 . Play games . I love to play games for review . Bingo , matching , memory , or fishing are easily adaptable for almost any topic . For fishing , we made rods by tying a magnet to a dowel rod with a piece of twine . Then , we put paper clips on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards to make the fish " and do n't stress ; they do n't  have to be fish-shaped if you 're not the crafty type . You can also use your imagination , a pack of index cards , and the board from most board games to create Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234 
@@108016994 @3416994/ <p> I do n't  know about you , but its planning season for me ! I 'm hauling up books , ordering curriculum , and printing maps like there 's no tomorrow . However , I 've noticed that all the planning in the world does n't  bring about an awesome homeschool year unless you think about these 5 things as you plan your homeschool. <h> 1 . How much time do I have available to homeschool ? <p> Sure , everyone talks about how there are 24 hours in a day , 1440 minutes , or 86,400 seconds , but how much time do we actually have available ? <p> After all , spelling takes time . Math takes time . Science takes time . So does chasing the toddlers out of the bathroom , changing a babys diaper , and comforting a heartbroken teenager . Parenting takes time as well . <p> Take a good hard look at how much time you actually have before you adding in program after program confident that this yearyoull complete it all ! Youll be surprised at how little time you truly have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always add in- more later ! <h> 2 . What commitments does my family have ? <p> Are you enjoying a weekly co-op , volunteer work at the food bank , or teaching Sunday School at church ? <p> Each of these commitments eats up some of the precious time and energy your family has even if they provide excellent learning experiences . <p> Youll be exhausted if you spend every day running back and forth all over town . For instance , you might drop the kids off at football before driving across town to volunteer at the food bank . Then dash back across town to pick up the kids before rushing home . Then its off to the library before a quick stop by the store . <p> Are you tired ? I am ! <p> Its one thing to dart around town once a week , but daily ? When will you have time to homeschool ? Remember , homeschooling takes time , and each commitment takes time . <p> As you plan the year , be careful that you 're not over-committing yourself . <h> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ? <p> Some kids dearly want to study animals , astronomy , or chemistry . Other kids want to go the zoo every year . <p> Before you begin your homeschool planning , ask your children what theyd like to see over the school year . Sometimes you get goofy answers such as Just read ! or Play Minecraft from dawn to dusk ! <p> Other times you get serious answers like I did this year . My high school teens both really want to study chemistry . My little 1st and 2nd graders are interested in animals and the human body . Guess what everyone is doing for science this year ! <p> My kids are getting their dream science programs . What do your children want ? <h> 4 . How much free time will my kids have ? <p> Free time is important for kids of all ages , even our high school teenagers . Free time is when kids dream , start projects , and learn what truly excites them . <p> Some kids use free time for activities such as programming a game which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game teaches them they adore programming . Even when they 're standing in the kitchen pulling out their hair because the code refuses to work . <p> Other teens use the time to write , and write , and write . Before you know it , theyve written a book , or two , or three . <p> So keep in mind the amount of free time you 're allowing your kids to have while you 're planning your homeschool . Will your kids have enough time to follow their passions ? <h> 5 . What are my homeschooling dreams ? <p> We all begin homeschooling with a dream . The dream varies from mom to mom and family to family . <p> Some of us dream of involved projects and a huge garden in the backyard . Others dream of long hours reading classic childrens literature aloud to our kids . Sometimes we dream of rambling walks in the woods , introducing children to the trees and flowers of our area . <p> But after a year or two in the trenches , our dreams sometimes get muddied , trampled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place . <p> Take some time this summer to head outside , lie on the grass , and remember why you homeschool in the first place . <p> The biggest problem homeschoolers have is a frantic desire to do it right and to make sure our kids do n't  fail . In our fear , we add too many commitments , too many programs , and too many chores . Everyone is burnt out by October . <p> Make this school year different . <p> Watch your time and commitments so you can indulge your childrens desire , enjoy free time , and live your homeschool dream . <h> 1 . Nature Hikes <p> Nature walks are- the perfect summer activities for families . The weather is warm and pleasant to be outside . Both teens and preschoolers enjoy the outing . You get to see and hear local wildlife . <p> Kids become- familiar with local trees , wildflowers , and birds . You do n't  even need to do a different hike each week . Taking the same hike several times in a season allows kids to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end of the summer months . <h> 2 . Gardening <p> Gardening is an excellent activity to do with kids . Plant vegetables for the table , flowers to spruce up the house , and melons for dessert. - You can start your plants from seed or pick up starters at the local gardening stores . <p> If you do n't  want to dig up the lawn , try container gardening . Tomatoes , lettuce , and basil do well in containers , and you can- enjoy a homemade spaghetti sauce and salad from food you grew yourself . <p> Go all out and grow several dozen plants in a large garden or keep it small and just grow one or two of your favorites. <h> 3 . Study Butterflies <p> Study butterflies this summer . Take a look at what types of butterflies live in your area . Carefully catch them with a net and examine their wings . Give your kids the quick tip that butterfly wings fold upright when they 're not flying while moth wings stay extended . Its an easy way to tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids to keep a nature journal of the different types of butterflies they find . What kinds of flowers do butterflies prefer ? Are you able to attract many to the flowers in your yard ? <p> And do n't  forget to pick up a butterfly kit while you 're studying butterflies . Kids love watching butterflies change- from a caterpillar to a butterfly . <h> 4 . Bird Watching <p> While you 're heading outside this summer on nature hikes , keep an eye out for the different kinds of birds you see . Does your area have waterfowl , hawks , eagles , or seagulls ? Also , keep an eye out for the baby birds in the early summer months . <p> There 's nothing as much fun as seeing the baby ducks following their mother on the local lake and watching them slowly age into full grown ducks . <p> Do n't  forget to keep an eye on your yard for birds . Quite a few different birds wander through my yard looking for juicy worms or crunchy seeds for breakfast . Encourage the kids to keep a journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try making bird feeders from recycled materials or making homemade bird treats to attract birds to your yard . <h> 5 . Astronomy <p> Summer is warm enough to stay outside comfortably all night . You can even sleep under the stars ! Give it a try this summer . See if you can find the Big Dipper , the Little Dipper , and Orion . If you 've been able to see the constellations in the winter , be sure to point out how the stars move as the season progresses . <p> Orion wont be in the same place twice ! <h> 6 . Berry Picking <p> Look for local farms where you can go berry picking with your kids . Often kids get the mistaken idea that berries come from a container at the store . Do n't  let it happen at your house ! <p> Head out and pick the berries off the vine this summer . And do n't  worry about picking too many . Fresh berries are delicious and tend to disappear quickly with kids around . <h> 7. - Make Jam <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and preserves . Take the kids into the kitchen with you so they can help wash , dry , and cook the berries . - Youll enjoy the taste of summer in the middle of winter ! <p> Summer is an excellent time to enjoy nature studies . The weather is warm , you can stay outside for hours , and plants are in full bloom . <p> You know how they say you do n't  get second chances . They 're wrong . Sometimes you do ! - My oldest two children have graduated and are attending college , but my youngest two are in K and 1st grade . <p> I get a second chance at getting this homeschooling gig right ! <h> 1 . Focus on diligence , not progress . <p> The first time through I kept focusing on progress . Were we at grade level , were the kids ahead , were we on schedule ? The moment we fell behind , I started to push . Maybe we can double up lessons , do a page a day . <p> Work , work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you know , it did n't  work . Focusing on progress actually slowed down our progress. - Eventually , I learned to focus on diligence . Diligence means you sit down to do the work every day . <p> Instead of insisting my daughter complete one page of Phonics Pathways like her older siblings did , I allowed her to stop after a third or even a quarter of a page when the going was tough . Sure the progress has been slow , but its been steady . <p> And I stopped calculating how quickly we can finish the book . <h> 2 . Enjoy content subjects . <p> When you have a child struggling with reading , writing , and math , you can be tempted to skip history and science until your child learns to read. - After all , the 3-Rs are the most important academic skill you can have . <p> But just as you 're laying a solid foundation in math as the kids learn to add , subtract , and multiply , you 're also laying a foundation in the other subjects . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a cell . History makes more sense when you 're aware of the story . Music is more entertaining when you 're familiar with the instruments . <p> Its not that we completely skipped the content subjects , its that I did n't  spend as much time on history , science , and geography as I did the 3-Rs . And I regretted it the moment the kids hit high school . <p> This time through , I 'm giving the content subjects equal billing . <h> 3 . Perfection does n't  exist . <p> Have you ever gone searching for the perfect curriculum ? I have ! When I first started homeschooling , I was certain it was possible to have the perfect homeschool , the perfect curriculum , and the perfect schedule . <p> Yeah , just like trying to be the perfect parent . <p> Unfortunately , the perfect homeschool does n't  exist . There is no curriculum that will solve all your problems or a schedule which will magically make the homeschool work . <p> Instead of trying to be the perfect parent with the perfect homeschool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do n't  need all the extras . <p> There 's a lot to be said for homeschooling with a pile of engaging books , a stack of paper , and quality art supplies . After all , the early homeschoolers did an excellent job educating their children with very little beyond a library card and a math textbook . <p> There were no online academies , there were no fancy curricula developed just for homeschoolers , and there were no support forums . <p> That 's not to say that being able to find that fabulous curriculum which makes science easy is n't a perk of living in todays world . I adore having the option of enrolling my kids in an online academy , and DVD lectures have raised the bar in my homeschool to a new height . <p> But the extras are n't  what 's going to make or break your homeschool. - In the end diligence and working with what you are what- make the difference . <h> 5 . Relax . It all works out in the end . <p> Over the years I have made many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than diligence , and we lost ground. - I searched for the perfect curriculum rather than focusing on using what we had a solid curriculum which got the job done . <p> The kids loathed that better math program the other homeschoolers were raving about. - We homeschooled around work hours , homeschooled on bed rest , and homeschooled during construction projects. - There were days I wept because we were homeschool failures . <p> But now , the oldest kids are thriving in college. - I was n't a homeschool failure . <p> With my second chance , I 'm not worrying about how quickly we can progress through the material . I 'm not on a quest for the perfect curriculum , method , or schedule which will solve all my problems me . And I 'm not looking for extras to do the work for me . <p> Instead , I 'm focused on enjoying my homeschool , watching my little children eyes light up as they learn how Egyptians made mummies , and concentrating on diligence . <p> After all , it turns out just fine in the end . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you 'd do things if given a second chance ? <p> Have your kids made their SMART goals and resolutions yet ? Its a New Years tradition ! But quitting your new resolutions is also a tradition in January . So just how do you keep your kids motivated to achieve their SMART goals this year ? <h> Keep Kids Motivated to Achieve Their SMART Goals <h> Marble Jar <p> Have you ever set up a marble jar for the family ? First find yourself a fancy jar or a quart canning jar to keep on the counter . Place a bowl of marbles next to the jar . Make sure you have enough marbles to fill the jar . <p> Now brainstorm a long list of activities which will bring your kids closer to their goals . It could be going on a bike ride , reading a book , studying French , or writing a page . Every time one of your children does an activity which will bring them closer to achieving their goals , drop a marble into the jar . <p> Gradually the jar will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much closer they are to achieving their SMART goals . <p> When the jar is filled , do something fun as a family . Have a pizza party , a family movie night , or go roller skating . Celebrate your accomplishments before pouring the marbles back into the bowl . <p> Its time to fill the marble jar again . <h> Hold Yourselves Accountable <p> Having an accountability partner makes people much more likely to achieve their goals , so make your kids accountable . <p> There are three ways to go about creating accountability partners within the family . <p> One is to assign kids to each other . The kids have to check up with each other about their progress towards their goals . Did they practice violin today ? Stress that the children must be polite and civil to one another . Name-calling is not allowed . <p> Another method is to make all your kids accountability partners with yourself . You choose a different personal goal for each child to track for you . The goal could be staying on top of the laundry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you hold each child accountable to you for achieving one of their SMART goals . <p> My favorite method is simply to add accountability to the family dinner conversation . Chat about what you did to achieve your goals today . Ask your kids how their progress is going . Brainstorm solutions as a family when setbacks appear . <h> Make Goals Fun <p> After the first excitement of goal setting wears off , kids are left looking at a year of tedious tasks . So instead of watching your kids wander back into their old habits , brainstorm ways to make their goals fun . <p> Perhaps your children can walk while playing Pokemon Go , find their favorite book in French and begin translating it , or stick a smiley face on the calendar each time they complete a task towards their goal . <p> Sometimes just seeing how far they can go before breaking a winning streak is enough to keep kids motivated . <h> Make Alternate Plans <p> When kids are setting their SMART goals , they forget to plan for the inevitable setbacks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week . The language DVD breaks . Outside commitments take up every spare minute . <p> The reason for the setback does n't  matter . What does matter is that your kids will hit snags along the road . Its as inevitable as laundry . <p> Before the setbacks arrive , brainstorm alternative plans with your kids . Make a list of ways to study French without a language DVD . Devise a simple method of practicing music without actually having the instrument in hand . <p> Make alternate plans for achieving goals before the problems arrive . <p> With these simple tips , you 'll be able to encourage your children to stay motivated through the year and be part of the small percentage who actually keep their New Years Resolutions . <p> My homeschool was a disaster . In my zeal to have the perfect homeschool , I 'd added too much to our school day and pushed the kids too hard in an effort to catch up . The kids were crying , and I was miserable . I 'd made mistakes while homeschooling and learned these 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 . Do n't  Rush <p> It happens every time . Your child is progressing smoothly . They 're working at the right level and enjoying their studies . Then you chat with a friend , read a homeschool forum , or receive a lecture from your mother-in-law . The next thing you know you 're panicking . Your kids are behind . You 're a failure ! <p> So you pick up the pace or decide to skip the end of the textbook . Your gentle homeschool has now turned into a war zone . The kids are crying because they do n't  understand the material anymore . You rushed ahead , and they could n't keep up . You 're crying because homeschooling has become a mess . Everyone is miserable . <p> Trying to rush kids through their education is a disaster . Children need time to absorb concepts , to master math facts , and enjoy learning.Mastery is more important than speed in education . <p> So slow down , enjoy your homeschool , and be a tortoise . Slow and steady wins the race ! <p> 2 . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone elses ? I know I have . <p> Comparing is always a mistake . <p> When you compare , you compare your weaknesses against your friends strengths . You see that your friends child is doing algebra while your child is finishing 6th-grade math . You see the amazing artwork , the astounding music , and the elaborate science projects . You do n't  see them hiding their kids- horrendous handwriting or the days spent trying to get their child to write just one sentence . <p> Everyone shares their successes , but how many of us parade our failures and struggles in front of family and friends ? <p> Nothing will shake your confidence as a homeschooler as quickly as comparing your struggles against a friends successes . <p> 3 . Be Diligent <p> Its easy to get caught up on the computer studying homeschooling . There are so many wonderful sites , forums , and blogs . There 's so much to learn ! <p> But when you 're sitting at the computer studying how to homeschool , you 're not homeschooling . You 're not sitting down with your kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions or pulling out the art supplies . <p> Its too easy to forget that diligence is an important factor of homeschooling . Simply sitting down every day for a few minutes to teach phonics , to study math , or read a great book gradually adds up . <p> Homeschooling requires we sit down and teach our children . <p> 4 . Stick with a Good Curriculum <p> Its tempting when you hit a snag in homeschooling to blame the curriculum and to just try something new . Youre promised the kids will never struggle with math or science again . Theyll suddenly adore writing . Itll bring about world peace . <p> After all the grass is greener on the other side . <p> However education does n't  work like that . Kids will learn beautifully for a time before coming to a halt . Its not that the curriculum is n't working , its simply they need time to absorb the material . Your kids need to practice the concepts , internalize them , before mastery sets in . <p> Often simply backing up and doing review work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and move ahead . <p> Jumping curriculum when the kids simply need a few weeks of review slows you down . You lose ground waiting for the new program to arrive , learning how to use it , and reviewing to catch back up to where you were . <p> Have you noticed how many awesome activities and excellent curricula there are these days ? Its too easy to keep adding more and more to your school day until you do n't  even have time to breathe . <p> Doing too much is a mistake . Kids wear out and become grumpy . You are exhausted from trying to keep all the balls in the air . The solution is simple but difficult . <p> Cut back on the number of activities so you 're not rushing here and there . Reduce the number of homeschool programs you 're using . <p> Children need time to explore , to think , to play . You need time to relax , enjoy a cup of coffee , and chat with your friends . <p> Leave time in your day to relax and enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my disaster of a homeschool turned peaceful . The children are now happy and making progress . Im relaxed . We have time to enjoy learning , play , and being a family . <p> What have you learned from the mistakes you 've made while homeschooling ? 148234 @qwx1008234

After all , it encapsulates , for many of us , both our homeschooling and child-rearing philosophies . Have you , however , ever given thought to its broader meaning ? <p> If you 're like me , youve always thought of this proverb in light of Christian parenting if you raise your child with Christian morals and values , he will carry those values into adulthood . However , I have had a broader view pointed out to me not once , but twice this week . The first time was by my pastor in church Sunday morning ; the other was by Rebecca Ingrall Powell in her book , Season of Change , which I was reading last night . <p> Both my pastor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointed out that this verse can and should also refer to a childs God-given talents , his natural giftings and bents . In that light , this verse should direct us not only to raise our children in the fear and admonition of the Lord , but also to encourage and support the natural giftings of our children . If a child is artistic , sign her up for art classes or make supplies readily available . If a child is athletic , provide opportunities to play sports and learn from talented coaches . If a child is musical , provide training and an instrument . <p> This can also refer to a childs spiritual giftings . Is your child hospitable ? Provide opportunities to open your home to friends and family . Does your child like to serve ? Let her explore volunteer opportunities within your church and community . Is your child a teacher ? Let him teach younger siblings or assist in a leadership role in church or scouting . <p> Part of our homeschool mission statement says , " Promoting family values , building the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one homeschooled kid at a time . " <p> If we are really going change the world with and through our children , we have to " train them up in the way that they should go . " We have to recognize their God-given talents and equip them to fulfill the purpose for which He has called them . We have to emphasize their strengths and encourage their weaknesses . In so doing , we gift them with a lifetime of personal and professional fulfillment , whether their profession be that of a world-class Christian athlete or a loving mom whose mission field is her offspring . And , in so doing , we also fulfill a portion of Gods purpose for us , as Christian parents by raising our children to be all that Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

I really love Mad Libs for a low-key , kid-friendly way to practice part of speech . Plus , they 're just fun and great for traveling ! <p> 2 . Word games . I am so into word games . I typically have a dozen or so Words with Friends games going and just a couple of weeks ago , I bought a word search book to entertain myself while waiting on Megan to get finished at a weekly Bible study meeting .

Let 's see how much you know about homeschoolers . Keep track of how many correct answers you get ! Well tally your score at the end and see how much you know about those weird , unsocialized homeschool types . <p> ( These are based on actual questions or statements Ive heard asked or said about homeschoolers . ) <p> 1 . Homeschoolers are weird and ugly . <p> False . Homeschoolers might be weird , but how and where a person is educated has no bearing on his or her physical appearance . I mean , really . I can hear the comments now . " My daughter was so pretty , but then we started homeschooling in 4th grade and , well , she 's just been so ugly ever since . " <p> 2 . You can never use the excuse " the dog ate my homework . " <p> False . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , been eaten here . I have to surmise that our family is not alone in this . <p> True . I have come to the conclusion that there is a parallel universe inhabited exclusively by single , mate-less socks ; Tupperware lids without their corresponding containers ; and pencils . Pencils walk away at an alarming rate around here . ( And , no , I have no material connection with Ticonderoga pencils . We just think they 're the best . I 'd be completely open to having a material connection with them , though " especially given the truth of that last point about pencils . ) <p> 5 . Homeschoolers have weird schedules . <p> True . I mean , the schedules are n't weird to us , but they are definitely different ( for most families ) than a traditional school schedule because we work at the times that work best for our individual families . Some of us homeschool year round , while others follow a more traditional schedule . Some of us are morning people , while others are night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school week is Tuesday-Saturday because it works best with the parents ' work schedule . <p> 6 . Homeschooled kids never have homework . <p> True False . It depends on how you look at it . All of a homeschooled kid 's work is done at home , so it 's all homework . Or , it 's all schoolwork , so there is never homework . I make my kids complete their unfinished work on their own time , so I guess that 's homework . So , that statement would be false at my house . <p> 7 . Homeschoolers eat lunch . <p> True . That may seem like a weird one , but I actually had someone find my blog once by searching the question , " Do homeschoolers eat lunch ? " ( Who says only homeschoolers are weird . ) Yes we eat lunch , though my teens do often sleep through breakfast . Does that make their first meal breakfast ? If so , what should we call supper ? This may be a trickier question than I thought . <p> 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homeschoolers run the gamut of academic ability just like kids in any school setting . I know some super-smart homeschooled kids and I know some who struggle . Most are pretty average in my experience . Of course , if you want to look at their graduation status as a guide , homeschoolers are a pretty smart bunch . Most of the homeschooled grads I know were valedictorian of their class " except some twins I know . They were valedictorian and salutatorian. grin <p> 9 . Homeschooled kids ca n't make it in the real world . <p> False . Unless we 're living in the Matrix , we all currently live " and are making it " in the real world . All the homeschool grads I know are doing just fine . <p> 10 . Homeschooled kids ca n't stand in line . <p> True . As much as I can tell from every homeschool field trip I 've ever been on , this one is true . Oh , well . If not being able to stand in line is the worst result of homeschooling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeschooled kids I 've meet seem to do okay with those little corral things at amusement parks , so the world should be safe from us . <p> 11 . Homeschooled kids will never be able hold down a real job because they have n't learned to get up early . <p> False . All those homeschool grads I know have mastered the high level skill of setting an alarm clock . Besides , being weird and ugly will probably prevent most homeschool grads from getting jobs in the first place . For those who may not be used to my twisted sense of humor , that was a joke . <p> 4 " 7 correct answers = You did okay . You must have some homeschooling families in your neighborhood or you 've run into them at the grocery story . Talk to them next time . They do n't bite . ( Well , the little ones might . ) <p> 0 " 3 correct answers = Hmmit sounds like maybe you met that one homeschooled kid that one time " maybe the one that lives down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows ? Maybe that one really was weird . I mean , the weird ones do exist just like the weird public school kids or your weird co-worker . Give the rest of us a chance . You might be surprised . <p> What are some weird statements you 've heard about homeschoolers ? Better yet , what did you believe to be true about homeschooling families before you became one ? 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> You are too funny ! ! I was literally yelling at the computer Yes ! Yes ! and Yes ! especially at the parallel universe inhabited by pairless socks . We now only buy black socks FOR EVERYONE and still the most frequently heard complaint in our home is Mummeeee , I cant find any socks that match ! How is that even possible ? All our socks are the same ! But sure enough , even now , none ever seem to match . Something weird and unsocialised is going on in our communal sock drawer .. <p> Last year our neighbor asked my then-12-yr. -old daughter if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he proceeded to hand her a book and tell her he was going to ask her questions about the book whenever he saw her . SoI guess another one would be " Homeschooled kids do n't  know how to read . " <p> Yeap . A friend of a friend asked my son earlier this year how they make friends , since they homeschool . My son responded : " Pleased to meet you . Will you be my friend ? " . The kid has been coming around to our house when he s visiting the estate , so I guess that answered his question We also have family and acquaintences who would do those random reading and math assessments as part of their civic duty to protect the world from those evil homeschoolers It was funny when my 13-year old daughter gave a math lesson to a 55-year old man the other day . Oh man , when will the world adapt ? <p> I am a homeschool grad and now homeschooling my girls ! : - ) Once my mom got asked " But how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get as kids ! ? " Moms answer " Oh , we manage . " Hahaha <p> I did get the " stand in line " comment once and I was completely stunned by it . Part of child-rearing is STANDING IN LINE ? ! ? REALLY ? ? You think in a family of 5 kids , my children wont learn to take turns ? I commented that theyd get plenty of practice in lines when we went to Disney World for 4 days the next week . Just wow . I had no idea that was even on the radar . <p> Ha ha , I got all the questions right . : ) I love this article , thank you . Ive been through everything homeschooling my kids through highschool . I 've had all kinds of people attack me over the years . Nothing satisfies like having your students quietly get full scholarships and get admitted to top colleges ( my oldest is in engineering school at a university ) . I do n't  like to see any kids suffer but its quite ironic that the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be excelling . Maybe they should have worried about their own kids instead of mine . <p> Keep up the good work with your kids ! All of you deserve a huge pat on the back ! The light at the end of the tunnel is that you will prevail and your kids more than likely will do well in life an appreciate all that you 've done . <p> LOVED this ! ! One of Moms friends met the youngest three when we were in Virginia . She admitted that she thought homeschool children would n't be " normal " . After spending a couple of hours with them , she realized how wrong she was . <p> I passed ! I kind of expected to , though , since I homeschool my swarm of six boys ( or is that brood ? hoard ? disaster ? ) . Before we started homeschooling , the only experience I 'd had with homeschooling was a 24 year old friend of my hubbys who just happened to be one of the coolest , most well rounded people I 'd ever met . He was hugely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , I 've never gotten any weird questions about it . I think that 's because when we started we were living in south Texas where it tends to be more common . We live in Illinois now , but its pretty widespread up here too . <p> Not going to lie , the lack of exposure to bacteria kind of killed me when I started high school at a private school . I used to get these really horrific sinus infections . Now theyve kind of calmed down now , but I still catch a lot of the more nasty bugs from my students , even after four years . <p> I think the most annoying question was " Isnt it weird having your mom teach you ? " Well , I do n't  know , I 've been homeschooled since I was five , I do n't  know any different . Is is weird having a different teacher every year ? <p> The best memory I have is my aunt ( a public school teacher ) gave me a series of books for Christmas with the compliment " these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how good a reader you are , so I think you manage easily " They turned out to be one of my favorite series and I still treasure them ! <p> I was homeschooled and knew a kid who really believed I did n't  have to do any real work or learning because the computer just told me all the answers . Yup . Also , this parallel universe you speak of its a real thing , and its also inhabited by my toddlers pacifiers !

@@108017005 @3417005/ <h> Moms Retreat <p> September 9 , 2008 By Kris Bales <p> Ive been thinking that it would be wise to institute what- Ive done in the past , but that I do n't  do with enough regularity : a Mom Retreat . Truthfully , what I 've done in the past probably ca n't legitimately be called a moms retreat as much as simply a planning session . <p> I try to have a planning session sometime during the summer for the following school year . Typically , I 'm able to do this on the weekend of the curriculum fair when my wonderful husband takes the kids to his parents house for the weekend . I gather a legal pad and my planner ( and , from now on , my laptop ! ) and take myself out for lunch at Panera Bread . ( I like Panera Bread because its " grown up " fast food I can place my order , take my food and be alone with no servers stopping by my table wondering when I 'm going to leavenot to mention their sweet tea or free Wi-Fi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about the direction I want our school year to take , brainstorming what worked and what did n't  the previous year . I can explore what made some things a success and others not so much . I can spend time thinking and praying about my goals for each child as well as considering what activities we might want to get involved with . I can get tentative schedules down and think about what a successful routine might look like for us for the upcoming year . I also enjoy reading homeschooling books for ideas and inspiration . <p> I guess that 's actually quite different than what I 'd envision my moms retreat to look like , though the benefits of a regular planning session are many . The place for a " retreat " might be the same and it might still involve my laptop , but it would be more " me " time time to read my email , catch up on some blogs or do my own blogging without guilt or interruption , which would mean leaving the cell phone at home or only answering calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please only call if he really has to ) . It might also simply involve a book that I 've been wanting to read there are four or five sitting on my nightstand right now . <p> I 've also heard some moms speak of taking their Bible and some inspirational reading and spending a night or two in a hotel alone with God . That sounds really nice , too , but probably more difficult to plan . <p> I know that Crystal , of Money Saving Mom fame , has posted about taking some time each Saturday morning for coffee and planning . <p> All of these ideas are simply a different approach to the same basic idea having some time , on a regular basis , to get away from the responsibilities and interruptions of home to plan , focus and rejuvenate . <p> I know that its often difficult for me to get away on my own either due to scheduling conflicts or simply just guilt about taking the time . However , I think its important that we moms take time for ourselves on a regular basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week ( I do n't  think my once a year plan is as effective as it could be ! lol ) . As Veronica Maria mentioned , in her comments on Tiffanis post , this time away for us moms is also a good chance for the dads to spend some quality time with the kids . <p> What if you 're a single mom ? I would suggest arranging child care with a relative or even arranging with another mom to alternate child care . I know that there are several relatives and friends that my kids love to stay with , so they would probably enjoy this time away as much as Mom . <p> While I love our homeschool groups monthly moms night out , I think I could equally enjoy just getting off by myself for a couple of hours once or twice a month . <p> What about you ? Do you do anything like this ? What do you enjoy doing during your time away ? 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> Wow ! Is that 5 blog posts in 1 day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night ! lol ! I think you really need to start on that fiction . I would definitely read it ! I enjoyed talking with you last night ! <p> Hi I am just reading your blog for the first time . Its great ! I too benefit from some time away and I think I am overdue for some to be honest . Sometimes , I will just go to the bookstore and wander around with a cup of tea . Other times I bring my books and either go to the library or a coffee shop and plan and think . Your post made me realize I need to take some " mom time " more often . : ) <p> I go on a yearly scrapbooking retreat at a local campground , they have a Vantines special during Feb , so several women only get together and scrap all weekend , it is great , we stay up too late , eat too much chocolate and talk ! <p> Taking time for planning should not be considered a luxury , but a necessity . Without careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not only hands-on , but also brains-on , and that requires alone time . <p> What about a retreat for the single mom who DOESN " T have any relatives to watch her kids ( and who has a special needs child on top of that ? ) How does a mom like that EVER get time away ? Having a special needs child along with two others means that I must pay for TWO sitters every time i want to go out , just in case the one child becomes overstimulated and needs to be given one on one time to calm down . Single mom , fixed income paying for two sitters is a stretch , and lately , even finding two sitters is harder still . I keep seeing ads for all these homeschool retreats and mom retreats , but every single one of them assumes that every mom will be able to find someone to watch their kids while they attend . Isnt there something out there for moms that provides childcare as a part of the registration fee ? Honestly , I have friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would not be able to babysit my kids so I could attend . <p> I wish I had a good answer for you , but , honestly , I 've never been in that position . I know that some conventions like Great Homeschool Conventions do have activities for kids that are kind of an all-day , drop-off thing for an additional fee . You might check out the Special Needs Homeschooling page on Facebook . Some of the moms there might have some ideas .

@@108017013 @3417013/ <h> Chore Charts <p> Weve been using this particular chore system for several years and it works great for us . I love that it easily grows with our family and the kids increasing responsibility and ability levels . <p> Our system consists of a chore chart and chore cards . The chore chart is simply a poster board with two library card pockets for each child : a " to-do " and a " done . " It looks like this ( yes , the colorful artwork was professionally done by me ahem ) : <p> The chore cards are 3X5 cards with a picture of the chore on the front for my non-readers and the chore written out on the back : <p> I got most of the pictures from Barrys Clip Art . ( Note : - Barrys Clip Art appears to now be a subscription site , so you may have to search elsewhere for free clip art . ) <p> After pasting the pictures on the cards and writing the chores out on the back , I laminated the cards with 3-M laminating pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contact paper " laminating . " The 3-M pages are quite a bit more expensive than contact paper , but they make the cards MUCH sturdier . And , I have to confess , its more aesthetically pleasing not one of my more frugal moments , but well worth it , in my opinion . <p> What I love best about our chore system is that its so flexible . Not every chore needs to be done every day , so there 's no chart with a big empty square for that day . I just place the cards in the slots for the chore that need to be completed that particular day . This also makes it very easy to rotate chores among the kids . 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> Oh it looks great !

@@108017015 @3417015/ <h> Scripture Memory <p> July 9 , 2008 By Kris Bales <p> About a year and a half ago , we started using the Scripture Memory Box as described at Simply Charlotte Mason . Ive been amazed at how quickly the kids and I memorize Scripture , including some rather long ones , and at how many we 've learned . <p> My biggest problem with the box is me . We often spend a bit longer than we need to on a Scripture because we 've learned it , but it takes me awhile to remember to decide on the next one to use and get it copied down . To avoid that this year , I have taken a couple of days to go through my Bible and pray about which Scriptures I 'd like us to learn . I am very pleased with the results . <p> I have tended , in the past , to focus on Scripture verses related to the negative behavior I see in the kids . One of my favorite examples is : <p> Do n't  have anything to do with foolish and stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble and defile many . Hebrews 12:14-15 <p> Now , I certainly do n't  think that there is anything wrong with using Scripture to show the kids how God views their behavior or to encourage them to be more kind to each other . However , I also want them to realize that the Bible has lots of powerful , positive things to say to us as individuals and that its not just Moms way of heaping on the guilt . So , one of the things that I want us to focus on this year is answering some questions that should be important to us as Christians , such as : <p> Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible ? <p> When should I read the Bible ? <p> To that end , our first Scripture , this for every good work . 2 Timothy 3:16-17 <p> I hope to be consistent with posting our Scripture memory verses and the reasons I chose them , as we go throughout the year . <p> What are some of your favorite verses ? Which verses do you feel are important for you to learn Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

I will never do an entire hallway ever again . I highly recommend one wall or corner ! <p> Step Two : - Measure your wall so you can easily cut the correct amount of carpenters paper .

@@108017033 @3417033/ <h> Some Thoughts From the Shack <p> February 1 , 2009 By Kris Bales <p> As I mentioned previously , I bought the book The Shack , by William Paul Young , with some of my Christmas money . A couple of friends had mentioned it and it sounded interesting , so I bought it . It was n't until later that I heard about the controversy surrounding the book . I asked a friend , whose opinion I respect , what she thought about it all . She had some good advice from her pastor about " chewing the meat and spitting out the bones . " <p> After reading the book and rereading the review linked above , I think the reviewer did an excellent job pointing out what is Biblically wrong with The Shack . There 's some good discussion in the comments to the review post , as well . I definitely would n't recommend the book to a new Christian because I would n't want this to be their basis for their view of God . However , I think it can provide some interesting food for thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good thing to give voice to your beliefs as you examine them while thinking through what this book has to say about God and the Trinity versus what the Book has to say about Them . <p> My overall opinion of the book is that it was " okay . " Not great , but okay . It required more thought than a book that I would typically read just for fun as a Christian , I could n't read it simply as a work of fiction but it was n't something I 'd read to grow my faith either ( i.e. a Bible study book ) . I certainly did n't  agree with all of the authors interpretations of God , but , as I said , some of it was pretty interesting food for thought . You may see several posts related to The Shack in the coming weeks or months because there were several chapters that I thought I might like to re-read and ponder , Bible in hand . <p> There were a couple of things , though , that stood out enough for me to go ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about forgiveness and the other was about Gods place in my life . Yeah , that one sounds pretty deep , huh ? <p> The thoughts about Gods place in my life came while reading the chapter in which , Mack , the main character , talks to the three Persons representing the Trinity , asking , " But do n't  you want us to set priorities ? You know : God first , then whatever ; followed by whatever ? " <p> Parts of a couple of the responses were particularly interesting to me : <p> Sarayu ( The Holy Spirit ) : " how much is enough ? How much time do you give me before you can go on with the rest of your day , the part that interests you so much more ? " <p> Jesus : " Mack , I do n't  want to be first among a list of values ; I want to be at the center of everythingrather than a pyramid , I want to be the center of a mobile , where everythingis connected to me but moves with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> While you may not agree with all of the authors theology , is n't that an interesting analogy ? Surely I 'm not alone in being guilty of sometimes saying , " Okay , I gave God the first part of my day , by having my prayer and Bible reading . Now , on with the rest of my day . " <p> Isnt the mobile a more beautiful picture ? Every part of my life connected to God , with Him at the center and the Holy Spirit being the wind that directs my life ? I do believe that I need to give God that first part of my day so that He can grow my relationship with Him to the point that the time I give him is the part of my day that interests me so much.However , I still like the picture of my life being a mobile centered on Christ with the Holy Spirit determining the direction it will all flow . <p> The other thing I found interesting was the chapter that was talking about forgiveness . That is one aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link above , as having thoughts contrary to Scripture , but , again , some of it was very thought-provoking . In this chapter , God is asking Mack to forgive the man who murdered his daughter . Mack , understandably , is having issues with this for the same reason that most of us have issues with forgiveness , even when what were being asked to forgive is n't nearly as huge . That reason is that , in Macks eyes , forgiveness means saying that what the other person did is okay and opening yourself up to a relationship with that person . <p> In this chapter , God tells Mack : <p> Mack , for you to forgive this man is to release him to me and allow me to redeem him . <p> Forgiveness is not about forgetting , Mack . It is about letting go of another persons throat . <p> You do n't  have to have a relationship with this manForgiveness does not establish a relationship . In Jesus , I have forgiven all humans for their sins against me , but only some choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiver , to release you from something that will eat you alive ; that will destroy your joy and your ability to love fully and openly . Do you think this man cares about the pain and torment you have gone through ? <p> I have had difficulty in the past with forgiveness because I felt that to forgive especially someone who had not asked for forgiveness was somehow saying that whatever they did was okay . I think Mr. Young may have a valid point here , though : forgiveness is not saying that what the offender did was okay ; its saying that you 're going to relinquish your role of judge and jury and leave that to God . <p> The hardest part of that , though , is probably the true heart of forgiveness : the part where you say , " I 'm releasing this person to God and , if they seek His forgiveness , and He redeems them , giving them the gift of salvation , I 'll rejoice that there is one more soul who wont spend eternity in Hell . " <p> Depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty hard pill to swallow the thought that God could forgive their " big " sin , just the same as He forgives your " little " ones . However , I think Mr. Young is also right in saying that forgiveness is for the forgiver . He goes so far to say , in the book , that some people go beyond not even caring that you 're harboring a grudge ( or even being completely unaware of it ) , but that some people actually feed on the knowledge that you 're suffering for what theyve done . <p> At any rate , I believe the author has a point in saying that forgiveness does not mean that you have to establish a relationship with the offender . As he points out , God created and loves all His children , even the ones who have chosen not to have a relationship with him . Relationships are built on trust . Forgiveness does not establish trust . It simply removes the burden of bitterness from the forgiver . <p> This is probably way too much rambling for a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud . If you 've read the book , I 'd love to hear your thoughts on it . Even if you have n't read it , feel free to share your thoughts on my thoughts . ; - ) 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> I got the book for Christmas , and with a low toleration for sloppy theology , and even lower threshold for poorly written and under-edited works I know , that should be reversed ; I 'm working on it I unaffectionately dubbed it , The Schmack . I cant help but feel it offends God when we do n't  give it our best , but know its marketable , however , to a " Christian " audience . The old cathedral builders and artisans would turn in their graves if they saw this . If there 's a sell out , itd like to see one like the Moravians , who sold themselves just to share Gods love with slaves . <p> But I found YOUR gleaning on forgiveness rather insightful , and presented better than the authors . And in turn , I reckon I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy of much , much more . On several levels . <p> @ Mister Dad Thank you . I was n't sure if what was bouncing around in my head was going to come out right . I agree that sloppy theology ignored for a marketable plot line is certainly not glorifying to God . <p> That 's one reason I hesitated to even post my feelings at all I did n't  want to generate more buzz about something that is n't an accurate reflection of God . However , I really want to share some of what I got from my reflections about the book and see what others thought about it all . <p> can i offer a tempered update ? i havent changed what i believe about the book . but i spoke about it with whom i received it from my mother-in-law . whilst we do not see eye to eye with one another , there is a mutual respect . and i 'd like to extend a little grace to readers who got more out of it than i . <p> Mom was moved by the what she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it begged its audience not to shove God in a box , especially one of preconceptions and religious misdirection. ive seen first hand how God can reveal Himself to be much different than what my upbringing , or even initial liking had imagined . for me , that does hold merit . <p> and i hope the readers whom were blessed by this book , continue on explore their relationship with the Lord personally , and passionately . 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

@@108017035 @3417035/ <h> Donde es Huh ? How to Teach a Foreign Language When You Do n't  Speak It <p> That 's pretty much it " what 's left in my memory of high school Spanish . Well , that , the numbers from one to thirty or so , and enough random phrases to probably just get me into trouble . <p> So , how do you teach a foreign language when you do n't speak it yourself ? You know , if for no other reason than the fact that most colleges and universities are going to expect your student to have 2 years of the same foreign language on his transcript . ( But , really , there are many benefits to learning a foreign language . ) <h> Learn together <p> A foreign language can be one of those fantastic subjects to learn together because languages are easier to learn when you have someone to practice with . If your whole family is learning , you 've got built-in study partners . <p> When Brianna took a Spanish class locally , her instructor used a fantastic resource @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese set when Brianna wanted to learn Japanese , too , but she was n't as motivated without a group of kids to learn with her . ) <p> There are many foreign language programs for homeschooling families and non-homeschooling families alike . Some of the most popular include : <p> When the kids were younger , we used Latina Christiana to try our hand at Latin for awhile . We did n't get very far , but you might be interested in knowing that having a 7-year-old say the blessing in Latin impresses the socks off of grandparents " so much so that even though they were initially opposed to homeschooling , they want to show said child off to other relatives . Just sayin ' . <h> Private tutor <p> If you 've got more than one high school student or if your family is committed to learning together , hiring a private tutor may be feasible . This could also be a good time to pool the resources of a few homeschool families and create your own personal class for your tutor to instruct . <p> Check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your library , or at area colleges to locate a tutor . <h> Take an online course <p> Unfortunately , the teacher of the local Spanish class was ultimately not a good fit for us . She had apparently never worked with any dyslexic kids and expected straight A students . From the way she talked , I really thought Brianna was failing the class . Then , we got her final report card and she had a B ! ( For the record , I was quite pleased with the B. ) <p> So , for Brianna 's second year of Spanish , we used the CurrClick Live classes and were very impressed . The instructor , Sre . Schere , was so gracious and kind . Brianna was n't always crazy about the class ( just because it was 2.5 hours of school on Friday ) , but she really loved Sre . Schere . <h> Skype <p> One of the really cool things about being a foreign language student today is that the Internet and Skype provide an option to learn a language from native speakers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am totally blanking on the name and will update if I ever remember and iTalki . I have n't used either of them , but they 're worth looking into . <p> Skype also opens the doors to more options with tutors . There was a lady in our homeschool group who taught Japanese . When she moved to Florida , she was still able to continue classes with students here via Skype . <h> Co-Op <p> Check with area co-ops . Because so many kids need it , it 's not uncommon to find foreign language classes offered . <h> YouTube and videos <p> I wish I 'd realized that many colleges will now accept American Sign Language as a foreign language . ( Not all will , so be sure to check . ) That was something Brianna really wanted to learn " enough that she 's learned a great deal on her own via YouTube . She 's learned enough that she can serve the deaf customers who come into the movie theater where she works , which I think is really cool . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a sign language interpreter before the temptation of a full-time income led me into the workforce sooner than I really should have gone . So , I have always had an interest in learning sign language , too . That 's why I 'm seriously considering our family learning together using the Learn and Master Sign Language course . <p> To find courses on YouTube , just search the name of the language you wish to learn and the word " lessons . " Check your local library or online for DVD lessons . <p> Also , many libraries offer online lessons , so check that option , as well . <p> As you can see , there are lots of options for teaching foreign language in your homeschool " even if the best you can do now is count to 10 in one of the many languages out there . For the inquiring minds , my plan for Josh and Megan is either to do a CurrClick Live class or use the Learn and Master course ( or something similar ) to learn American Sign Language .

She REALLY needs someone to converse with , that I can afford to pay . Havent found that yet , so she is going to continue Japanese at the CC in the fall . She took the Mango Japanese course , too , in the beginning through our public library . I will say that for Japanese at least it was a VERY beginning course , but it did confirm to my daughter that Japanese was the language she wanted to pursue so that was a plus . <p> Thank you for the link about the sign language . My younger daughter and I will be learning sign language together and will be checking that out ! Another online option my older daughter is looking into for Spanish is http : //spanish.academy/ ( Homeschool Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been learning Latin this year . We are using Lively Latin and are enjoying it .

She is very eager and seems to be drawn to foreign languages and cultures . <p> For Sign Language , also check out http : //www.lifeprint.com/ . This is a great starting point and reference point . I 've used the ASL Lessons The ASL dictionary and the Fingerspelling practice tool . All of this is FREE . Many of the lessons have review quizes and video instruction , where you 'll learn even more !

This totally prevents that build up on my hair . <p> As long as I do n't over do the vinegar I do n't wind up smelling too much like a salad : - ) !

Add fun activities . <p> During the cloudy days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine that 's as blah as the weather . Complete math , English , geography , and science . Check it off ; call it done . I do n't  know about you , but its an uninspiring routine . One that 's doomed to bring dread and fear into childrens hearts everywhere . <p> Spice up an ordinary routine with fun activities such as mummifying a chicken , making a cell out of cake and candy , or reenacting historical events to snap everyone out of the Winter Blues . <p> 3 . Make a naughty and nice list . <p> Make a naughty and nice list . Divide a piece of paper in half . On one side , list all of the things you loathe about your homeschool . On the other , list all the things you love about your homeschool . Obviously you do n't  want to change what you love , but take a look at what 's annoying you about homeschooling . <p> Does math feel like its nothing but an unending routine of drill then lesson , drill then lesson ? Try adding some fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve a few puzzles , or explore some obscure patterns . <p> If science has turned into a long list of reading assignments , add a few hands-on demonstrations of concepts or experiments to spice things up . In fact my kids love science kits . They 're a wonderful way to add educational fun to science . <p> With a bit of thought and effort , you can ensure that the nice list far outnumbers the naughty list . <p> 4 . Indulge in a spontaneous game day . <p> Some days we all wake up and need a break . Perhaps the kids are crabby as they 're recovering from a bad cold or simply sick of being stuck inside all day . <p> Declare a spontaneous game day . Pop popcorn , turn on music , and pull out the games . Give everyone a day off and spend it playing games and enjoying family time . Sometimes we all need a change of pace to combat the Winter Blues . <p> 5. - Let the kids teach . <p> There 's a rather funny phenomenon where teaching a subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by having your kids teach you for a day . Have them read through the lesson and explain to you what 's going on . Ask questions and ask for detailed explanations . <p> Encourage the kids to give a lecture , guide discussions , and lead the homeschool for the day . Youll be amazed at how much your children learn when they 're doing the teaching . <p> You do n't  have to be held hostage this winter by the Winter Blues . Instead use these 5 tips to combat the Winter Blues and enjoy homeschooling. 148232 @qwx1008232 148231 @qwx1008231 148235 @qwx1008235 <h> Comments <p> We love having occasional movie days- usually a movie for whatever book we 've just completed as a family . After a shortened day of school , we make some popcorn and hot chocolate , grab some blankets , and snuggle in the living room . Were actually planning one for tomorrow . : ) And I totally agree with taking breaks . Since I homeschool with the 6-week on , 1-week off schedule ( which I learned about here ) , well be having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half ! Yay ! <p> Some wonderful tips here . I am with you , after a certain time , our routine begins to feel a little blah and we are tempted to drop off . <p> We like to do school with friends ; sometimes we can do Montessori inspired works with same-age friends . <p> Other times we get out the science equipment , throw the curriculum sequence out the window , and just start making cool stuff like , bubbles , lava lamps , and magnetic goo . My kids always love goggles and gloves . <p> Other times we make up lessons , like , make a story booklet about the Romans , or we take our math and reading to the grocery store , or we make dioramas out of plywood and so some wood working . <p> We live in the South and I do year-round homeschool ( until DS gets older ) , so we actually experience the SUMMER blues ! We have many more winter days that are nice to be outside in than summer days . <p> That said , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , so we are just very flexible and take a day off or do something special whenever we feel like it . This does n't  happen that often , so it does n't  add up to more than the usual number of vacation days a schooler has ( probably many fewer days , actually ) . 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

This avoids the harsh light that often results from a built-in flash . <p> It 's a handy little trick , but not always easy to pull off because it leaves you doing everything else one-handed . <p> A couple of nights ago , I started searching for an alternative after seeing how much better a shot " especially indoors " can be when the flash light is bounced off the ceiling rather than whatever you 're shooting .

We love WordSmith. - Its a creative writing course , rather than oh , what 's the word I 'm looking for ? - You know , other types of writing , such as reports , persuasion , and so on. - However , for a reluctant writer , creative writing is sometimes less intimidating and definitely more fun. - And , in my opinion , the mechanics of writing can still be learned through creative writing . <p> Now , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In. - It covers the main types of writing in a clear , conversational style. - Like WordSmith , it is written to the student , so its designed to be used mostly independently. - Both programs require feedback on the writing from Mom , but the actual day-to-day lessons are designed for the student to do independently . <p> Reading. - This is the time to start reading some of the great books and preparing for high-school level reading. - A few of my favorites for this age , again , mostly tied to history , are : - Johnny Tremain , Across Five Aprils , and Island of the Blue Dolphins. - If your student is a strong reader , I would suggest checking out the book Reading Lists for College-Bound Students. - It makes a great reference for preparing for high school literature . <p> Spelling. - As I mentioned last week , if you 've got an older child who struggles with spelling , we 've had great success with Apples : Daily Spelling Drills. - Apples is designed for older students who are struggling with spelling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and phonics rules for older students ( middle to high school age ) . - It is decidedly Christian , so if you 're looking for a secular spelling program , this would not be for you. - If you are Christian , you may run into some issues with Bible translation differences for some fill-in-the-blank spelling practice. - We had this issue a lot of times the word that the workbook was going for was not the word used in our translation. - This was n't a big issue , but it did come up from time to time . <p> History. - Again , I was really impressed with Pandia Press History Odyssey for kids who have completed the four year Story of the World cycle. - Pandia Press History Odyssey combines great , hands-on learning with fantastic literature. - As I mentioned last week , Brianna has found the Level 2 reading list very challenging , so , based on your childs reading level , you may want to consider sticking with Level 1 through middle school , though you may have to beef up the activities or supplement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'm also considering checking next year to see how difficult it might be to select alternate books in place of the more challenging Level 2 books. - Since many of the lessons are directly related to the reading assignments , this may not be a feasible option. - I 'll let you know how it goes , if we decide to try that next year. - Either way , if you take a look at History Odyssey , be sure to read the book lists for each level to find the right fit for your child . <p> Science. - Like I said last week , weve long been fans of the Christian Kids Explore science series. - If your child has n't  done the Chemistry and Physics books in the series , seventh and eight grades would probably be the perfect time to go through these two books in the series. - They would make a great introduction to the topics so that , hopefully , they 're a little less challenging in high school . <p> Bible. - I still think Bible Study Guide for All Ages is perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - However , seventh and eighth grades are the perfect time to add in some more age appropriate personal Bible study in the form of some of my favorite studies by one of my favorite authors , Rebecca Ingram Powell. - She offers two Bible studies for girls in this age group Wise Up and Get Real and one for boys , Dig Deep. - Love , love , love Wise Up ! - Brianna went through it a year or so ago. - I 'm going to get Get Real for her this year and Dig Deep is on my list for Josh in a couple of years . <p> Do n't  give up on nature study and music and art appreciation at this age , either ! - Visit Barb at Harmony Art Mom and Handbook of Nature Study for ideas on how to continue these areas of your homeschool on up through high school . <p> This post is linked to Works for Me Wednesday . <p> This post contains affiliate links and I will receive a commission on any sales purchased using said links .

All of the events that culminated this week actually began last week , though . Last Thursday , the day before my favorite weekend of the entire year curriculum fair weekend I took all the kids to get haircuts . I meant to take before pictures , but I completely forgot . I did remember to get a before shot of Brianna , though , since hers was the most drastic change . <p> Here she is in the van , just before we went into the salon : <p> Here is the seven inch pony tail that the stylist cut off : <p> Brianna was planning to donate to Locks of Love , but she did n't  quite have 10 inches . Well , actually , she probably did , but I think the stylist was afraid to cut too much off at once . Here she is with Josh and Megan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little blind from the sun ) : <p> Who does she remind you of ? In case you need a hint , look over in the left sidebar , near the top . <p> Josh and Megan went to Brians parents for the weekend . Brianna really wanted to stay home with me and I finally decided that she was old enough to go to the curriculum fair and not be boredand she was n't . We had some nice girl bonding time and she enjoyed running into many of her friends at the fair . <p> Friday afternoon , Brianna and I went to Walmart to stock up on school supplies : <p> No , it was not an especially frugal shopping trip , but much more economical than it would have been a few weeks ago before all the school supplies were on sale . My favorite finds were the sketch pads . I was looking for something to use for nature journaling . I could n't find anything inexpensive that had a thick cardboard back , which well need for sketching outside . <p> I was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of the store when I found the Mead books . They were just over $3 for 70 sheets , plus they have the thick cardboard back and a pocket folder in the front , which I 'm thinking may really come in handy on nature walks . <p> Monday was another monumental day : After three years , Brianna finally got her brace off ! ! I 'm not sure who was more excited , her or Brian and I. Yeah , okay , I 'm guessing probably her . Shes been working hard at making up for three years of not chewing gum or eating popcorn and sticky candy . Do n't  her teeth look great ? <p> I love her retainers . She does , too . They 're not metal wire ; they are made of clear , molded plastic that just fit over her top and bottom teeth . You cant even see them when they 're in her mouth . Much better than what I had when I got my braces off . <p> The rest of the week has been spent preparing to start school for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done and a list of library books that well go get either this afternoon or tomorrow .

@@108017055 @3417055/ <h> How to Start a Family Book Club <p> January 6 , 2015 By Kris Bales <p> We 're probably all aware of the benefits of reading aloud to children , but did you know that studies have been done about how parents , families , and even society at large benefit from families reading together ? <p> A study by Kent State University revealed that family literacy results in improved reading and writing skills , greater math and science knowledge , and even increased social awareness and advocacy for parents . <p> It went on to show that families who read together become emotionally closer and build a foundation for lifelong learning . The study further states that society benefits include a positive impact on health and nutrition , high school drop-out rates , and home and community violence . <p> I 've read aloud to my children since before they were born . ( Yep , I was that mama reading to her pregnant belly ) . Even though they 're all teens now , we still do family read-alouds . However , the number of books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far greater than the number of hours in my day for reading aloud . <p> I 've come up with a solution I 'm going to implement this year " a family book club ! <p> The idea is just the same as any other book club except that we can discuss the book together as we go along , rather than waiting until a once-a-month meeting . We 'll just have to make sure everyone keeps up so there are no spoilers ! <h> Where to find multiple copies of the same book without breaking the bank <p> I 've come up with a few options for getting everyone a copy of each book we 'll read . <p> The library . The library is an obvious choice for a free source of reading material . If each family member has his or her own card , it should n't be an issue to check out individual copies , unless the guilt of one family hogging multiple copies of the same book factors in . And , of course , depending on how long your library let 's you keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewing your loan , this may or may not wind up being a free option . <p> The used book store . For us , a better option is our local used bookstore , where we can usually pick up reasonably-priced books and multiple copies without breaking the bank . <p> Amazon . I 'll admit it " I 'm really bad about just wanting my own copy of a book without traipsing off to the used bookstore . With an Amazon Prime membership , it 's often more temptation than I can bear just to let the UPS man bring copies of books to our door . If you can find the mass market paperback edition , they 're relatively inexpensive . <p> Electronic copies . You can often find the Kindle version of a book at a greatly discounted rate , if not free . I have the Kindle app on my desktop and my iPad , so it would be easy for at least two of us to share a book that way . <p> Also , if you have a child with a print disability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because Josh has been diagnosed with dyslexia , our Learning Ally membership will allow him to download free audio books to his library . The membership is only for the person with the print disability , so the rest of us will still need our own copy , but that will be one less book to purchase . <p> Sharing . We have also been known to share books . While not ideal , since you have to coordinate reading times , this is an option . You can either read a certain number of pages each day or everyone can have their own bookmarks . <h> The benefits of reading together as a family <p> In addition to the benefits of reading a book together as a family that I already mentioned , it 's just fun to have someone to share a story with . You can laugh at the funny parts and cry over the sad parts with someone who knows what you 're talking about . <p> I am sometimes guilty of explaining the entire storyline of a book just so I can share a funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much easier that would be if you 're talking to someone who 's reading along with you ! <p> Not only that , but I love that reading books together will make for some great family dinner table discussions . That will be helpful for making sure that everyone is comprehending the storyline okay , but also , I have discovered that teens have some amazing insight . They often help me to see something in a completely different light than I would have otherwise . <p> As other homeschooling parents can probably relate , I am sometimes guilty of turning everything into an educational moment. - I want our family book club to just be an opportunity to share good stories together and create some family memories " including our own family language . ( Brianna and I did this when we both read the Twilight books . ) <p> I want to include a good mix of classics , popular fiction/modern lit , and books made into movies . Besides dinner table discussions , I really do n't want to get into a bunch of extra activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often as possible , I do want to include a family movie night for watching film adaptations of some of the books we read . Post-movie discussions may include : <p> Which did you like better , the book or the movie ? <p> Why do you think the screenplay writers chose to make the changes they did ? ( Because there are always changes . ) <p> Did the characters look like you had them pictured ? <p> What are some things from the book that you were really hoping would be in the movie , but were n't ? <p> At this point , I do n't think the kids are as excited about this as I am , but I think they 'll get on board when they see I 'm not going to turn it into more school , but rather , a way for us to connect as a family . <p> Have you ever done anything like this with your family ? How did it go ? What suggestions would you offer ? 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the movie 10 Things I Hate About You . I loved that movie as a teenager . : ) To Kill A Mockingbird , Catcher in the Rye hmm ca n't seem to think of anything right now . But great idea ! I love the family bonding I will have to remember to start a family book club down the road when my little ones get older . <p> I love this idea . My wife and I already read together and were looking to do this same thjng with our little one ( due in April . ) I 'm not sure how well the book/movie discussions will go lol there are a few that I hated so much I wo n't ever watch them again ( Eragon for one . ) However , as a side project , maybe writing our own screen play of some of the books we read might be fun . Even if the movie has already been done it would lend room for the childs own personal vision of the book to shine through . <p> I have wanted to do this for ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ; ages from 22 to 12 years with very definite opinions ! You have inspired me to look harder ! We have had a family movie night for a while now my daughter has film as one of her majors at uni . She tells us really interesting things about the film the time it was set in or something about the production so wonderful ! <p> " The Princess Bride " would make a great one to read and discuss , and the film version is fantastic . I heard about a group of homeschooling families who did this together and had a themed meal together when discussing the book . I think having themed food would be a fun element to add , even if just done as a family . I like the idea of doing this just as a family unit , rather than trying to coordinate with others . The coordination factor is why we do n't  have a book club going already .

You can check out my 2012-2013 homeschool curriculum page to see what all we 'll be using this year . I 've got everything figured out but foreign language for my oldest . She wants to learn French . Any suggestions besides Rosetta Stone ? 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> I was looking into Rosetta Stone too , but I cant justify the cost right now ( my kids are in 2nd and 3rd grade . ) They 're using Muzzy for French . And since I 'm trying to learn some French myself so I can help them , I 've been looking into a few resources . The BBC has a free basic French course on their website that I 've been using , and its quite good : http : **33;276;TOOLONG Also , I write for About.com , and our Guide to French Language has an online beginners email course ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : LONG ... <p> I have n't used it , but I know there is a program similar to RS called Instant Immersion that is way cheaper . We 've used the Berlitz products in the past . Also , our kiddos are little so we enjoy Little Pim and the BBC resources as well . <p> I just bought Instant Immersions Spanish at Sams Club for $15 . Was $24.98 . They had Spanish , French , German and Italian all marked down to $15 . I do n't  know if that was just my local Sams Club or all of them but worth looking into . <p> I enjoyed using an audio program that I borrowed from the library . Its called Pimsleur . We did Spanish , but I have seen many other languages offered too . I recently saw it at Barnes and Noble , but no price was listed . My kids have learned and retained the most from this program . We started with Rosetta , but the retention was not there and then we moved into BJU Spanish I. I would not recommend BJU unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 years of Spanish in school and it was difficult to navigate after so many years of not using the language . <p> Pimsleur has 2 native speakers along with an English speaker talking you through the converstation . This is a conversational method , which means , as an example , that you may only learn one verb tense at a time vs. all the conjugations of a specific verb . For example : to run , you may only learn I run and not " you run , he runs , they run , we run " until later lessons . <p> I feel the program really challenges your brain because the English speaker will tell you to say a specific thing and then in 1-2 seconds , the native speaker will say the correct answer . I liked trying to " beat the clock " with the right answer . An example , the English speaker would say , " Your friend is walking down the street and you will greet her . Tell her good morning . ' " You have time to answer and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Weve used Pimsleur French with our six year old twins and they love it . Its great because you focus on conversation rather than spelling the words and therefore you are able to avoid speaking French with an American accent . I highly recommend it . <p> Thanks , Ellen . A bunch of people have suggested Pimsleur . Unfortunately , our local library does n't  have it and apparently they do n't  allow CDs to be sent through intralibary loan . *sigh* I 'd really love to try it before we buy . <p> We love the Uncle Eric books and I recently purchased a few more in the set . Well be doing " Whatever Happened to Justice " this fall as my son takes a class in election politics . I 've heard such great things about the Trail Guide . It works so well for so many ! Looks like it will be a great year , Kris ! <p> Weve got Whatever Happened to Penny Candy and have enjoyed what we 've read of it . Both Brianna and I have said we 'd like to read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've read so far . <p> My daughter is using Live Mocha at http : //livemocha.com/ Signing up for an account is free . The lessons are free , but cost " tokens " which you earn by reviewing other members lessons . So after every few French lessons I have her help me edit English lessons that others have submitted , which is an excellent English grammar lesson . <p> I do n't  know how old your oldest is , but for junior high/high school French we 've been using Breaking the Barrier . Its good for grammar and vocab . It does need some supplementation in the form of more exercises ( sometimes there is not enough practice ) and some type of audio like Tell Me More or Rosetta Stone , but we 've liked it . I spoke directly with the publisher and they said many of their customers ( including schools ) spread the two levels out over three years to give credit for French 1 , 2 , and 3 , so that is what we 've done . Colleges like to see at least two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oooo , about French : I was going to say Rosetta Stone as that is what we started with . Our eldest daughter is 23 and graduated with a Double Major : French and International Studies . We used Rosetta Stone , tutors , BJU French 2 and 3 through HomeSat ( no more , but online classes : LONG ... with Mrs. Anderson . She is superb ! ) Landry Academy online has French courses . Our public Library has a program attached online called Mango . If your library does n't  have it , here is a link to tell them about it . http : **35;311;TOOLONG <p> Also , our daughter can tutor over distance or consult via Skype , etc. if you need further help . <p> We live in an Arabic-speaking country where there are first and second language French speakers everywhere . We would like for our 5th , 8th and sophomore children to begin French , but want the teacher to be guided by a curriculum that would both prepare my children to speak AND be ready for AP tests in America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same curriculum but realize that may be stretching it a bit . Any suggestions ? Also , does anyone know how many hours of language every week is necessary to count it for high school credit ? 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

While we still love everything on that list , the kids have gotten older and some of our curriculum needs have changed . I thought it was time for an update . <p> So , here is our Top 10 ( updated ) Favorite Homeschool Curriculum : <p> 1 . Trail Guide to Learning " Trail Guide obviously gets our top spot . We 're loving it ! I never thought I 'd be so crazy about an all-inclusive curriculum , but I am . Trail Guide covers everything except math and it 's completely laid out for the parent . My planning consisted of hitting the print button a few times and making sure I have all the supplies needed for the projects we 're doing each week . Works for me ! <p> 2 . Teaching Textbooks " Josh and Megan have used Teaching Textbooks for several years now . It really comes in second after Horizons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching lessons and their work is automatically graded ( with immediate feedback for them ) makes it our top pick for math these days . <p> 3 . Real Science Odyssey " If we were to do anything for science other than what is covered in Trail Guide , we 'd go back to Real Science Odyssey . I love all its hands-on learning . <p> While we let ourselves get off track and currently have this loaned out to a friend , we 'll definitely get back to it and complete the course before Brianna graduates . I 've got workbooks set aside for Josh and Megan , too , when they get a bit older . <p> 7 . A Young Scholar 's Guide to Great Composers " I really love the way this workbook is laid out . Composer study is another hit-or-miss subject around here , but this is one of the best books I 've seen on the topic . <p> It 's currently on sale , too . You can get the Young Scholar 's Guide to Great Composer 's combo set for 30% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned this one before , but it 's worth mentioning again . This site allows you to input your student 's algebra problem ( you know , the one you ca n't figure out because it 's been 20+ years since you 've thought about algebra ) and it does n't just give you the answer " it shows you how to get the answer . <p> Even if you choose not to tell your kids about this one , bookmark it so that you can figure out how to help them with their math . <p> Since my Top 8 cover all the things that we 're either loving and using right now or that we have have enjoyed since my last top choices post , I 'll have to close with two of my all-time , **36;348;TOOLONG choices : <p> 9 . All About Spelling " I still say All About Spelling is one of the best spelling programs out there . It teaches spelling in a hands-on , multi-sensory way that is almost like phonics instruction . It 's spelling instruction that just makes sense . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my top pick for grammar . Until we switched to Trail Guide , we had used Easy Grammar since my oldest was in 3rd grade . I like the way Trail Guide teaches grammar in a practical , hands-on way , but I know that Easy Grammar has given my kids a solid foundation on which to build . 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> Interesting about TT my kids have done Horizons math for three years and next year we will be switching to TT for sixth grade ( my youngest will stay in Horizons ) . - I think I 'm switching for the reasons you mentioned in your post . - - <p> I also love The Young Scholar 's Guide to the Composers . - I would love to make a co op class out of it , actually being a musician by training , it 's the best I 've seen , too . <p> Trail Guide is all-inclusive , except for math , so that 's all we 're using right now .

Soak up every single second of this chubby finger phase you can because these precious years are fleeting and you do n't  want to waste them worrying about " homeschooling " your toddler. - <p> But I do n't  say any of that because its a Facebook group and we all know how scary those can be . <p> Moms of little ones , just be the rockin mama you are . That 's the only lesson needed for now ! <h> 3 . Other Homeschool Moms <p> " Comparison is the thief of joy . " Theodore Roosevelt <p> Isnt that the truth ? <p> Other homeschool moms can be intimidating . Conversations around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . One mom swears by the Charlotte Mason method ; another mom believes unschooling is the way to go . Some moms buy school in a box , and other moms dutifully piece together the perfect unit studies for free at the local library . Online classes or not ? This publisher or that publisher ? Ahhh ! ! ! <p> It is so easy to fall into the comparison trap in the homeschooling community . Do what works for your family and feel good about it . Period ! <h> 4 . Naysayers <p> There will always be people that do n't  understand your decision to homeschool . They come in all shapes and sizes . Family , friends , strangers in line at Target . <p> Its just the opposite , actually . Being home all day only means you 're never able to clean anything because humans are always there ! Add homeschooling on top of the everyday circus that is your household , and you 've got an even bigger mess . <h> 6 . Finishing Every Lesson in the Book <p> At the start of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down with a tall stack of crispy curriculum . Then I proceed to torture myself with this very broken lesson planning technique . Maybe you can relate ? <p> I immediately look to see how many total lessons there are and divide that number by 30 ( weeks of school ) and then I divide that number by 4 ( days a week ) and voila ! I have lesson plans . This gives me a rough idea of how many lessons I need to complete each week to finish the curriculum . Or so I think . <p> It takes about one week for this plan to fall apart . And then you know what I do ? I do it all again . <p> How many lessons are left ? Divide . Divide . <p> This happens about 758 times during the school year , and we never finish . Ever . <h> 7 . Socialization <p> My boys have never been extremely social , and that does n't  have anything to do with homeschooling ! <p> Listen , your kids are who they are . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world in their own time , and when they do , the right people will love and appreciate them for who they are . Its really that simple ! <h> About Adrienne Bolton <p> Adrienne Bolton is wife and homeschooling mom of two boys , one in high school and one in middle school . She 's a Christ follower , runner , yoga lover , coffee guzzler and pursuer of sanity. - Their Florida family began the unexpected journey of homeschooling in 2009 and she 's been hanging on for dear life ever since . Adrienne writes with an honest voice about the realities of motherhood , homeschooling , and everything in between at- The Mommy Mess . <h> Comments <p> Thank you so much for this article because I am such a worrier ! ! ! I know I should n't , and I know it serves no purpose but I guess it is just in my nature . Thank you for the reminders about how fast the time goes : ) I 'm so excited to teach high school ! My kids are only 7 and 8 so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patient teaching older kids . <p> The worry I would add is " Is what I am doing working ? " I always feel like I am second guessing everything on the parenting and homeschooling front . I know I am giving it all for my family and there is n't much more I can do : ) <p> I do n't  worry anymore . Maybe when I first started . Maybe when I started teaching my youngest which has severe autism . A little when the started high school or applied to college . Have no fear . Pray .

" As a mom ( and former SPED teacher ) I worry that I 'm not doing enough with my middle schooler who has several learning disabilities . I often think there is more I could be doing or I should be doing this or that . It is stressful ! <p> Yep ! You nailed it ! My kids all reading and writing even though I was panicking about not knowing how to teach them . They are now in grade 1 , 3 and 4 and doing super well . My house is never spotless as it as one day , in fact , there is always mess all over but hey , were all super happy ! : D <p> Thanks so much for this list of things not to worry about .

I also ca n't believe we 've almost made it through another school year . <p> And , do n't even get me started on the fact that Josh will be a senior next school year . sigh <p> The highlight of the week was this : <p> Yes , we thought we needed another creature in the house . Well , to be fair , two of us did not think we needed another creature in the house . The boys thought we were just fine , thankyouverymuch . <p> But the girls are suckers for a pretty face and Megan has been wanting her own cat " or dog .

Jack was n't impressed and he 's taken up with the neighbors down the street . Now , he only comes to visit and is pretty grouchy when he does . <p> So , we got Megan an as-yet-unnamed snuggle buddy . She is such an affectionate cat . We got her Tuesday afternoon , so far she 's doing pretty good with the dogs and other cats . There 's been a little hissing and growling on both sides , but they 've also all slept in one another 's presence , so I think we 're off to a good start . <p> And , as long as there are treats involved for everyone , they can peacefully exist in close proximity . <p> We are open to name suggestions , but I think we 've rejected about 1,000 of them . Megan likes Echo , so that may be what we wind up with . I 'm leaning toward Sassy , even though I was originally in favor of Oreo or Domino . <p> For your reference , we currently have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We also have five cats : Gus , Lily , Luna , Chloe , and Jack ( except he really does n't  live here anymore ) . Shes a female cat . <p> I had a fabulous Mother 's Day .

We were all exhausted and everyone slept great because the house was so quiet . <p> Brian grilled some steaks for dinner then we all went to see Guardians of the Galaxy , Vol. 2 . It was the perfect , relaxing day spent with my favorite people . Then , I had breakfast with my mom and sister on Wednesday as our belated Mother 's Day brunch . <p> Yep , that 's pretty much it for the highlights .

@@108017085 @3417085/ <h> Review : Sue Patricks Workbox System <p> October 24 , 2009 By Kris Bales <p> Having heard all about the workbox craze , I was anxious to try it myself. - I received the e-Book , Sue Patricks Workbox System right about the time we went on vacation . Since we were headed out on vacation , I was n't able to implement the system right away , but we have enjoyed using it the last few weeks . <p> If you 've been living under the proverbial rock and do n't  know anything about the workbox system , its an organizational system that was developed in the autism community and has been tweaked by author Sue Patrick for use in homeschools with kids off all ages and abilities , including those with ADHD and autism-spectrum disorders . <p> It is important to note that Ms. Patrick is rather adamant that you first try the system exactly as she has designed it before making any adjustments so that you can get the full effect and see how the system works for your family. - That being said , those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its " supposed " to be used in our homeschool . <p> While I can fully appreciate how the system was designed to work and why Ms. Patrick strongly encourages families to use it that way , there are three reasons why I knew I had to adapt it for our family : <p> 1. - We do n't  have a separate school room and my husband is not about having three wire shoe racks filled with a total of 36 plastic shoe boxes in our dining room , nor is there room to do so . <p> 2. - The system , as written , seemed very rigid to this rather relaxed , eclectic homeschool mom. - I 'm not about pointing to a " be quiet " sign on a Popsicle stick when my kids are talking. - We tend to take the home part of homeschool pretty seriously , which can include relevant rabbit trails or telling somebody to save that thought for a more appropriate time , as the situation warrants. - And , I do n't  mind my kids asking for help when they need it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coupled with the " use em and they 're gone " philosophy did not fit with my parenting style . <p> 3. - We do history , science , art and music together everybody and I typically do grammar on the white board with Josh and Megan , so setting up the entire system for the handful of subjects that the kids do independently- seemed a bit much . <p> As I was considering the best way to set up our modified system , I began to feel a bit like I was trying to fix something that was n't broken. - However , after using it for the last few weeks , I 'm liking it pretty well. - It does encourage independence and the kids like the portability. - Are you dying to know what we 've done ? <p> Milk crates and hanging file folders , baby ! <p> I found milk crates the kind designed for home offices , with a lip to hold hanging file folders for $3.50 each at Big Lots. - I got a set of colored hanging file folders because , let 's face it , bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day than green and drab and Velcro dots. - I printed off the number strips and we were good to go . <p> Instead of cutting the schedule strips into strips , I taped the whole grid on the front of the kids milk crates workboxes. - I then put the numbers on the file folders. - As they finish the work inside each folder , they move the number from that folder to the schedule grid. - They are not to move the number until the work in that folder is finished , not when they start on itbecause , um , yeah , we have a couple of kids who get halfway through something then forget to finish it . <p> One of my favorite things about the workbox system is the fact that Josh and Megans music folders and recorders fit in one of the file folders no more nagging about doing music homework ! <p> Almost immediately , Josh asked me if he had to do the work in his box in numerical order. - Honestly , I 've always been an " I do n't  care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your work done as long as it gets done " kind of homeschool mom because I think that teaches independence and time management , so , of course , I told him no. - However , I did tell him to put the numbers in the right order on the " completed work " grid so that he could easily see if hed missed something . <p> Oh , and for the record that " when it gets done " comment is mostly for my oldest who sometimes likes to do the next days schoolwork at night before she goes to bed. - I guess , technically , I do care when it gets done as I have two who would put off their work indefinitely , if I 'd let them . <p> The kids are to put their completed work back in their boxes and stack them up ( I love that the milk crates are stackable ! ) in the dining room when they 're done , so that I can check their schoolwork. - A surprising benefit Ive found is that this method makes checking school seem easier. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm now checking each childs full days work together , it seems easier. - I guess that 's because I used to check all the easy stuff first and leave the more time-consuming work until the end , whereas now , its spread out. - Yes , I know that 's all psychological , but I can deal with that . <p> So , while our modified workbox system has n't  totally streamlined our day , it has made certain aspects of it easier , such as : <p> The kids like the portability of being able to take their entire box of work to their preferred study spots . <p> It is encouraging greater independence in my younger two since one of the things I put in their boxes , Daily Grams , is something we had been doing together. - Josh still likes to have my help , but Megan likes to take her box and at least attempt the Daily Grams on her own . <p> As previously mentioned , no nagging about music homework and easier schoolwork checking time for me . <p> So , overall , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and implement the ideas that work best for our family. - In addition to explaining the workbox system , Ms. Patricks book offers many practical and idea-sparking suggestions for ways to present schoolwork in a more kid-friendly way , such as making games from posters , creating file folder games , and setting up fun learning centers . <p> Sue Patricks Workbox System is available as an e-Book download for $19 or a print book for $19.95. - Ms. Patrick also offers , on her website , a consulting service and supplies for setting up your workbox system and/or learning centers. 148233 @qwx1008233 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> I 've been using the workbox system for my boys ( 3rd and 5th grade ) for the past 9 weeks . We love it ! Of course , I do n't use it EXACTLY as she lays it out in her book . The system has helped my boys tremendously with staying organized with their work and working through ALL of it . I have found some unexpected benefits to me as well:1 . The system encourages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EXPECT yesterday 's work to be graded and in their workbox with their new work so it holds me accountable.2 . The system helps me to have more review in my boys ' days and to add indepedent projects that they can do that relate to our unit study.3 . The system has helped the boys to be more independent although they are free to ask for help whenever they need to ask.4 . The system helps me to be more organized . <p> My oldest child ( 7th ) does n't use workboxes as she follows her assignment list very well . <p> We use a loose version of it also , but only use 6 boxes in a stacking drawer set up . It works great for us . We are like you and do certain subjects together , so that is why we use 6 . Plus , my boys are young : ) <p> Great review Kris ! I always love seeing how families modify it for their use . At some point , I 'd like to modify it for classroom use , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while before I can try it out . <p> I understand why the system is so rigid though . When working with autistic kids and kids with more severe cases of ADHD , that " Be quiet " sign will be a must , as will a certain number of " help " cards . I 've found with my experience , mostly with ADHD kids , they tend to like to make excuses for not being able to do stuff on their own , so this forces them to think about it and figure it out , instead of crawling to you acting helpless . It also teaches them management skills , which is something they often so need . But , like you said , your family does n't need it , so you could make that modification . <p> I like this system tooI did think Sue was a bit much when it came to certain attitudes of how to " do " they system , but our version of the system works well tooI did not do the number strips or other cardsI am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I attached the numbers to each boxand they stay thereI think the beauty of this system is the the children " SEE " all of their workthen they see it GOING AWAYI have tried a couple of variationsfile box , numbered foldersbut use the system mostly how it was designed for my oldest . He is able to get through more work than ever before.Another beauty for me is some of what you described for checking work.You HAVE to look through it because they need to be refilledand that is a great way to guard against building it up and then having to reteach two major math **25;386;TOOLONG ! One last thing I love is that EVERYTHING GOES IN THE BOXwell , I do n't put pencils in , but everything you needso there is no last minute rememberingoh , I need a mapokwe 'll do that in a little bitand then you get off track , and then you forgetsometimes for 2 weeksit is all in the box , so there is no DOWN TIME waiting for the things you needTHanks for the review ! C <p> We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy it especially now that we have the kinks worked out . You can see our modifications at LONG ... I love reading about others modifications . I too seem to aways tweak a program for our family , it 's just my nature , so i can totally relate to your thoughts on it . : ) <p> We use the workbox system also , with some tweaking . I only have one child so it was easy to have 12 boxes but I do not use any of the cards or number strips . It has helped me stay organized , and has encouraged me to switch things up on a daily basis to add in all those items we buy but do n't quite get to . My daughter likes seeing what is coming up next and when she will be finished . We accomplish between 7 12 boxes each day depending on what else we have planned.BlessingsDiane <p> I also do n't use the system exactly as written , but many of the things that I have changed are the same things that you have changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , however . Because they do several of the things together , I set things up to make that easier . <p> My kids really love the Workbox system ! We have been doing it for about 8 weeks now , and they still like it and so do I. I figure that 's a great sign ! ; ) <p> Kris , thank you for your great review ! We 've actually been using milk crates for ea. of my kids the last couple of years , in order to keep all of their current every-day stuff together , easily accessible and portable , though I have n't put hanging files in it . I believe THAT alone would help to organize what so quickly becomes a stacked , jumbled mess ( I 'd even thought to , but have n't gotten around to it yet with so much moving , etc. going on ) . Thank you for the input , this may be exactly what I 'm looking for , since I too do n't want to be fixing what is n't broken , nor do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own homeschool , but rather just refine it . This may very well be a workable answer to my prayers of late , as I do need to incoorperate more prepared scheduling/independent directives into our day for my two middle schoolers , since our 2yo seems to throw off my groove more days than not , and it seems that EVERY subject that they 're not independent with , or do n't have prior written directions/plans suffers for it . Blessings <p> We use the workboxes in a looser , a bit more unstructured way as well . I really like the concept , but was hard pressed to find 12 things that we can do every day .

@@108017098 @3417098/ <h> Review : Sue Patricks Workbox System <p> October 24 , 2009 By Kris Bales <p> Having heard all about the workbox craze , I was anxious to try it myself. - I received the e-Book , Sue Patricks Workbox System right about the time we went on vacation . Since we were headed out on vacation , I was n't able to implement the system right away , but we have enjoyed using it the last few weeks . <p> If you 've been living under the proverbial rock and do n't  know anything about the workbox system , its an organizational system that was developed in the autism community and has been tweaked by author Sue Patrick for use in homeschools with kids off all ages and abilities , including those with ADHD and autism-spectrum disorders . <p> It is important to note that Ms. Patrick is rather adamant that you first try the system exactly as she has designed it before making any adjustments so that you can get the full effect and see how the system works for your family. - That being said , those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its " supposed " to be used in our homeschool . <p> While I can fully appreciate how the system was designed to work and why Ms. Patrick strongly encourages families to use it that way , there are three reasons why I knew I had to adapt it for our family : <p> 1. - We do n't  have a separate school room and my husband is not about having three wire shoe racks filled with a total of 36 plastic shoe boxes in our dining room , nor is there room to do so . <p> 2. - The system , as written , seemed very rigid to this rather relaxed , eclectic homeschool mom. - I 'm not about pointing to a " be quiet " sign on a Popsicle stick when my kids are talking. - We tend to take the home part of homeschool pretty seriously , which can include relevant rabbit trails or telling somebody to save that thought for a more appropriate time , as the situation warrants. - And , I do n't  mind my kids asking for help when they need it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coupled with the " use em and they 're gone " philosophy did not fit with my parenting style . <p> 3. - We do history , science , art and music together everybody and I typically do grammar on the white board with Josh and Megan , so setting up the entire system for the handful of subjects that the kids do independently- seemed a bit much . <p> As I was considering the best way to set up our modified system , I began to feel a bit like I was trying to fix something that was n't broken. - However , after using it for the last few weeks , I 'm liking it pretty well. - It does encourage independence and the kids like the portability. - Are you dying to know what we 've done ? <p> Milk crates and hanging file folders , baby ! <p> I found milk crates the kind designed for home offices , with a lip to hold hanging file folders for $3.50 each at Big Lots. - I got a set of colored hanging file folders because , let 's face it , bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day than green and drab and Velcro dots. - I printed off the number strips and we were good to go . <p> Instead of cutting the schedule strips into strips , I taped the whole grid on the front of the kids milk crates workboxes. - I then put the numbers on the file folders. - As they finish the work inside each folder , they move the number from that folder to the schedule grid. - They are not to move the number until the work in that folder is finished , not when they start on itbecause , um , yeah , we have a couple of kids who get halfway through something then forget to finish it . <p> One of my favorite things about the workbox system is the fact that Josh and Megans music folders and recorders fit in one of the file folders no more nagging about doing music homework ! <p> Almost immediately , Josh asked me if he had to do the work in his box in numerical order. - Honestly , I 've always been an " I do n't  care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your work done as long as it gets done " kind of homeschool mom because I think that teaches independence and time management , so , of course , I told him no. - However , I did tell him to put the numbers in the right order on the " completed work " grid so that he could easily see if hed missed something . <p> Oh , and for the record that " when it gets done " comment is mostly for my oldest who sometimes likes to do the next days schoolwork at night before she goes to bed. - I guess , technically , I do care when it gets done as I have two who would put off their work indefinitely , if I 'd let them . <p> The kids are to put their completed work back in their boxes and stack them up ( I love that the milk crates are stackable ! ) in the dining room when they 're done , so that I can check their schoolwork. - A surprising benefit Ive found is that this method makes checking school seem easier. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm now checking each childs full days work together , it seems easier. - I guess that 's because I used to check all the easy stuff first and leave the more time-consuming work until the end , whereas now , its spread out. - Yes , I know that 's all psychological , but I can deal with that . <p> So , while our modified workbox system has n't  totally streamlined our day , it has made certain aspects of it easier , such as : <p> The kids like the portability of being able to take their entire box of work to their preferred study spots . <p> It is encouraging greater independence in my younger two since one of the things I put in their boxes , Daily Grams , is something we had been doing together. - Josh still likes to have my help , but Megan likes to take her box and at least attempt the Daily Grams on her own . <p> As previously mentioned , no nagging about music homework and easier schoolwork checking time for me . <p> So , overall , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and implement the ideas that work best for our family. - In addition to explaining the workbox system , Ms. Patricks book offers many practical and idea-sparking suggestions for ways to present schoolwork in a more kid-friendly way , such as making games from posters , creating file folder games , and setting up fun learning centers . <p> Sue Patricks Workbox System is available as an e-Book download for $19 or a print book for $19.95. - Ms. Patrick also offers , on her website , a consulting service and supplies for setting up your workbox system and/or learning centers. 148233 @qwx1008233 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> I 've been using the workbox system for my boys ( 3rd and 5th grade ) for the past 9 weeks . We love it ! Of course , I do n't use it EXACTLY as she lays it out in her book . The system has helped my boys tremendously with staying organized with their work and working through ALL of it . I have found some unexpected benefits to me as well:1 . The system encourages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EXPECT yesterday 's work to be graded and in their workbox with their new work so it holds me accountable.2 . The system helps me to have more review in my boys ' days and to add indepedent projects that they can do that relate to our unit study.3 . The system has helped the boys to be more independent although they are free to ask for help whenever they need to ask.4 . The system helps me to be more organized . <p> My oldest child ( 7th ) does n't use workboxes as she follows her assignment list very well . <p> We use a loose version of it also , but only use 6 boxes in a stacking drawer set up . It works great for us . We are like you and do certain subjects together , so that is why we use 6 . Plus , my boys are young : ) <p> Great review Kris ! I always love seeing how families modify it for their use . At some point , I 'd like to modify it for classroom use , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while before I can try it out . <p> I understand why the system is so rigid though . When working with autistic kids and kids with more severe cases of ADHD , that " Be quiet " sign will be a must , as will a certain number of " help " cards . I 've found with my experience , mostly with ADHD kids , they tend to like to make excuses for not being able to do stuff on their own , so this forces them to think about it and figure it out , instead of crawling to you acting helpless . It also teaches them management skills , which is something they often so need . But , like you said , your family does n't need it , so you could make that modification . <p> I like this system tooI did think Sue was a bit much when it came to certain attitudes of how to " do " they system , but our version of the system works well tooI did not do the number strips or other cardsI am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I attached the numbers to each boxand they stay thereI think the beauty of this system is the the children " SEE " all of their workthen they see it GOING AWAYI have tried a couple of variationsfile box , numbered foldersbut use the system mostly how it was designed for my oldest . He is able to get through more work than ever before.Another beauty for me is some of what you described for checking work.You HAVE to look through it because they need to be refilledand that is a great way to guard against building it up and then having to reteach two major math **25;413;TOOLONG ! One last thing I love is that EVERYTHING GOES IN THE BOXwell , I do n't put pencils in , but everything you needso there is no last minute rememberingoh , I need a mapokwe 'll do that in a little bitand then you get off track , and then you forgetsometimes for 2 weeksit is all in the box , so there is no DOWN TIME waiting for the things you needTHanks for the review ! C <p> We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy it especially now that we have the kinks worked out . You can see our modifications at LONG ... I love reading about others modifications . I too seem to aways tweak a program for our family , it 's just my nature , so i can totally relate to your thoughts on it . : ) <p> We use the workbox system also , with some tweaking . I only have one child so it was easy to have 12 boxes but I do not use any of the cards or number strips . It has helped me stay organized , and has encouraged me to switch things up on a daily basis to add in all those items we buy but do n't quite get to . My daughter likes seeing what is coming up next and when she will be finished . We accomplish between 7 12 boxes each day depending on what else we have planned.BlessingsDiane <p> I also do n't use the system exactly as written , but many of the things that I have changed are the same things that you have changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , however . Because they do several of the things together , I set things up to make that easier . <p> My kids really love the Workbox system ! We have been doing it for about 8 weeks now , and they still like it and so do I. I figure that 's a great sign ! ; ) <p> Kris , thank you for your great review ! We 've actually been using milk crates for ea. of my kids the last couple of years , in order to keep all of their current every-day stuff together , easily accessible and portable , though I have n't put hanging files in it . I believe THAT alone would help to organize what so quickly becomes a stacked , jumbled mess ( I 'd even thought to , but have n't gotten around to it yet with so much moving , etc. going on ) . Thank you for the input , this may be exactly what I 'm looking for , since I too do n't want to be fixing what is n't broken , nor do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own homeschool , but rather just refine it . This may very well be a workable answer to my prayers of late , as I do need to incoorperate more prepared scheduling/independent directives into our day for my two middle schoolers , since our 2yo seems to throw off my groove more days than not , and it seems that EVERY subject that they 're not independent with , or do n't have prior written directions/plans suffers for it . Blessings <p> We use the workboxes in a looser , a bit more unstructured way as well . I really like the concept , but was hard pressed to find 12 things that we can do every day . Then I sort of felt a slave to the order . We ended up changing things up quite a bit , but still keeping the boxes . My oldest son has Sensory Processing Disorder ( unlike others who say that the rigidity may be more necessary ) and I actually found the boxes to rigid for him , maybe it 's because he is still young ( age 5 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel that I am open to changing things as we go along though , so we will see how it all progresses . : ) <p> I have been intrigued by the workbox system since I first heard of it .

@@108017111 @3417111/ <h> How to Assign High School Credit for Electives <p> First , you need to know how to assign credit for electives . One credit is generally award for 150-180 hours worth of work in a subject . So , if your student spends an hour a day most days of the school year working on his hobby ( or skill , talent , passion , etc. ) , he 's earned one credit . <p> Tip : This also applies to sports concerning P.E . credit . <p> You can also assign credit for mastery of a skill . So , maybe your student does n't spend 150-180 hours on a given hobby in a single school year , but over the course of her four years of high school , she achieves what would reasonably be considered high school level mastery of that skill , you can award one credit . <h> When to Assign More Than One Credit <p> We homeschooling parents need to be on guard against short-changing our kids . We certainly do n't want to fabricate credit for our students but , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're giving all credit that they earned . <p> If you have a student who spends a tremendous amount of time on a given skill or hobby , you can probably award more than one credit . If your photography buff were in school , she might take photography classes more than one year of high school " think Photography 101 , Photography 102 , etc . <p> You can do the same thing in your homeschool . Josh spends hours learning and playing guitar . In addition to learning to play , he has also studied music theory . I gave him credit for each on his transcript . <p> My film-making friends also spend hours on their craft . There is so much that goes into film-making from composition to the actual filming to editing and preparing the final product . Not all of those skills would necessarily be taught in a single course , so mastery may earn more than one credit . <h> How to Assign More Than One Credit <p> A simple way to figure out how to assign credit and list electives on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Just about anything can be considered an elective course for high school . You never know what might turn into a career field or an entrepreneurial opportunity .

Do you have questions about counting that as an elective ? 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <p> My daughter has two main interests . Ornithology has led to two credits so far ( and there will probably one more ) as well as some stuff ( newsletter editing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her other interest is trampolining . As well as competing she coaches , judges and does other volunteer work at competitions . I keep that all as an extra-curricular since threre is no PE requirement here and it is n't especially relevant for the field she plans to study at univeristy . If she was going to pursue teaching , or sports science or something I 'd have it in the main academic section of her transcript . I 'm pretty relaxed ( she 's the youngest of four who were all homeschooled and there are few to no formal expectations as to what is required for graduation or university admittance ) and just follow my gut as to what to put where on a transcript . <p> I have found that the credit hours are pretty arbitrary . When I was researching different states credit hours 16 years ago , I found it could be counted as low as 70-80 hours per credit . Many places used 120 . I do not know why most home school sources site the much higher 150-180 range . Especially in todays ps , where kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less , per subject . I have found that 90 hours is quite sufficient and middle of the road between the two extremes found in most brick and motor systems . Most traditional courses- such as using a high school textbook , does n't  need any hours counted . A student can do the entire book in 2 months or take 2 years and still earn 1 credit of high school biology . The hour counting is really only needed if using a self-created course or electives that do n't  have a set course book/schedule- such as sports or art on ones own . So why make it unnecessarily high ? Yes , I make traditional looking transcripts for all of my children , but it is a tool and not the goal . Far better for the student to excel in self-learning skills than overly worry about too many boxes and hoops . <p> Yes , absolutely every family should do their own research and do what makes sense for their unique families and situations . What I share is based on my experience . In my area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 120-180 , with 150-180 being fairly standard . In most states , the homeschooling parent decides the course and graduation requirements for their students so the range is simply a guideline , though I would want to take into consideration the requirements and expectations of the colleges and universities a student may be interested in attending . <p> You 're absolutely correct about textbooks . Completing a more traditional textbook should earn 1 credit regardless of how long it took to complete it . That wasnt what I was addressing here since most students hobbies and interests are n't  going to involve a traditional textbook . I was addressing self-created courses and electives , which , as you said , may require hour counting , if for no other purpose than to give the teaching parent an idea of how a students self-directed interests could best be shown on a transcript . <p> As always , anything I share here is based on my own experience and is based on how I tend to do things .

@@108017115 @3417115/ <h> What Good Is a Parenting Seminar ? <p> February 11 , 2014 By Kris Bales <p> Early in our marriage , I won tickets to a Gary Chapman marriage seminar . Brian and I had a great time and really reconnected with each other that weekend . One of the things I remember Mr. Chapman saying " well , other than the fact that his wife never shut cabinet doors and I could n't imagine anyone not shutting a cabinet door they 'd just opened until Megan came along , but that 's a whole nother story " was that married couples should try to go to a marriage seminar every year because it was a great way to keep your marriage healthy . <p> Fast forward a few years . When Brianna was still in public school " in first grade " I went to pick her up one day . I noticed a sign on the bulletin board for a parenting seminar . I figured if a marriage seminar was good for your marriage , a parenting seminar must be good for your parenting , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , apparently , the only parents to sign up for this event without being court-ordered to do so . <p> Talk about awkward " especially when the children 's librarian whom you 'd seen at the library every week for the past several years for story time was one of the people helping . I did feel the need to explain that we were there of our own free will . It was a really good seminar , though , and I 'm glad we signed up . <p> So , why would you want to attend a parenting seminar ? <h> 1 . Parenting seminars can provide you with new ideas . <p> It does n't matter if your kids are toddlers or teens , there is always something to learn about this parenting thing . Even if you only pick up one new idea " whether it 's a disciplining technique or an idea for connecting with your child " if it 's effective , it was worth the time to attend the seminar . <p> And , the fact is , each new stage of childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just when you think you 've got a handle on the toddler stage , here comes some new preschool phase . Just a couple of weeks ago , our church offered some breakout sessions . I went to one about kids and the internet and social media . Y'all I 'm a social media manager . I thought I had this thing down . Um , yeah . I walked away with a page of notes . There 's always something new to learn . <h> 2 . Parenting seminars can encourage you . <p> No matter how good you may feel about your overall parenting skills , there are days when we all feel like a failure " when we think maybe we should start saving for our kids ' therapy bills . A good parenting seminar often helps me see the areas where I 'm getting it right while providing encouraging ideas for how I can work on being a better mom . <h> 3 . Parenting seminars can offer great suggestions on ways to reconnect with your kids . <p> Just as you can walk away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ideas for ways to regularly connect with each other , parenting seminars can spark ideas for ways to feel closer to your kids . Again , that ages and stages thing often comes into play . The ways your preschool daughter enjoyed spending time with you are likely not the same now that she 's a teen . <h> 4 . Attending a parenting seminar can help you mentor someone else . <p> When we went to that parenting seminar when Brianna was younger , I spoke to our small group leader about the fact that perhaps we were out of place " that I had n't realized that the other families were there because they had to be . She encouraged us to continue because many of the other families attending had n't really ever had strong family relationships modeled for them . <p> Now , that situation probably is n't going to be the same at most parenting seminars , but the fact is that there are parents who are coming along behind you " with kids at stages you 've already been through " who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't feel wise or experienced . <h> Where can you find a parenting seminar ? <p> I know that , in our area , parenting seminars are n't as readily available as marriage seminars .

@@108017119 @3417119/ <h> How to Plan a Family Game Night for Your Homeschool Group <p> August 7 , 2012 By Kris Bales <p> Some of the most fun that our family " as in , the entire family , Dad included " has had with our local homeschool group are the family game nights we 've held . I 've been thinking lately that it 's been too long since we 've had one of these just-for-fun gatherings and it 's time to plan another one . <p> Y'all should know by now that I 'm all about easy , so I wanted to share with you a few simple tips on how to plan a family game night for your homeschool group . <p> If your group is anything like mine , the majority of activities are during the day so that moms ( or the schooling parent ) and kids can attend without taking coveted family time away from the evenings . <p> If your husband is anything like mine , that 's just fine with him because it means he does n't have to make conversation with strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it gets everyone involved and includes activities that give everyone a chance to interact and get to know each other in a laid-back setting . <p> So , what 's involved in planning this little shindig ? <p> 1 . Find a location . A church fellowship hall or community center are great options because they usually have the basics that you need : <p> tables <p> chairs <p> a place to serve food <p> basic sports equipment such as basketball goals , a volleyball net , or a four-square grid <p> The times we 've had a family game night , we 've been able to secure a church fellowship hall at no cost . We just had to make sure we cleaned up afterward . A community center may involve a rental fee , but it 's usually not bad split up between participating families . <p> 2 . Plan for food . You know there 's got to be food . All that game-playing makes people hungry . Most of our group 's events are done potluck-style . Everyone brings a main dish , side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-liter soda , gallon of something ( preferably sweet tea ) , water bottles , or juice boxes . <p> We 've found that it 's easiest for one person to pick up all the paper goods ( plates , napkins , cups , plastic utensils ) and have each family bring a dollar or two to cover the cost . <p> I bought a plastic tote for our group so that I could store our paper goods between events and restock as necessary . Depending on turnout , I do n't always need to collect money each time , just when I need to restock . <p> 3 . Bring games . We ask everyone to bring a few of their family 's favorite games . We try to make sure we have easier games for the younger kids , too , though sometimes they just like to play with each other while the older kids and parents play . The little ones sometimes enjoying " helping " a parent or sibling play , as well . <p> Those basketball goals and volleyball nets come in handy for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . For these events , the emphasis is on fun , so there are n't any hard and fast rules about what people do " a sport , a board game , or just chit chat " as long as everyone is being safe and respectful . <p> A couple of rules that we do follow is that all the pieces for a particular game stay on the table where that game is being played and all the pieces are put back in the box when it 's not being played . That way , everyone can go back home with all the pieces of the games they brought . <p> We 've discovered some great new ( to us ) games at family games nights , such as Pit ( much more fun than it sounds ) and enjoyed some old favorites with new friends . <p> Over that last decade or so , I 've planned dozens of events for our local homeschool group and I am happy to share those ideas with you ! I have put together a 22-page guide to planning activities for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hundred or an informal group of a few families . <p> 52 Weeks of Homeschool Group Activities offers an idea for each week of the year , loosely organized by season , along with planning tips for events and field trips .

Our house is n't large , but we spread out into different rooms . Word games in the living room , strategy games in the dining room , sports games in the basement . I think our largest group consisted of 4 or 5 other families . One year we had a winter Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a little hockey first . <p> I cant remember the food , but I am all about easy . I am guessing we picked up pizzas and then everybody contributed munchies and deserts . <p> We did organize a game night for our church once . It was pot-luck and everyone brought games they enjoyed . The problem with that was that the adults were more interested in just sitting and socializing after dinner and really did n't  play any games . I think if we wanted more adults to play , we should skip the dinner and just maybe make it a dessert event . <p> School ( we have one in public school and one at home ) wo n't start here for another several weeks ( after Labor Day ) , but I think a game night to start off the year would be fun ! <p> Our homeschool support group has monthly family nights . Most are holiday/season themed . For example , our Aug. theme is ( Not ) Back to School , the potluck is breakfast foods , we will wear our " school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ts , art smocks , , , ) and the games shared will be favorite learning games like Apples to Apples Bible Edition and Scrabble . Also , everyone is bringing school supplies to share for take home treatbags . <p> Pit is so much fun ! I remember playing it as a kidI still have the game that was our families when I was growing up . My kids use the bell as their hotel desk bell . Someday , they will learn the real game . Thanks for the ideas , I think we will try this with our co-op this year . 148237 @qwx1008237 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

@@108017125 @3417125/ <h> 5 Ways to Encourage Kids to Write <p> Kids do n't  always like to write , in fact some kids rather dread it . These kids avoid writing with a passion and drive their poor mom to despair . Here are a few of my favorite gentle ways to encourage kids to write . <p> 1 . Write letters . While some children do n't  enjoy writing reports or essays , they love to write letters to extended family members . Its fun to send the letters and receive a response back . Its also a great way to involve grandparents in the homeschool . <p> Another option is to write a letter to a favorite author . Have your child write about how much the books are enjoyed and what your childs favorite scene is. - Writing to family is an excellent introduction to friendly letters while writing to a favorite author is an introduction to formal business letters . <p> 2 . Write a short book . Writing stories is another great way to encourage kids to write . Your child can write their stories in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but be gentle . Its better to err on the side of too little than to discourage a love of writing . <p> Once the stories are written , have your child carefully copy the stories onto paper and illustrate them . You can do a formal stitched binding or simply staple the books together . Your child has now written their first book . <p> 3 . Write paragraphs on a favorite topic . Some kids love to write stories and others do n't  . If your child believes writing a short story to be the equivalent of torture , have him write a paragraph every day on a topic of his choice . <p> In my case , one of my sons spent a summer studying ants . He followed ants . He examined the anthills . He read about ants . He wrote many , many , many paragraphs about ants all summer . To this day my son still adores ants . <p> 4 . Write and frame a poem . Spend a month reading and writing poems .

Unfortunately , no one really had any ideas . Apparently , this is a time of burn-out for everyone . <p> I found something this week , however , that worked really well for me . Its a little thing called perspective . <p> I just finished reading a really good book by Karen Kingsbury called Halfway to Forever . Its about two couples facing loss in their lives . In one of the families , the wife has already lost her first husband and daughter and faces losing a second child . In the other family , a couple faces the possibly terminal illness of the wife . I was so moved , nearing the end of the book , because I found myself reflecting on the emotions these families must be facing . <p> I also found myself unable to forget a horrible dream that I had about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been asleep and awoke to remember that Megan , my youngest child , had died every moms worst nightmare . I 've known people who have lost a child or a spouse and Ive always thought that the worst time would have to be the time right after waking . There are those blissful moments between sleep and wakefulness when you do n't  remember where you are or what day it is . Then , reality hits . <p> I 've always thought that those must be the worst moments after losing someone because it must feel like losing them all over again . <p> So , in this dream , I was waking up to the realization that Megan was gone . Then , I starting telling myself , over and over , that it was only a dreambut , in my mind , I knew it was n't . <p> I went downstairs to check on her , the whole way chanting to myself that this was only a dream . But , when I got to her room , she was n't in her bed . Her favorite blanket was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , I realized that it was n't a dream <p> It was so realistic . When I really woke up , the relief I felt was indescribable . God must have known what I needed , because shortly after that , I heard Megan coming up the stairs . I met her with open arms as she climbed into bed with me . I watched her sleep for a long time . I thanked God , literally , every time I looked at her for the two or three days following the dream . Its been about two weeks now and whenever I recall the dream , I still thank God that it was only a horrible nightmare . <p> Megan spent most of the day in bed sick on Monday , so , by the time I went to bed Monday night , I just missed her . I felt like I had n't  seen her all day . Josh , who is still going through his season of needing to be with us , was asleep in our bedroom floor as I was finishing this book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforted that he was there . <p> When I awoke on Tuesday , I had such a feeling of thankfulness and perspective . I do n't  mean that to sound " holier-than-thou " and I know that , even though were thankful for our families , they can still frustrate us to no end and we can still have those " blah " times as homeschooling moms . However , the whole thought process that I 'd been having really changed my outlook on the day . I just wanted to enjoy my kids and let them know how much I love them and how very blessed I feel to be their mom . <p> That feeling set the emotional climate in our home for the rest of the week . Everything did n't  go perfectly as planned and there were moments when the kids were irritable , but there was a joy in being together that changed my outlook , and subsequently the kids outlooks , on everything we did this past week . I pray that we can hold onto that thankfulness and cherish our time together , realizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass all to quickly . <p> " Sons are a heritage from the LORD , children a reward from him . " - Psalm 127:3 <p> What practical tips do you have to offer a homeschooling mom who is feeling uninspired and " unenthused " you know , for those times when you do n't  have a nightmare and an emotionally-charged book to put things into perspective ? ; - ) 148232 @qwx1008232 148230 @qwx1008230 148234 @qwx1008234 <h> Comments <p> When we realize we are having one of " those " days sometimes we just call it off . Go to the library , play musical instruments , clean the house with the music blasting or bake something yummy . Other times we have one of the kids teach something they have heard/read or learned outside of the normal school work . Sometimes , when we cant afford to take off , we just have a 10 minute comedy show . The kids get to tell their favorite jokes , and make us laugh . Or try to . Art is a good way to get back on track and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We looked out the window and noticed the fall colors and decided to go on a walk .

I cant wait to read others ideas . <p> Kris , This is such a great post ! Perspective is where it begins and ends , girlfriend ! We just sat down for our family " Christmas meeting " where we take a look at the things we do each year , what we want to make sure we do again , and what we do n't  have to do this year . As my children begin to leave the nest ( my oldest is a junior ) I want to be sure that I embrace each moment with them ! <p> Take a minute to stop by my blog and leave a comment about your parenting fears ! I might be able to include your thoughts in an upcoming article for ParentLife ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar nightmare recently and woke up in the middle of the night so grateful to see my toddler fast asleep beside me . I must have stayed awake for a couple of hours just watching her sleep and reflecting on what a gift she is . <p> Loss that 's exactly what it feels like waking up to start another day as you always have and being slammed in the heart by the reality that your life is no longer what youve always known ; that you are irrevocably forever changed , but the world marches on as if nothing happened . It is cruel . I know I am not special for having suffered the loss of my mother many have , but that fact does n't  make my loss any less painful . <p> Its been nearly three years now and there are times I still struggle to find Gods plan . Thank you for sharing and I pray that your memories of the nightmare ( they can be so heartbreakingly real ) continue to guide you only towards peace and appreciation of the love that surrounds you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * <p> Website 148236 @qwx1008236 148234 @qwx1008234

@@108017293 @3417293/ <h> 5 Ways to Encourage Kids to Write <p> Kids do n't  always like to write , in fact some kids rather dread it . These kids avoid writing with a passion and drive their poor mom to despair . Here are a few of my favorite gentle ways to encourage kids to write . <p> 1 . Write letters . While some children do n't  enjoy writing reports or essays , they love to write letters to extended family members . Its fun to send the letters and receive a response back . Its also a great way to involve grandparents in the homeschool . <p> Another option is to write a letter to a favorite author . Have your child write about how much the books are enjoyed and what your childs favorite scene is. - Writing to family is an excellent introduction to friendly letters while writing to a favorite author is an introduction to formal business letters . <p> 2 . Write a short book . Writing stories is another great way to encourage kids to write . Your child can write their stories in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but be gentle . Its better to err on the side of too little than to discourage a love of writing . <p> Once the stories are written , have your child carefully copy the stories onto paper and illustrate them . You can do a formal stitched binding or simply staple the books together . Your child has now written their first book . <p> 3 . Write paragraphs on a favorite topic . Some kids love to write stories and others do n't  . If your child believes writing a short story to be the equivalent of torture , have him write a paragraph every day on a topic of his choice . <p> In my case , one of my sons spent a summer studying ants . He followed ants . He examined the anthills . He read about ants . He wrote many , many , many paragraphs about ants all summer . To this day my son still adores ants . <p> 4 . Write and frame a poem . Spend a month reading and writing poems . Some will be bad , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy to read . <p> Pick a favorite poem for your child to copy neatly onto blank paper before illustrating the poem . Make it a fancy as you 'd like . Frame it and proudly display your childs poem prominently in your home . <p> 5 . Keep a journal . Keeping a journal to write about the days events is a great way to encourage kids of all ages to write . Your kids can journal about the birds flying about the yard or stories heard at soccer practice . The weather or even ants can be written about . <p> Encourage your child to take pride in their journal by investing in a high quality book . It will become a treasure to read in future years . <p> Do n't  worry if your child does n't  take quickly to writing . All kids are born with their own gifts , talents , and desires . <p> Do gently encourage your child to write using one of these 5 techniques , and eventually your child will learn to write . 148232 @qwx1008232 148231 @qwx1008231 148235 @qwx1008235 <p> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

You already know that we love salt dough , so I was curious to see how this compared . <p> Its definitely messier to mix and a little hard on the senses ( see note below ) , but it seemed to bake similar to salt dough and it painted well . We had trouble getting one of our thick pieces , a volcano that Josh wanted to make , to bake all the way through , but we had that problem with the salt dough last time , too . One of our thinner pieces broke . Because the piece did n't  seem thin enough to be terribly fragile , I 'm not sure that the sand dough is as sturdy as the salt dough . <p> All in all , though the sand dough would probably work just as well as salt dough for a flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the mess comparison , the ease of access of materials ( its easier for me to pick up flour at the grocery store than to head to a home improvement or hardware store for sand ) and the cost of materials ( sand being a bit more expensive than flour ) , I 'd probably choose salt dough . Sand dough would , however , be a viable alternative . <p> Sand Dough Recipe <p> 4 c. sand <p> 2 c. corn starch <p> 4 teaspoons cream of tartar <p> 3 c. hot water <p> Combine the first three ingredients and whisk together until they are blended well . ( If you 're like me and have issues with the " fingernails on a chalk board " sound , this part will not be pleasant for youits also messy , as sand and corn starch dust wind up everywhere . ) <p> Add three cups hot water and stir . Then , heat over medium heat , stirring until the mixture becomes so stiff that you cant stir any more . ( A good indicator that its done is when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . ) <p> Remove from heat and let cool 15 -20 minutes . When its cool enough to handle , knead a few times .
