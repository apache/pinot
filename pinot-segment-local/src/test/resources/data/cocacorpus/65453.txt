As you brew with care , you continue to honor the hard work of our small-scale farmer partners and join a community of Equal Exchange coffee lovers . <h> The 3 Basic Elements <p> WaterCoffee is 99% water ! Use only the cleanest , freshest water available . It 's best not to use distilled water in which the natural minerals have been removed because coffee interacts with these minerals to naturally enhance the taste . Bottled spring water or filtered tap water is ideal . <p> Water TemperatureThe perfect temperature to brew coffee is between 195- and 205-F . Since many automatic drip brewers average only 850 watts of power , it 's important to make sure that your brewer 's capacity is at least 1,000 watts as this is required to bring the water temperature up to the proper range . When brewing manually with a French press or filter cone , remove your kettle of boiling water from its heat source and let it sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GrindWhen you purchase whole bean coffee , it 's best to grind your coffee right before brewing , although it 's perfectly acceptable to grind your coffee when you buy it . Your goal is to achieve the right grind for the right brewing method : <p> coarse grind for French press brewing <p> medium-coarse grind ( aka. " regular ' ) for automatic drip brewers <p> medium grind for filter cone method <p> fine grind when making espresso <p> You may also purchase Equal Exchange drip grind coffee that has been ground and vacuum-sealed to preserve freshness for automatic drip brewers and filter cones . <p> Coffee-to-Water ratioWhatever method of brewing you use , the general standard is 1-2 Tbsp of coffee for every 6 oz of water . For the French press , use 2 Tbsp per 6 oz of water . Automatic drip brewers , on the other hand , tend to produce a desirable brew when using as little as 1 Tbsp per 6 oz of water . You 'll want to experiment and adjust depending on whether you prefer a stronger or milder brew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quality begins to deteriorate . In the case of the French press , after it 's brewed 3-5 minutes and the coffee grounds have been pushed down to the bottom of the glass vessel , we recommend that you transport the coffee into a thermos , or serve it immediately ; if left in the press , the coffee will continue to brew and become bitter . In general , we recommend that you transfer coffee from any method of brewing into a stainless steel thermos or an insulated carafe to keep it hot for the next cup . <p> Storing Your CoffeeStoring your coffee in an airtight glass or ceramic canister is optimal . Properly stored coffee can stay fresh up to two weeks and should not be refrigerated , nor is it necessary to keep it in the freezer . For maximum freshness , we recommend purchasing only as much coffee as you will consume in a 1 1/2 to 2 week period .

That first whiff of delicious aroma when breaking into a new bag is one of my favorite moments . But freshness is key and coffee 's full awesomeness is fleeting . Here 's how to hold on to the magic as long as possible . <p> I 'll assume you 've gone through the trouble ( or in the case of a Blue Bottle at Home coffee subscription , the ease ) of obtaining quality , fresh roasted , whole coffee beans . The full flavor of coffee begins to reveal itself a few days after it 's roasted , and starts to wane after a couple weeks . There is not much that can be done to extend that complex , fresh flavor far beyond this . The vast majority of what you find stocked on the grocery shelf is already stale and the pre-ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inert gas flushing and other tricks to extend shelf life have only modest impact and are no substitutes for scoring fresh beans . <h> The Do 's <p> The basics are easy : you want to decrease air movement , limit temperature fluctuations , and avoid exposure to light . But there 's more than one way to accomplish these goals . Here are three of my favorites . <h> The Bag It Came In <p> Not all coffee bags are created equal . Some bags look nice , but provide no barrier against the effects of oxygen or the escape of aroma . Bags that are made of coated Kraft paper or that do n't have a firm seal will go stale more quickly . Some bags ( such as those used at Blue Bottle ) use a one-way valve that allows the fresh coffee to off-gas its initial CO2 without bursting the bag and can be resealed . <p> Keeping your beans snug in one of the good resealable bags is a fine way of staying fresh . <h> Jar and Lid <p> This is an easy one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recycled sauce jar , even a plastic gatorade bottle makes a fine receptacle for keeping the coffee beans locked down . And scooping your dose out of a nice , wide-mouth jar is often a bit easier than scooping from a bag . The one caveat is that too much exposure to sunlight is not ideal , but odds are you wo n't be stashing this on your windowsill . <h> A Nifty Contraption <p> There are a number of bean storage devices out there , but the one I find most nifty is the Airscape by Planetary Design . It is simple and unassuming , made of stainless steel , and has a special internal locking lid that let 's you push the air out for a snug fit at any volume . <p> Whatever you use to hold your beans , make sure to keep the container out of direct light , which will help keep the temperature stable . A kitchen cabinet is always a good choice . <h> The Don'ts <p> There are a few things to avoid if you want your beans to taste fresh after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are a number of products on the market for bean storage that look like they belong more on the back pages of Sky Mall than in your kitchen . These often feature some ability to create a vacuum for storing your beans , which often will speed up the staling process by going beyond just removing oxygen and actually drawing oils and aromatics out to the surface of the coffee . It is unlikely that such gizmos will extend the life of your stash any more than a simple jar . <p> Pro tip : if it plugs into a wall outlet , do n't store beans in it . <h> The Fridge <p> A little bit of coolness is probably a good thing , but humidity is not , and our fridges have a lot of moisture in the air . Every time you crack open your stash , humidity will creep in , bringing off flavors with it . So do n't store your beans in the fridge . Your countertop or cupboard is cool enough . <h> The Freezer <p> There is much debate among coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my take : <p> Only consider freezing coffee if you plan on keeping it much longer than a month . For shorter stints , you 're better off just storing it airtight at room temperature . <p> If you freeze , make sure it is in a fully sealed container , without even a one-way valve . <p> When you 're ready to use it , allow it to come to room temperature while still fully sealed to avoid condensation . Once it 's been thawed , do not freeze it again . <h> Out in the Open <p> Once upon a time many of the early retail pioneers in specialty coffee would merchandise their coffee in big open bins , the sight and smell of the beans enticing shoppers to purchase a scoop or two . It 's a much more rare sight now as the principles of quality and freshness have gained ground , but you still see it crop up in older shops or bulk bins . <p> Wide open bags or old cookie jars without snug lids are a common kitchen no-no , as is occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , I 'm guilty of this , too . ) <p> Many grinders have good size hoppers that can hold a lot of beans , but we would suggest only dropping in there what you need for the current brew and keeping the rest safely sealed elsewhere . They 'll just get stale waiting for your grind . <p> Bottom line : Keep your fresh beans in something airtight , cool , and out of direct sunlight ; grind them fresh every time you brew ; and you 'll enjoy your coffee for as long as it lasts . As always , we 're happy to help you with any coffee brewing or storing questions you might have , just drop us a line .

It depends on the amount and type of samples that are sitting on Charlie 's desk . When a sample comes in , I make sure we record them , and then I schedule a cupping with all of our coffee decision-makers . <p> It 's important that we first take a physical look at the coffee . This is my favorite part of the jobjust by looking at the green coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from and their harvesting and processing practices . It tells the story of a coffee . I 'm also looking for any defects that may affect the quality of the coffee . <p> The day before the cupping , I 'll roast the coffee sample , and stick to a very light roast profile to reveal all we need to know about the coffee 's inherent qualities on the cupping table . It 's always fascinating to try a new coffee , and roasting it is part of the process where you start to discover what a coffee 's potential is . <p> Then , we host a sample cupping . We try to make sure everyone attends because important decisions are made at these cuppings . For samples we are unfamiliar with , Charlie and I cup those together and then decide if we want to re-cup with more decision-makers . It 's always exciting to find a delicious coffee in a group of samples when we 're not sure what to expect . <p> My job is to properly arrange the coffees and set up a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision about whether a coffee is right for our menu . <p> It 's very important that cuppers are unbiased in sensory decision-making .

Once we 're done cupping , evaluations are made at the table , and I 'll put together a report of our sensory scores and notes . <p> Charlie follows up with the producers and importers associated with the sample , and sends the report with our sensory feedback . I love this part of the process , because it reminds me of the feedback I was seeking with my coffee from Uganda so long ago . <p> Learn about working and growing with Blue Bottle Coffee on our careers page .

Being a barista was like a dream job for her , but without any prior experience it felt impossible to get started .

A lifetime of working with coffee , analyzing beans , and preparing samples for export made it second nature . Over the years , I 've tried to develop that same skill with roasted coffee . I 've gotten very good at eyeballing a handful of beans that works out to roughly 15 grams " about the right amount for 8 ounces of water . <p> Using a scoop or scale in your regular brewing is a great way to be consistent , but letting your eyes and hands do the work periodically can pay off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an ill-equipped kitchen . Having a confident , tool-independent go-to reference for your coffee-to-water ratio is what separates the padawans from the Jedi knights . <p> On the water side of the equation , things can get trickier . Eyeballing water in an unfamiliar brewer is dicey . The measuring lines on many drip machines do n't often match reality , and stovetop tea kettles do n't usually have affordances for showing volume . <p> All that confidence I had about my properly-measured handful of beans is shaken by the prospect of using too much or too little water . Next thing I know I 'm rooting through someone else 's cupboards like a Wookie in a trash compactor with the walls closing in , desperately looking for measuring cups or some kind of Pyrex thingy . <p> To avoid this spectacle , the one elegant move I 've learned is to use mugs as measures . Years of working as a barista have given me a good skill at guessing the volume of most mugs . I tend to favor mugs in the 6-10 ounce range , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since each of my handfuls of beans corresponds to 8 ounces of water , I 've become handy at eyeballing a 1-cup pour into most any mug , rendering it a suitable measuring cup . When in doubt , I err on the side of brewing a bit too strong , since I can always add hot water after the brew is done . <p> Your grinders and gizmos may still present some challenges , but if you 've got great beans and a decent coffee-to-water ratio , you are already close to making the jump to lightspeed .

All can deliver outsized returns of awe and beauty . <p> Coffee brewing is not this kind of an art . <p> No barista champion , brewer 's cup finalist , supercomputer controlled precision-engineered coffee contraption , or Michelin starred chef is going to add any outsized transcendence to a cup of coffee that you could not also achieve with the same beans and a modest level of meticulousness . Coffee brewing is not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an art where small optimizations can lead to big rewards . The processing of coffee involves so many variables that very small changes can result in startling improvements down the line . Roasting is a craft where attention , nuance , and experience can unlock enormous potential from the bean . In these arenas of coffee , obsession can pay off with transcendence . The whole can often exceed the sum of its parts . The full depths always remain to be plumbed . <p> But once all those steps are done and we arrive at a finished , fresh roasted , whole bean coffee product , coffee brewing is a finite affair " the ceiling of transcendence already established earlier in the chain . No amount of fussing , no fancy " perfect coffee " contraptions , no calibration tools , no deep finesse , will move the bean outside of its now established bounds . Those that claim otherwise are either selling or sipping some snake oil . We often project onto the black box of our beans a potential that is n't really there , chasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point I 'm compelled to add a link to my *Except for Espresso disclaimer . There is a whole world of experience , mastery , and personal point of view that come into play when exploring that brew method . But I will nonetheless posit that espresso 's difficulty is not necessarily correlated to its potential for transcendence . I 've had shots of espresso prepared for me that were so good they felt like miracles , but I would hesitate to declare that the barista had added anything to the experience outside of some exquisitely executed tuning in to what was already there . Coffee is complicated , but coffee brewing does n't need to be . <p> I think we are doing a disservice to coffee when we make brewing out to be more magical than it is . <p> There are many technical improvements that can still be made in delivering a better cup ( especially in a busy commercial setting ) . Grinders could always use more innovation , baristas are often breaking new ground with technique , and the art of delivering exemplary service to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontiers remain . But none of these things should obfuscate the underlying simplicity of brewing . <p> So when I read a major news article or attend a trade show and see more glorification of overly elaborate brew methods , high-tech gizmos , and other misplaced mythologizing ... I find it disheartening . Coffee appreciation , or even full-on coffee connoisseurship , should n't require knowledge of all the esoterica of machinery or all of the minutiae that obsesses us as professionals . The " do n't try this at home " message implicit in so much of this has held back great coffee from taking its rightful place in the American kitchen and left the door wide open for convenient capsule coffee quackery to dominate . My hope is that the tide is turning and coffee pros are ready to demystify much more of our craft and in doing so include our customers more deeply on the pure and easy joys of the finished product .

The impetus was simple . TechnoServe , a non-profit with an agricultural focus , was helping to finance a wet mill . The results , however , were revolutionary , giving the farmers an opportunity to sell their coffee directly to the quality-focused buyers able to pay premiums for cleanly-processed , sweet coffee . Perhaps more profoundly , it was the first opportunity for the world to experience coffee from an area that had been previously ignored .

I got up at 3:45am , drove to the roastery in Oakland ( which at the time was behind Restaurante Dona Tomas in the Temescal ) , loaded my station wagon , hitched up the espresso cart , stopped at the Thrifty Drugs across the street for ice and then white-knuckled it across the bridge , flooring my Peugeot trying to keep up with the flow of traffic . I 'd been in business for a year and a half , but getting in this market was a long-held dream . I wanted to knock people 's socks off with the best coffee they had ever tasted . The market was filled with people like me - strivers , second chancers , delvers - people willing to get up early and work hard to make something extraordinarily delicious without a lot of help or money . I was proud to be one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the espresso tasted good and a lot of people walked away happy . Pleasantly surprised , really . Two o'clock came and trading four cappuccinos for a roast chicken seemed like the best deal I would ever negotiate . Everything was cleaned up and packed up by three thirty , and I pulled back into the roastery just as the sky was starting to darken . More unloading , of course , and more cleaning , but I got home by six and was asleep by seven thirty . It felt like the beginning of something , and it was . <p> I worked that market on Saturday , in more or less the same way , 54 times in a row . I got more help , the markets got busier , and in less than two years I was able to take the occasional Saturday off . The Ferry Plaza market was my graduate school , my gymnasium , my think tank , and my laboratory . It eventually felt like my home town . Dexter and Lulu ran it like it like it stood for something : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best local ingredients mattered . Even though the market was made up of the scrappiest and most undercapitalized farmers and food producers , each Saturday we were greater than the sum of our parts , punching far above our weight and showing much of the country what a high-quality and sustainable food system could look like . <p> The Saturdays added up . The lines grew longer . I hired more people . In 2005 we opened our kiosk in Hayes Valley , in 2008 our first cafe in Mint Plaza , and in 2009 ( another dream ) we opened inside the Ferry Building . We ratcheted up our preparation standards , our training standards , and started flying all over the world in search of great coffee . In 2010 we opened in New York , in 2014 we opened in Los Angeles , and this year , in culmination of yet another dream , we opened in Tokyo . <p> The farmers markets have been such a formative experience for me and Blue Bottle that I ca n't adequately express the gratitude I feel to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dexter , Lulu , and all the volunteers ) , to Ron at Urban Village , to the Berkeley Ecology Center , to all the Blue Bottle hands who have made great drinks outside under challenging circumstances , to all our fellow vendors who have taught us what hard work and dedication is , and to our guests who line up to buy coffee every single week . <p> I was shopping at the market with my family several months ago when I realized that Blue Bottle today was neither scrappy nor under-capitalized . It 's a great feeling , actually . To have a plan and be able to execute it with plenty of long range thinking and no compromises feels luxurious . But the incubator nature of the farmers market is not really about the luxury of ever-increasing preparation standards . It 's not about scaling excellence . It 's about taking a chance on an unknown doing great work and giving that person the opportunity to succeed ( or fail ) in front of some of the most astute and demanding customers in the country . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our coffee has never been more carefully sourced and roasted , we are at the point in our trajectory where our ambitions just do n't fit outside the Ferry Building on Saturdays .

Fortunately , that 's not our style . We are going to celebrate how lucky we are and how far we 've come by donating the entirety of our revenues to all our Markets on our last day . I plan on getting up early and working one more Saturday at the Ferry Plaza on May 30 . I 'll be a little rusty but I hope you can join me.

@@21417395 @1417395/ 64594 @qwx264594 64599 @qwx264599 <h> Happy Tenth Anniversary at the Kiosk ! <p> Ten years ago today we opened our coffee kiosk on 315 Linden Street , which was at the time a pee-smelling dead-end alleyway adjacent to the wrecked Central Freeway . Loring Sagan , the architect who owned the building , more or less dared me to open a coffee cart , thinking that the improbable waits for his coffee at the Ferry Plaza farmers market would shrink to almost nothing , given that the Hayes Valley of 2005 was more sketchy than sought after . It had the uneasy peace of a place people tended to hurry past if they did n't live there or understand the charm , which was , admittedly , not exactly on the surface . <p> The day before we opened , I roasted coffee all day and then met my wife , Caitlin , in Hayes Valley for a takeout dinner and a night of organizing . We had passed all our inspections , but there were some serious details to work out : Where do we put the cups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We bought a dessert to get us through the evening " a disappointingly gritty lemon tart " and finally made it out of there around midnight . <p> My Peugeot station wagon did n't sputter or shudder or rattle on the Bay Bridge ; it just lost all power and glided gently to a stop . I do n't usually think about omens , but as you might imagine , I thought this was a bad one . That my improbable run of luck ( plucky farmers market coffee guys ! ) could be coming to a close . The symbolism of giant semi trucks leering at us , then crushing us , was too obvious to ignore . <p> The tow truck eventually came , of course , and dropped us off at a point precariously located on the Oakland/Emeryville border . We made it home , slept briefly and then back to the alley for opening . <p> And how we opened ! Regulars from the farmers market for whom I had been making drinks since we started on the Ferry Plaza " Jen , Ed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what we were up to . At the end of the day , I was elated to find that we had made slightly over two hundred bucks ! I had a hazy , intuitive idea of the concept of " break even , " and I realized that we were probably not there , but I thought that I would plug away for a while and see how long we could continue to pay our bills . <p> I 'm not sure when it happened , but as the months rolled on , more and more people started showing up . The original three baristas settled into a stride , and we built a business . I was back at the roastery roasting , bagging , and delivering , and I noticed more and more people when I would drop off coffee . People started talking about the odd little coffee cart to their friends . <p> It had to be May of 2005 when , nursing a macchiato after a coffee delivery , I noticed a couple pausing thoughtfully in front of the cart . The gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and murmured , " I really like this place . " His partner turned , somewhat surprised , and responded pointedly : " Why ? " <p> His answer : " I 'm not sure . " <p> Which is as good of a general summation of the ambiguous affection we 've been engendering there for a decade . <p> So there we are . A delightful , improbable run on the alley . Thanks must go to Loring , who helped me dream it up , to all the staff who have made drinks with kindness and professionalism , to our guests who made it a success instead of an interesting short-lived art project . And , of course , to my lovely wife Caitlin and my son Dashiell.

Baristas get 15 minutes with a crush of technical and sensory judges to prepare 12 drinks consisting of sets of espressos , traditional cappuccinos , and a signature beverage of their own creation . In the weird world of high-end specialty coffee , these strange events have gained some prominence . <p> I have mixed feelings about barista competitions . On the one hand , many of my friends and respected colleagues put an enormous amount of time and effort into them . On the other hand , I feel like they often send the wrong messages to consumers . They further underline a common misperception that making a good cup of coffee is a pursuit best left to professionals and serious hobbyists - the don't-try-this-at-home fallacy we rail against at Tonx . On yet another hand ( three hands ? ) , preparing a really good espresso is n't an easy feat to pull off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm just being a grump ? <p> When a friend hit me up to support a new Kickstarter campaign for a barista competition documentary called Drip , I was n't terribly excited . Over the years I 've been to dozens of these events and find it pretty tedious as a spectator sport . But eventually I stumbled across their video in an open browser tab and decided to press play . <p> Hey ! This thing looks like it could be alright . It 's beautifully shot , and I see a few of my favorite coffee nerd folks in there . So I decided to chip in . <p> I asked director Rock Baijnauth a few questions over email about his team 's motivation for making this movie . <p> You did n't originally set out to make the film all about the competition ... What was your original premise ? <p> Originally , I wanted to do a film that would do for coffee what Sideways did for wine . Get people talking about this beverage that I love in a really romantic and poetic way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped us add human interest layer that took the film beyond mere edu-tainment . <p> If you were giving the stereotypical Hollywood elevator pitch for this film it would be <p> Sideways meets Best in Show . It 's full of passionate , quirky , lovable characters that are talking about something they love . <p> In recent years , the trend during routines has moved from baristas talking about their own craft toward talking more about the farmer ( something I welcome ) . How much is being a good storyteller important to winning ? <p> It 's probably as important as the drinks they are presenting even if it 's something unspoken . It 's a competition about being a good presenter as much as it is a competition about making great coffee . You have 15 minutes to captivate the judges . Being a good storyteller is integral to that . <p> Any cringe inducing moments ? <p> Whenever a barista drops something or goes over their allotted time . Your heart kinda sinks for them . You clench your fists and hope they recover as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to get there . <p> With all the baristas having their own soundtracks , does music licensing become a challenge for the film ? <p> It 'll all come down to how it 's edited . In our last documentary , there was a Jay-Z song playing in the background that we got to use under fair use laws . It 's a fascinating piece of law . <p> Am I wrong to be cynical about what these competitions mean to the greater coffee loving public ? <p> I think anytime you can get people having a dialogue about something , regardless what side they are on , you 're doing a good thing . These competitions get people talking . They open up dialogue . They introduce the average person to a world they probably would n't have known about otherwise .

A single origin is beautiful and lovely , but it 's ultimately one-dimensional and lacks depth . A blend is like a gorgeous painting , taking many single origin colors to create a picture that has depth and story . I 'm still not sure if this is insightful or glib eloquence , but I want to find out . <p> I 've had a torrid history with blends . I began what has become a career in coffee at a roasting company that offered more blends than single origin coffees . There was a blend for every mood , every day , and every person " so long as they liked their coffee burnt beyond recognition . The blend was a secret , but the roasters and blendmaster assured us that it was the same all year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A super burnt fish . <p> A couple years later , at a new job , I was the roaster and blendmaster . And I killed the blend . I stopped blending , stopped mixing , stopped scooping a bit of this and little more of that . No more blend . It was all about single origins . The smaller the farm , the smaller the tree , the smaller the bean , the better . If I could n't tell you the astrological sign of the family dog or the type of fruit juice I was offered during my visit , I was n't doing my job properly . <p> And it was pretty great . I got to visit a bunch of coffee producing countries , see the farms producing the best beans in the world , and experience the spectrum of coffee flavors . And through all of this exploration , I got pretty intimate with the varying ways that coffee manifests itself in our cups , and I had the pleasurable task of presenting these to coffee drinkers . I had become an active participant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had much to say about what we think about when we think about coffee . And I enjoyed it . <p> While I believe that there are single origin beans that can hold their own against the majority of blends in the world , it 's impossible to deny that a carefully considered blend of choice coffees can achieve the unachievable . It can pair the brown sugar character of a Guatemala Antigua with the ginger and florals of an Ethiopia Sidamo , the winey character of a Burundi Kayanza with the vanilla notes from a Costa Rica Tarraz+ . <p> One of my favorite hacked-together blends is to take a Colombia coffee , with its syrupy body , flavors of molasses and cherry , and mix it with a bright citrus burst of Kenya Nyeri , with its grapefruit and raisin flavors . On their own , each is delicious , but together they unite like a superhero team , hellbent on destroying your modest notions of what a cup of coffee is capable of , each picking up where the other left off , finishing each others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-crafted team is capable of , and a well-crafted blend is no different . <p> Our first blend was meant to be a mere nod to this , but I 'm afraid we 've outdone ourselves . A floral , citrusy bean ; a sweet , syrupy bean ; a full-bodied , soft-spoken bean , a chocolaty , rich bean . Together , they create a blend so complete , so balanced and complementary , it lacks the edges to deconstruct or even fully understand it . Giving up their multivariate descriptors and assuming the cloak of a cup that is at once the flavor of coffee and unlike any coffee I 've had .
