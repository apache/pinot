Famed impersonator Billy Richards played the Fremont Tavern and the Green Shack in the 1930s , while Gordon Stafford and Francis Russell performed at the notorious Kit Kat Club during World War II . Beginning in the 1950s , such stars as T. C. Jones , Lynne Carter , Jim Bailey , and Craig Russell all brought their revues to Las Vegas . None of these shows , however , played longer than two or three weeks , or became part of Las Vegas entertainment tradition in the way that Lido de Paris , Folies Bergere or Bottoms Up ! did. 1 <h> Kenny Kerr and This is Boy-Lesque <p> Until Friday , May 13 , 1977 when Kenny Kerr debuted This Is Boy-Lesque at the Silver Slippers Gaiety Theatre . Boylesque was different from any of the impersonation revues that had gone through Las Vegas before . The show combined classic impersonation similar to the elegant acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dancing , singing , comedy revue Las Vegas producers adored . While the variety of celebrity female impersonators , flashy costumes , and energetic choreography dazzled audiences , it was always Kerr himself who brought those audiences back . Kerrs routines were not scripted , his repartee was ad-libbed and genuinely funny . Kerr himself sang rather than lip-synching . His ability to put audiences at ease and create an intimate venue out of an ordinary showroom made Boylesque one of the most popular shows in Las Vegas history. 2 <h> Female impersonator vs " male actress " <p> Despite the success of his show , Kerr remained closeted . Kerr referred to himself as a " male actress " not a female impersonator , and as late as 1982 insisted in a Las Vegas Review-Journal interview with A. D. Hopkins that he had " a girlfriend and hopes she will have his child next year . " This attitude initially distanced Kerr from the gay community . The 1970s-80s was still the dark ages for gay people in Las Vegas , particularly in the city 's gaming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in those businesses thennor could those businesses cater to criminals . Nevada 's sodomy law was enforced so that Kerr , and all other gay entertainers and gaming personnel in Las Vegas were de facto criminals . Add common bigotry to the mix and gay people in the business had to be closeted ( Read a 1991 eyewitness account of Boylesque ) . 3 <h> Kenny Kerr in the Community <p> Despite his rocky start , in time Kerr became one of the Las Vegas gay community 's most dependable and outspoken supporters donating his time , talent , and money to community causes . He performed in fundraising benefits for Aid for AIDS of Nevada AFAN , Golden Rainbow , Lighthouse Compassionate Care , and the Gay and Lesbian Community Center . His $1,000 donation to Nevadans for Constitutional Equality toward the repeal of Nevada 's sodomy law in 1993 was the single largest contribution , and Kerr was always available to perform , emcee , or judge at a variety of gay community events , no matter how small . To support gay men and women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Ask , Do n't Tell " policy , Kerr debuted an " Uncle Sam Wants Everyone " number in his show complete with a World War II-style poster of Kerr standing at attention in military drag . In 1997 Kerr received the gay community 's Lifetime Achievement Award at the Gay and Lesbian Community Center 's Honorarium. 4 <p> Even before he was accepted into the Las Vegas gay community , Kerr was embraced by Las Vegas 's straight business and entertainment establishment . This acceptance was reinforced by Kerr 's support of local charities such as Child Haven , the Cancer Society , and the Injured Policemen 's Fund , as well as by his loyal heterosexual fan base . Kerr 's involvement in these circles raised the gay community 's profile and by embracing Kerr , that establishment recognized and began accepting Las Vegas 's gay community. 5 <p> When the Silver Slipper was sold in 1988 , Kerr moved to the Sahara , and over the next two decades bounced among several Las Vegas hotels including the Stardust , the Union Plaza , the Debbie Reynolds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suncoast , and the Sunset Station in Henderson , Nevada . Along the way Kerr has dealt with embezzling employees , bankruptcy , a still-born talk show venture called Vegas Nights , a failed bar called Kenny Kerrs Fantasy , and , in 1997 a near-miss business involvement with Torsten Reineck , owner of the Apollo bath house in Las Vegas , who was later associated with serial killer Andrew Cunanan who murdered fashion designer Gianni Versace. 6 <p> At the time of this writing Kerr has still not found a venue to call home in the way the Silver Slipper once was for him . He travels in and out of the country performing in bistros , cabarets , cruise ships , hotels and showrooms elsewherebut mainly splitting his time between Las Vegas and Palm Springs . He looks back on his 30+ roller-coaster years in Vegas with equanimity. 7 <p> " I 've been fucked over by people I never thought would fuck me over , " Kerr says . " I 'm a survivor .

Fornication ? Sodomy ? <p> The records of the Virginia Court reveal the history of a servant , Thomas or Thomasine Hall , who claimed to be " both a man and a woman , " but who was alleged by neighbors to be a man. ( 1 ) <p> This document is valuable for the study of the historically specific reaction to sexual ambiguity ( in this case , perhaps a physical ambiguity , certainly a mental one ) . The recorded testimony leaves it unclear whether Hall was actually physically hermaphroditic , or was a biological male who had long dressed and worked as a female and had come to consider him/herself male and female . <p> Whatever Hall 's physiological character , the documents reveal a three-way competition to define Hall 's sexuality : by Hall him/herself ; by the general populace ; and by the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case , officially pronounced Hall " a man and a woman , " and required him/her to wear items of each sex 's clothing-thereby accepting " man " and " woman " as non-exclusive categories . This resolution was congruent with the relative lack of official stress placed on sexual differentiation in this era when both men and women necessarily did many of the same kinds of work. ( 2 ) Later , in the 1800s , the rigidification of and absolute opposition between the categories " male " and " female , " and the different kinds of work performed by each , would make such a resolution unlikely : Sexual ambiguity ( physical or mental ) would then be resolved by categorizing an individual as either " male " or " female . " ( 2 ) <p> Hall 's Testimony <p> In testimony before the Virginia Court in 1629 , Hall told of being " born at or near Newcastle Upon Tyne .

Returning from military duty to Plymouth , England , Hall again " changed himself into woman 's apparel and made bone lace and did other work with his needle . " Shortly afterward , Hall once more changed " his apparel into the habit of a man and so came over into this country .

Hall 's phrase seems akin to the modern , slang , heterosexual male expression " To get a piece of pussy . " Hall apparently meant that she dressed as a woman in order to obtain sexual access to a man . <p> Hall 's response to Captain Basse did not satisfy Virginians . Francis England further testified that he and Roger Rodes were alone with Hall after hearing the rumors that Hall was a man .

The original document , which is mutilated here , suggests that Basse inspected Hall and discovered " a piece of flesh growing at the section missing belly as big as the top of his little finger an inch long .

Severus son , Caracalla was a ruthless tyrant , succeeding his father along with his brother Geta . The cleverly ruthless Caracalla killed the equally ruthless but clumsier Geta .

While this act seems appealing to modern sensibilities , it seems to have simply been a brazen ploy to increase tax revenues . Caracalla was killed by his soldiers in a plot , and the usurper Marcrinus ( of commoner descent ) took the throne for a brief period . The emergence of the military as the only legitimate source of power and the weakening of Roman tradition both became especially present in the Severan era and help us understand the context of Elagabalus brief reign . <p> Marcrinus welcome was quickly worn out when he attempted to reform the pay of the Roman legions to assist the solvency of the Empire . His attempted fiscal reforms angered the soldiers who , after overthrowing Caracalla , now missed that Emperors generous ways . The atmosphere all over Rome became very tense .

Vestals chastity was very important to Roman religious practice and the punishment for violating chastity used to be execution by live burial . This marriage was thus an unprecedented violation akin to desecrating the Eucharist for observant Roman Catholics . Furthermore Elagabalus arranged a marriage between her deity El Gabal and Urania the goddess most worshiped in Carthage , which was the most ancient and hated enemy of Rome . In order to participate in her administration and gain Imperial favor , senators and other Roman dignitaries were forced to dress in un-Roman ways and to participate in elaborate sacrifices and other ceremonies . <p> The topic of Elagabalus genitalia comes up frequently . One way Greeks and Romans distinguished themselves from the near Eastern civilizations was that they did not practice and abhorred circumcision . The ancient sources claim that Elagabalus was circumcised as part of the requirements for the priestly profession and the later Historia Augusta even claims that her penis was infibulated ( meaning that the head of the penis was divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was one of Elagabalus fondest desires , not out of religion but out of " effeminacy . " This last statement seems to very strongly indicate a condition that would today be called transsexualism . <p> The only symbols of Elagabalus reign that survive are precious metal coins and a very few examples of statuary . Many of the coins do indeed show the religious changes : displaying the meteoric stone of El Gabal and calling for that deitys blessings . The statuary on the other hand shows a young man with hair cut in classic Roman style and thus seems designed to placate those of traditional feelings as it showed the young ruler as being similar in appearance to Caracalla and other Roman emperors . Some historians use this lack of archeological evidence to claim that Elagabalus cross gender behavior was greatly exaggerated or even simply made up to smear her . I think it is just as plausible that the fact that only gender normative visual records of Elagabalus survive shows that her sexual and gender variance was disapproved of and often hidden and can lead one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values were preserved , while evidence of cross gender behavior was effaced . As Elagabalus standing decreased in the eyes of powerful Romans , she was forced to adopt her cousin Severus Alexander as a " son " and successor . Alexander was only four years younger ! Meticulous care was taken to ensure that this boy was not corrupted by his eccentric cousin and was instead carefully reared according to the most conservative Greco-Roman values . Understanding quickly that Alexander was a threat , Elagabalus sought to remove him but the ploy failed and when coming to appear before the camp of the Praetorian guards , Elagabalus was murdered along with her mother . Their mutilated bodies were carried through the streets and then thrown into the Tiber as if to wash away the upset that came upon the Roman world . <h> Legacy <p> After Elagabalus reign , women were never allowed to enter the building where the Senate was convened . Her establishment of a " womens senate " was considered one of the many examples of Elagabalus depravity . The fact that women like her grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also condemned by writers with deep patriarchal values . Care was taken to erase Elagabalus from the historical record like other Roman emperors that were considered tyrants in a process called damnatio memoriae . Elagabalus was used by subsequent historians , Roman and post-Roman , as an example of one of the worst rulers ever . <p> Transgender behavior existed in Rome before and after Elagabalus . Transgender practice was tolerated and even sometimes respected by the Roman populace when it was practiced by the male-born priestesses of Cybele , known as the Gallae . These women would celebrate a taurobolium which ( originally meant to be the castration of a bull ) was a castration ceremony where someone formally defined as male would lose their genitalia , bleed like in menstruation or childbirth , and then subsequently wear womens clothing and go by female names . Like other cultural practices this was a highly ritualistic and mystical understanding of gender identity . Rome was a vast empire and culturally diverse empire and in some respects it can be said a marketplace of religions existed . A male-born person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local Gallae temple to Cybele and have herself castrated , both to please her goddess and also perhaps to fix a deep inadequate feeling toward her own anatomy . <p> The Gallae however , existed somewhat on the periphery of Roman society . While Roman polytheism greatly revered the Goddess Cybele as a very important goddess , her worship was not considered Roman and was not integrated with traditional Roman practice . For a brief span that did n't  exceed four years , however , a radical transgender and religious experiment was imposed on the Roman world by a passionate young person known as Elagabalus . It is a mistake to suppose that Elagabalus had goals akin to contemporary understandings of feminism and gender theory : Elagabalus was a product of her own time and place and the social structures in force at the time ensured her rise to power . Transgender people and phenomena have always existed but for once a person of strong gender variance caused a deep upset in an ancient culture .

His close-cut black hair is slicked to the right , and he pushes his thick wire-rimmed glasses over the ridge of his nose . It is the year 1948 , and Hart has just received his master 's degree in public health from Yale University . Disciplined , ambitioned , and determined Alan L. Hart will continue to pursue his medical career and literary creative outlets . He will remain with his wife who he married five years prior for the rest of his life . He will make massive contributions in the research of Tuberculosis . He will complete four novels . However , all the while , he will conceal that at birth , Alan was deemed female , with the name Alberta Lucille Hart inscribed on his birth certificate . At age 27 , Hart began living as a man . Yet his female past would follow him throughout the remainder of his life . With every discovery , or run-in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs , and begin a life again . <p> Alan was born Alberta Lucille Hart in October of 1890 to parents , Edna and Albert Hart in Kansas . Due to a typhoid breakout , his father died in 1892 . Alan 's mother then relocated the two of them back to Oregon , where her family lived . As Alan grew up , it became obvious that he was not interested in girlish things whatsoever . He hated to perform domestic work . He preferred to play Civil War games and was said to have had a passion for pocket-knives and chopping wood . He was interested in sports such as football , rowing , hunting tennis , and hiking ( Boag 9 ) . Alan 's role model from an early age was his grandfather , whom he would follow around and listen to while he talked about agriculture and politics . In the introduction to his book , Re-dressing America 's Frontier , historian Peter Boag states that Hart , " always regarded herself as a boy , she early claimed that she would be one if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wear trousers " ( Boag 10 ) . Indeed , Alan never identified with his gender assignment of female . <p> Upon entering high school Alan was teased for his looks and awkward demeanor in his performance as female , further reinforcing his firm awareness of his true gender identity . To avoid social situations , Alan became an avid student and totally engrossed himself in his studies . This paid off . He graduated top of his class in 1908 . It was during these years that his attraction to females and not males became obvious to him as well . He attended Albany College ( now known as Lewis &amp; Clark College ) for two years and in 1910 , moved to California where he attended Stanford University . Here , Alan began to don masculine attire and never turned back . He frequented the Tenderloin District in San Francisco and experienced nightlife and romance . This was a serious period of self-realization and growth for Hart personally , socially , and sexually . Still perceived as female , however , his presentation of masculinity led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical College in 1913 . As in high school , this led to a similar outcome ; due to alienation from fellow students Hart again put all his energies into his studies and graduated top of his class in 1917 . All the while Hart had been involved in a series of love affairs and relationships with women , ranging from friendships to romances . <p> During his medical studies he began personal research on his sexual and gender identity . He sought out the professional help of a physician named Allen Gilbert . With Gilbert 's help , Hart seriously began his transition into living life solely as a man , both physically and sartorially ( Boag 12 ) . In 1917 Gilbert removed Hart 's uterus . At this point in history , a hysterectomy was seen as a full-sex change , which speaks to how gender was perceived medically . The removal of the female reproductive organs deemed Alan medically male . Hart also changed his name to Alan and permanently changed his wardrobe , which led him to pass as male full-time . Hart 's past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him throughout his life and career , leading him to live a life that was wrought with fear and inherent difficulties . <p> The first time Hart had to relocate and resign from a position happened in the same year of his surgery , 1917 . He was appointed at a hospital in Portland as a male but when there was recognized by a former classmate from Stanford , Alan felt he had no option but to resign . It was never made specifically clear that his gender identity was the reason , but Hart continued to move and hold various positions of work all over the West and Southwest . Historians attribute these moves and continual job changes to his " sex-change " . <p> Hart had been writing memoir-based fiction since high school , and was first published in 1935 for his book titled Doctor Mallory . All of his novels , Doctor Mallory included , are rooted in social issues in the medical field and also pertained to Hart 's personal experiences therein . One of his characters , named Sandy Farquhar , is very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiologist . Hart stated , " Sandy Farquhar went into radiology because he thought it would n't matter so much in a laboratory what a man 's personality was . But wherever he went , scandal followed him sooner or later . If he could have gone in for himself , I think he might have succeeded in the face of all odds for he was a grand man with sick people . But he had no capital and so had to work for other doctors or hospitals all his life . That ruined his chances because eventually his story would get around and then he 'd be forced to leave . ' Resigning by request ' was the way he put it " ( Booth 1 ) . Through Hart 's fiction writing , the experiences of his life and what he faced as a transgender individual are made clear . <p> However , perhaps unlike his fictional character in Doctor Mallory , Hart was very successful . He and his wife lived happily together for 37 years . Hart was a pioneer in the research of tuberculosis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut ( Booth 2 ) . He was a successful doctor who also tackled and approached the social issues of medicine and American culture . In 1935 Hart wrote , " The ugly things that have grown up in medicine are the result of the ugliness and falsity of society as a whole , of our American preoccupation with success and making money , of our concentration of effort on the production of things rather than their use for a fuller human life " ( Booth 2 ) . He died in 1962 from heart failure . Hart 's struggles as a transgender person led him to be a successful doctor , social critic , and husband , and he deserves to be remembered as such .

As per marriage , as per sexual practices , as per the rearing of children , etc . In this kind of work there may be women to emerge who will be able to formulate a new and possible concept that homosexual persecution and condemnation has at its roots not only social ignorance , but a philosophically active anti-feminist dogma .

She was deeply involved with several social justice movements in the United States . Her work created spaces for uncomfortable conversations on issues of racism , sexism , sexuality and class . <p> Lorde was born in Depression-era Harlem on February 18 , 1934 . Her mother was from Barbados and her father from Carriacou in the Grenadines . She was the third child born to Linda Belmar Lorde and Frederick Byron Lorde . Lorde was awkward as a child , being nearly blind and chubby . The darkest child of a disciplinarian mother who could pass as white , she was the most headstrong of the three sisters . These factors along with her Caribbean mothers musings of " home " being elsewhere began to stir feelings of not belonging . <p> Lorde began writing poetry at age twelve . She was inspired by poets such as Keats , Edna St. Vincent Millay and Helene Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a public school for intellectually gifted girls , she worked on the school newspaper and published her first poem , " Spring , " in Seventeen Magazine in 1951 .

Her homo-erotic feelings began to emerge during her teenage years , through various crushes on female peers and teachers . <p> After graduation from high school , Lorde left her parents home and attended Hunter College . She surrounded herself with leftist thinkers and lesbian friends . She found an opportunity for literary expression at the Harlem Writers Guild . However , she found it difficult to merge these worlds , not having gained a strong sense of her place in them . In 1953 , Lorde became greatly politicized by the trial and subsequent execution of a friends parents , Julius and Ethel Rosenberg . Again , she was an outsider among homophobic leftists .

For the first time , she found a sense of herself as belonging , and in 1954 she returned to New York with a new voice . Lorde graduated from Hunter College , attended Columbia University , and found work as a librarian . <p> With a new fervor , Lorde explored her sexuality . She simultaneously maintained lesbian and bisexual identities , being neither butch nor femme . She was an outsider among other Black women , with her Afro and different style of dress . This added to the weight of her intersecting identities that made finding her place in a single community difficult . <p> A self-identified lesbian , Lorde entered into an interracial marriage with Edwin Rollins in 1962 . Theirs was an unconventional marriage with extra-marital pursuits . They had two children between 1963 and 1964 . Lorde began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March on Washingtonin 1963 . Several of her poems were also published that year , including " Now That I Am Forever With Child . " In 1964 she was included in an anthology , New Negro Poets , USA , edited by Langston Hughes . In 1968 Lorde began a teaching career after she earned a position as poet-in-residence at Tougaloo College . At Tougaloo , she inspired and molded a new generation of Black militant poets . This experience also fueled her own writing and lesbian identity . While at Tougaloo she fell in love with a woman , Frances Clayton , with whom Lorde and her children built a family life . This relationship facilitated the end of her troubled marriage . Her first collection , The First Cities ( 1968 ) , was published while she was at Tougaloo and received generous reviews . <p> As a lecturer in 1970 , Lorde engaged diverse student bodies on the interlocking identities of class , race , and gender , with history and culture .

But , seeking greater inclusion into Black literary circles , she deleted an overtly lesbian-identified poem from her third collection , From a LandWhereOther PeopleLive ( 1973 ) . This collection marked Lordes literary engagement as overtly politically radical . As she moved through feminist circles , she forged supportive friendships with other feminist writers , such as Adrienne Rich and Sonia Sanchez . Soon she became an icon on the feminist circuit , invited to speak and lecture . In 1973 , she publicly came out by reading " Love Poem , " the poem she had deleted from her third book . Her fourth collection , New York Head Shop and Museum ( 1974 ) , illuminated her increasing anger toward social inequality . <p> In search of ethnic roots , Lorde traveled to the Caribbean and West Africa many times throughout her life . She returned from Africa with a stronger persona embodying the " mother warrior " within her .

As Lordes fame grew , so did the demand for her to come and speak , in the U.S and abroad . Her international travels helped to clarify her theories on intersecting identities and difference , adding geographic location to the conditions that determine experiences of oppression . In 1977 , Lorde took the position of poetry editor for Chrysalis , a feminist quarterly publication . As editor , she provided strong criticisms for her feminist peers , expecting that they speak the totality of their lives . In a 1977 speech , " The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action , " Lorde revealed that she had experienced a cancer scare , during which she found her strength in other women . She also illuminated and critiqued racism and homophobia in the feminist movement , calling attention to internalized racism as well .

Just as with her established identities , the identity of " cancer survivor " injected a new perspective into her work and a sense of immediacy . She placed greater emphasis on speaking out on her theory of difference . In her pivotal essay " The Masters Tools Will Never Dismantle the Masters House , " Lorde attacked racist white feminism : " If white american feminist theory need not deal with the differences between us , and the resulting difference in our oppressions , then how do you deal with the fact that the women who clean your houses and tend your children while you attend conferences on feminist theory are , for the most part , poor women and women of color ?

This collective nurtured the voices of women of color . Engaging her own " erotic , " Lorde told her own story through the autobiographical Zami : A New Spelling of My Name ( 1982 ) . Zami and Sister Outsider ( 1984 ) , a collection of essays , dealt with issues of sexism , sexuality and racism . <p> During these later years , Lordes international prominence grew .

I wrote the latter in the style suitable for the scientific investigators to whom my Autobiography was addressed . In the Autobiography I was almost exclusively occupied with a frank exposition of what life meant to me personally . In the two later works I have been chiefly occupied with characters with whom I associated intimately in the Underworld and who , almost exclusively , belonged to the so-called " vicious tenth .

Providence has determined as my peculiar literary field the " Underworld . " I have been fated to explore it in many cities , as no other writer has . I have thought it worth the attention of the leaders of thought to become acquainted with the results of my unparalleled explorations . <p> The reasons that I explored the Underworld so extensively , and , for the six years of my physical prime ( age nineteen to twenty-five ) , took as my bosom friends prostitutes , " fairies , " burglars , gunmen and other atavics were not because I was morally depraved . Mother Nature caused me always to be a " goody-goody . " I could not help being so . I deserve neither praise nor blame .

Having been for years in New Yorks Underworld I was curious to explore the Underworlds of other large cities where I have sojourned . And if my sojourn happened to be long enough I plied my instinctive avocation in the Underworlds of the cities visited . <p> My method of composition in the case of the second and third members of the trilogy is primarily the sub-conscious . My conscious personality is the mere scribe or typist . My conscious self merely writes down what is inwardly dictated by my subliminal self . While writing one line of the primary scribbling I am in general entirely ignorant of what the content of the next line will be . <p> It is probably , to a large extent a case of subconscious memory . The psychological laws of association bring into the stream of consciousness memories of perceptions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered my head for a score of years . All that I , without any effort or act of volition , set down on paper springs out of my life experience . If providence had not vouchsafed my unusually checkered and adventurous life I would have been unable to write books , no matter how I had perfected myself in English composition . <p> But after the crude outpourings of subconscious memory have been scribbled down my training in English composition comes into play . I consciously reflect upon and seek to improve every phrase that I hope some day will be published . <p> It was otherwise in writing my Autobiography of an Androgyne . Then it was a matter of sometimes having to cudgel my brain to get a book out of it . But my writing that first book a score of years ago seems to have made the composition of books second nature .

But there exists this difference from Stevensons dual personality : Instinct even transformed me occasionally into an Actual personality other than my every-day self and into a feminine personality , whereas I lived out my everyday life as a male .

Only my experiences while impersonating a female are of as yet an unheard-of character to the vast majority of readers .

@@107290549 @2690549/ <h> Carlett Brown : The Extreme Marginalization of Transwomen of Color <p> By Katie Bruno <p> Christine Jorgensen embodies the idea of American transgender history in the 1950s but there were transpeople unnoticed by the majority population possibly because of lack of publicity for certain matters of marginalization . Very few know the story of Carlett Angialee Brown , who was a 26 year old " shake dancer " and U.S. Navy veteran earning $10-15 a night in nightclubs wanting to become a biological woman . When white faces have been on the front covers of magazines and newspapers it is difficult to find the news on people of color . This is particularly true with further marginalized groups like transgender people of color and it becomes difficult to find any records of their lives . Many transpeople are documented by articles on their arrests , with a lack of attention on their gender identity and who they are as individuals . The lives of many transgender people from the 1950s and 1960s are mostly seen as a record of arrests and comments on their " deviant " dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avon Wilson , and Delissa Newton . These womens stories are marginalized greatly and their stories are barely mentioned compared to white transwomen like Christine Jorgenson , who became a media sensation . In the 1950s , the idea of crossing gender lines was seen as very deviant . However , when there are white transwomen why do we not also see transpeople of color in the news ? When Carlett Brown tried getting her surgery from male to female she faced many challenges like citizenship , access to proper and affordable surgery , and arrest . The experiences of transwomen of color were a result of their occupation of several marginalized categories and that leads to challenges in their lives . Carlett Brown was a black transwoman who only wanted to get sex reassignment surgery and marry the man she loved . <p> Carlett had a strong desire to become a woman . From physical exams Carlett Brown was found to be intersex , but instead of removing the feminine characteristics , Carlett wanted to have sex reassignment surgery in order to become fully female . Carlett faced great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One major issue was revoking her rights of citizenship in order to get her sex reassignment surgery , SRS . Carlett found that she could get the proper surgery she wanted but it was not possible for her to get it in the United States . Carlett would have to travel to Denmark or Germany to get such a surgery . When Carlett was selling her blood for five dollars a pint to pay for food and rent , it seems unimaginable that she could afford these costly procedures for hormone treatment and SRS . In Denmark there was also the issue of who the surgery was offered to . Carlett was planning on getting her surgery done by Christine Jorgensons SRS doctor in Denmark . However , Denmark only offered their sex reassignment surgery to Danish nationals . Carlett told Jet Magazine , " I just want to come a woman as quickly as possible , that 's all . I 'll become a citizen of any where I can receive that treatment I need and be operated on " 1 . This was in reference to becoming a citizen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizenship in the United States in order to get her surgery . Carlett was more than eager to do such a thing . Carlett was in love and ready to marry a Sergeant in the United States military , Eugene Martin , who was stationed in Germany2 . The two of them had known each other since they were children and had been corresponding with one another while Sgt. Martin had been overseas for 2 + years . Carletts sex reassignment surgery and legally becoming a woman would give her access to a partnership with Sgt. Martin . Carlett told Jet Magazine , " I regret leaving the United States , but after the Christine Jorgenson affair , the United States refuses to give an American citizen permission to alter his sex . I want to become a woman as quickly as possible so I can marry old man Sgt. Eugene Martin of Weareham , Mass , who is now stationed in Frankfort , Germany " 3 . Carletts decision to give up her rights of citizenship raises an interesting point of identity . Carlett giving up her identity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shows that her gender identity was far more to her important than her citizenship and country . In the June 25th article of Jet Magazine Carlett is seen shopping for her wedding dress in a department store in Boston . Brown was ejected from the store by the police after the workers in the store witnessed Brown shopping . Browns plans to leave the United States for her surgery were interrupted when the U.S. government would not let Brown leave the States because of back taxes she still owed . She faced a lot of issues with getting her sex reassignment surgery and a lot of the outcome is still not known from documentation . However , the importance of it to her is shown through what she was willing to give up for it . <p> The sections about Carletts impending surgery and marriage were minimized in the article . The articles on Carlett are no more than half to a page long about her invading the space of women . The articles talk about the shock of Carlett wearing what are deemed " womens clothes " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . These are still common reactions for transpeople to face today . The lives of transpeople are turned into a spectacle , almost a display for others to watch and be fascinated by . Then the transpeople are told they are deviant and occupying the wrong space and are taken away to jail . This happened to Carlett Brown but Carlett was unable to pay her five dollar bail that was set . Carlett could barely pay for her food and rent . When people of color tend to be so excluded and marginalized in terms of opportunity and employment , particularly in the 1950s prior to the achievements of the Civil Rights Movement , they are left without many options on how to live . Carlett was a shake dancer who sold her blood in order to live . So when she was arrested for the " crimes " of being a transperson and occupying the space that was said to be for biological females she was unable to pay for the costs and her manager paid for her4 . Barely having money to pay for food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassignment surgery , showing just how important Carletts sexual identity was to her . However , the last known Jet Magazine article on Carlett indicated her taking a job at a fraternity house as a cook , where Carlett would accept bookings at night clubs during the evenings in order to pay about $1,200 in back taxes to the U.S. government before being able to leave the U.S. for her surgery5 . Unfortunately information on Carletts life after this article are not known so it is difficult to know if Carlett did end up leaving the United States and receive her sex reassignment surgery . <p> In the end it seems as though all Carlett wanted was to be able to get her sex reassignment surgery and be with the man that she loved . The inaccessibility of surgeries for all transpeople of this time in the United States was debilitating for a lot of people , to not be who they felt they were .

" Because of Jet Magazine , Carletts story can still be found , but it is difficult to say if Carlett was able to pay off her back taxes and make it to Europe for her SRS and to be reunited with Sgt.

Kennedy was famous for his vivid , and some might say almost compulsive , heterosexuality . But straight men can have a gay side , and JFKs life was filled with prominent gay men . At least one of them , Kirk LeMoyne " Lem " Billings , was one of Jacks body men and lived part-time in the White House . Billings was so much a part of the extended Kennedy clan that he was regularly included in family gatherings , and Attorney General Robert " Bobby " Kennedy named his son Michael LeMoyne Kennedy . <p> This queer perspective is not readily visible in President Kennedys official history .

The Everard is not one of those new bathhouses in tune with the spirit of gay liberation . It has no amenities . There are no pleasant lounges for sitting around and socializing ; there 's no entertainment to bring men together in easy camaraderie . The place is grungy , and its patrons get right to the pointwhich , of course , is sex . <p> The Everard does have an old portable television . It 's plopped on a table in a corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool so uninviting that , in all my visits to the Everard , I 've never seen someone take a dip in it . Tonight , when I wander through , I notice a crowd standing around the TV , raptly attentive to , of all things , a news report . As I walk over to see what the attraction is , I overhear a series of sharp , angry comments . These guys are pissed . A reporter is describing events in Dade County , Fla. , where someone named Anita Bryant is waging a campaign against a gay-rights ordinance . Whenever her smiling face and coiffed hair flash across the screen , a new round of curses spews from the mouths of these towel-wrapped men . <p> The scene arouses my activist sensibilities . I remember thinking : If politics has entered the basement of The Everard , gay liberation has reached much farther than I thought ! <p> No event in queer history enjoys a higher reputation than Stonewall . The 1969 riots are celebrated every year with scores of parades and marches in dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorthand for militancy , resistance , and pride . Yet its power has been as a symbol . We commemorate Stonewall after the fact . Not many people experienced it directly , and not many more read about it as news . <p> By contrast , the 1977 campaign to repeal the gay rights statute in Dade County , Florida involved huge numbers of people . It was a local event with a national reach , a story with legs . Newspapers and television covered it for months , the first time this was true for a " gay rights " story . The battle in Dade County , home to the city of Miami , did more to build a national lesbian and gay movement than any other single event . It reached deep into cities and towns around the United States , leaving local communities stronger and better organized . It created a vibrant sense of participating in a common project , a feeling of shared danger . <p> The Dade County saga began simply enough . In January 1977 the county 's board of commissioners voted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story might have ended there , as it had in a couple of dozen other cities that had passed non-discrimination ordinances , except for one resident of the county who attended the final hearing . Bryant , a popular singer who had once been a runner up in the Miss America pageant , was outraged by the county board 's action . A born-again Christian , she testified with Bible in hand , and afterward she vowed to fight the ordinance . She and her husband , Bob Green , founded an organization , Save Our Children , to lead a campaign for a ballot initiative to repeal the gay rights law . <p> Bryant 's celebrity statusshe 'd had gold records ; she toured with Bob Hope and performed at military bases ; and she was under contract with the Florida Citrus Commission to promote the sale of the state 's orange juiceguaranteed media attention for this county commotion . She gave journalists plenty of good quotes . The sentiments that poured from her mouth were inflammatory . At the county commission hearing on the anti-discrimination statute , Bryant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abomination ... Homosexuals will recruit our children ... They will use money , drugs , alcohol , any means to get what they want . " <p> Bryant sounded this theme of recruitment again and again . On a trip to Chicago to appear on the nationally televised The Phil Donahue Show , she told the Tribune : " Children are very easily persuaded ... a homosexual is not born , they are made . So there has to be some recruitment . " <p> By the time voters in South Florida headed to the polls in June , Bryant 's statements had become apocalyptic . " We will prevail , " she informed a roomful of supporters and journalists , " against a life style that is both perverse and dangerous to the sanctity of the family , dangerous to our children , dangerous to our freedom of religion and freedom of choice , dangerous to our survival as one nation , under God .

When Ovidio Ramos , a spokesperson for the Latin Committee for the Human Rights of Gays , took part in a call-in program on Spanish-language radio , the calls were so hateful and threatening that a depressed Ramos committed suicide a few days later . When another activist , Manuel Gomez , appeared on a Spanish-language television show , his car was firebombed . Later , after Gomez addressed a rally in the heart of the Cuban community , he was assaulted and left for dead in an alley . So many angry calls came to the Dade County gay coalition that police began to provide its offices with round-the-clock protection . <p> But the campaign did n't just mobilize the homophobes . It galvanized gay men and lesbians around the country . After gay bars in Miami posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The Advocate issued a call for a national boycott of Florida citrus products . By March , the boycott had spread not only to big cities like Boston and Dallas , but to Idaho 's only gay bar .

The national council of the Metropolitan Community Church passed a resolution encouraging its congregants to support the fight for gay rights in south Florida . Contributions from almost every state arrived at the office of the Dade County gay coalition . Activists traveled to Florida to help in voter education campaigns .

Up to 100,000 were involved , they claimed . The industry not only photographed and filmed children , but also sold their sexual services to adult men . The menace was near at hand . " Chicago is the headquarters of a nationwide ring trafficking in young boys , " they wrote . " A nationwide homosexual ring with headquarters in Chicago has been trafficking in young boys , sending them across the nation to serve clients willing to pay hundreds of dollars for their services .

" Another described what happened as " a crime worse than murder . " <p> The series put the gay community in a difficult spot . To attack the Tribune risked sounding like a defender of child sex abuse . Yet the reporting was irresponsible and unbalanced , and the claims stretched credibility . The paper purported to expose the sexual exploitation of children , yet in the whole series only five short paragraphs mentioned young girls . The writers claimed to have spent three months investigating an industry that exploited tens of thousands ; they said Chicago was a major center of it ; and they cooperated closely with police . Why then could the police only find two fourteen year old " victims " ? <p> Over and over , the series fingered the city 's gay men as the source of the danger .

How did he manage all this , one wondered ? <p> But sex panics do n't require believability . The Tribune had set hysteria in motion . Alderman Ed Burke conducted public hearings . Governor Thompson appointed a state task force on child pornography . The U.S. Attorney opened an investigation and the Cook County state attorney convened a grand jury .

At a march in New Town , according to one report , " the gay community 's anger at the Tribune series boiled over .

Gay men and lesbians descended on the Medinah Temple , located at Wabash and Ohio , to protest the singer 's appearance . Marchers six abreast circled the building , as a large contingent of police looked on . " Anita is McCarthy in drag , " one placard proclaimed . " God drinks wine , not orange juice , " said another . Afterward , a large contingent marched over to Pioneer Court and the Tribune building , to chants of " Boycott the Tribune .

Share your research about a place , a person , an event , an organization : if its about LGBT history , about men who loved men and women who loved women , or about people who crossed gender identities , we want to know . <p> The value of recovering LGBT U.S. history is illustrated by a number of striking examples . <p> 1 . The historians ' brief in Lawrence v. Texas , and the historical evidence and arguments presented , played a major role in the U.S. Supreme Court 's 2003 decision that sodomy laws were unconstitutional . Likewise , historians briefs in Obergefell v. Hodges played an influential role in the Supreme Courts 2015 ruling that bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional . <p> 2 .

His historical research brought out veterans whose organizing led to the gays-in-the-military debates of 1993 , and , finally , to the end of the U.S. military 's anti-homosexual policy in 2011 . <p> 3 . After California passed the FAIR Education Act in 2011 , requiring the teaching of LGBT history in public schools , both supporters and opponents recognized the action as profoundly important . Teach LGBT history widely , each side knew , and the consequences for the future will be immense . <p> 4 . In 2014 the U.S. National Park Service launched an " LGBT Heritage Initiative " to identify sites associated with LGBT U.S. history . This theme study will provide a preservation roadmap for both National Historic Landmarks and the National Register of Historic Places . <p> 5 .

All Americans are now called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013 re-inaugural speech : the moral principle all are created equal " guides us still ; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall . " <p> 6 . In 1957 Franklin Kameny , because of his homosexuality , was dismissed from his job as an astronomer in the U.S. Army 's Map Service . This lead , in the 1960s , to Kameny 's spearheading a new militancy in the homosexual rights movement . LGBT activists in Washington , D.C. have used Kameny 's history to win recognition of his work from major institutions -- the Library of Congress and Smithsonian , among them . These history activists also extracted a formal apology from the federal government for the wrongs done Kameny . <p> 7 . The discovery that attorney John William Sterling lived with , slept with , and maintained an intimate relationship with James Orville Bloss for more than forty years revealed a new side of Yale University 's early major donor , whose name adorns Sterling Library and many Yale institutions . The revelation of this previously unknown history is playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present Shearman Sterling law firm . <p> 8 . One of the earliest modern examples of substantial research on LGBT history began for a documentary play compiled and written by Jonathan Ned Katz , and produced by the Gay Activists Alliance , in New York , in 1972 . So the work of recovering LGBT peoples ' past arose directly out of the modern gay liberation movement . The recovery of LGBT history remains today an important form of public service , education , and activism . <p> Despite the above examples the history of LGBT people remains unknown to most Americans , including most LGBT people . This continued marginalization is unfortunate because LGBT history has the power to inspire and change people , whatever their identity or outlook . Histories of people in the past open hearts and minds . <p> Knowing about past persecution is a goad to present activism . Knowing about past resistance to discrimination encourages resistance to discrimination in the present . Knowing how much has changed shows that substantial change is possible -- that todays work to create change can make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a tool for change . <p> History bonds a community . It builds a sense of being a people . It instills pride and confidence , and offers a sense of belonging . Nations , ethnic groups , racial groups , and religions all pass their history down through the generations , and use it to create solidarity . Providing LGBT people with their previously unknown past profoundly deepens their understanding of themselves it counters the often banal , superficial stereotypes of LGBT people that appear in much of the media . <p> Why OutHistory.org MattersAs the major website on LGBT American history OutHistory.org reaches out , beyond academia , into homes around the nation and even the world , and connects with otherwise isolated LGBT people . OutHistory reaches distressed LGBT teens , and lonely LGBT elders , telling them they 're not alone , and informing them of an inspiring past . <p> By distributing new , accurate information about the LGBT past OutHistory effects the consciousness of present activists , and informs their work to rectify existing discrimination .

For example , research published on OutHistory documents Father Junipero Serras punishment of two Native American men for " abominable vice , " in California , around 1777 . This history received new attention on the Web when Pope Francis made Father Serra a Saint . OutHistory points out links between past events and current events of relevance to LGBT political campaigns . OutHistory makes the past relevant to the present . <p> Since it went online in 2008 , OutHistory.org has published substantial , original research on the formerly hidden LGBT past : <p> On the 40th anniversary of the police raid on the Stonewall Inn , OutHistory published previously unknown police records of the raid . <p> OutHistory published a previously lost manuscript autobiography by the transgender Earl Lind/Jennie June/Ralph Werther , dating to 1921 . <p> OutHistory published Alan Bernstein 's previously unknown , 149 page defense of homosexuality , written in 1940 , and a detailed biography of Bernstein . <p> OutHistory published an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Isnt Baldwin That Well Known Pervert " ( the quotes written by J.

In 1893 , Dr. Charles H Hughes of St Louis described the Washington Drag Dance with these remarks : <p> In this stable performance of sexual perversion all of these men are lasciviously dressed in womanly attire , short sleeves , low necked dresses and the usual ball room decorations and ornaments of women , feathered and rib boned headdresses , garters , frills , flowers , ruffles , etc and deport themselves as women .

Swanson had made a name for herself in Chicago , where she did not hide her ambitions to " become a star . " When Billboard announced in 1937 that Swanson had just been signed to the Sunbeam label , it put her on the road to fame . Yet she never compromised her identity as a female impersonator as the author of the Billboard article acknowledged that Swanson was " a fem impersonator whose real name ( was ) Alphonso Horsley . " <p> By clearly embracing her transgender identity ( Marl Young , Sunbeams owner , printed Swanson 's real name right on the record label ) , Swanson - and many other drag queens - lived comfortably thanks to the night-lounge business and entertainment .

In an interview with a University of Chicago sociologist , Leo , a Black homosexual , reported having read that " men who desired men were often effeminate .

" I believe , " she tells Terkel , " that one of the most sound ideas in dramatic writing is that in order to create something universal , you must pay very great attention to the specific . " <p> This maxim runs throughout the Brooklyn Museums new exhibit Twice Militant : Lorraine Hansberrys Letters to " The Ladder " . Hansberry wrote a number of letters to the editors of " The Ladder " , which was , as the curators point out " the first subscription-based lesbian publication in the United States . " The magazine began publishing in 1956 and Hansberrys first letter to the editor appeared in 1957 . Also in the exhibition are a number of unpublished notes , poems , short stories and essays , documents in which Hansberry explicitly engages with the intersecting axes of her identities as a writer : lesbian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heterosexual marriage . <p> In the letters and documents on display , its clear that Hansberry repeatedly engaged with the question of the specific and the universal in regards to her own lesbian identity . The Hansberry of these texts seems to have frankly acknowledged her own sexual identity while attempting to articulate the best ways to claim personhood as a black , lesbian writer in a heterosexual marriagespecifics of her experience that both connected her to collective political identities and potentially isolated her from these identities . <p> In her first letter to " The Ladder " , Hansberry tells the editors " I 'm glad as heck you exist . " Hansberry was writing in response to an article in the preceding issue , where a writer argued for assimilation with the larger heterosexual culture and particularly the abandonment of " butch " presentations . Hansberry writes , " As one raised in a subculture experience ( I am a Negro ) where those within were and are forever lecturing to their fellows about how to appear acceptable to the dominant social groups , I know something about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be clear is that one is oppressed or discriminated against because one is different , not wrong or bad. This is perhaps the bitterest of the entire pill . " <p> Hansberry argues in favor of assimilation , not because she believes the dominant social norms are correct or necessary , but from a purely pragmatic standpoint . " As a matter of facility , of expediency , one has to take a critical view of revolutionary attitudes which in spite of the BASIC truths I have mentioned above , may tend to aggravate the problem of the group , " she wrote . <p> In a later letter , Hansberry writes , " What the homosexual wants and needs is not autonomy from the human race but utter integrationin it . I feel however I could be wrong about this . " The letter was written in response to an article admonishing lesbian women who remained in heterosexual marriages . Hansberry , who had married Robert Nemiroff in 1953 , continued , " I am one of these , incidentally . " They separated around the time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first initial of Nemiroffs last name in her signatures to these letters . <p> Hansberry agreed with the Ladder that lesbian women in heterosexual marriages who sought out affairs with other women should be held in contempt by both straight and lesbian communities , not least because she believed that it debased lesbian relationships : as she wrote , " all relationships between women need not be that of cats , tearing at each other . " Yet she admonished The Ladder for the articles lack of sympathy for lesbian women in heterosexual marriages , pointing out that such relationships were part of a greater " social moral superstructure that has never admitted to the equality of women and is therefore immoral itself . " <p> " I do n't  think people start out in this world to be bad , " she wrote , " They start out to be happy . " This insight was one of the underlying contradictions between the individual and the universal . <p> The most extraordinary document in the exhibition is , in my opinion , an unpublished 1961 essay Hansberry wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homophile " conference between male homosexuals , who were advocating for a Homosexual Bill of Rights , and some lesbians , led by an editor of The Ladder , who opposed any attempt at sponsoring legislation , arguing that " you cant legislate sentiments . " <p> Hansberrys response " On Homophobia , the Intellectual Impoverishment of Women and a Homosexual Bill of Rights " applies a precise arithmetic to the situation , taking into account the privileges and what we would now identify as the intersectionality of these disparate causes and groups . <p> " It is true that all human questions overlap and while our understanding of a trial in Israel or an execution in Viet Nam may not momentarily be rapid fire , life has a way of showing up why we should have cared all along.there always comes the reckoning , " Hansberry wrote . " Men , as a sex , find themselves socially stagnant and trapped into incredible patterns with conformity that dictate what and how their " manliness " should be in order to hold their place over the lesser ... The relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special and deep implication . " <p> Hansberry noted that women do not " enjoy genuine equality with men . They have not , therefore , evolved as a group the discipline of intellectually organized thought . They do not , for instance , think socially , they think personally " and so are unable to understand the urgent need for organized political action . Hansberry was careful to note , " It has nothing to do with intelligence . It has everything to do with experience . Which is why the fact is fluid . " Hansberry later argued that " the reason we have such excellent agricultural and educational organizations " in the United States is because these were governmental departments and places where women " got to the point " and organized socially . <p> The one drawback of the Brooklyn Museums exhibition is its staging . Sidelined to one wall in the Sackler Center , the exhibition is made up entirely of Hansberrys texts , making it difficult for a visitor to spend time with her words and truly read each document . Included in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " What I love " , " What I hate " , and " What I Should Like " , records that she began keeping each year of her life , starting at age 23 . The lists underline this question of identity as simultaneously personal and political . In one , from her 29th year , Hansberry placed " My Homosexuality " under both " What I Love " and " What I hate " . All the lists contain beautifully evocative lines that pierce the heart of Hansberrys desires . One " What I Like " includes " 69 when it really works " ; all the lists contain descriptions of lovers and Eartha Kitts legs and eyes are mentioned across multiple lists . <p> Access to these documents , as Kevin Mumford points out , was restricted for many years . Its understandable that the Brooklyn Museum may be under a restriction as to how they can display them .

Hansberry linked this ability to think socially , and not personally , to fully realizing ones political and human rights , of fully claiming ones personhood . Male homosexuals , she notes , socialized to believe in their integrity as male citizens and used to the language of " dissertations and speeches and manifestos , " to claim equal rights . Lesbians , being women and not socialized in this form of personhood and assertion , indeed , denied their full humanity because of their gender , were understandably against advocating for legal rights .

" Barones , " also known as " Rustys " developed into a definitely lesbian , sub-cultural space . Crossing the threshold into Rustys , you entered the " inside " world . Inside Rustys , lesbians were able to define themselves through community and public space . Lesbians called each other " Brothers , " and protected each other from police and straight male harassment . There was a tendency not to welcome men into lesbian bars , but a few gay men would attend . <p> After-hours private clubs , Diners , automats , coffee houses , restaurants , cafeterias , movie theaters , and hotels were also locales enjoyed by gay and lesbian clientele .

These include a social stigma attached to homosexuality and homosexualitys illegality throughout the United States . The centrality of the " closet " required that individuals controlled information about him or herself in order to avoid the threat of violence posed by visibility . <p> Social patterns were organized around the " closet . " Specifically , homosexual activity was generally " asocial " before 1969 . There was much segregation of information between gay and straight worlds and a split between public and private lives . This created the need for homosexuals to lead double lives . Lesbians and gay men could not climb the corporate ladder as easily , due to concealment of personal life and unmarried status .

Police raided bars ; leading to arrests , legal fees , and the loss of jobs . Extortion was a large cost for bar owners , as bars , in their semi-legality , had to pay for " protection . " Because of legal and extra-legal threats , bars were often owned by straight outsiders , or by organized crime . During the Closet Economy , gay commodity culture existed through heavily coded works , such as The Well of Loneliness , as well as through semi-legal businesses selling erotic photographs , nude magazines , erotic fiction , and sex toys . New gay and lesbian social institutions published newsletters , which spawned mail-order businesses serving homosexuals . These capitalist endeavors contributed to the process of identity formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire ; yet at the same time , rigidly defined identities , and exploited desire . <p> Homophile Protest10 <h> Lesbian Organizing <p> The early " homophile " movement began in the 1950s with the formation of the Mattachine Society and ONE , Inc . Both of these organizations were comprised of predominantly gay males . ONE Magazine was the first widely circulated gay and lesbian magazine . <p> Women who were involved with the Mattachine Society began to realize that the concerns of gay men differed from those of lesbian women . " The same forces that allowed gay identity to coalesce from the late nineteenth century onwardthe shift to wage labor , the growth of industrialism and urbanization , the removal of production from the home , and the restructuring of the familyaffected both men and women , but in decidedly different ways . " 11 For example : promiscuity , relationships , gender , and sexual identity each affect men differently than women . The differing concerns and the emergence of a lesbian identity combined to provide the impetus for the creation of the Daughters of Bilitis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and publications such as " The Ladder " to address their needs . <h> Resort Communities <p> The resort community , Cherry Grove , was a gay and lesbian " world " that allowed for the freedom of expression . Women here were the most separate and distinct group in the eyes of Gay men , with the Grove consisting of a majority of gay-male dominated spaces . Nonetheless , lesbian groups went there and succeeded in making a space for themselves and they continued to travel to Fire Island from the 1930s onwards . During the McCarthy Era , " the Groves unwritten charter was to be a grand , fun , party place . " 12 Cherry Grove held its own values that fostered community building between gay men and lesbians .

Lesbian women were less likely than gay men to face police harassment . Lesbians were also able to publicly enjoy their sexual preference . <p> The lesbians attracted to Cherry Grove in the 1930s through the 1950s were upper class white women . " Grove racism , sexism , and larger economic factors seem to have almost completely daunted lesbians who were black , Latino , or Asian , who even today come mostly as day-trippers , not renters or owners . " 13 There was not a shift toward acceptance of middle class and minority women until the 1960s . <p> Women at Cherry Grove had independent incomes and professional jobs and they identified with art , theatre , and cafT society . Public socializing , serial monogamy , their relationship with camp , and a lack of cross-class eroticism further characterized the lesbian community .

Under these conditions , the Grove meant much more to them than just another summer resort . " 14 The older lesbians expressed ambivalence toward labels , " although the older ladies pursued lesbian relationships with relish , they were more ambivalent than their younger friends toward lesbian identity .

( 1 ) Because this work greatly influenced the colonists ' interpretation of statute , Coke 's work is quoted here in some detail . <p> Coke 's opening lines on " Buggery , or Sodomy " stated : <p> If any person shall commit buggery with mankind , or beast : by authority of Parliament this offense is adjudged felony without benefit of Clergy .... <p> " Buggery , " Coke continued , <p> is a detestable , and abominable sin , amongst Christians not to be named , committed by carnal knowledge against the ordinance of the Creator , and order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast , or by womankind with brute beast . <p> Buggery vs . Boy Love <p> Coke distinguished between " Bugeria " ( which he claimed was " an Italian word " for sodomy ) and " Paederastes or Paiderastes " ( which he called " a Greek word " meaning " Amator puerum , " lover of pubescent boys ) . Boy love , he said was " but a Species of Buggery , " and added : it was complained of in the English Parliament " that the Lumbards Italians from Lombardy had brought into the Realm the shameful sin of Sodomy , that is not to be named . " <p> Contrary to Coke 's suggestion ( says historian Robert Oaks ) the term buggery did not derive from an Italian word " Bugeria . " That Italians from Lobardy introduced sodomy into England was folklore reflecting an economic conflict ; Coke cited as his source a Parliamentary debate in which representatives of English traders attributed sodomy to a rival group of Lombard moneylenders . <p> Punishments <p> The suggested punishments for buggery or sodomy were Coke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it deserveth death ... , though they differ in the manner of punishment . <p> One author said those guilty of sodomy should be burnt , " and so , " added Coke , " were the Sodomites by Almighty God . " Other authors said that " Those who commit unchaste acts with animals and sodomites are to be buried alive . " In " ancient times , " said Coke , males convicted of buggery were hanged , females were drowned ( the reference here was apparently to female bestiality ) . In England of his own day , said Coke , as felons , those convicted of buggery were hanged by the neck . <p> Traditional Phrases <p> Coke next considered the language used in English references to buggery . " Detestable and Abominable , " he said , were " just attributes " of the crime . The phrase " amongst Christians not to be named " was used in the " usual Indictment of this offence . " The phrase " carnall knowledge " appeared in the indictment passage referring ( in Latin ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " or " the thing in the thing , either with mankind , or with beast . " The " least penetration maketh it carnall knowledge , " said Coke . A mere " ejaculation of seed , " he said , did not constitute buggery ; analogy was made to rape , in which ejaculation without penetration did not constitute the crime . <p> Both Parties are Criminals <p> In buggery , Coke stated , both the " agent " and " consentient " ( consenting party ) were felons . That accorded with God 's law as expressed in Leviticus , which said that , if a man lay with a man as with a woman , both had committed abomination , both must die . This also accorded with " the ancient rule of law " which said ( in Latin ) that " those who do it and those who consent to it were punished with like penalty . " " The Sodomites came to this abomination by four means , " said Coke , <p> by pride , excess of diet gluttony , idleness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> If the party buggered be within the age of discretion under fourteen , it is no felony in him , but in the agent only . <p> In buggery , as in other felonies , said Coke , all accessories to the crime were also considered parties to the act . <p> Women <p> Discussing the application of the buggery law to women , Coke claimed ( falsely ) ' that the English statute prohibited any " person " ( male or female ) from committing the crime with " mankind or beast . " ( The English law simply prohibited " Buggery . . . with mankind or beast , " without specifying the sex of the parties . ) The reference to females in the English buggery law was explained , said Coke , by the fact that <p> somewhat before the making of this Act a great Lady committed buggery with a Baboon , and conceived by it .... <p> Thus did a curious bit of English folklore enter an influential commentary on the capital buggery law . <p> Crying Sins <p> Coke concluded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mentioned in the Bible-sins crying out for punishment . The " crying sin " of the " Sodomites " referred to Genesis 18:20-21 . There God said that because " the outcry against Sodom &amp; Gomorrah " was great he would visit those cities to see if the outcry was true . The last " crying sin " cited by Coke was " the voice of the op pressed and the unpaid wages of labor , " a reference to several biblical passages condemning the economic oppression of workers by employers ( passages now not often cited ) . The sins of the Sodomites , Coke thought , included not only sodomy , but the exploitation of labor . <h> References <p> Jonathan Ned Katz , Gay/Lesbian Almanac ( NY : Harper &amp; Row , 1983 ) , pp. 88-89 , citing Edward Coke , The Third Part of The Institutes of the Laws of England . . .

All I ask in return is that we take the meanness out of this legislation . <p> I ask my leadership to recognize that those of us who happen to be in long-term loveing relationships also might be considered or at least studied for the potential of legitimate benefits and privileges . For example , if I were to get sick , why should my partner not have automatic visitation rights and automatic consultation with the doctor ? <p> I have letters in my office of people from cancer and AIDS who have been denied that basic privilege . When a friend of mine died last year of AIDS , his partner of 16 years could not sign the documents at the funeral home .

We will not change any policy , we will not change anything in the bill , rather we would seek simply to look at Federal , State and international law so that we might have a body of accurate information upon which to deliberate in the future . <p> In so doing , we would not only reaffirm the traditional definition of marriage , but we would also send the signal of our sensitivity and respect to those who happen to be gay or lesbian . <p> The gentleman from Illinios MR .

Hansberry achieved international fame with the Broadway production of Raisin in the Sun ( 1958 ) , for which she won the New York Desk Drama Awards ( the youngest and first African American ) . Her portrayal and personal portrait personify a moment of young rebelliousness , feminine elegance , and civil rights protest , and yet few of her readers have been aware of her lesbian desire , writings , and relationships . Though they had divorced , Hansberrys former husband , Robert Nemiroff , restricted access to archival materials that expanded upon her sexual identity . Recently , the Hansberry estate has permitted researchers access to some of the materials , and in 2013 I received permission to view the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new information about her personal life that I have examined . <p> In 1948 Hansberry matriculated at the University of Wisconsin but later dropped out of classes after less than two years , apparently the result of distraction or perhaps a sense of marginalization as a black woman and lesbian . Ironically her lowest gradea Dwas given for her performance in a drama course . At the age of 23 , writing from Madison , Hansberry composed a list favorite things , " Myself in Notes , " in which she wrote a number of likes , including " to look at a well dressed women " and " deeply intelligent women , " but under dislikes , " masculinity in women . " At 26 , she listed Eartha Kitt , Anna Magnani , and " intellectual women " under likes , but noted that she remained " indifferent to : most men . " In turn , her political activity immediately moved leftward : pressing for the integration of local institutions , joining and then heading a progressive political organization , campaigning for presidential candidate Henry Wallace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in progressive political circles and eventually joined the Communist Party , and assisted Paul Robeson with the production of a black radical journal , Freedom . <p> At that time the FBI commenced undercover surveillance and continued to monitor her activities sporadically , and then increased their coverage after the premiere of A Raisin in the Sun , assigning an agent " to determine whether the play in any way follows the Communist line . " Their investigation uncovered no such content , speculating that it " would have never been accepted on Broadway if there were any Communist content . " Around the same time , she found herself the object of uncomfortable speculation when the press reported that she was the daughter of a wealthy real estate broker and that her familys business , Hansberry Enterprise , run by her two brothers and sister , owned at least thirteen properties that were in violation of building codes , and that the city had cited them for more than 40,000 in fines . Depressed and angered , Hansberry engaged an attorney to rebut the charges and clear her reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her husband , Robert Nemiroff , Hansberry sent her a letter to the editors of the national lesbian journal , The Ladder , along with a money order for $2.00 ( to receive as many back issues as the amount covered ) . In the first one , Hansberry offered several observations about social differencewhat she described as " off-the-top-of-the-head reactions , " and developed what may be identified as the first theory of intersectionality . She first wished to dispel the idea of " wishing to foster any strict separatist notions , homo or hetero . " In a reading of the " homosexual " literature that was not apparently her first , Hansberry negotiated the problem of difference , showing a sensitivity to need to find separate and to join , and demonstrated remarkable adeptness at applying an understanding of the civil rights movement to the question of lesbianism . After addressing the needs of separatism , Hansberry compared the dictates of black respectability to the homophiles adoption of a similar strategy , arguing that the " most splendid argument is simple and to the point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , of course , undeniable service to the human race , could still be insulted , denied a hotel room or meal in many parts of our country . " <p> The first edition of Raisin in the Sun , 1959 . The play was partly autobiographical , and the first play by an African-American woman to open on Broadway . <p> On the one hand , Hansberry addresses The Ladder and its audience as " you people , " as if to notice , but not clearly identify with , lesbians of the 1950s . On the other , Hansberry made a number of observations about the homophile movement that seemed to reflect a sustained reading of The Ladder and more than a passing interest in lesbian issues . " What ought to be clear is that one is oppressed or discriminated against because one is different , not wrong , or bad somehow . " She readily analogized the case of African Americans to that of homosexuality , but did so from the inside . In other words , when she compared the " personal discomfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and then predicted that " someday , I expect , the discrete Lesbian will not turn her head on the streets the sight of the butch strolling hand in hand with her friends in their trousers and definitive haircuts . " Of this scene , Hansberry wondered if the West Coast was more prejudicial than the East Coast , and therefore had spawned more homophile groups , or if they were " Pioneers still ? " As for the East Coast she attested to " a vigorous and active set almost bump one another off the streets . " <p> While making public appearances and authoring the text for a book commissioned by the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee , Hansberry returns to the same lifestyle---caught up in the hectic and glamorous schedule of a downtown bohemian , dashing to coffee dates , appearing at star-studded events , lunching in the Villageand a profound sense of isolation and aloneness . Much of the recently released diaries reveal a reflective and imaginative woman , and yet someone battling the symptoms of depressiona woman not only singular but isolated . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As for this homosexuality thing ( how long since I have thought or written of it in that wayas some kind of entity ! ) Am committed to it . But its childhood is over .

" In January 1964 , returning from the hospital , Hansberry writes of her intense desire for her lover , and their sexual encounters . The woman had slept over at Hansberrys place as well . The loneliness and illness became entangled in Hansberry , and that evening " so much was pent up . I consumed her whole . I recalled also when she first lay in my bedhow very , very wet the place on my leg when she moved . She was very ready .

At work on her biography , in the 1980s Margaret Wilkerson mentioned the 1957 letters to the Ladder , observing that they " raised the problem of a lesbian in a heterosexual marriage , " but that same year she separated from Nemiroff and they later divorced . Because of Nemiroffs intentions along with a broader scholarly silence , the complexities of Hansberrys life have remained obscure . <p> The only exceptions to the silence of the closet came from a few gay and lesbian archivists and writers . Del Martin and Phyllis Lyons 1972 lesbian anthology , Lesbian/Woman , referred indirectly to Hansberry , observing that " many black women who been involved in the homophile movement found themselves forced to make a choice between two Causes that touched their lives so intimately , " and that " One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

DOB New York Daughters of Bilitis member , and she contributed to this magazine in its very earliest years . " While she subscribed both to the Ladder and ONE , no evidence has surfaced of her participation in meetings , conferences , or other activities . Yet lesbian archivists understandably desired to include the evidence of her desire in the record . Archivist Barbara Grier responded to what she described as a " capsule ad " posted by Nemiroff and " offered her LADDER material , " but claimed that she did not receive a reply from him , which seems entirely plausible given his other decisions as executor of the estate . Some years later apparently Nemiroff , or perhaps another archivist , clipped the pages of Jonathan Katzs Gay American History ( pages 5 and 425 ) that reference her letters to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this was the extent of his ability or intentions to include , much less recognize in a public way , Hansberrys enthusiasm for the homophile movement and passions for other women . <p> Another act of queer genealogythat is , attempting to document and claim the presumed straight figure as and for queerappeared in a special 1979 issue of Freedomways , the black radical journal for which Hansberry had once worked . Here the lesbian feminist poet , Adrienne Rich , figured Hansberry as a " problem , " insofar as she presented several complicated characteristics-- " black , female , and dead " --and then Rich writes of her frustration that " the Hansberry papers are not simply accessible in an archive open to the public . " Yet as a lesbian feminist immersed in essentialism of the time , Rich felt constrained as a white women looking at a black women , and awaited the eyes of a black feminist to examine these documents , citing the black lesbian scholar , Barbara Smith . She then reminds readers of Hansberrys correspondence with the Ladder and her mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the closet , or what she termed Hansberrys " internal and external censors .

Yet Hansberrys closest friend was probably James Baldwin , forming a queer bohemian couple that comforted one another under the pressures of the limelight . <p> Up until quite late , Hansberry appears unaware that she had cancer--the pain in her shoulders diagnosed as " calcium deposits " and the pain in her stomach as " ulcers . " When she finally underwent treatment , her diary entries repeat the following : " Great day but a queer day . Much pain last night . Took a Darvon ; vomited was instantly relieved .

" The ninth provision of the Virginia legal code of 1610 read : <p> No man shall commit the horrible , detestable sins of Sodomie upon pain of death ; &amp; he or she that can be lawfully convictled of Adultery shall be punished with death .

The laws were enforced with a vengeance by the governor 's personal decree , without trial by jury . <p> These " ruthless policies , " says historian Alden T. Vaughan , " rested on the assumption that the colony 's plight necessitated stringent discipline . " In England , Vaughan says , " Family , church , community , and government guided personal and group behavior . Virginia at this time had few such controls : almost no families , few clergymen , scattered and unstable communities , and an unpredictable government that took orders from a commercial organization .

CCC was the birthplace of a number of Las Vegas 's gay organizations and provided meeting space for dozens of others . <p> Lawrence had been active in the Las Vegas gay community since 1979 when he moved from Pittsburgh with his husband , Ernie Egyed . Lawrence finished his Bachelor 's degree in psychology at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas in 1982 , and his Master 's in marriage and family therapy at California Lutheran University in 1984-87 .

And as the AIDS epidemic began spreading through Las Vegas ( see AIDS in Southern Nevada ) , organizations such as AFAN met the physical needs of HIV-positive people , but there was nowhere they could go to work out their mental and emotional issues .

It was with help from AFAN that Lawrence created a new division of Bridge Counseling in 1989 called CAIP Community AIDS Intervention Project which served as an umbrella for Bridge 's gay outreach programs and received funding from the Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Abuse BADA and the Centers for Disease Control CDC . Among these programs were an HIV-negative support group , the Gay Men 's Health Project , Significant Others , and a Survivors group of those who had lost loved ones to AIDS .

Later , Lawrence hired another prominent counselor , Kathy Reinken , away from Bridge. 5 <p> It was financially difficult in the months after Community Counseling was established--Lawrence lived on a thousand dollars a month and he and Phil Carracher had to do private practice on the side to pay office rent and utilities .

His psyche , tastes , and manners are more or less conspicuously feminine . On the sexual side of life the ultra-androgyne desires so far as possible to pass for a woman . The ultra-androgyne always feels himself to be a female and is always attracted only toward the ultra-virile or the tremendously virile as a male around his own age . But when he becomes older ( still under thirty ) , almost without exception prefers the society of such ultra-men to that of the best-favored women . Ultra-androgynes are women with male pudenda . They ordinarily pass their lives as men in masculine attire of rather loud color and design .

( 1 ) <p> Chapter two relates that within ten days after June 15 , 1607 , when the ships which had brought the colonists departed back to England , the remaining settlers were " oppressed " by " extreme weakness and sickness . " The " cause " was said to be that while the ships had remained the settlers ' <p> allowance was somewhat bettered , by a daily proportion of biscuit which the sailors would pilfer to sell , give or exchange with us , for money , saxefras , furs , or love . A printed marginal note identifies this passage as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Interpretation <p> The above narrative presents a problem of historical interpretation . In one interpretation , the document suggests that " love , " seemingly meaning sexual favors , was one of those items which the first American settlers exchanged , along with money , sassafras , and furs , to keep themselves alive . In that interpreation , the term " love " apparently referred to sexual contacts between men . Since there were no women among the Virginia colonists in 1607 , the " gratification " of the " animal instinct " cited above would make this the earliest documented instance of carnal relations between Englishmen in the New World . <p> Is another interpretation plausible ? Did " love " simply refer to " affection " ? Was it likely that seventeenth-century English sailors would have traded stolen biscuit for the settlers ' affection , or given biscuit away because of their affection for the settlers ? <p> The marginal reference to the sailors ' " abuses " lends credence to the interpretation that " love " here meant sexual exchanges . " Love " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct between the sexes , and its gratification " ; the Oxford English Dictionary cites the King James Bible ( 1611 ) : " Come let us take our fill of love until the morning " ( Proverbs vii , 18 ) . <p> The existence of what may be a casual reference to a sexual exchange between males , in an account published and publicly distributed in England , begins to be explained by its historical context . The Map of Virginia did not , according to its modern editor , " tell the side of the Virginia Company , with which John Smith was so often at odds . " Smith and his close associates wrote their version of events " against the wishes of the Virginia Company , " and together had it printed with the help of a group of sympathetic clergymen. ( 3 ) <p> The subtitle of the book promised that it unfolded the " fundamental causes from whence have sprang so many miseries to the undertakers , and scandals to the businesses .

" The manuscript " was thought fit to publish " in its " rude " original form , since such an honest , unadorned account would best help to " purge that famous action " of colonization from " infamous scandal . " ( Does that assertion argue against a sexual interpretation of the word love ? ) The " discourse , " it was said , " is no Judge of men 's manners , " and was " only a reporter of their actions in Virginia , not intended to disgrace any , accuse any , excuse any , nor flatter any . " The narrative " can detract from none that intendeth there to adventure their fortunes .

@@107290641 @2690641/ <h> Beauford Delaney <p> By Dionn McDonald <p> Beauford Delaney was an African-American painter of the Harlem Renaissance . A great modernist painter , his work included abstract impressionism , pastel portraiture and representational streetscapes and landscapes . During his life he received critical acclaim for his bold and complicated uses of light , color and texture . <p> Delaney was born December 30 , 1901 in Knoxville , Tennessee . He was the eighth of ten children , five of whom survived childhood . His mother , Delia Johnson , was a seamstress and domestic worker ; his father , John Samuel Delaney , was a Methodist Episcopal minister and a barber . Religious faith , education and culture were of great importance in the Delaney family . Beaufords artistic talent was greatly encouraged . At fourteen , he completed his first commissioned painting . The quality of his work gained him an introduction to a white painter , Lloyd Branson . Branson became his mentor , and encouraged him to study art in Boston . A few years earlier , Beaufords older sister , Ogust Mae , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beauford welcomed the change . <p> In Boston , Beauford immersed himself in culture and studied classical painting . Unable to pay for his education , he informally attended classes at several art schools in Boston . His work was influenced by Monets impressionist use of light . He was also influenced by a local painter Alfred Morang , whose broad strokes were similar to Van Gogh . Beauford had arrived with letters of introduction in hand and was invited into the parlors of Bostons upper-class society of social activists . Among them were important African-Americans such as the poet Countee Cullen and writer/activist James Weldon Johnson . As an African American moving through Bostons white society , Beauford struggled with his many identities . While in Boston , he had his first gay experience , which added to his sense of difference . After six years of study in Boston , Beauford moved on to New York in order to advance his work . <p> Delaney arrived in Harlem during the Renaissance and at the start of the Great Depression . He was resourceful and created work for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The quality of his portraiture garnered him a position as a sketch artist at a dance school . One of his portraits was published in the New York Telegraph and the Chicago Defender . This exposure led to his work being exhibited in 1930 at the Whitney Studio Galleries , which later became the Whitney Museum of American Art . Delaneys exhibition received positive reviews . He continued to paint New York socialites , Black leaders , jazz musicians and the people of Harlem . In 1932 , his paintings were exhibited at the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue . Now a full-time artist and teacher , he joined the Art Students League where he met other artists , like Jackson Pollock . Delaney was also a member of the Harlem Arts Guild and other artists organizations . Much of the African-American work of this period contained race-related content . For Delaney , art was primarily expression rather than commentary . Although he was very much in tune with the issues of the day , his style became more abstract as an expression of his inner world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great jazz music , much of his work was complicated , unpredictable and escaped traditional form . <p> In 1938 , Beauford Delaney began to experience a new level of critical acclaim , with his first two one-man shows and coverage in Life magazine . After his third one-man show , his modernist cityscape Greene Street was compared to artists such as Van Gogh and CTzanne . Also featured during this show was Delaneys first painting of the writer James Baldwin , Dark Rapture . Delaney became a life-long friend and mentor to Baldwin . During the 1940s , Delaneys work was greatly inspired by broad uses of vivid color , such as that of Matisse and Picasso . This inspiration can be seen in Untitled ( Night Scene ) and Can Fire in the Park . Delaneys brushstrokes provide great texture that seems to lift the images from the canvas . Having received greater recognition , Delaney was featured in the exhibit , " The Negro in Contemporary Art " , where his Othello was well received . His 1948 solo exhibit at the Artists Gallery brought acceptance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was awarded a brief fellowship at Yaddo , an artists retreat in upstate New York . This time spent outside of the city in nature settings moved his work more toward the abstract . His best work of the civil rights era , Earth Mother , juxtaposed a European expressionist style with Black objects . His time at Yaddo and away from New York also stimulated thoughts of traveling to Paris . In 1953 , he left for Paris with the aid of patrons and friends . There he joined a community of American artists , including writer James Baldwin . After a difficult year , Delaney exhibited in the MusTe dArt Moderne and the MusTe des Beaux Arts . His exciting manipulation of color was well received . He exhibited at numerous shows in Paris and throughout Europe , but only occasionally sold his work . <p> While in Europe , Delaneys mental health deteriorated greatly , as he struggled with poverty and conflicts over his sexuality . Hearing of his mothers death in 1958 added to his depression . Although he found relief in his work , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life returned in full force on a trip to Greece . He is reported to have gone overboard from a ship to escape men whom he believed were trying to kill him . Delaney was diagnosed as having acute paranoid delusions and was placed on antidepressant medication . With improved health , he returned to his life as a painter in a new studio , acquired for him by friends . <p> Beginning in 1962 , Delaney would complete some of his best work . But again , depression and alcohol drove him into a relapse . In 1962 , his friends attempted to orchestrate a New York show of his work , to be sponsored by the Urban League . Baldwins letter to potential supporters said Delaney " brings great light out of the darkness of his journey , and makes his journey and his endeavor , and his triumph ours . " Unfortunately , the show never took place . In Delaneys journal he spoke of " birth pains " and " enlightenment , " suggesting a sense of hope for improvement . Reflecting his improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-man show in 1964 . By this time he was combining portraiture with expressionism . His 1966 Portrait of James Baldwin placed dark lines against a yellow abstraction , which reflected his departure from purely representational portraiture . In 1968 , Delaney received a grant from the National Council of the Arts , which helped him to continue working . In the early 1970s , he received many accolades and increased visibility of his work in the States . When praised for this , he commented " I ai n't  seen no famous money , and I 'm hungry . " Delaneys final exhibition in Paris took place in 1973 at the Gallerie Speyer . The show was a success , with several works being sold . One reviewer said his work " stimulates the human soul , like a Billie Holiday recording . " His final exhibit during his life was at the Studio Museum in Harlem , where his Paris works were shown . <p> Delaneys abstract work reflected his feelings of difference and emotional unrest . Throughout his time in the States he felt split , moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Yorks Greenwich Village , he found freedom to explore a conflicted gay life . Yet , he remained affected by a racial difference that he could be distanced from in Harlem . Delaney suffered through periods of depression and disturbing visions , coupled with alcohol abuse . He was plagued by financial troubles and was often assisted by his wealthy patrons and friends . In 1975 , Delaneys mental and physical health took a turn for the worse . He was diagnosed with what was likely Alzheimers disease and was committed to St. Annes hospital in France .

( 1 ) <p> The testimony against Sension is the most detailed known to exist in any colonial sodomy case . Extensive excerpts from the original manuscripts , transcribed by Jonathan Ned Katz and Lisa Duggan , were first published in Katz 's Gay/Lesbian Almanac. ( 2 ) <p> Saxton 's Testimony <p> Daniel Saxton , a servant of Sension 's , was his primary accuser , testifying that he saw Sension commit sodomy with another servant , Nathaniel Pond . Saxton also claimed that Sension attempted sodomy with him . Numerous other townsmen testified to Sension 's repeated attempts at sodomy with them or other young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or early twenties ) . Sension apparently pleaded guilty to attempted sodomy , asserting his innocence of any completed act . <p> Sension 's History <p> " Goodman " Sension arrived from England on the ship Elizabeth and Ann and settled in Windsor about 1640 . The only reference to Sension in Windsor court records before 1677 , is a report of his refusal to testify , in 1640 , against Aaron Starke ; accused and convicted of " buggery " with a heifer--a refusal significant in terms of Sension 's own illegal sexual proclivity . <p> In 1643 , Sension bought a lot and built on Silver Street , opposite Pigeon Hill Road . He married his wife Isabell on June 12 , 1645 . In 1648 , he received a bequest from Edward Chalkwell of a gun , sword , bandoliers , vest , hat , and forty shillings . Isabell Sension was admitted to the Windsor Church on January 22 , 1649 . <p> A tax list of 1675 divided the Windsor population into five classes : Nicholas Sension was in the first class -- those with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Sension became prosperous : Of five income groups in Windsor in 1676 he was in the second richest . In June 1676 , Sension was listed among those voluntary contributors who gave to " the poor in want in other colonies " -- his donation was two shillings , six pence . In 1680 , after thirty-five years of marriage , the Sensions were reported to have had no children . Nicholas Sension died on September 18 , 1689 . <p> In 1677 , the testimony at Sension 's trial revealed that his sodomy attempts had begun over thirty years before , about 1646-47 . <p> Griswold 's Testimony <p> George Griswold testified that thirty-one or thirty-two years earlier <p> I was in the mill house ... and Nicholas Sension was with me , and he took me and threw me on the chest and took hold on my privy parts. ( 3 ) <p> Phelps ' Testimony <p> William Phelps testified that about thirty years earlier ( about 1647 ) because of the " abuse " which Sension had offered to Phelps 's brothers and many others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fearing how God might punish such abuse , The " hazard " of Sension " infecting the rising generation , " said Phelps , made him complain to a member of the court about Sension 's " Sodomitical actings towards my brethren . " Phelps said that when he confronted Sension about his activity , Sension had " acknowledged he took it up at the school where he was educated , " admitting to Phelps " how long " he had pursued " this trade . " ( 4 ) <p> First Warning <p> Although Phelps indicated that court members discussed the matter in the late 1640s , Sension was not brought to trial at that time . He was instead privately confronted by individual court members . But even after this private confrontation Sension continued his " sodomitical " ways . <p> Gibs ' Testimony <p> Jacob Gibs testified that about 1648 Sension had made overtures to him . Gibs said that " many times , ifnot all times , " when he and Nicholas Sension were alone . Sension had made advances . Once Sension had tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trembling with his body " -- reaching " his hands within my breeches , laboring to handle the low part of my body in an uncomely manner .

After much striving I told him that if he would not let me alone , I would cry for help .... ( 5 ) <p> Holcombe 's Testimony <p> Josiah Holcombe testified that about 1658 Sension made three separate overtures to him . One night Holcombe and Sension were on the watch together , and Holcombe suggested that they go to a house , apparently to sleep . Sension instead suggested that they go to his " haymow " ( or haystack ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> and when we were there , when I was almost asleep , ye said Sension did endeavor to untie my breeches and I , perceiving what he was about , wondered what he meant ; and I was quiet and let him alone till he had unloosed my breeches and heaved them down over my breech behind , and with his mouth and nose rubs about my breech , and being about to get upon me , I shoved him off and he promised me to be quiet . <p> " Another time the same year , " says Holcombe , " I was mowing for my father , " and <p> Sension came to me and lighted his pipe and smoked by me , and I having an open pair of drawers , the said Sension thrust up his hand into them and at last went to untie my drawers . <p> And on another occasion , while Holcombe was bathing in the river , he recalled that <p> I went out upon the bank to dry myself , and the said Sension came to me with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to lie on my belly , and strove with me , but I went away from him. ( 6 ) <p> Second Warning <p> About 1667 , twenty years after his first warning , Sension was privately confronted a second time about his behavior . At this time , Sension 's indentured servant , the seventeen-year-old Nathaniel Pond , complained to his brother , Isaac Pond , about Sensiori 's advances . Isaac Pond brought the complaint to John Griffen , asking for his advice and counsel . <p> Griffen 's Testimony <p> Griffen testified that Nathaniel Pond had " made known his grievance , " telling his brother <p> what temptations he was liable unto by reason of his master Sension 's grossly lascivious carriages towards him , who did often in an unseemly manner make attempts tending to sodomy , so that Nathaniel was forced by violence to throw Sension off from him , and yet his said master did often , and at the same times when he was resisted , reiterate his attempts of that nature so that , though Nathaniel was grown , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so violent and constant that Nathaniel found it difficult work to keep Sension off . I advised Isaac Pond to use all means to procure his brother 's release from Goodman Sension , and that if he and some friends could not attain it ... , then to make his application to authority. ( 7 ) <p> Isaac Pond went immediately to Timothy Phelps for advice . Phelps , one of Windsor 's wealthiest citizens , went with Isaac Pond to see Sension , and spoke with him in Nathaniel Pond 's presence . John Griffen related the surprising result . Sension agreed <p> to let the said Nathaniel Pond at liberty , but the young man , after his way was made for him , out of his ingenuity ( as I did judge when I heard of it ) , said that his Uncle Sension ( as he styled him ) , having been the man that had brought him up from a child in his orphan state , and now being grown up , he was loath to leave him who had the trouble of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do him service . . . . <p> After Nathaniel Pond refused to leave his master , Sension offered to give Pond a year off his service , and forty shillings , " for his abuse . " ( 8 ) <p> Nathaniel Pond 's refusal to leave Sension , even though troubled by his master 's sodomy attempts , suggests the emotional and economic complexity of these relationships . John Griffen referred to Nathaniel Pond 's " ingenuity " in refusing to leave his " Uncle " Sension , suggesting , perhaps , that Pond stayed on in hopes of an inheritance from Sension 's sizeable estate . Sension , though married , was childless , and Pond having been raised in the household may have hoped to receive some tangible benefit from his master 's interest . Pond may have also truly felt gratitude and affection for Sension , in spite of his troubling " sodomitical " overtures . <p> Renwert 's Testimony <p> Robert Renwert was apparently one of those who investigated the matter , questioning Nathaniel Pond about his master . Renwert later recalled that Pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hardly understand him . " Pond finally said that Sension " would have committed that Sin of Sodomy with me . " Then Pond " Expressed the same words again , somewhat Louder . " Renwert asked Pond <p> if his master used any Loving Expressions to him to persuade him to it . He said " no , not any . " I asked him if his master 's clothes were on or no . He said his master 's clothes were on . <p> Renwert also recalled one of the Enno family asking Pond ifhis master spoke with him " to persuade him to his wish . " Pond answered no . Renwert recalled that Sension 's wife " complained much how stubborn and disobedient " Pond was , how he would not obey lawful commands. 9 ) <p> In the late 1600s Windsor townspeople permitted Nathaniel Pond to remain in the Sension household , though both master and servant were subject to sodomitical " temptation . " The matter of Sension 's sodomitical advances was apparently resolved by a reduction in Nathaniel Pond 's term of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shillings . <p> Willson 's Testimony <p> Samuel Willson testified that about 1671 he had slept overnight with Nathaniel Pond and that , in the morning , Sension had " come up to the bedside and did put his hands into that bed . Nathaniel Pond and I lay back to back . " When Sension put his hand " to Nathaniel Pond 's breech , " Willson " turned about " and Sension " pushed his hand out of the bed , and said he 'd come for some tobacco . " ( 10 ) <p> Saxton 's Testimony <p> At the trial , in May , 1677 , Daniel Saxton , the major witness against his master Nicholas Sension , testified that " he saw Nicholas Sension come to bed to Nathaniel Pond and make the bed shake . " Saxton concluded that Sension " had committed the Sin of Sodomy with Nathaniel Pond . " <p> Saxton also testified that , in April , the month before the trial , Sension hadcome up to his ( Saxton 's ) room early in the morning . Saxton says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , thinking with myself whether he would commit the same wickedness with me as I had seen him commit with Nathaniel Pond . <p> Saxton said that Sension " turned me on my belly and took up my shirt , and with his lips kissed my tail ? twice : and then got on me with his body , with that end of persuing his tricks ? . " Saxton violently " thrust him off , warning his master " that he would not leave this Devilish sin till he was hanged . " ( 11 ) <p> Gilbert 's Testimony <p> Another witness , Josiah Gilbert , testified that " in the chamber overhead " he " overheard " the words , " You 'll never leave this Devilish sin till you are hanged . " ( 12 ) Gilbert 's brother also testified that Josiah often said he had heard Daniel Saxton tell " his Uncle Sension that he would never leave his old trade till he was brought to the gallows . " ( 13 ) <p> Other instances of attempted sodomy by Sension , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a series of witnesses . <p> Parsons ' Testimony <p> John Parsons testified that Sension suddenly " clapped his hands about me and unbuttoned or unclaspted my breeches . " Parsons told Sension to leave him alone , but " accidentally Sension got me down " and tried " to get upon me with his Yard in his hands . " ( 14 ) <p> Barboe 's Testimony <p> Samuel Barboe testified that Sension " proferred me a bushel of corn if I would put down my breeches . " Another time , said Barbee , Sension " put his hands in my breeches to my bare skin . " <p> Buoll 's Testimony <p> Peter Buoll testified that once , in Sensiori 's barn , Sension <p> told me if I would let him have one bloo blow ? at my breech he would give me a charge of powder .

( 16 ) The words " and Sinful " were crossed out in the manuscript . <p> Moses 's Testimony <p> Twenty-two year-old John Moses testified that when he lodged at Sension 's he ( Moses ) slept in the same bed with Nathaniel Pond .

Barber said that , while working as a servant , he made a trip to Hartford during which he and Sension " were appointed to lie together in a trundel bed , " In the room there was also <p> a standing high bed wherein lay two members of the General Court at that time , And Barber saith that he was unwilling and afraid to lodge with Sension because of some reports he had heard formerly concerning him , but being that the gentlemen lay in the chamber , and they were in a foreign place , he hoped no hurt would come of it , and therefore submitted and yielded to lodge with Sension without making disturbance in a strange house .

Barber , being awakened , and feeling what Sension was about , was in a great strait , fearing to disturb the courtiers in the other bed , and more , fearing he should be wronged .

And so Barber slept in fear all night , and in the morning told his master ... that he would lie no more with Goodman Sension .... ( 18 ) <p> Barber apparently felt some conflict about his incriminating testimony against Sension ; he testified that he was " much beholden " to Sension for " entertainment in his house " during an earlier " time of troubles , " when Barber and his wife were first married . Barber was " therefore ... much troubled " that his testimony should " in the least measure " weigh against Sension . " But , " added Barber , during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle room between Goodman Sension and his wife , " Sension , " early in the morning , used to come out of his bed chamber with his shoes on , and so passed through Barber 's room .

( 19 ) <p> Sension , it seems , was considered a good neighbor by Barber , and a kind master by Nathaniel Pond , even though both were troubled by his " sodomitical " attempts . <p> Enno 's Testimony <p> The testimony of twenty-two-year-old John Enno indicates that Sension felt remorse about his behavior , and worried about its public disclosure . Enno said that when he lodged one night with Daniel Saxton , Nicholas Sension came into the room , took the bed clothes off the sleeping Saxton , lay down in the bed by him , " and caused the bed to rock much . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Daniel , " and " went into the next room ... and prayed to God to save him from this wicked sin that he had lived in a long time . " ( 20 ) <p> Hanberry 's Testimony <p> Arthur Henberry testified that John Enno had told him that , after Sension had lain in Daniel Saxton 's bed , Enno had seen what Sension " left behind him on the thighs of Daniel Saxton . " Enno and Saxton had also told Henberry of " Sension 's proffering to give Nathaniel Pond his black horse , " apparently as an enticement for sexual favors. ( 21 ) <p> Enno 's Testimony <p> Another time , John Enno testified , he was sleeping with Nathaniel Pond . Toward morning Sension " came to the bedside and uncovered me , and seeing that it was me , he went to the other side of the bed and ... lay down by Nathaniel Pond . " Enno had many times found Sension lying by Pond 's side of the bed . Enno swore that Sension " desired me to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. " ( 22 ) <p> Hennerick 's Testimony <p> Another witness , Arthur Hennerick , also once heard Sension plead with John Enno : <p> Oh John , do not speak anything to my prejudice ; I would not have thee speak of it for a thousand pounds . I love you and your mother and all the family. ( 23 ) <p> Verdict <p> According to colonial custom , proof of completed sodomy legally required two witnesses ( or . possibly , one witness and evidence equaling a second witness ) , and Daniel Saxton alone testified to have " seen " Sension commit sodomy with Nathaniel Pond . The court , therefore , had legal grounds for finding Sension guilty of only attempted sodomy . As punishment , Sension 's entire estate , his " lodging and land in Windsor , and all his cattle and swine and household stuff of all sorts , " worth 300 pounds , were held in bond for his good behavior during his lifetime . If Sension behaved , he received no material punishment . Sension lived for twelve years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal proceedings against him . <p> Interpretation <p> Sension 's relatively lenient sentence , despite the abundant evidence of his sodomy attempts , may be due to his wealth , high status , and personal favor in the community , as much as to the colonists ' apparent reluctance after the 1660s to enforce the harsh penalty provided by their capital sodomy law . The fact that Sension 's attempted sodomy was known in the community , and continued for over thirty years before any legal charge was brought , indicates that American colonists , by the late 1600s at least , were sometimes more tolerant of sodomy ( and attempted sodomy ) than their still harsh legal codes implied . <p> Historian Linda Bissell , who discussed the Sension case in her thesis on seventeenth-century Windsor , Connecticut , suggested that before Sension was finally prosecuted under the sodomy law , the community tried other social means to control his conduct . The community , concluded Bissell , used the law " to enforce obedience only when other means had failed and violations of norms were flagrant .

The Queen City Business Guild , an organization of bar owners that would eventually become todays Greater Seattle Business Association , as well as the United Ebony Council , a black gay male organization founded in 1975 , and part of the Court of Seattle with its empresses and royalty , both used the Mocambo for early organizational meetings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the late 1960s was the Dorian Society .

The Seattle Counseling Services for Sexual Minorities , established in 1969 , was the first gay-run counseling service for gays in the country . <p> During this period there were other indicators of increased visibility . MacIver Wells opened the 611 Tavern just before the 1962 Worlds Fair to capitalize on the flood of tourists that washed through Seattle . The interior of the 611 was very conscious about serving a gay clientele . The dTcor was designed to provide maximum visibility for patrons - including mirrors on the wall . Like most bars in Seattle both gay and straight alike , it was subject to the " blue laws " preventing activities ranging from patrons holding drinks while standing up , or the number of chairs at the bar . <p> In addition to the restrictive blue laws , many gay barsincluding the 611were also part of the police payoff system .

" <p> In the early 1960s , the Golden Horseshoe became Seattle 's first regular-hours bar where men could dance openly with men . In exchange for this " privilege , " the owners had to pay the police $50 per week , plus $15 a night for a cop to monitor the door on Fridays and Saturdays . Police pay-offs were common in this time period , a means of fending off harassment and keeping the bars open . In the late ' 60s , a group of bar owners joined forces with the FBI to expose the pay-off system ; scores of Seattle police were dismissed and some were sent to prison .

Although her career as an elected official was short , her impact was significant considering the political climate of the country during the 1960s . She was a pioneer who paved the way for countless Americans to participate in the electoral process . <p> Barbara Charline Jordan was born on February 21 , 1936 to Ben Meredith and Arlene Patten Jordan . She was the third child of the couple and was raised along with her two older sisters in Houstons Fifth Ward . Ben was a strict father and governed his house in a manner consistent with his fundamentalist Baptist religious beliefs . Arlene was a domestic worker and housewife heavily involved in the church . Arlenes grandfather , Edward A. Patton , served in the state legislature after reconstruction and was one of the last African Americans to do so in Texas until his great-granddaughter , Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Ed Patten , was an influential figure in Barbaras life . He encouraged her to forge her own path and validated her intellect as a means to succeed . Throughout her life , Jordan credited her grandfather for the encouragement he provided in her early years . Ben also received some of the credit for Barbaras achievement . His strict parenting and emphasis on achievement resulted in all of his daughters being excellent students . He expected his daughters to participate in church activities at Good Hope Missionary Baptist Church . This is where young Barbara learned that she had a gift for oration . The community nurtured her gift and she often recited religious poetry or scripture at her church or at others within the community . <p> In the color-conscious black community , then and now , Barbaras appearance as a big , dark-skinned woman prevented her from gaining popularity based on appearance . However , her wit , intellect , and charm won over those who did n't  see her as " traditionally " attractive . At Phyllis Wheatley High School , she was awarded " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black attorney who went on to become the Assistant States Attorney in Cook County , spoke at a Wheatley Career Day . Seeing this eloquent and successful black woman had a significant impact on Barbaras decision to attend law school . <p> During this time , the University of Texas at Austin was embroiled in a legal battle over its segregationist policies . Instead of changing those policies , local politicians and the administration formed an alternative school , Texas Southern University , to accommodate black students who were not permitted to attend the University of Texas or its law school . Because Texas Southern was hastily assembled , the pre-law track was not established . Barbara spent her college years taking courses that were not related to the law necessarily . Ultimately , she spent an additional year taking pre-law courses before her graduation . <p> At university , Barbara pledged the Delta Sigma Theta sorority , as they were not as color-conscious as some of the other sororities . Throughout her life , Barbara continued to be active , as an alumna , in the Delta Sigma Theta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern , Jordan also became involved in the debate team where she developed her oratory skills . Her debate team won against many schools around the country , black and white . Traveling with the debate team allowed Barbara to see how her community was insulated from the daily prejudices experienced by many blacks living in a racially segregated society . Tom Freeman , the TSU debate coach , encouraged Barbara to consider Boston University School of Law instead of attending the law school at Texas Southern . Her parents and sisters sacrificed financially so that Barbara could attend Boston University School of Law . <p> Through her experiences in Boston , Jordan was able to develop the interpersonal skills that would allow her to gain access to the predominately closed circle of white Texas politicians .

In 1960 , she volunteered at the Kennedy-Johnson campaign headquarters . She began by doing basic office tasks , but when a speaker for the campaign was unable to attend an event , Jordan filled in . As a result , she began speaking at other campaign events . The district in which she campaigned had an 80% voter turnout .

Jordan had two unsuccessful runs for the Texas senate . Due to a reapportionment in Texas , in 1966 she was elected to represent the newly formed District 11 that was primarily African American . <p> Jordan served in the Texas senate from 1967 to 1972 and was the first black woman in the states history to serve .

She was so successful in this endeavor that in her last year in the Texas senate , her colleagues selected Jordan as president pro tempore of the senate . As is customary , for that position , she served as Governor of Texas for a day . She was the first African American woman to serve in that capacity . <p> From the Texas senate , Jordan was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1972 and was selected as member of the House Judiciary Committee .

She continued to be politically active , serving as special counsel on ethics for Governor Ann Richards . She was invited to speak at the Democratic National Convention again in 1992 . Two years later , Jordan was asked to head the Commission on Immigration Reform by former President Bill Clinton and was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in that same year . <p> Jordan was intensely private during her life and was never public about her sexual orientation or the relationship she had with Nancy Earl .

She was adept at politics and it showed in the relationships that she nurtured with politicians of opposing political views such as Senator Hardeman .

Circumstances and events that once seemed inextricably a part of lesbian culture and even of the definition of lesbianism itself have constantly come and gone throughout this century . " To limit the definition of " lesbian " to one " rigid and simplistic " category or classification is counter to the actual " lived experiences of love between women , " in which a wide variety of subcultures are created by lesbians themselves .

They used to come down to the 1410 West Roosevelt Road , a gay club . <h> How would you say gays were treated in the 40s ? <p> They were treated like dogs . The vice squad was so bad . You would be taken to jail and they would put you in the laundry in jail . They would n't put you with the boys . You had to wash some old funky clothes . So it was pretty rough . <h> How did you become acquainted with the gay scene ? <p> I learned how to dance in 1939 . It was another queen who taught me , Valda Gray . I admired her .

It must have been about 1940 when she came to Chicago . She lived in Indianapolis . I met her at the Halloween Balls . Sometimes you did n't  see her for four or five months . Then when Halloween came she would come back . We did n't  have too many halls where we could dance . <h> Where would you go dance in the 40s ? <p> There was place on Roosevelt Road , called 1410 West Roosevelt road . A Jewish fellow owned it .

The boys were so hostile . They would tear your drags off , tear your wigs off . They would make nasty remarks . They would say stuff like " come on in and suck my dick " but I needed some money , and I borrowed a drag from one of the queens . I had put my make up on it , and get on the street corner and shock the people . Cuz we wore grease paint you know . Well anyway , it was Max Factor grease paint , No. 8 . <p> And I told my best friend , she said " Where are you going ? " I had just turned on 43rd street and King Drive . " Well I am going to 1410 .

I got on this streetcar , and this little lady was sitting right across from me , you know , and here I got all this make up on , the eyelashes , the lipstick and everything , and Cuban heels ( cause I did n't  dance in high heels Cuban heels are much lower and can grip the floor better . ) All the queens danced in heels but I did n't  trust them . <p> So anyway this lady was sitting right across from me , and then comes this dude : " Hey baby you sure do look good !

I just sat there and crossed my legs . <p> So we arrived at Roosevelt Road , I got off at Roosevelt road and I could see everybody going looking out of the window , where is this man going with all this makeup on . And when I got to 1400 , it was on Friday night , Jeanne Leroux was slick , she went in with the band boys , because she knew they werent going to bother her with the band boys . <p> When I got off the streetcar , I saw the punks right there my heart fell .

" And she said " Well , were not going to start the show right now , well wait until it gets a little more crowded . " <h> Describe the crowd at these clubs where you were dancing ? <p> It was a straight crowd , totally black , a Jewish guy owned the club , his son was the bartender and his nephew was behind the bar too .

We could do the band chorus , and we all had what we called the line , the half line , and we could do that and then we would do the special thing called the middle number , then we would do the finale . So he told us , " Work one more show , I 'll give you another $10 . " We 'd already made $10 , so this was $20 , that was good change .

She said " Yeah , child , but let 's go up to the bar and have a drink . " And she knew I did n't  drink that much . I just took a shot . The band was happy to have us because that meant they were making more money too . <p> So anyway , we did the third show , we rocked the house . It was just like a circus . It was just me and Jeanne Leroux . And the crowd had got really mellow . And he told us we could do another show , a fourth show because it was still early , it was n't even 12 oclock . So we did the fourth show and that was good money . So , I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe , but I learned something by going to the different clubs , I take my money and put it down in here , see <p> First I would wrap it up in a handkerchief , a little small ladys handkerchief and I would put a pin in there and put it down in here cause they was n't going down in theretheyd make you take your shoes off , but theyd never thought about of going down in your dress . So , about 2 oclock and Jeanne said " you going now or are you going to wait for the band ? " I wanted to go down to 43rd to go to the Fred Robertsons , because his tavern was open all night long . So Jeanne said " Are you going to leave now ? " I said " yes , child , I 'll see you later . " <p> And when I walked out that tavern , they reached for me . And I stepped back , the boy , his name was Little Cap ( later on , we became real tight ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ! " I said " What did I do to you ? " I had kept one $5 out . I said " You all want some wine ? " They drank wine . " Yeah , sissy , you gone get us some wine ? " " Yeah ! " So I gave them the money , he went into the tavern , got the wine , brought it back , gave me my change . <p> And an old lady was standing there , just looking at me . She could n't imagine me looking like that and I 'm a man , with all this makeup on . I asked her " Would you like some of my cologne ? " And they had a cologne named " Park and Tilford " and you put that on and you could smell me up to 99th street . It was just that strong . So I took it and gave her a little bit around here . I won her over . <p> It was n't the boys , which I found out later on in life , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't the boys . " He wants to be like us , go kick his ass . " I gave her a pair of earrings too . And this guy took me over to see his mother and next weekend I went over there . <h> What about the Drag Balls ? <p> Thered have a big band , maybe about seven or eight pieces in the band , and everybody would be dancing with one another , and theyd be drinking . They had tables like a cabaret , and youd dance with your friend or youd dance with someone elses friend . And the lesbians would be there , not to many of them , and they would dance with the queens . <p> The first lesbian I danced with , I thought was a man . Her name was Billy , and I thought Billy was a man until she told me " No baby , it ai n't  like that .

At 3:30 a.m. on Sunday morning , May 11 , 2003 , Gunn , who identified as an aggressive or " AG " butch , was waiting for a bus at the corner of Broad and Market Streets in downtown Newark .

On Thursday afternoon , while hundreds of mourners at City Hall denounced her killing and demanded civic action to create safe spaces for LGBT young people , the suspect in her murder , Richard McCullough , 29 , turned himself in to Newark police .

The first Newark chapter of Parents and Families of Lesbians and Gays ( PFLAG ) was founded , and the national organization established a scholarship in her memory . <p> In the coming months and years , LGBT Newarkers drew increasing attention to the tragic consequences of stigma , exclusion , harassment , and violence . However , they also repeatedly encountered bureaucratic obstacles and a failure on the part of public officials to deliver needed resources .

In office , he created the Mayors Advisory Commission on LGBTQ Concerns , with Darnell Moore as its founding chair .

At a critical point in the campaign , Foster helped implement a midnight signature gathering campaign in San Francisco gay bars in advance of the state primary deadline that helped McGovern be the first candidate to submit the required signatures that morning .

Kathy Wilch , a speaker at the Democratic National Convention , gave a divisive speech opposing the Gay Liberation Plank and halted approval of its inclusion in the Democratic Party Platform .

The Conspiracy of Silence suppressing advocacy for gay rights on the national political level continued to be a pervasive stance of the Democratic Party during this era. 2526 <p> After the Democratic Convention , Carter made some efforts to reach out to lesbian and gay constituents through adult media . Playboy Magazine released an interview where Carter made it clear that he would sign a bill to extend equal rights to gay people , and his wife said at the time " I do not think that homosexuals should be harassed .

The 1975 bill removed Californias anti-sodomy laws that criminalized sex between consenting adults of the same gender . Sodomy laws had long been used in states around the nation to criminalize homosexuality. 29While the laws had been used in practice sporadically , the practical impact was to silence lesbians and gay men about their sexuality . If someone came out about being gay and having a partner , sodomy laws made it that this person was in effect admitting to being a criminal .

With all of this success , more people wanted to get involved in politics and the Alice B. Toklas Club . An election was held in 1977 for Club President , and membership grew significantly . 107 members showed up to vote for the elections and 26 members were elected as officers to the club . With these elections , Alices moderate , professional insider style became a sore point for many in the community who felt the club did n't  speak for them at that time . <p> January 1978 Edition of the " Gay Vote Newsletter " of the " Gay Democratic Club " ( later known as the " Harvey Milk Democratic Club " ) when Harvey Milk was sworn into office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings about the most raw of human emotions and Harvey Milksrise to power awakened the city , bringing about new possibilities , and unfortunately new hostilities that had not been experienced in the past . <p> After two unsuccessful bids for Supervisor in 1973 and 1975 , Harvey Milk was elected Supervisor after a new system of district elections was established in 1977 . Known as the " Mayor of Castro Street " , Harvey was the first openly gay man elected to the Board of Supervisors , and he won as a grassroots candidate without the support of Alice . Members of Alice believed Harvey was too left in his politics to win , so the Club backed another gay candidate , Rick Stokes . But Harvey did win the election and made history , leaving Alice to consider its decision . One important historic aspect of Milks win was the recognition that grassroots politics could be successful . Alice members believed that politics was an insider game , and that outsiders could n't make it into positions of power . Milks win disproved this and set about a rethinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because Alice did not support Harvey , his supporters formed the " Gay Democratic Club " which eventually became the Harvey Milk Democratic Club after Harvey was assassinated . The Milk Club ultimately became the left-leaning voice in LGBT politics for the city , while Alice became positioned as the moderate voice in LGBT politics . A third club , the Stonewall Democratic Club , formed in Los Angeles and established chapters all over the country , with a San Francisco chapter established for much of the 1970 's and 1980 's . This club also became quite influential in San Francisco politics for some time , especially under the leadership of Gary Parker . With Stonewall and Milk , San Francisco now had three clubs for gay activists to choose from , whereas Alice had been the only game in town just a few years before . 3031323334 <p> In 1977 , when Harvey Milk and George Moscone were newly elected , the Alice B.

" Five years after the Supreme Court made its ruling on Roe vs . Wade , the religious right began to organize all over the country , linking feminism and gay rights as shared targets in their cultural war . Jerry Falwell created his " Moral Majority " 37 and Anita Bryant waged a Save our Children campaign in Florida , while in California , State Senator Briggs jumped into the act by placing his Measure 6 on the ballot to ban gay people from teaching . The " No on 6 Campaign " backfired on Briggs and turned out to be a huge success story for LGBT Californians . Briggs lost his initiative after Alice and other LGBT organizations rallied together across the state . The campaign became a context for training young activists and supported networking among LGBT organizations . The conservative loss temporarily slowed the religious rights crusade against gays .

On November 27th , 1978 , Supervisor Dan White climbed through an open window of City Hall and gunned down Supervisor Harvey Milk as well as Mayor George Moscone . It was a day when everyone grieved and the assassination changed San Francisco forever . <p> Dan White assassinated Milk and Moscone just days after the Mayor signed into law Milks Gay Rights Ordinance that White opposed . The LGBT Community held a massive , peaceful candle light vigil in Harveys memory following news of the murders . Later that year , White was brought to trial outside of San Francisco , and a suburban jury found him guilty of " voluntary manslaughter " and gave White 7 years in prison , a sentence widely criticized as too lenient . The jury supported the verdict on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood sugar was so high , that he snapped and went temporarily insane . This infamous " Twinkie " defense sparked outrage within the LGBT community , for justice had not been done . Following the verdict , the " White Night Riots " broke out in San Francisco , and over 160 people ended up in the hospital . The riots directed anger at the SFPD , as Dan White had been a former police officer , and a string of police related incidents occurring around the time of the verdict led to an environment of tension between the community and the police . ( For more about the Police and LGBT community tensions at that time , Uncle Donalds Castro Street history has some interesting information : http : **36;34;TOOLONG ) <p> Amidst all of this turmoil , the leadership of Alice was torn about how to respond .

" 42 <p> As Walters mentioned , a string of issues had been creating tension between the community and the SFPD . The Pegs Place incident involved officers entering a lesbian establishment and assaulting women patrons with little action taken afterwards by the SFPD to respond to the incident .

@@107290679 @2690679/ <p> Queen City Comes Out : Exploring Seattle 's Lesbian and Gay History provides highlights of LGBT history in Seattle drawn from the History Project members collective research conducted over the last 15 years . This is an overview of the early history of taverns in Pioneer Square , the formation of early organizations that led to the flourishing of lesbian and gay community in the 1970s , and the early responses to the challenges of the 1980s &amp; 90s . <h> Women 's Bars - Oral Histories <p> Gail McDougall talked about the initiation process many women went through on their first venture into a lesbian bar : <p> GAIL : " The first time , they usually had to be escorted by somebody who was known . I would usually take the person in and introduce them , and of course , they had to show I.D . to prove they were twenty-one . I was introduced by somebody who took me in the back door , because I was under twenty-one . I would suggest that they wear jeans and a flannel shirt that was basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and until they decided what they wanted to be , I would make them dress butch . " <p> In other oral histories we 've conducted , its not uncommon to hear of women carrying their " butch " clothes in a bag or purse , and changing at the bar , rather than be seen in pubic . At the same time , it is important to be aware of the economic limits of womens lives during the middle decades of the 20th century . With exceptions , women had less expendable income , and thus had different social patterns than men . In our research , for example , we 've found that lesbian history often takes us away from the bars and into the private homes of women during the 1940s , 50s and 60s in which personal networks of friends and lovers played a much more important role than public spaces such as taverns and bars . Obviously , these sorts of histories are more difficult to track , making the recovery of Seattles lesbian history all the more challenging and interesting . It also reminds us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of bars and bathhouses . <p> Nonetheless , lesbians were part of the Pioneer Square scene during the postwar era , and did begin to create their own public spaces . In the middle to late 50s , for example , the Grand Union was located through an unmarked door under a street overpass . Sapphos Tavern operated in Pioneer Square since the 1950s moving to Prefontaine Place in the 1970s . In the 1970s , as a result of the womens rights movement and feminism , womens spaces proliferated . The Greek Torch , and the Silver Slipper on the east edge of Pioneer Square , as well as spaces in the University District and Fremont neighborhoods , were often gathering places for lesbian feminists during the 1970s . <p> Mary Scott , Silver Slipper <p> The Silver Slipper at that time was on -- 210 South Jackson . So we went down there a lot -- for about a year or so . And there were still quite a few of the bar regulars , but it seems to me that the older women just kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them just simply were overwhelmed . They just could n't understand or cope with all of this big influx of feminist , out , wild lesbians . A lot of them did n't  look or act like lesbians , and they werent into butch and femme . Or everybody looked butch . You could n't tell the butches from the femmes ! ... <p> But a lot of the younger non-feminist bar regulars , who were roughly our age -- in their twenties and early thirties -- stayed , and there was some social pushing and shoving , so to speak , a period of adjustment on both sides . ... <p> The Slipper was a womens bar . It was a lesbian bar . Occasionally a man would come in , but he would be a gay man . He was kind of an oddity , you know ? He was there because maybe he knew one of the bartenders , or maybe he was a friend or a brother of a customer there that night , or whatever . He had a legitimate tie , and nobody really minded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in . And you could pretty well tell , after a while , whether the men had a legitimate reason for being there , or whether he was with a woman friend or wife -- and they were there looking for a lesbian to go home with them for perverse three-way kinds of sex ? . <p> So when you would see a mixed couple zeroing in on a woman who was by herself and started buying her drinks , you knew what was going on . And other lesbians would move in to protect her , or they would try to intervene and either get her out -- if she was too drunk to get out -- somebody would take her either to her home or to their home , or to somewhere for the night . Or they would try to get the het couple to leave peaceably . <p> Or they would distract them , or as a last resort -- and I saw this happen more than once . Some lesbian would go to the bar and get a beer , and come back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beer on the guy . " Oh , I 'm so sorry ! Oh -- spill over here ! Somebody bring a rag !

Pisces and her lover , Ann Occhi , and their friends , lovers Pennie Kubla and Judy Brandt , decided to start such an organization in Las Vegas with several women who had been members of Friends , and part of the Womens Concerns Group of the defunct political organization , Nevadans for Human Rights. 2 <p> Women Uniteds first organizational meeting was held on Wednesday , February 4 , 1987 . Even though it was founded by lesbians for lesbians , WUN 's documents and literature were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deference to its closeted members . Nowhere in the newsletters or founding papers does the word " lesbian " appear ; in fact , Article II in the organization 's first bylaws notes that " The primary goal of WUN is to enrich the quality of life not only for women , but for all persons regardless of ethnic background , religion , gender or sexual orientation . " To this end , among the first advisors of the group was a gay man , Michael Loewy , founder of the Desert and Mountain States conferences and president of the University of Nevada , Las Vegas 's Lesbian Gay Academic Union . Despite Mike Loewys advisory role , men were not allowed to join WUN or attend its meetings . Even when confronted with a male-to-female transgendered person who wanted to join , Pennie Kubla recalls , " Members were uncomfortable and kept her out . " 3 As far its public face went , WUN 's lesbian identity remained hidden nearly to the end of its existence . Even in the local gay press , WUN was described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Born as a largely underground movement in feminist and lesbian-feminist political culture of the 1970s , women 's music grew into an important means of lesbian expression . The movement , however , had passed Las Vegas by. 7 Women United member Judy Corbisiero , who had produced women 's music in upstate New York before she moved to Las Vegas in 1983 to be with her lover , Gudrun Fonfa , was the person who worked to bring that movement to southern Nevada . Judy had been shocked by the absence of womens music or culture in Las Vegas , and it was Gudrun who encouraged her to renew her East Coast contacts , and provided seed money for Judy to begin producing WUNs musical events . The first concert Judy produced in Las Vegas as WUN Productions was a performance by the Fabulous Dyketones at WUN 's " Christmas , Solstice , Hannukah , Season 's Greetings " party at the Sahara Hotel on December 11 , 1988 . The party was a success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so tight , the Dyketones crashed at Judys and Gudruns house ( Read Judy Corbisiero 's recollections of women 's music in the 1970s ) . 8 <p> Over the next two years Judy and Gudrun brought some of the most famous artists in women 's music to Las Vegas for WUN events . These included Alix Dobkin , Debbie Fier , Deidre McCalla , Chris Williamson and Tret Fure , Lucy Blue Tremblay , Dianne Davidson , and local duo Cashmere and Silk . Judy recalls that Las Vegas womens audiences werent as receptive to the more political performers , but loved the comedians she brought to town , such as Monica Grant and Lyn Lavner. 9 Unfortunately , these womens concerts werent profitable , and while they were important vehicles for establishing womens culture in Las Vegas , Women United soon stopped sponsoring concerts altogether and returned to its cozy social roots of picnics and dances and parties at Lake Mead. 9 <h> Political Fractures <p> There had been contention brewing at Women United for some time between those who wanted to keep the organization social and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminist-identified .

Several women , led by Judy Corbisiero , left Women United to found the Womens Herstorical Society whose purpose was to buy a building in which to establish a womens center , open a womens bar and music production facility , establish a library and coffee house , and offer a job-training service. 11 <p> The Herstorical Society sponsored several events to raise money , including a concert by musician/storytellers Caryl and Ardy in November 1989 , performances by Monica Grant and Teresa Trull , and a Lesbian Prom Night in the Royal Pavilion of the Four Queens Hotel on Fremont Street in 1990 . While none of these events was particularly successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herstorical Society--Judy Corbisiero lost $1500 of her own money and realized there was n't enough interest in the lesbian community to found a women 's center . The Herstorical Society died and its members drifted back into WUN. 12 <p> Women United , however , never recovered from its political fractures . There were other women 's groups forming in the community which drained away WUN members and much of its purpose . It was also victim to burnout which afflicts most organizations eventually . In addition , there was a religious element some felt worked toward the demise of Women United when overzealous members of the Metropolitan Community Church MCC , who belonged to WUN , proselytized the other women , urging them to join MCC. 13 <p> Women United lingered on through 1993 when the group rewrote its bylaws to at last state clearly that it was an organization " formed by and for lesbians .

There was enough money left in the treasury to throw a Valentine 's Day dance at the Gipsy where the group 's first Valentine 's Day dance had been held six years before . In a gracious last gesture to the community , Women United of Nevada gave its coveted membership list to the newly-founded Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Southern Nevada. 15

It begins with the story of Aunt Leila , who lived in a couple relationship with another woman but never , as far as her namesake knows , identified as a lesbian . Rupp thinks about Aunt Leila to raise questions about what we can and can not know about history , about categories and identities , and about historical interpretation .

Romantic friendshipspassionate , intense , loving , physically affectionate relationshipsdeveloped between same-sex friends in the homosocial worlds of the middle and upper classes .

With the emergence of an urban working class came the formation of a culture in which sexuality was more public and , for women , less confined to marriage . Until late in the century this working-class subculture was overwhelmingly heterosexual for women , but men began earlier to make contact with other men for both intra- and interclass sexual encounters . <p> In the late nineteenth century , " homosexuality " and " heterosexuality " first came into being as categories into which people might be placed and might place themselves . Earlier , expressing desire for a person of the same sex , or engaging in a same-sex sexual act , or falling in love with someone of the same sex did not mean that one merited designation as a special kind of person . With the rise of a consumer society came increased emphasis on sexual expressiveness and public discussion of sexuality . Subcultures of those with same-sex desires began to coalesce .

Men and women with same-sex desires knew where to gather , used certain terms to identify themselves , and developed codes of dress and behavior that marked them as particular kinds of people . But it was not just in the notorious locations such as Greenwich Village , Harlem , and San Francisco that women and men were able to meet others with similar sexual desires .

In the building of what came to be named " lesbian " and " gay " communities we can see the origins of the modern world in which we live . <p> By the mid-twentieth century , the Second World War and the " lavender scare " of the postwar years had major consequences for those with same-sex desires . Mobilization for war brought about increased geographic mobility , and the sex-segregated nature of both the military and war industry heightened the chance that individuals with unexpressed or unacknowledged same-sex desires would make contact with others who shared those feelings .

With the revelation of her transition from male to female , Christine Jorgensen educated the public on the subject of transsexuality . Her story forced doctors and scientists to revisit the terms of sexuality and reveal the distinctions between homosexuality and transsexuality . Christine Jorgensen managed to take her personal story and turn it into a tale of inspiration and awareness . <p> Christine Jorgensen was born as George Jorgensen Jr . on May 30 , 1926 to parents George Jorgensen and Florence Davis Hansen Jorgensen in the Bronx . She was born into a Danish-American family and was raised with the help of a close-knit extended family ( Meyerowitz , 53 ) . Her father was the primary bread earner and her mother was a devoted stay at home wife , who looked after her husband and children ( Moore ) . In essence , Christine enjoyed a pleasant childhood . The family lived in a nice neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public school , attended summer camp and went on family vacations ( Meyerowitz , 53 ) . Hers was a typical , white , middle-class upbringing . <p> From an early age , Christine noticed that something was wrong and she felt that she was different from other boys her age ( Shuman ) . As a young child , Christine hated everything associated with boys . She hated short hair , hated boys clothing and did not enjoy things such as fighting or participating in sports , like many of the boys her age did . Instead of sports and fighting , toy trucks and cars , Christine dreamed of playing with girls and baby dolls ( Moore ) . She also found herself becoming envious of her sister Dorothy and her beautiful long hair , and resented the fact that she and Dorothy were not alike ( Moore ) . Christine would later state that the feelings concerning her identity made her feel extremely unhappy and hopeless as a child . She knew something was wrong , but could not do anything about it ( Moore ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her also began to notice that she was in fact different from other boys but summed it up as Christine exhibiting female tendencies ( Moore ) . <p> As Christine reached her teenage years it became more obvious to her and others that she was different from all the other boys . One thing in particular that made Christine realize that she was different from those around her were the feelings of attraction which she began to develop for other males , specifically male friends ( Moore ) . Although Christine developed strong feelings for some of her male friends , she later recalled that she never received any of the same feelings from them in return ( Moore ) . At this point , Christine felt extremely confused and torn about her sexuality and her attraction to men . Despite the fact that she had developed feelings and was attracted to other men , she refused to admit or accept the fact that she might be gay ( Shuman ) . Instead , Christine felt that she was a woman who had somehow ended up in the wrong body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Shuman ) . <p> After Christine graduated from high school in 1945 , she unsuccessfully tried to enlist in the army twice but was rejected because of her small stature ( Moore ) . After being denied entrance into the U.S. army , less than six months later she was drafted . However , her small boyish stature prevented her from earning anything more than a desk job ( Moore ) . Even though Christine had tried her best to fulfill the male gender role , especially by enlisting in the army , she still did not fit in among other men . Serving in the army for a little over a year , Christine remained isolated from the other soldiers and rarely interacted with them ( Shuman ) . Not long after enlisting , Christine was honorably discharged following an illness . <p> Christine then moved to Hollywood in hopes of finding a job as a photographer but soon after discovered this was not as simple as she thought it would be ( Moore ) .

At the same time , she still continued to look for answers concerning her feelings and turmoil in her life as a man ( Moore ) . While in Connecticut , Christine read about an endocrinologist who was performing experiments with hormones on animals ( Meyerowitz , 54 ) . Christine wondered if hormonal treatment could possibly be the answer she had always searched for . After her discovery , Christine contacted a noted endocrinologist , Dr. Harold Grayson , who immediately rejected Jorgensens wish to possibly undergo hormonal treatment in order to fix what she felt was wrong . Grayson instead referred her to a psychiatrist where she could get help in getting rid of her female inclinations ( Moore ) . Jorgensen knew this was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fix " her , still believing that there had to be a biological reason for the way that she felt ( Moore ) . Finally in May 1950 , Jorgensen traveled to Denmark after learning from a friend that medical research was being performed on transsexuals ( Shuman ) . Christine met with Dr. Christian Hamburger , a specialist on transsexuality ( Shuman ) , and he told her that she was not a homosexual but most likely a transsexual ( Shuman ) . Finally , Christine had answers that confirmed what she had always felt . <p> On September 24 , 1951 , Dr. Hamburger began Christines sex reassignment surgery free of charge as part of his experiment . He completed the series of procedures in October of 1952 . In June , 1952 , Christine shared the news of her sex change with her family in a letter where she wrote , " I have changed , changed very much , as my photos will show , but I want you to know that I am an extremely happy person and the real me , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same old " Brud . " But nature made a mistake , which I have had corrected , and I am now your daughter " ( Moore ) . Her family was very open and welcoming and declared that their love for their daughter was still the same as it had been before ( Moore ) . <p> Although it is disputed how Christines story was leaked to the press , some suggest Christine leaked it herself . Christine claims she was betrayed by a family friend , others claim it was a lab technician who revealed the story . Nevertheless , the New York Daily News broke the story of Christines transformation on December 1 , 1952 with the headline " Ex-G.I . Becomes Blonde Bombshell " ( Meyerowitz , 62 ) . After this first newspaper revelation , more and more reporters wanted in on the sensational story and immediately Christine became a media sensation . The media was obsessed with Christines physical presentation ( Meyerowitz , 63 ) , and they picked at every detail of her appearance . The newspapers buzzed about how feminine she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have successfully turned into a woman . The media wanted to know everything about her . Did she have a boyfriend ? Did she want to marry in the future ? ( Meyerowitz , 63 ) . Jorgensen used all the media attention to her advantage . After returning to New York , she began to make appearances where she shared her story , even using the spotlight to promote her night club act ( Meyerowitz , 74 ) . <p> The significance of Jorgensens story lies in the fact that she took control of her own story ( Theophano ) . Although it was first reported as a sensational story of sex reassignment , she took advantage of the media coverage and used it to educate the public on transsexualism and its distinction apart from homosexuality ( Theophano ) . Jorgensens story pushed doctors to redefine their terms on transsexuality and encouraged scientific research on surgical intervention ( Meyerowitz , 97 ) .

Her 1983 study , based on interviews with 78 women , outlines the communitys development , the constitution of its membership , and its relation to other communities within the locale . According to Krieger , members of the community identified as lesbians and feminists , were generally white and middle-class , and were " heavily academic . " The community gave members affirmation and a group identity , but it also excluded others . Some members felt a sense of ambivalence about to what extent they belonged to it . <p> Anthropologist Esther Newton , in a 1982 essay updated in 1998 , is interested in understanding why most recent social science writing about lesbians only describes white , middle-class women while implying that they constitute the whole of the lesbian community . One reason this may be , she theorizes , is that lesbian feminists were generally white middle-class women . Because lesbian feminist ideologies became hegemonic in written discourse after 1970 , this may have influenced social scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarship on gay men which , she argues , evinces more diversity and disagreement about the boundaries of " gay community .

Schneider . New York : Routledge , 1998 . <p> Scholar Barbara Ponse , in a 1978 book , draws upon interviews with women in lesbian communities to understand how lesbian identity is socially constructed . According to Ponse , identity words such as " lesbian " serve to indicate political solidarity ( such as in " woman-identified woman " ) and to demarcate difference from heterosexuality . Women in these communities disagree on which words " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesbian " are most appropriate to how they identify themselves ; each word carries a specific historical , cultural , and political meaning . For example , Ponses interviewees view bisexuality and femme-butch role-playing as problematic . <p> Ponse also asserts there is a common " gay trajectory " that typifies identity construction in the lesbian world . In this " gay trajectory , " lesbians first understand themselves to be different from heterosexuals . After accepting their feelings , they accept a lesbian identity ( they " come out " ) . At this point , they seek a community . <p> In this important article , poet and theorist Adrienne Rich asserts that male oppression of women is based in part upon compulsory female heterosexuality . Much feminist scholarship , she argues , does not examine the institution of heterosexuality . Feminist scholarship that contributes to lesbian marginality is in fact detrimental to the cause of womens liberation . Indeed , lesbian lives are more profoundly female , woman-identified , and in opposition to patriarchy than heterosexual lives . <p> Rich also asserts that we should not limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future genital sexual experience . Instead , Rich develops the term " lesbian continuum " to mean " a rangethrough each womans life and throughout historyof woman-identified experience embracing many more forms of primary intensity between and among women , including the sharing of a rich inner life , the bonding against male tyranny , the giving and receiving of practical and political support , " as well as marriage resistance and intimate girl friendships . For Rich , the realization of this continuum shows that women have throughout history always resisted male oppression . <p> African American lesbian feminist Barbara Smith , in the 1982 introduction to Home Girls , writes that after nine years of organizing " there is now a vital movement of women of color in this country . " The publication of Home Girls is meant to further that movement by reaching more Black people . Smith argues that because Black women experience both racism and sexism simultaneously , they should consider not only allying themselves with Black Nationalist and Third World liberation movements , but also with feminism . This is because their experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Smith asserts that Black womens longstanding resistance to slavery and sexual violence point to innate feminist potential , even if many Black women have not called themselves " feminist .

Stein asserts that the Radicalesbians encouraged lesbians to prioritize gender identification rather than sexual identity . The term " lesbian , " in this context , implied a separation from gay male communities and politics . The lesbian was not merely a sexual being , but was " woman-identified " in partnership with straight women more than with gay men . Stein shows , however , that some Radicalesbians continued to work with gay men , and that some continued to view themselves as allied with gay liberation . <p> Sociologists Verta Taylor and Nancy Whittier are interested in explaining " collective identities " on a theoretical level . Taylor and Whittier draw upon symbolic interactionist theory to posit that the concepts of " boundaries , " " consciousness , " and " negotiation " at work on the level of daily lived interactionscharacterize the construction of collective identity in social movements . They point out that boundaries are central to the formation of collective identity . Lesbian feminists , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Music Festival and lesbian publishing houses . They have also developed a distinct world of " female values " that comprise egalitarianism , caring , and collectivism . <p> " Consciousness , " for Taylor and Whittier , denotes interpretive frameworks emerging from a recognition of shared interests , such as that lesbianism subverts patriarchy . " Negotiation " amounts to the ways social movements work to change symbolic meanings , such as through adjusting ones self-presentation to be more androgynous in opposition to beauty norms .

" God always was , always will be , always remains the same , " Sister Perpetua made our class repeat . To my nose-to-the-grindstone , tradition-bound Italian family , it was n't only God who remained the same .

A college student during the Vietnam War era , I had my head turned around by the antiwar movement , especially the priests and nuns who were making protest against the war a way of life . The war seemed wrong to me . I had to take my personal stand in relation to the military draft , and I had to do what I could to stop what seemed like a moral nightmare . <p> I remember thinking , " how could my country do this ?

A new generation was writing a new history . Instead of history being the story of the rich , famous , and powerful , it was becoming the story of everyone . Slaves , factory workers , miners , housewives : you name it , and someone for sure was writing their history . The past was now peopled with ordinary folks and their stories , the kind of stories that , when I was a kid , my mom told me about her parents and their immigrant generation . There was drama and heroism and tragedy in these lives . <p> I was learning all this in New York City in the early 1970s . Gay Liberation was swirling all around me . It was only a matter of time before I found my way to it , and it to me .

The word out on the street , so to speak , was that , until Stonewall , all homosexuals , all queers , had led secret , shameful lives , isolated from one another , invisible to everyone . <p> By chance ( but is anything ever really chance ? ) , I ended up one Saturday in 1973 at a Manhattan apartment with a group of folks talking about the need to produce new knowledge that could get added to the toolbox of gay and lesbian liberation . Jonathan Ned Katz was there . His play , Coming Out ! , based on historical documents he had painstakingly uncovered , was electrifying audiences in New York . Soon , his massive book , Gay American History , would demonstrate to anyone who picked it up that there was a rich queer history waiting to be harvested , if only some of us would do the spadework .

We got excited by reading old newspapers and letters or by finding the survivors of a much older queer generation so we could interview them and capture their stories . Do n't get me wrong : I did have sex in the 70s . But doing history was sublime . <p> Some of my most vivid memories of the 1970s and early 1980s are of times when our history went public . In those days , universities were not falling over each other to hire queer scholars and offer queer courses . Those of us doing gay and lesbian history did it in community spaces , before audiences attracted by the flyers we pasted all over town . I remember Joan Nestle , of the Lesbian Herstory Archives , giving her talk on " the voices we have lost , " with barely a dry eye in the audience .

Judith Schwarz shared stories about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World War I era .

There was magic in these rooms as audiences thrilled to images of queer worlds and queer lives they never dreamed existed . <p> Sometimes I think this magic has been lost . Such excitement has become history , a thing of the past . Many undergraduates today can take courses on LGBT history . Some of us who do this research now have academic jobs . Any good bookstore will have a shelf or two on gay and lesbian studies .

" <p> Bradford 's declaration is a good reminder that rebellion was in the air here in Chicago more than forty years ago . It was percolating from the ground up , on the streets and in the bars and in the parks , wherever queers found themselves in confrontation with the law . Stonewall was one expression of that , but it did n't need to be imported to Chicago from New York to rile people up . There were more than enough home-grown grievances to start the talk about " Gay Power . "

When Orlovsky read from his collection , Clean Asshole Poems , regent Lilly Fong and her entourage left the performance in an elaborate huff .

Collins got " tired of people who were whatever they were by day and fairies by night . " Will produced fliers with intertwined male and female symbols and his telephone number and pinned them on campus billboards . He also slipped ads into the student newspaper , the Rebel Yell , which read simply , " I M R U ?

" One early commentator , Fleta , says such criminals " should be buried alive . " Either burning or burying were the punishments " used for this crime among the ancient Goths , " says Blackstone . " By now , " he adds , " the general punishment of all felonies is the same , namely , by hanging .

According to him , such crimes could be perpetrated between men , between women , between men and women ( including between a man and his wife or a man and a prostitute ) , with animals ( which he considered the worst crime ) , with one oneself , or with non-Christians .

Gunn , a fifteen-year-old black lesbian , was returning home from the Christopher Street Pier in New York , and was killed when she resisted McCulloughs advances .

Tremendous advances have been made in the past decade , yet the earlier history of Queer Newark remains largely overlooked , despite excellent work already written in different fields . <p> Sakia Gunn in many ways represents the multifaceted legacy of this history : tragic at times , but also bold , defiant , and resistant .

In a recent conversation , the subject of Anita Bryant came up and Neal Parsons stated that there was group of about a dozen people from Richmond in Norfolk and it was the first time many of the had ever stood up in public as gay or lesbian ; this was a risky action at the time and some of them were on the news . Parsons stated he was n't aware , however , of anyone suffering negative consequences from this action . Bryants campaign was publicized nationally and her visits to Virginia spurned Richmond citizens to action .

The keynote was given by author and activist Karla Jay . The rally participants capped off the event with a reception at the Pace Memorial United Methodist Church and a dance at the Sheraton. 3 In a conversation with Beth Marschak , she emphasized that the coalition of groups that had come together , including RLF , wanted to focus on a positive message to counter Bryants message and not focus on Bryant herself . <p> Marschak also emphasized that the Rally at Monroe Park was also one of the early examples of the gay and lesbian community reaching out and gaining the support of allied groups , specifically religious groups in the area .

" The City of Richmond targeted gay men in this area under its solicitation law . Credit ML <p> Although the primary response of the community was the rally , several members of the community did attend the performance and confronted Bryant at the UR concert .

Parsons told Bryant how she was hurting gay people and Garnett argued religion and the bible primarily with Bryant 's husband . Their words must have made an impression because Bryant was later to mention the incident in an interview with Playboy. 5 In a conversation with Neal , he noted that his response to the comments made by Bryant was also published in Playboy ; he had responded with a letter to the editor because Bryants recollections of the event twisted what he and Garnett had said . Weeks after the confrontation , October , 22 , 1977 , Parsons and Garnett , along with Tony Segura , continued their activism , helping to form the Richmond Gay Rights Association ( GRA or RGRA ) . 6 <p> The Richmond Gay Rights Association formed to " formulate action programs aimed at the repeal , enactment and modification of laws and ordinances affecting the gay and lesbian community and to formulate educational and cultural programs to promote the general community welfare .

According to the 1975 law , " police can arrest anyone for soliciting sex by word , sign or gesture or through any lewd , lascivious and indecent act . " An article in Our Own reported Richmond citizens harassed for solicitation on " The Block , " the gay male cruising area . The law was designed to reign in local massage parlors , but by 1978 was increasingly used by the police to arrest gay men for solicitation , following an increase in vice squad patrols .

The board consisted for 8 men and 8 women from across the state , involved with existing LGBTQ rights groups ; Richmonds own Barbara " Bobbi " Weinstock serving as the temporary chair. 10 The group was a loose coaltion of existing groups and the plan was to coordinate the political and educational activities around the state and create a state-wide communications network .

In 1978 , the Richmond Human Rights Commission began forming the text for a new human rights ordinance to amend the City Code of 1975 . In March , 11 Richmond clergy signed a letter supporting the inclusion of sexual orientation in the human rights ordinance , stating that it was not the " morality of a person 's sexual orientation , but rather a person 's rights and protections under the law " that was a consideration . The proposed ordinance also elicited opposition including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Attorney Cornan Mattox who said the ordinance would be illegal in Virginia and the local evening paper which urged citizens to " communicate their displeasure with individuals on the commission " and to strongly consider this ordinance when electing city council members in the fall election. 13 <p> At the June 6 meeting of the Human Rights Commission a number of people spoke for inclusion of sexual orientation in the language . Some of the speakers for the inclusion were : Beth Marschak of the Third District Womens Political Caucus , Bruce Garnett of the Richmond Gay Rights Association ( GRA ) , Barbara Weinstock of the Virginia Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Rights and Reverend Ed Meeks " Pope " Gregory. 14In a conversation with Beth Marshak , she emphasized that members of RLF chose to step up and speak for the ordinance as members of other groups they were involved with in order to indicate the widespread organizational support for the ordinance .

Her documentation of the black experience in the early twentieth century was a significant contribution to American history and folklore . She recorded the heavily metaphoric stories she heard in her childhood and throughout her travels in the regional dialect spoken by those she encountered . These stories and the experiences of her travels influenced the body of work for which she became known . <p> Born in 1891 in Notasulga , Alabama , Zora Neale Hurston was one of eight children born to John Hurston and Lucy Potts Hurston . When Zora was just a toddler , her parents moved their family to Eatonville , Florida . Eatonville was the first all black town to be incorporated in the U.S. and is still in existence today . In this town , Hurston was exposed to black achievement and sheltered from the violence and oppression present in so many cities and towns across the South . Hurstons father was a preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped to form many of the laws of the town . Lucy Hurston was a housewife , of which John was intensely proud . The Hurstons lived a confortable life in a thriving , all black town . <p> From this sheltered upbringing emerged a young woman who was forced into the outside world by the death of her mother in 1904 . She was sent to live with family in Jacksonville , FL . This led to her first job as a ladys maid for a singer touring with a Gilbert and Sullivan revue . After her father remarried , Zora returned to Eatonville briefly . She left her family home permanently after a physical altercation with her stepmother . She had not been able to finish high school so , in 1917 , in Baltimore , she registered to finish her high school courses at Morgan College . She was 26 years old at the time but reported that she was 16 to qualify for housing and other assistance .

Under the guidance of Boas , Hurston began to formalize her interest in " Negro folklore . " During this period , she embarked upon fieldwork that would be the basis for her collection of Negro folklore , Mules and Men , published in 1935 . Initially , she found it difficult to get people to tell her their folk tales because of her academic approach . Facilitated by a wealthy patron , Mrs. R. Osgood Mason , Zora resumed her fieldwork with better results . <p> While living in New York City , she also became a prominent figure in the Harlem Renaissance and contributed to the acclaimed publication Fire ! along with other greats such as Langston Hughes , Richard Bruce Nugent , and Countee Cullen .

In 1931 , she ended her brief marriage to Herbert Sheen . She collaborated on plays with prominent writers like Langston Hughes and continued to write short stories . One of her most famous pieces , " How It Feels to be Colored Me , " was featured in The World Tomorrow . <p> Zora received a Guggenheim fellowship to travel to Haiti and Jamaica to study the Yoruba-based religious practice known as Vodou . While in Haiti for this research in 1937 , Hurston produced her best-known work of fiction , Their Eyes Were Watching God .

Although she loses her love , she learned to live on her own terms . It has been speculated that the main character is loosely based on Hurston . The book was published upon her return to the U.S. in September of that same year . <p> In 1939 , Hurston received an honorary Doctor of Letters from Morgan State College and the Distinguished Alumni Award from Howard University . She continued to conduct ethnographic studies of blacks communities , traveling throughout the American South and into Central America . She published anthropological work on Voodoo in New Orleans and the black communities in Honduras . <p> In the winter of 1950 , Hurston returned to Florida to live .

Her autobiography , Dust Tracks on a Road , was published in 1941 . One of her great fears was that she would die without money or recognition . In 1945 , she wrote a letter to W.E.B . Dubois imploring him to organize resources so that notable blacks would not suffer the fate of unmarked graves and fade from history . This foretold her fate . <p> In 1959 , Zora suffered a stroke .

The court noted that ' almost all of the testimony of all the people who actually saw , examined , or talked to the children was that the children are healthy , happy , normal , loving children .

Chapter 28 , section 45 , approved November 26 , 1861 , read , " The infamous crime against nature , either with man or beast , shall subject the offender to be punished by imprisonment in the Territorial prison for a term not less than five years , and which may extend to life . " The infamous crime against nature evolved from English buggery laws , defined as homosexual or heterosexual anal intercourse and bestiality , all of which were referred to in Scottish law as sodomy. 1 <p> For more than a hundred years what became known as Nevada Revised Statute NRS 201.190Nevada 's sodomy lawwas used to terrify , blackmail , and persecute gay men by associating them with bestiality , pedophilia , and rape . With that law in place , the history of gay people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is largely a history of criminal prosecution . <h> First Attempts to Repeal the Law <p> There were several unsuccessful challenges of 201.190 , 2 but it was n't until 1993 that that statute at last was repealed--and not as the result of a court order , but through legislation passed willingly by the Nevada State Legislature . <h> Mobilizing Support <p> In April 1991 , Las Vegas Bugle publisher Rob Schlegel and Ken Tomoroy--a co-founder of the Names Project in Nevada--formed a political organization called Citizens for Equal Justice CEJ whose intent was to work toward establishing equal rights for Nevada 's gay citizens , including an effort to repeal NRS 201.190 in the 1993-94 legislative session . At the group 's second meeting on December 17 1991 , the name was changed to Nevadans for Constitutional Equality NCE . Among the 30 people who attended that meeting were Schlegel and Tomoroy , gay political advocate and columnist Lee Plotkin , Tyrone Smith , Ted Giordano , attorney Kevin Kelly , activist Judy Corbisiero , and Dr. Jerry Cade , who at that time was chairman of the anti-discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in 1992 , had urged the legislature to repeal NRS 201.190 as a tool for fighting the AIDS epidemic. 3 NCE contrived a careful strategy : NCE lobbyists would persuade an unlikely legislator , preferably a Northern Nevadan , to introduce legislation to repeal the sodomy law near the end of the session so the state 's conservative forces would n't have time to mount opposition. 4 <p> At the same time the NCE was plotting strategy , a group of wealthy , well connected A-Gays from southern Nevada was planning a behind-the scenes assault on NRS 201.190 , intending to use their money and professional and political connections in the legislature to get the sodomy law repealed . Among these were physician Mel Pohl and his lover , Deniston Kay , and businessmen Joe Lamarca , Bob Forbuss , and Dan Burdish. 5 But there was a random factor coming into the picture that no one foresaw : Democratic Nevada State Senator Lori Brown , elected in 1992 from District 7 in Las Vegas . Brown did n't know about Nevadans for Constitutional Equality , nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft SB 466 to repeal the state 's sodomy law , it came entirely from her own belief in equality for all Nevada 's citizens. 6 Brown 's request caught the gay community by surprise , which had no choice but to combine resources and get behind her . SB 466 began its journey through the Nevada legislature on May 13 , 1993 when it was introduced through the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee by Republican Senator Randolph Townsend. 7 <p> One of these connections was Robert " Bob " Fulkerson , director in 1993 of the progressive organization Citizen Alert . Fulkerson 's vast connections throughout northern Nevada , combined with Corbisiero 's connections across the state , provided an unprecedented cross-constituent support for repealing the state 's sodomy law. 8 <h> " The Issue is Freedom " <p> Despite the support SB 466 enjoyed , its journey through the legislature was n't smooth . Mormon legislators , such as Assemblyman Tom Collins , were particularly nasty in their opposition .

Dr. Paul Cameron , a discredited psychologist who led the homophobic Family Research Institute , noted an " exceptionally high rate of heart attacks " among gay men which he believed " might be related to the use of the rectum for sexual pleasure . " 9 <p> Support came from several respected scholars and religious figures who supplied affidavits in favor of repeal . These included Las Vegas 's Rabbi Mel Hecht of the Reform Movement of Judaism ; Rev. H. Darrell Lance , the widely published professor of Old Testament interpretation who easily demolished the opposition 's claims of biblical proscription of homosexuality ; and historian John Boswell , author of Christianity , Social Tolerance , and Homosexuality and Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe . In the legislature , African-American Senator Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Countys Republican Senator Mark James gave a stirring speech in which he said , " The issue here is not gay rights .

JFKs numerous affairs ( before , during and after his marriage to Jackie ) and his friendships with gay men suddenly had a social and cultural context . Criticisms from others in the Kennedy orbit insinuate that Jack took advantage of Lems love for him without reciprocating . David Pitts quotes Vidal cruelly calling Billings " a lifelong slave , " " the principal fag at court , " and a " nurse " who helped Jack deal with the pain caused by Addisons disease . <p> Indeed , it often seems that Kennedy did treat people who loved him for granted . This may have been true of his wife , although perhaps she understood that their marriage would be non-monogamous . Our most accurate accounts of JFKs carelessness are not from Lem , but from women who later came forward . For example , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes an affair she had with Kennedy , beginning in the summer of 1962 when she was 19 and ending shortly before his assassination on November 23 , 1963 . She was expected to be constantly available for him , he was inconsiderate and unloving , and she was permitted to tell no one . The affair was socially isolating for a very young and sexually unliberated woman , causing her to deceive friends , boyfriends and ultimately her husband and children for most of her adult life . <p> In many ways , Kennedy was enjoying the kind of sex life that would later characterize the gay mens " party " of the 1970s . Some of his partners saw the lifting of monogamy as liberating too , viewing their romps with the President as special and carefree episodes that they were happy to flaunt .

Informants denied that she was an intersexed individual , word of which would have been impossible to conceal from her people . Her baby name , according to Mary White Pete , was ququnok patke , ' one standing ( lodge ) pole woman . ' As a young woman she was said to have been quite large and heavy boned . She wished to marry at this time , but because of her unusual size none of the young men were attracted to her . The Kutenai girl reached maturity at the time employees of the North West Company were first entering the Kutenai country from the east . Eneas Abraham a Native informant said that a party of fur traders arrived in the Lower Kutenai region , and upon their departure she accompanied them ... <p> We are fortunate in having information about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1811 refers to her as ... <p> the Woman who three years ago was the wife of Boisverd , a Canadian , and my servant ; her conduct was then so loose that I had to request him to send her away to her friends ... 2 <p> From the above it would seem that the Kutenai woman had married Thompson 's servant , a Canadian named Boisverd in 1808 ... <p> After more than a year 's absence Madame Boisverd returned to her own people . She had a strange tale to relate . According to her story , her husband had operated upon her and thereby transformed her into a man . She told her relatives , ' I 'm a man now . We Indians did not believe the white people possessed such power from the supernaturals . I can tell you that they do , greater power than we have . They changed my sex while I was with them . No Indian is able to do that . ' Thereafter she changed her name to Kauxuma nupika , ' Gone to the spirits ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an indication of her sexual transformation . Soon she began to claim great spiritual power . Her people were unable to understand these strange happenings and some believed she was bereft of her senses . <p> Following Madame Boisverd 's return , she began to assume the habits and pursuits of the opposite sex . Men 's shirts , leggings and breech cloths were now substituted for the women 's dresses she had previously worn . She seems to have had little or no difficulty adapting herself to the new garments , since she evaded detection in such garb at Fort Astoria for an entire month . She also began to carry a gun as well as bow and arrow . Now she wished to marry a person of her own sex and is said to have approached several young unmarried women in succession , all of whom refused her ... <p> The rumor now got around that in revenge Madame Boisverd wished to bring about the death of those girls who refused her through use of her recently-acquired supernatural power . As a result people came to fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company of divorcees and widows . <p> Finally Madame Boisverd found one woman from the area along the Kootenay River , southeast of modern Nelson , B. C. , who had been abandoned by her husband and was willing to live with her . The two were now to be seen constantly together . The curious attempted to learn things from the consort but the latter only laughed at their efforts . A rumor ran through the community that Madame Boisverd had fashioned an artificial phallus of leather for use in marital intimacy but the godemiche , these inquisitive individuals surmised , failed to deceive her ' wife ' . Soon the news circulated about the camp that Madame Boisverd was becoming jealous of her companion . The former accused her friend of having an affair openly with a man and began to beat her . <p> About this time or shortly after-it is difficult to know the exact order in which some of these events take place-the Kutenai berdache , as we may now speak of her , started to gamble with a group of men at Duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrows , and bark canoe .

The berdache , in keeping with her newly assumed status , now began to manifest an interest in raiding and warfare ... <p> Her assumption of a warrior 's role ... represents a considerable achievement , greater perhaps than that of women warriors among the Plains tribes . The masculine ideal among the Kutenai , certainly the Lower Kutenai , was the skilled hunter , capable of providing game and fish for his family in a forested region of rather limited resources ... <p> The reports of modern Kutenai disagree as to the details of the berdache 's first war excursion which failed to come upon any enemy horses and decided to return home .

She realized that her brother was aware of her true condition ... <p> ... Starting out next morning , the raiders reached present Elmira on Lake Pend d'Oreille .... All tried to cheer the leader , who was down-hearted over an unsuccessful trip . He replied that of course they would not be permitted to give the Victory Song upon reaching camp , but that anyone who wished could select a new name . None of the men accepted the offer .

Stating that he would never use her new name , a meaningless term for her , he threatened to expose her . <p> The berdache now took a new female companion from the present Creston area for her wife . It was not long before she again evinced jealousy of her consort 's behavior . <p> One night the two began to quarrel inside their mat lodge . The berdache began to beat her wife .

In 1825 , however a Kutenai woman wearing men 's clothing is mentioned in the journal of John Work , Hudson 's Bay Company trader at Flathead Post . Bundosh , as she is known here , has been satisfactorily established as the same Kurenai woman mentioned earlier by the Astarians and by David Thompson ... 10 <p> The entries referring to her follow : <p> Monday 12-The Kootenay chief with about a dozen of his men arrived ...

Chief Paul claimed that she had treated and cured his father , Chief David , of illness ... <p> A period of 12 years elapses before our next historical reference to the Kutenai berdache . It is contained in the journal of W. H. Gray , the missionary , who was journeying to the states in 1837 , travelling with Francis Ermatinger , the Hudson 's Bay Company trader to the Flathead . <p> A party of Flathead was virtually surrounded by Blackfoot and Bowdash , as she is known here , had gone back and forth trying to mediate between them . On her last trip she deceives the Blackfoot while the Flathead , as she knew , were making their escape to Fort Hall and the fur rendezvous . <p> Gray 's journal reports : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feet have killed the Kootenie woman , or Bowdash , as she is called .

For the purposes of this web page , let us assume that these are not coincidences . <p> Brief History <p> The Warehouse District takes its name from the busy warehouses that populated the area next to Raleighs central rail line . In the first half of the 20th century , the area was populated with coal yards , feed mills , and a Coca-Cola bottling plant , and warehouses to store everything being produced . As Raleighs manufacturing industry began to fade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . In the 1970s , Raleighs artistic scene laid claim to the area , finding the wide open spaces of warehouses to be perfect locales for performances and galleries3 . <p> In 1978 , one especially popular warehouse was converted from a Civil War warehouse lot into the more hip sounding " Lot 13 " . Lot 13 housed several permanent art installations and was the location chosen to stage a performance piece called " Opening Windows and Passages " , which featured a young David Sedaris3 . By the 1980s , several permanent art galleries appeared in the reason including Anthony Ulinskis Dovetail fine woodwork and William-Cozart woodshop , both of which are still present and operating in their original locations today3 . These galleries were not necessarily queer in nature , but they did offer the region a more liberal , artistic vibe . <p> Throughout the 1980s , more and more artists flocked to the district , such as Doug Van de Zande , Thomas Sayre , and Steve Schuster , opening photography , sculpture , and architecture studios , respectively3 . Naturally , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club . The Berkeley was erected in the mid 80s to answer that call . Once the Berkeley opened the door , The Capital Corral nudged it open further , becoming the Warehouse districts first gay club3 . The Capital Corral still operates in the same location , under different management and a new name : 313 Raleigh . Legends ( the most popular and mainstream club ) along with Flex ( for a slightly older , scruffier crowd ) opened in the 90s4 . <p> Lull in Development <p> In 1998 , the City of Raleigh planning director , George Chapman offered his opinions on the potential for future growth in the Warehouse district . He made it clear that the city would not be able to offer incentives to businesses . Niche stores , vying for an allusive customer are not traditionally investments the city considers practical or effective . At the time , tax incentives were being saved for large job creators , such as additions to the Convention Center and Memorial Auditorium . Chapman notes , " The so-called alternative business community usually seeks to locate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attraction of the Warehouse district5 . " He predicted that , " the area will continue to develop on its own with businesses that are trendier and more upscale than an alternative arts area would feature . Over the next decade , the area did continue to develop , but at a much slower pace and not quite in the direction Chapman expected . <p> Continued Growth <p> Liz Masnik is the proprietor of The Borough , one of the districts newest additions , opening in 2007 . She developed and opened the pub with no expectations for creating an identity . Her strategy was to " get the doors open and see what happens after that6 . " A typical night at the Borough reveals people from all walks of life . There 's the young Urban Outfitters alternative crown and bachelorette parties , as well as the more mature crowd , just stopping by for a drink after the latest gallery opening . Commenting on the wide range of patrons her pub attracts , Masnik notes , " I 've never been to a place with such a mixed clientele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . " However , the " Raleigh Downtowner " readers who named it the number one " Best Gay/Gay Friendly Bar " means that the people of Raleigh have already defined it as friendly . <p> The Borough is representative of the new wave of development in this area , including : <p> Dapper Style House an experimental high fashion retail and bar hybrid <p> Raleigh Denim Workshop a startup high end clothing line , whose collection was picked up by Barneys New York in their first year of operation7 . <p> The September 9 , 2010 edition of the Raleigh News &amp; Observer contained a headline entitled , " A Welcoming Plan Raleighs LGBT Center Hopes Events Will Help Unite Residents8 . " The Center opened their new office on the northern entrance to the Warehouse district , welcoming all visitors from the heart of downtown in May of 2010 .

He added , " putting a face on the LGBT community is a big step forward8 . " <p> The Future <p> The city of Raleigh added a vote of confidence ( in the form of a $1 million grant ) for the Warehouse district by supporting the development of the Contemporary Art Museum , or CAM Raleigh9 . This joint venture between failed City Gallery of Contemporary Art and North Carolina State Universitys design school is expected to inspire artistic minds . The president and CEO of the Downtown Raleigh Alliance feels that , " the more students you have coming to school downtown , the more creativity and innovation get to happen . We 'd love for those students to ultimately open up their own places , their own studios downtown10 .

Though no variant of the term " sodomy " is actually used , the rumor does place Whitefield in intimate relation to another male 's " Posteriors . " The letter also suggests that the rumor was invented by Whitefield 's " enemies " to do him out of his parson 's job . The rumor 's allegedly originating with a " Servant Maid " introduces the possibility that class and gender-based hostilities lie behind that female servant 's report . <p> Hockley 's Letter <p> In response to a letter from John Watson , Richard Hockley writes back : " You ca n't think what secret satisfaction I have when I peruse that part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased that Watson has resolved " to search the Scriptures " and become better acquainted with God 's true doctrine , " notwithstanding the Malicious shameful opinions of the World " with respect to the Reverend Whitefield . Referring to those rumors Hockley says : <p> as Jean in some measure unfolded to you the rise of that most Infamous base report you have heard concerning him Whitefield I shall do it as brief as possible thinking it my Duty to clear his Innocence . . . . <p> Hockley says he would do as much for " every Person that is so falsely judged and truly blameless . . . . " He adds that " When Mr. S and Mr. W Whitefield went down to Maryland , " they and <p> two or three more went up Stairs and shut the Door in the house they put up at and S being gall 'd blistered in the Posteriors got one in the room to apply a Plaster or some tallow to the place affected , and this was discovered by a curious Servant Maid in the house that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prostituted Character and Imprudent to the Last degree , who some days after their Departure from thence told this to some of Mr. Wd 's Enemies and so cook 'd up the story you have heard . . . . <p> This rumor , says Hockley , had been passed along by someone in his town who had visited Maryland and heard the rumor there . Hockley assures Watson that the story " meets with no Credit here , " being understood as " an open scandalous way of using ? a Parson of his profession . " Hockley says , " I thought I would just mention the thing to you as it really is , ' ' so that Watson " might not be apt to Imbibe any prejudiced Notions " against Whitefield -- and so that Watson " might venture to say with the Prophet of Old on some misrepresentation of the Servants of God ' Their tongues are set on fire with Hell and the Poison of Asps is on their Lips ' . . . . " Hockley thinks " it my duty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitefield . But Hockley would not have Watson imagine that his defense proceeds out of blindness , " from any prejudice or bigoted notions in favor " of Whitefield , " for I hope I know my own heart . . . . " Alluding to the rumor against Whitefield Hockley reminds Watson " how Christ himself and Apostles were villified . " Hockley writes that he is " alternately overwhelmed with grief and Joy " concerning Whitefield , <p> with grief to see so sincere and young a Son of Levi so much abused , with Joy when I reflect for what cause he suffers and that his Master Jesus was worst used before him . . . . <p> Whitefield 's Personal Life <p> The rumor concerning George Whitefield takes on additional interest in light of biographical details supplied in Philip Greven 's The Protestant Temperament ( 1977 ) , a study of childrearing patterns , religious experience , and identity in early America . <p> Looking back on his youth Whitefield says " I can date some very early act 's " of uncleanness " ( probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " filthy talking , " and says he more than once stole money from his mother " to satisfy my sensual appetite " for food.2 <p> As a preacher Whitefield believed that parents should resolve to break their children 's wills " thoroughly when young , " so that " the work of conversion would be much easier , and they would not be so troubled with perverse children when they are old . " 3 <p> On his first visit to the American colonies Whitefield publicly denounces the " sinfulness of those amusements " called by others " innocent diversions " ( card playing and dancing , for example ) , which divert one from a full-time preoccupation with God . Whitefield speaks against levity and for an all-pervasive seriousness.4 <p> Whitefield Proposes Marriage <p> While crossing the Atlantic from England to Georgia , early in 1740 , Whitefield proposes marriage to a woman back in the country away from which he is moving . His proposal is worded in such a way as to insure her refusal . He writes to this woman about his fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . He declares that he is " free from that foolish passion which the world calls Love . " He proposes , he says , " only because I believe it is the will of God that I should alter my state . . . . I would not marry but for Him . . . . " <p> His marriage proposal duly rejected , Whitefield writes to a male friend that he seeks a woman " dead to everything but JESUS " -- but also qualified to run the orphanage whose founding he is contemplating.5 <p> Love Among Men <p> Whitefield 's letters to male friends , acquaintances , and fellow ministers , says Greven , " abound with expressions of love and affection , brotherly care , and close ties through kinship in Christ . " In July 1739 , Whitefield writes to a " familiar friend who has been dear to me as my own soul . " In November , 1739 , he writes to " Brother J. " : " Indeed I love you . " Says Greven , " All of Whitefield 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as were most of his acquaintances.6 This may begin to account for the " infamous " rumor which followed Whitefield from Maryland to Pennsylvania early in the summer of 1740 . <p> Brides of Christ <p> Whitefield is among those evangelical who think of themselves as " brides of Christ , " who consider one 's ideal relation to Jesus to be a " marriage . " In the early l740s , in a sermon preached in Philadelphia , Whitefield exhorts his listeners to a " marriage " with Jesus , who " offers to espouse all Sinners to himself , and to make them Flesh of his Flesh , and Bone of his Bone . He is willing to be united to you by one Spirit . " Whitefield calls : " Come then , my Brethren , come to the Marriage . -- Do not play the Harlot any longer . -- Let this be the Day of your Espousals with Jesus Christ , he only is your lawful Husband . " Whitefield , says Greven , " felt himself truly married only to Jesus . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year following the " infamous " rumor , Whitefield married . " His decision , " says Greven , " evidently was sudden and unexpected , for his experiences with the prospects of marriage in previous years gave no grounds for expectlng him ever to marry.8 <p> The woman he marries , Whitefield tells a friend , is neither rich . . . nor beautiful , " and will not " attempt to hinder me " in God 's work.9 The preacher had found , says Greven , " a perfect woman to head his orphanage . " Passion , apparently , had nothing to do with Whitefield 's marriage . " His own true marriage to Christ continued without the constant seductions of the passions and the flesh that bothered so many other evangelicals . " 10 <p> Whitefield , says Greven , became " the most charasmatic evangelical preacher of the eighteenth century , " as well-known at the time in the American colonies as he was at home in England .

So , that in itself is fairly unusual . One of the realities when I was running for office was that my opponent in the general election was the Chief Deputy of the department and he was being endorsed by the then Sheriff who was touting him as being the best thing in the world .

" It was really helpful in terms of overcoming that stereotype . I know the main reason I got that endorsement was the fact that I had previously been with the department and had been a Captain before I left to go to law school . There were still enough folks around that had worked for me and with me , so I had a reputation of being a real professional who was very fair and a very compassionate boss . <p> Since that time , both in 1997 and 98 , I was given the Administrator of the Year Award by an organization called the Combined Law Enforcement Association of Texas which is a statewide police officers group .

We have an openly gay state Representative here in Austin , Glen Maxey , and it took Glen I think probably at least three terms in office before the paper stopped referring to him every time as the " openly gay legislator . " One of the things I did n't  want was anybody labeling me as " the woman Sheriff , " or " the lesbian Sheriff . " People do n't  go around saying " the male Sheriff " or " the heterosexual Sheriff . " Youd never refer to people in those terms . <p> A : One of the things that happened during my campaign is that folks would try to do the innuendo thing before I was elected Sheriff I was an attorney doing mostly civil rights and employment law around the state and I was very successful at it .

The Alcohol Beverage Control Board establishes the rules and regulations regarding the sale of alcoholic beverages in the state of Virginia and had several statues regarding homosexuals that stated : <p> Section 4-37 states in part " a bars license may be suspended or revoked if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of narcotics , drunks , homosexuals , prostitutes , pimps , panderers , gamblers or habitual law violaters " <p> Section 4 98 " forbids a licensee from employing any person who has the general reputation as a prostitute , homosexual , panderer , gambler , habitual law violater , person of i 'll repute , user of or peddler of narcotics , or person who drinks to excess or a " B-girl . " <p> Many of the groups that organized through the years had eliminating these laws from the books as a goal . In 1991 , Virginians for Justice had the opportunity to take an active step in doing so . A federal district court in Alexandria , VA agreed to hear arguments in a case concerning these regulations . Although the laws are on the books , they had , in effect , not been enforced in the 1980s . A lawsuit was filed in Alexandria by the owner of the French Quarter CafT , by the College of William and Mary Gay and Lesbian Alumni ( W&amp;M GALA ) group and Dale Barnhard , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Quarter opened in May of 1991 , retired Col. William Glasgow , Jr . tried to keep the restaurant from getting a license based on the ABC regulations prompting a lawsuit by the French Quarter owners who did n't  want to be in fear of losing their license and being shut down in the future because of the regulations . W&amp;M GALA said the organization joined the lawsuit because of the situation when they attempted to get a liquor license for a Homecoming Event , their request was delayed because of the ABC regulations ; a GALA spokesman said that the delay was caused by " a major , ongoing violation of Constitutional rights in the state of Virginia the ABC code denies the freedom of assembly guaranteed gay and lesbian Virginians , like all Americans .

Bryan declared the anti-gay ABC regulations unconstitutional and signed an order preventing Virginia ABC agents from enforcing them . Judge Bryan also required that the ABC board to notify all current license holders and any future applicants of the changes in the ABC regulations . The ABC board was also ordered to pay the court costs for the plaintiffs , equaling almost $11,000 . Pat Heck of Virginians for Justice pointed out that the legislators could have saved the state this money and the time and money that the state had invested in defending the case if they had acted and changed the anti-gay language themselves , instead of forcing the issue to go to court . Shirley Lesser , chair of Virginians for Justice , said that the court order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fight for equal justice .

" <p> Early in childhood , in anxious exile from hurtful intimacies , I became a loner in the crowd , working assertively to gain accolades from grownups by producing unusual , colorful , primitive , tempera paintings , but all the while surrounded by a protective , isolating cocoon . <p> And in the private , progressive Greenwich Village elementary school , The Little Red School House , I moved aggressively among my classmates , bidding for their attention by putting out a newsletter , Jons Journal , and hanging out with the A-list clique , all the while surrounded by an invisible , isolating wall . <p> As an art major at Music and Art , a public high school , among a class of 300 artists and musicians , I received plaudits for my paintings , was elected Features Editor of the school paper , and directed my classs varsity show , all the while remaining completely separate and alone , aloof from close relationships , firmly encased in my own private isolation booth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a male , at age 18 , in 1956 , did I begin to feel the need to reach out . Only then did I begin to yearn for human contact . And only then did I begin to feel searingly , achingly lonely . But , fearing intimacy and hurt , and inexperienced in the ways of making connection , I was often alone . <p> In the 1960s , I began individual psychotherapy with a humane heterosexual , Herb Freudenberger , who had escaped Nazi Germany on his own as a young child and , amazingly , made it alone to the U.S. It came as quite a shock when , a year or so into therapy Herb rejected what had been my opening complaint : " Your problem is n't homosexuality , its that you do n't  relate to anybody ! " <p> The shock subsided and I began slowly to venture out of my shell , helped especially by the experience of Herbs group sessions . I began to feel better about myself and my ability to sustain relationships and even the hurts they sometimes bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I began to explore New York Citys recently founded gay liberation groups . <p> Rarely in our lives is there an actual , solid , heavy , wooden door ( not a metaphorical door ) that we know , if we have the guts to open it and walk through it , will utterly change the rest of our lives for the better , but in ways we cant imagine . <p> As I approached the door of the Episcopal Church on 28th Street and 9th Avenue in New York City , where the Gay Activists Alliance was holding weekly meetings , one evening in the winter of 1971 , I knew that crossing that threshold would change my life . I took a deep , anxious breath and walked in . <p> At the age of thirty-three I began attending the raucous weekly meetings of the GAA , and the eloquent oratory of the groups leaders rang in my ears . ( " We 're demonstrating for our lives ! " exclaimed Arnie Kantrowitz in one impassioned speech . Arthur Evans , Jim Owles , Marty Robinson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the world with fresh eyes . I participated in public actions and took part in intense private discussion groups and psychologically probing " consciousness-raising groups . " I marched with a poster that proclaimed : " Homosexuals are revolting . You bet we are ! " <p> In a few short months I weathered a destabilizing change . I came home from those wildly exhilarating meetings exhausted , my head literally spinning from the intense , abrupt shift in understanding and emotion I was so quickly undergoing . <p> I experienced a fundamental mental alteration , from a sense of myself as individual monster-freak to a new , shared sense of myself as member of a put-down group , newly outraged , organized , resistant , and public . In the gay movement I affirmed my affectionate and erotic feelings for men , the particular emotions for which society put me down , and for which , for so many years , I put myself down . <p> My participation in the gay movement soon led to my first imagining such a thing as homosexual history . At a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apartment on 16th Street in then-unfashionable Chelsea , we talked of ways to publicize our new movement . I then privately resolved to research and compile a documentary theater piece on gay and lesbian life and liberation . <p> Like Martin Dubermans documentary play In White America , which I 'd heard about but not seen , the piece I imagined would employ American historical and literary materials to evoke dramatically our changing situation , emotions , and consciousness . <p> The agitation-propaganda theater piece , Coming Out ! , produced by the Gay Activists Alliance Arts Committee , opened on June 16 , 1972 , at GAA 's rented firehouse , reproduced in September 1972 at the Washington Square Methodist Church , and then again in June 1973 at The Nighthouse , in a tiny theater ( a ground-floor room , actually ) , in Chelsea . <p> Martin Dubermans comments on that last production , on the front page of The New York Times Sunday drama section , encouraged a publisher to give me a contract for a book of documents on homosexual history ( $2,500 on signing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my book Gay American History : Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A. was published at the end of 1976 . <p> Given my earlier history as anxious , isolated , lonely loner , the six months we spent developing and rehearsing Coming Out ! , from January to June , 1972 , was one of the most exciting , challenging , and profound communal experiences of my life . <p> I attended every rehearsal of the piece , and my interactions with the director , David Roggensack , stage manager , Reed Lenti , and the actors included creative challenges : how to make the words of my documentary compilation come alive on stage ; how to wrest honest , heartfelt readings out of non-professional actors ( a couple of professional actors started rehearsals but then dropped out , concerned that their participation in a gay liberation play would negatively effect their future theatrical careers ) . <p> The challenges also included confronting tensions between the militant lesbian feminists in the cast and the not-so-feminist gay men , the alcohol consumption of one participant , and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a gay liberation play . <p> Indeed , still deep in the closet , on the first version of the script I had used the pseudonym " Jon Swift , " though it soon dawned on me that a pseudonym just would n't do on a theater piece titledComing Out ! ( exclamation mark ) . So , along with the other participants in what felt like a daring , scary venture , I gulped and said " OK , use my real name . " Sure enough , at 10 a.m. on the Friday morning of the plays opening my telephone rang and it was my mother . Her voice quavered , she was on the verge of tears , and shed seen an ad for Coming Out ! " Is that you in The Village Voice ? " " Yes , " I answered . " " Are you a . . . a homo-sexual ? " " Yes . " " Why did n't  you tell me ? " " Because I knew you 'd react like you 're reacting . " " But why do you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> So the play Coming Out ! included my own coming out to my mother and , after several years , the start of a new relationship between us . Over these years she moved from knee-jerk anti-homosexual hysteria to using her editing skills ( honed as a long-time Associate Editor at Parents Magazine ) to help me edit the book that became Gay American History . Mother love triumphed over homophobia . <p> My work on the play Coming Out ! initiated my new life as an open gay person , my long professional career as a historian of sexuality and gender , and furthered my movement into the world of human relationships , with all their pleasures and , of course , their pains . My work on Coming Out ! helped make me human .

How did that come about ? <p> A : I wanted to be a Priest ever since I was a little kid . I went to a Catholic school . In fact my entire education including college and graduate school were all Catholic . It was primarily that background , and stories I would hear about my grandfather whom I was named after . He was apparently kind of rough on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Stories like that influenced me . As I 've always said , I want to help people . <p> Q : How did you reconcile these two directions in your life the Priesthood and recognizing you were gay ? Did you identify as a gay person at that point ? <p> A : No . When I was growing up in the 50s and 60s I never even heard the word . I did n't  even know the concept existed , that there was such an option . Reflecting back now I remember in high school one time my mother , who worked as a nurses aide , coming home and talking about some people with a patient and she said they were " kind of funny . " That was her term . Now I think I know what she was saying back then , but at the time I had no clue . I did n't  come across the concept until I was in college . I did n't  have any trouble reconciling my own same-sex attractions because the idea with the Priesthood is that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that never was a real big issue . Any kind of sexual activity did n't  occur until I was in college . In the seminary in fact . I probably listened more to the scriptures with regard to Gods loving everyone and not condemning them , being a forgiving God , a God that did n't  make mistakes in his creation . I was still in school when Pope Paul VI wrote his encyclical or letter on Humana Vite . In there he talks about gays . He says being gay is not a choice a person makes but rather its determined by God through heredity or genetics . I find it interesting the Pope went that far , but at the same time stated that while God made you gay , you could n't act upon being gay . That always made me question if God was schizophrenic or what . But , I had some pretty liberal professors who also questioned that type of teaching and I know the present Pope and the teachings of the church are trying to back-track . They say that , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in any way is intrinsically evil which , again , is inconsistent . <p> Q : How does that faith background play out in your life now ? <p> A : It is still very , very strong . But I also recognize that if you thoroughly understand Catholic Christian teaching , that ultimately a well informed and developed conscience makes the decision . And I believe I do have well informed and developed conscience . Finally , as an adult , I see myself as wanting to make a difference and having the kinds of characteristics and personality traits that can do that . That is what I am about . I consider myself a very spiritual person . I still identify myself as Roman Catholic . <p> Q : What characteristics do you think play out most strongly in your political life your Mexican American heritage or your being gay ? <p> A : I think all of them . They all have a unique part to play in it . As far as my decision to run for the Council , that 's the Mexican heritage piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteered to drive people to the polls . When I got there I realized there were a substantial number of African-Americans and Caucasians and a real small handful of Latinos . I went up to a friend of mine very much involved in the party and asked , " Where are all the Mexicans ? ! " He said it was very hard to get to get them involved . Then I said , " As a matter of fact , why do n't  we have a Mexican-American on Council ? " And he said , " Well , why do n't  you run ? " <p> So , that was how it began . In 97 the party was committed to bringing on more diversity and wanted to support a Latino candidate . About 25 Latinos were invited to the headquarters to talk about going about doing this . Through the conversation , I and another person said that we were interested in running . I made it clear that I was gay , though I assumed most people knew since there was an article in the paper a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case , I made it clear at that point to the Latino community and to the party that I was gay and that I did not want it to be an issue .

" To me , those aspects all mingle together to make me who I am.

" <p> The operations of the LGHP were overseen by a volunteer administrative team that arranged publicity , coordinated volunteers , and secured the grants necessary to fund the non-profit organization . Finances came in from countless private donors and local organizations , and a number of larger organizations , such as the Ms. Foundation for Women and Glaxo , Inc. 3 , gave considerable sums to the program . With these funds , the LGHP was able to establish itself in the community as an invaluable resource to the gay community , particularly to men living with AIDS .

The 459 respondents to the survey revealed that the majority of gay men and lesbians felt that they were receiving less-than-adequate medical care and/or experiencing homophobia in the healthcare system , making referrals to gay-friendly physicians a top priority .

To protect the safety of the employees and the documents in the office , the location was never disclosed , and the key was kept in Francescas , a nearby ice cream shop . All volunteers were obligated to go through a training program at the Orange-Person-Chatham Mental Health Center before being allowed to take calls5 . From the first calls Heathline received , it was clear that the operation was not simply an urgent care hotline , but the beginning of a vast social network for the gay community both inside and outside the office . Many people called with AIDS-related concerns , searching for both medical assistance and support groups , but still more called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to speak with someone who was either gay or an ally of the gay community . In the pre-internet era , even gays and lesbians who were out found it difficult to meet others in the gay community . Healthline not only put callers in touch with healthcare services , but organized meetings at local churches and made callers aware of gay family events , gay and lesbian sports teams , LGBT-friendly businesses , and bars . <p> 6 <p> In turn , callers would inform Healthline of new events and organizations that they could refer others to . The constant exchange of information causes many of the archived call logs , which were also how the volunteers communicated with one another from shift to shift , to read something like a business transaction7 . The volunteers themselves benefited equally from their time at Healthline .

Others would call in seeking sexual services , and volunteers were advised to be weary of certain numbers and told not to give out any information to certain callers . <p> 2012 <p> Today , the gay social network in North Carolina has migrated from the telephone lines to the web servers . Health concerns can be addressed online , and LGBT resources , in addition to being able to be found instantaneously on the websites of local organizations , have increased in number .

As the organization grew , members became increasingly curious about who made up the Filth Order of the organization . Opposition to Mattachine , along with charges of communism also began to grow . Eventually , the leadership of the organization was restructured and almost all of the original founders dropped out. 4 <p> Mattachine Review , 19595 <p> The new leaders took a very different approach in running the organization . They preached the idea that homosexuals were no different than heterosexuals and abandoned activist techniques . The organization focused on educating the public about homosexuality , and they called upon sociologists and various members of the mental health community to aid them in their efforts . This revamped version of the Mattachine is more characteristic of the organizations of the homophile movement . ONE , however , became increasingly independent and retained its stance as a more activist publication . In 1955 Mattachine began publishing Mattachine Review , a magazine that was formally linked to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach and those who pushed for more activist tactics would consistently plague the organization until its downfall in the early 1970s. 6 <h> The Daughters of Bilitis <p> Officially the Mattachine Society was established to represent the entire homosexual community , though in actuality the membership of the organizations was primarily male . In fact , throughout the entire life of the organization , the Fifth Order was exclusively male . Mattachine consistently lacked a lesbian presence throughout its 20 year history . Within the organization , the homosexual experience was defined in ways that only gave voice to gay men , thus leaving out lesbians . In order to fully include lesbians in the homophile movement , their dual identity as homosexuals and as women had to be recognized. 7 The Daughters of Bilitis was the organization that recognized this . <p> The Daughters of Bilitis ( DOB ) was formed in 1955 in San Francisco , CA by four lesbian couples . Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon ( a couple ) are typically credited with the founding the organization since they played the most significant role in launching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Martins and Lyon s desire to socialize with other lesbians . The organization was intended to act as an alternative to the lesbian bar scene . In the beginning , the members argued over the direction the group should take . Martin and Lyon wanted DOB to have broad goals that were similar to the Mattachine Society and the two pushed for goals that focused on educating the public about lesbians . At this point the group split and those members who were blue-collar workers left to form their own social group. 8 <p> The Ladder , 19579 <p> From its beginning , DOB bore close resemblance to the Mattachine Society . Like Mattachine , DOB viewed educating the public as the means by which the lives of lesbian and gay individuals could be improved . DOBs express purpose was also very similar to that of Mattachines in that both called for homosexuals to fit into larger society and to participate in professional research endeavors . Both organizations also called for laws that targeted homosexuals to be revised . Despite all this similarity , the DOB maintained qualities that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of changing the attitudes of society as a whole , the organization primarily acted to address the needs of lesbians and to provide such women with an environment that was safe . It helped lesbians get their lives together and begin participating in larger society . Also , since DOB was an organization that served gay women , they were concerned with issues such as motherhood and the problems faced by married lesbians. 10 <p> In 1956 DOB began publishing its own magazine called The Ladder . The magazine was not a political publication ; rather it provided lesbians with advice and gave them a place to tell about their experiences . Poetry , fictional stories , histories , and biographies were often published in the Ladder . The Ladder also gave attention to the situation of married lesbians and offered advice on how to best raise children in a lesbian family . Employment advice and financial guidance were also provided by the magazine. 11 Due to declining membership and fractions within the organization , the Daughters of Bilitis disbanded in the early 1970s. 12 <h> Mattachine and DOB Clash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked together throughout the two organizations existence . Together they sponsored forums , discussion groups , and other events . Eventually , however , the two organizations began to clash . DOB became increasing frustrated with the promiscuity of gay males and the police harassment associated with this behavior . DOB members were also frustrated by the chauvinism expressed by Mattachine and the patronizing attitude it had towards DOB . DOB refused to be viewed as the ladies auxiliary of the Mattachine Society . In response to all this , DOB wrote in their constitution that its members were not allowed to join other homophile organizations. 13 <h> DOB and Its Relationship with the Lesbian Community <p> The membership of the DOB consistently remained small throughout the organizations existence . Lesbians from the professional community were never attracted to the group . This was partially due to the fact that those in the professional world did not feel safe joining a gay organization for fear that they would lose their jobs . The self-help nature of DOB also prevented the organization from attracting many lesbians from the professions since such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the services offered by DOB. 14 <p> Prejudice towards the butch-fem bar culture of the working class lesbians also stunted the growth of the organization . The members of DOB looked down on the bar culture and butch lesbians . They did not see such behavior as respectable and did not like the image that such behavior portrayed to society . For many lesbians , however , the bars provided them with an important sense of community that DOB could not account for . It was a larger , more stable community that was more personable . <h> A Different Option : The Bar Culture <p> The bar culture of the 1950s continued to proliferate the working class lesbian community in the 1960s and 1970s . The bar served as a social gathering place where lesbians could meet one another and form relationships . Bars were consistently threatened by raids from law enforcement and/or closure . When one bar would close , another would open to take its place . The location of the bar often determined the clientele , as well as the bartender and the owner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply go to a bar because their favorite bartender worked there . When a bar would close , a bartenders following would often follow him/her to a new bar . For more information about the bar culture , please see the 1950s section of the website or read " The Development of the Homosexual Bar as an Institution " by Nancy Achilles . <h> The Social Scientists <p> Along with the homophile organizations various professionals within the social sciences began to challenge the notion that homosexuals were sick and mentally i 'll . The study of homosexuals had previously been dominated by psychologists and psychiatrists who believed that homosexuality was a pathology . In 1952 the American Psychiatric Association published the first edition of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual , Mental Disorders ( DSM-I ) . This first edition listed homosexuality among the socio-pathic personality disorders . When the DSM-II ( the first revision of the manual ) was published , homosexuality had been moved to the category of " non-psychotic disorders , " which included fetishism , transvestism , exhibitionism , voyeurism , sadism , masochism , and pedophilia. 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gay is sick " mentality was Evelyn Hooker , a professor at UCLA . When teaching in the UCLA extension division in 1943-1944 Hooker met a gay male student , Sam From , in one of her classes . Later on the two became friends . Through From , Hooker met many other homosexuals who became her friends . From then began to encourage Hooker to study homosexuals . He said to her : <p> " Evelyn , we have let you see us as we are . We have hidden nothing from you . You probably know more about people like usthan any psychologist in this country . Now it is your scientific duty to study us. " 17 <p> In 1953 , Hooker was awarded a grant by the NIMH to study homosexuals . The project compared a group of 30 heterosexual men to a group of 30 non-clinical gay men . The use of non-clinical participants was crucial since all research up to this point had been done on homosexuals living in clinical settings or in jails . After using a variety of assessment tools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two groups in terms of mental well-being and psychological adjustment . What 's more , the psychologists and psychiatrists who administered the tests were blinded to the sexual orientation of the men and they were not able to correctly identify which men were gay and which were heterosexual . The findings were presented at the 1956 meeting of the APA and were published in 1957 in the Journal of Projective Techniques . Hooker conducted several other studies about homosexuality after this , though the findings from her first study are the most often cited. 18 <p> Hookers work played a large role in the declassification of homosexuality as a mental illness in the DSM . First , in 1973 the idea that homosexuality in and of itself was a mental disorder was removed from the DSM , however the new category of " Sexual Orientation Disturbance " was created . This classification was developed for those individuals who were attracted to members of the same sex and were disturbed by or wished to change it . It was not until 1986 when the APA published the DSM-IIIR that all references to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of sociology also began to challenge the view that homosexuals were mentally i 'll . In 1967 William Simon and John H. Gagnon published an article entitled " Homosexuality : The Formulation of a Sociological Perspective " in the Journal of Health and Social Behaviors . In this article , the authors critiqued previous research on homosexuals , stating that it treated the group as homogenous and that it was only interested the cause of homosexuality rather than understanding homosexuals and the world they exist in . The authors called for researchers to rethink the study of homosexuals in order to consider " the complexity of the life cycle of the homosexual , the roles of that mark the various stages of this cycle , and the kinds of forces , both sexual and nonsexual that impinge on this individual actor . " 20 This change in approach was an important step towards debunking the " gay is sick " mentality . Unfortunately , this article focuses primarily on gay males . <p> In 1968 Mary McIntosh published an article entitled " The Homosexual Role " in the journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion that homosexuality was a condition . She discussed how labeling someone as a homosexual acts as a form of social control . From the perspective of role theory , it becomes clear that homosexuality is more than a sexual behavior pattern . Thus , McIntoshs article seeks to expand societys understanding of what it means to be a homosexual . Like the Simon and Gagnons 1967 article , McIntoshs article focuses on gay males . Later , in 1977 Fredrick a Whitam publish a piece entitled " The Homosexual Role : A Reconsideration " which refuted that notion that the concept of role could apply to an interpretation of homosexuality . He stated that using the concept of role to understand homosexuals violates the sociological definition of role and that the definition does not fit the characteristics of the homosexuality . He commented that homosexuality was simply a sexual orientation . <p> In 1973 Gagnon and Simon published a book called Sexual Conduct in which they examined sexuality from a non-biological , social psychological standpoint . Included in this book is a chapter entitled " A Conformity Greater Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesbians . This chapter begins with a critique of past research on the lesbian community , stating that such research was focused on sexual behavior . It is proposed that in order to fully understand lesbians , we must understand how they interact with society . To she 'd light on this , the authors interviewed 20 lesbians about various aspects of their lives . Topics discussed in the piece include becoming a lesbian , the lesbian community , lesbians experiences in the workplace , lesbians relationships with family and friends , lesbians search for love , and how lesbians achieve self-acceptance . Overall , the work is revolutionary in that it is an in depth account of the lesbian experience and for the first time researchers were interested in what it really meant to be a lesbian . <p> Neil Miller , Out of the Past : Gay and Lesbian History from 1869 to the Present .

@@107290847 @2690847/ <h> Christopher Street , West Hollywood <p> By Peter Nardi <p> In 1975 , I moved to Claremont , CA to begin what would become a 35 year teaching career as a professor of sociology at Pitzer College , one of the Claremont Colleges about 35 miles east of Los Angeles . I graduated college in 1969 , the same month as the Stonewall riots . But I ended up in Philadelphia attending graduate school so was not aware of the 1970 march to commemorate Stonewall and do not recall anything in Philadelphia . I also was just coming out , so was not as attentive to the growing gay movements as I later became . I left Philadelphia in 1975 , and had never been to a gay pride march until 1977 when several of us from Claremont drove to LA to watch what was called the Christopher Street West pride march . Note that it was not held in West Hollywood , as it is today , but along Hollywood Blvd , between Vine St and Highland Ave , a few steps from where the LA Gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Anita Bryant was running rampant so lots of the signage and T-shirts made reference to her . After the parade , a small festival -- very small , the parking lot of a mini-mall on Sunset Blvd and Cherokee Ave -- had booths , food , and souvenirs . Today , it is a big commercial festival , with admission prices and corporate sponsors . But in 1977 , my first parade was seeing gay teachers , gay religious groups , parents of gays , lesbian groups , and not the bars and disco floats that would later be added . My memory is that it was truly a march and commemoration of the Stonewall events and my first introduction to what would become a career in gay studies and activism . Luckily , I have some photos from that march and posted on this website.

This exhibit was created by Pauline Park , co-chair and co-founder of the New York Association for Gender Rights Advocacy ( NYAGRA ) . <p> Pauline Park , Ph.D . " The Making of a Movement : The Story of the Successful Campaign for a Transgender Rights Law in New York City . " The 8th Annual Mark E.

All rights reserved . <h> Conclusion <p> It is through a close study of this campaign , using Gladwells principles , that we can draw lessons about transgender community organizing and social transformation . First , as Gladwell suggests , consistent with the Law of the Few , a small number of people can engage real and meaningful social change . While organizations representing thousands of people supported the transgender rights bill , the day-to-day work of the campaign was carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per the Stickiness Factor , the way in which a message is communicated can make the difference between acceptance and rejection . The campaigns ability to craft a simple message of basic human rights to remedy pervasive discrimination proved critical in successfully communicating with key audiences . And third , the Power of Context , as Gladwell argues , is indeed crucial . The campaign was able to make transgender inclusion part of the dominant discourse in the LGBT community and was successful in persuading the citys political elite to make transgender discrimination its own issue . But it was ultimately an entirely unrelated issue namely , term limits that helped reshape the political context in which the transgender rights bill was being considered , and when term limits forced out the incumbent mayor and Council Speaker , that gave the new Council leadership the opportunity to move the bill to passage . <p> I would like to conclude by quoting from a historic . We ask ourselves , who am I to be brilliant , gorgeous , talented and fabulous ? Actually , who are you not to be ? " This is a quote from Nelson Mandelas inaugural speech as he took the oath of office as president of the Republic of South Africa . As Mandela said at his inaugural , " As we are liberated from our own fear , our presence automatically liberates others . " <p> In an era overtaken by cheap and easy cynicism , it is too easy to give into the temptation to throw up our hands and say that we cant do anything about it , whatever it is . But the truth is that each of us has it in our power to make social change . We simply have to believe that we can and then find the best way to do it . I invite you tonight to join me in the gender revolution . We all have a stake in it men and women , conventionally gendered and gender-variant , transgendered and non-transgendered .

Together , we can change the world ; we must simply have the imagination to envision it and the courage to pursue that vision . Thank you .

The first account is by Havelock Ellis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of " Nicholai de Raylan , " confidential secretary to the Russian Consul , who at death ( of tuberculosis ) at the age of 33 was found to be a woman . She was born in Russia and was in many respects very feminine , small and slight in build , but was regarded as a man , and even as very " manly , " by both men and women who knew her intimately . She was always very neat in dress , fastidious in regard to shirts and ties , and wore a long-waisted coat to disguise the lines of her figure . She was married twice in America , being divorced by the first wife , after a union lasting ten years , on the ground of cruelty and misconduct with chorus girls . The second wife , a chorus girl who had been previously married arid had a child , was devoted to her " husband . " Both wives were firmly convinced that their husband was a man and ridiculed the idea that " he " could be a woman . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial penis . In her will she made careful arrangements to prevent detection of sex after death , but these were frustrated , as she died in a hospital . " ( 1 ) <p> In 1958 , Dr. Eugene de Savitsch , in a book on homosexuality and " transsexualism , " still speaks of homosexuals as those whose <p> body may be essentially that of the male but the sexual impulse predominantly that of the female , and vice versa . <p> A startling example of that kind has been reportedin the case of a woman who led the life of a man . The individual , known under the name of Nicholas de Raylan and former secretary of Baron von Schlippenbach , the Russian Consul in Chicago , declared himself to be the son of a Russian admiral . He had been twice married , but at his death on December 18th , 1906 , in Phoenix , Arizona , was declared to be a woman . Investigation resolved the mystery into the following tangled contradictions : Declaration of the hospital physicians at Phoenix , Arizona , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first wife , and of his second wife , that he was a man ; records of the Superior Court , which show that the first Mrs. De Raylan was given a divorce on the ground of infidelity ; records of the War Department , which show that he enlisted as a soldier during the Spanish-American War ; testimony of friends and neighbours that he led a gay life , drank , smoked and was well known to chorus girls . <p> He was well educated , and was evidently a graduate of one of the Russian universities . <p> For two years he suffered from tuberculosis and went to Phoenix where he hoped to recover his health . No news was received of him until telegrams were sent out announcing his death , coupled with the declaration that he was a woman who had lived all her life as a man , married , fought as a soldier and worked in the office of the Russian Consul . De Raylan 's first wife , who secured a divorce for infidelity , said the trouble was his fondness for chorus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chorus , wept on learning of de Raylan 's death , declaring that talk of his being a woman was nonsense ' . The post-mortem examination showed a female with an imperforate hymen , undoubtedly a virgin , with uterus , tubes , ovaries and vagina present and in the normal position . An imitation penis and testicles made of chamois skin and stuffed with down were suspended in the right place by means of a band around the waist . <p> One of the most incredible parts of the story is the Spanish-American War episode . We can only presume that the examination of recruits was a bit more sketchy then than it is nowadays . It is still more incredible that the individual was apparently a well-integrated personality who led a useful life until the last two years , when tuberculosis put an end to his unique career . <p> It was suggested by the experts that there might have been some glandular deficiency , but this was very difficult to establish because the autopsy technique in Phoenix , Arizona , in .

Young , Genital Abnormalities , Hermaphroditism and Related Adrenal Diseases ( Baltimore Md. : Williams and Wilkins , 1937 ) , but I find no mention of Nicholas de Raylan in this book . The problem of the reliability of these early reports of Lesbian transvestism is raised by the following case cited by Havelock Ellis : " In New York in 1905 a retired sailor , ' Captain John Weed , ' who had commanded transatlantic vessels for many years , was admitted to a Home for old sailors and shortly after became i 'll and despondent , and cut his throat .

Frank Weed , who had the month before committed suicide . There is absolutely no indication in any of these printed news reports that either of the Weed brothers might have been a woman in disguise , and the details of John Weed 's life do not match the details of the life of the " Captain John Weed " cited by Ellis . It is possible that Ellis 's informant had access to information about an individual whose name and history somehow became confused with that of the John Weed who died in December , 1905 ( New York Daily Tribune , Dec. 21 , 1905 , p. 12 , col. 3 ; Dec , 22 , 1905 , p. 14 , col .

She preferred to dress as a man and had many love escapades with women . ' She can fiddle as . well as anyone in the State , ' said a man who knew her , ' can box like a pugilist , and can dance and play cards ' " ( Ellis 1936 , p. 242 ) .

What put that idea into your head ? <p> A : At the time that I ran it was because I saw a need . The only way that the gay community at that time could become forceful was to become political . I do n't  care what people say , even one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will make a difference . These people that say , " Oh , I 'm not going to vote , I 'm only one person , it is n't going to count , " well , by Jesus Christ , it does count . If everybody had that attitude then nothing would be accomplished and we would be all screwed . <p> Most everything Ive done in my life was done with a purpose , not with a big purpose , at least not what it ended up being . At the time that I did this , I wanted to prove to these silly queens that by voting , it did make a difference . I wanted to prove that everybody had the right to vote . I wanted to prove that you had the right to run for public office . And the only way to make these people understand that , was to do it . So I decide to , with the help of some of the customers at the Black Cat . They said , " Why do n't  you run for office ? " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote . Our man who ran that part got top recognition from the Democratic Party for registering the most voters . He was gay . He went to all kinds of places and he got people to register to vote . He did n't  go onto a street corner , he went into the glory holes and the bars and the bathhouses and sat there . He basically said , " You register to vote and then you get the prize . " And little by little they began to realize that if we stick together , we can do something . I was preaching that 30 years ago . My platform when I ran was " Equality Before the Law . " The San Francisco Court House had just been built and that was the slogan on it and I said , " This is what my slogan will be . I 'm going to take it and shove it right down their throat . " I saw that there were two interpretations of the laws and that they were trying to make gay people second rate citizens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned a lot about the law . I realized that you had to have a party endorsement to run for public office and neither the Democrats nor the Republicans wanted to endorse me because I was openly gay . So I had to use brinkmanship and threaten to sue them . I 've always been a Democrat , and they had to allow me to list as a Democrat even though they did n't  endorse me in any way . Then to get on the ballot , it ( took ) 35 signatures . I had to blackmail the 35 people . And then when you ran for office in the city it was not according to districts . It was open . After I made the election they came to see me at the Black Cat . Politicians . They wanted to see who was crazy enough to say that they were gay and to run for public office . They thought I was just a starving entertainer looking for publicity to make money . They found out that I was not a starving entertainer , that I was making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flabbergasted . But that opened the door . That made politicians and other people realize that there were gay people out there . <p> For Supervisor , you normally have three to five positions open and at the most you might have ten people running . The time that I ran , there were five positions and nine people were running . The filing deadline to run was ten hours away , and I saw that I had a chance . They got nervous , and within those ten ours the nine had increased to thirty-three people . A musician , a garbage collector oh , they went out and got anybody they could find thirty three people running for five positions ! The most there had ever been up until that time . It was done specifically to weaken the pool ( because I was in it ) . Well , I came in ninth ! Out of thirty three , that 's not bad ! So , you see , that 's what they did . I could have gotten more votes , but the gay community is our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gay community politicians knocking at the door saying " I would like to talk to you . " I 'd proved my point by saying there were 10,000 voting queens . And 10,000 voting queens is a good block . All we have to do is stick together . Shortly after that we elected a sheriff . Shortly after that we got mad and we defeated a man running for mayor . In other words , the politicians of San Francisco realized we were important . Just like today , conventions realize there is a caucus made up of gay people . At one time , they did n't  pay any attention . But now they do . <p> As little as I may be , I 'm part of the history . And no matter where you are at , and you do n't  know your history , you do n't  know where you are going . <p> I believe what I did then has helped make gay people understand that they have to be part of the community that they live in . That is what the Court system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco to be part of a community . How are you part of a community ? By getting out there and sweeping the streets with the straight people .

Nor am I sure that it is a victory for respectability , or the children who need far more than respectability to thrive . But I am sure that it is a victory for equal rights , and that it offers an opportunity for our queer political community to move on other social justice issues . Marriage was never the be all and end all of perfect equality , as mainstream media and LGBTQ advocacy organizations would have it . However it was a clear sign of unequal citizenship , and a suppression of our right to have the families we want to have in the ways we want to have them .

This wasnt democracy , as gay marriage opponents are framing it , nor did such strategies support freedom of religion . They were cynical campaigns of terror against all LGBT people , and they were a form of voter fraud that sapped the energy of progressive organizers and required extensive disinformation .

The unmarried or plurally married have often viewed ( many still do ) these domestic arrangements as crucial to their personal dignity ( a keyword of Obergefell ) and to their right to free expression. - If it is perhaps technically accurate to say that , over millennia , marriage " has promised nobility and dignity to all persons , regardless of their station in life , " that promise has been but a promise , and it is one that is ever more fragile one in the United States in the face of persistent racism , sexism and social inequality .

Are LGBT folk likely to do better at marriage than straight people ? No , but that is n't what the Constitution requires of anybody . Has love won the day ? Probably not : love is one of the more changeable emotions , a marriage destroyer as well as a marriage creator . Will children in LGBT families feel more secure ?

For decades , achieving gay rights has been a process of accepting half-measures , concessions and small victories while I prepare to be kicked in the face every time a SCOTUS decision or a hateful anti-marriage ballot measure is pending .

" ( 3 ) <p> " Whoredom " Danforth defined as " the violating of a single woman . " <p> " Adultery " was " the-violating of the Marriage bed .

" ( 5 ) <p> Danforth 's discourse was intended , he declared , to vindicate God 's " severity toward this vile and wicked Youth , " Benjamin Goad .

He was extremely addicted to Sloth and Idleness .... He gave himself to Self-pollution , and other Sodomitical wickedness .

" The Lord 's " severity " to Goad showed that " Whoredom , Adultery , Self-pollution and Sodomy , are as odious ... now , as ever .

" The guilty person might well ask , if God did not spare this " lewd Youth , " why should he spare any other " old practitioner in Sodomitical wickedness " ? Danforth instructed the wicked to repent " unclean Speculations , vile affections , unchaste fire , " so that God 's heart would not be broken by " thy whorish heart .

The impure of heart were warned to watch all their " thoughts and affections , " to " Stop thine Ears at filthy Jests , amorous Songs , " and to " Abhor all lascivious Touches , unchaste Embracings. " ( 18 ) <p> Finally , Danforth urged , " let us carefully Watch over our Children , Servants , and all that are under our Care and Charge , lest they be stained and defiled .

But in 1977 , my first parade was seeing gay teachers , gay religious groups , parents of gays , lesbian groups , and not the bars and disco floats that would later be added . My memory is that it was truly a march and commemoration of the Stonewall events and my first introduction to what would become a career in gay studies and activism .

He himself died of pneumonia , and two of his brothers and a nephew of consumption . Neither of my parents were morbid or eccentric .

Spiritualistic manifestations , hypnotic dabblings , and the other psychical fads of the day have little or no attraction for me . In fact , I have always been skeptical of them , and they rather bore me . <p> " At school I was an indolent , dreamy boy , shirking study , but otherwise fairly docile to my teachers .

As a child I was passionately fond of flowers , loved to be in the woods and alone , and wanted to become an artist . My parents opposed the latter wish and I gave way before their opposition . <p> " In me the homosexual nature is singularly complete , and is undoubtedly congenital . The most intense delight of my childhood ( even when a tiny boy in a nurse 's charge ) was to watch acrobats and riders at the circus . This was not so much for the skillful feats as on account of the beauty of their persons . Even then I cared chiefly for the more lithe and graceful fellows .

A certain bareback rider , a sort of jockey , used especially to please me on account of his handsome legs , which were clothed in fleshlings up to his waist , leaving his beautiful loins uncovered by a breech-clout . There was nothing consciously sensual about these reveries , because at the time I had no sensual feelings or knowledge . Curiously enough , the women-actors repelled me then ( as they do to this day ) quite as strongly as I was attracted by the men . <p> " I used , also , to take great pleasure in watching men and boys in swimming , but my opportunities for seeing them thus were extremely rare .

I was constantly falling in love with handsome boys whom I never knew ; nor did I ever try to mix in their company , for I was abashed before them , and had no liking nor aptitude for boyish games . Sometimes I played with girls because they were more quiet and gentler , but I cared for them little or not at all . <p> " As is usually the case , my parents neglected to impart to me any sexual knowledge , and such as I possessed was gathered furtively from tainted sources , bad boys ' talk at school and elsewhere .

At the time of puberty I spontaneously acquired the habit of masturbation . Once while bathing I found that a pleasant feeling came with touching the sexual organs . It was not long before I was confirmed in the habit .

I am not attracted by young women in any way . Even their physical beauty has little or no charm for me , and I often wonder how men can be so affected by it . On the other hand , I am not a woman-hater , and have several strong friends of the opposite sex . They are , however , women older than myself , and our friendship is based solely on certain intellectual or esthetic tastes we have in common . <p> " I have had practically no physical relations with men ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when about 19 or 21 , I started to embrace a beautifully formed youth with whom I was sleeping , but timidity and scruples got the better of my feelings , and , as my bedfellow was not amorously inclined toward me , nothing came of it .

It was now that I felt for the first time the full shock of love . He returned my affection , but both of us were shy of showing our feelings or speaking of them . Often when walking together after night-fall we would put our arms about each other . Sometimes , too , when sleeping together we would lie in close contact , and my friend once suggested that I put my legs against his . He frequently begged me to spend the night with him ; but I began to fear my feelings , and slept with him but seldom . We neither of us had any definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have related above , we had no further contact with each other . A few months after our amorous feelings had developed my friend died . His death caused me great distress , and my naturally religious temperament began to manifest itself quite strongly . At this time , too , I first read some writings of Mr. Addington Symonds , and certain allusions in his work , coupled with my recent experience , soon stirred me to a full consciousness of my inverted nature . <p> " About eight months after my friend 's death I happened to meet in a strange town a youth of about my own age who exerted upon me a strong and instant attraction . He possessed a refined , handsome face , was gracefully built , and , though he was rather undemonstrative , we soon became fast friends . <p> " We were together only for a few days , when I was obliged to leave for my home , and the parting caused me great unhappiness and depression. - A few months after we spent a vacation together . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same bathhouse . When I saw my friend naked for the first time he seemed to me so beautiful that I longed to throw my arms about him and cover him with kisses . I kept my feelings hidden , however , hardly daring to look at him for fear of being unable to restrain my desires . Several times afterward , in his room , I saw him stripped , with the same effect upon my emotions . Until I had seen him naked my feelings for him were not of a physical character , but afterward I longed for actual contact , but only by embraces and kisses . Though he was fond of me , he had absolutely no amorous longings for me , and being a simple , pure-minded fellow , would have loathed me for mine and my inverted nature . I was careful never to let him discover it , and I was made very unhappy when he confided that he was in love with a young girl whom he wished to marry . This episode took place several years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him have cooled considerably . <p> " I have always been very shy of showing any affectionate tendencies . Most of my acquaintances ( and close friends even ) think me curiously cold , and often wonder why I have never fallen in love or married . For obvious reasons I have never been able to tell them . <p> " Three or four years ago a little book by Coventry Patmore fell into my hands , and from its perusal resulted a strange blending of my religious and erotic notions . The desire to love and be loved is hard to drown , and , when I realized that homosexually it was neither lawful nor possible for me to love in this world , I began to project my longings into the next . By birth I am a Roman Catholic , and in spite of a somewhat skeptical temper , manage to remain one by conviction . <p> " From the doctrines of the Trinity , Incarnation , and Eucharist , I have drawn conclusions which would fill the minds of the average pietist with holy horror ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions are both logically and theologically defensible . The Divinity of my fancied paradise resembles in no way the vapid conceptions of Fra Angelico , or the Quartier St. Sulpice . His physical aspect , at least , would be better represented by some Praxitilean demigod or Flandrin 's naked , brooding boy . <p> " While these imaginings have caused me considerable moral disquietude , they do not seem wholly reprehensible , because I feel that the chief happiness I would derive by their realization would be mainly from the contemplation of the loved one , rather than from closer joys . <p> " I possess only a slight knowledge of the history and particulars of erotic mysticism , but it is likely that my notions are neither new nor peculiar , and many utterances of the few mystical writers with whose works I am acquainted seem substantially in accord with my own longings- and conclusions . In endeavoring to find for them some sanction of valid authority , I have always sought corroboration from members of my own sex ; hence am less likely to have fashioned my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You will rightly infer that it is difficult for me to say exactly how I regard ( morally ) the homosexual tendency . Of this much , however , I am certain , that , even , if it were possible , I would not exchange my inverted nature for a normal one . I suspect that the sexual emotions and even inverted ones have a more subtle significance than is generally attributed to them ; but modern moralists either fight shy of transcendental interpretations or see none , and I am ignorant and unable to solve the mystery these feelings seem to imply . <p> " Patmore speaks boldly enough , in his way , and Lacordaire has hinted at things , but in a very guarded manner . I have neither the ability nor opportunity to study what the mystics of the Middle Ages have to say along these lines , and , besides , the medieval way of looking at things is not congenial to me . The chief characteristic of my tendency is an overpowering admiration for male beauty , and in this I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely no words to tell you how powerfully such beauty affects me . Moral and intellectual worth is , I know , of greater value , but physical beauty I- seemore clearly , and it appears to me the most- vivid- ( if not the most perfect ) manifestation of the divine . A little incident may , perhaps , reveal to you my feelings more completely . Not long ago I happened to see an unusually well-formed young fellow enter a house of assignation with a common woman of the streets . The sight filled me with the keenest anguish , and the thought that his beauty would soon be at the disposal of a prostitute made me feel as if I were a powerless and unhappy witness to a sacrilege . It may be that my rage for male loveliness is only another outbreaking of the old Platonic mania , for as time goes on I find that I long less for the actual youth before me , and more and more for some ideal , perfect being whose bodily splendor and loving heart are the realities whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the birth and development within me of what , for lack of a better name , I term my homosexualized Patmorean ideal , life has become , in the main , a weary business .

Since the Assessor is an elected position in each of the 58 counties of California , I figured " what better way to influence the way things are done in the office than to run for Assessor ? " So , late in the fall of 1989 I started to lay out my campaign for the 1990 election . I waited for the filing deadline to make my move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because I really had no campaign in place since I had no experience running for office . <p> After the filing deadline , there were seven candidates challenging the incumbent and I had begun to have serious misgivings about my new adventure . What kept me going was the idea that I could make a difference in the office in spite of the fact that I had no fundraising experience or connections in that regard . <p> I plugged away and after the dust settled on primary election night , I had forced the incumbent into a run-off in the general election ! I suddenly had credibility and my primary election opponents became campaign volunteers . We raised money , retained a campaign manager and worked toward November . I was also now giving more speeches and had more public appearances . <p> None of these events made the impression on me that the Stonewall Democratic Club did . It was the first time I had addressed a lesbian and gay organization . While it never occurred to me to mention that I was gay , I found warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , two members wrote checks to my campaign on the spot . These two members , Steve Martin and Jeffrey Prang , became friends . They eventually ran for office and are now members of West Hollywoods City Council . <p> When the general election arrived , I had a very good shot at winning . That night , I did win , and for the first time in Los Angeles County history , a sitting assessor was defeated . As I walked out of the Downtown Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel and looked up , I said " Wow ! " I was struck by the realization that I was responsible for valuing all this real estate and felt higher than the highest of skyscrapers surrounding me . <p> Ive been a regular participant in the Christopher Street West Gay Pride Parade since my election .

My race had a good mix . Conventional wisdom says that we can only win in progressive or liberal districts with high gay populations . That we ca n't win against the political establishment . And that successful candidates will be those who happen to be gay , rather than those who are publicly gay . Those are just three more stereotypes about us I 've been happy to disprove . <p> I call my campaign a race of 9 months and 20 years . Eight months in the general election . A one month runoff . 20 years building a track record of civic involvement and a network of friends , contacts and supporters . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1995 special election . In a six-week campaign I finished third of 19 candidates . But I learned from the experience . <p> One advantage of the longer campaign was the chance to better control my public image . It started the usual way : Every time I saw my name in print it looked like " lesbian " or " gay " was my last name . We met with the local media and made a simple request . " Gay activist " was what I did in my free time , but I was an oil company employee from 8 to 5 . All my opponents were described by profession . We expected equal treatment . It worked . ( From then on it took at least a paragraph before the issue cropped up . ) Houston is a large media market , and I had nearly a million voters to reach ; so we had a large TV ad budget . We made sure that voters saw and heard me as they ate their breakfast cereal . I was the candidate of reform and good government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office as openness about my private life . <p> This was true coalition politics . I had incredible lesbian and transgendered volunteers . The bulk of my money was raised from gay men . Many conservatives voted for me because I was a longtime civic club officer , some because I worked for a conservative republican oilman . The police union endorsed me because they knew I understood their jobs , the African-American political establishment because they had worked with me to clean up the police department . <p> The experiences of running for office and of holding office are vastly different . I 've worked hard , helped pass several important ordinances and provided first-rate constituent services to all Houstonians . I have not been seen as the " lesbian Council Member . " But one of the most satisfying services my office provides is a safe place for our community to call with problems , especially ones involving the police or discrimination . <p> I enjoy my job and am excited to face each day .

But I feel an intense responsibility to be not only a good public servant , but also a role model for our community . <p> Most of the time , gay and lesbian issues , like many issues , are worked on behind the scenes . By having a seat at the table , I 've been able to make sure that transgendered people are part of our non-discrimination policy and to point out that the city 's nepotism rules ignore my life partner . However , I do n't hesitate to speak out about hate crimes or police harassment in the press and at the Council table .

It essentially shut down the business of the House for three days . How did that come about ? <p> A : It was the 1997 legislature and we were trying to pass a non-discrimination in employment bill . The House was 31-29 , with the Republicans controlling it by just one seat , so I was a swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leadership to allow the bill for the statewide ENDA to at least have a hearing in the Commerce Committee . Well , we got into February , the bill came out and was assigned to a committee by the Speaker who was supposedly supporting the legislation , but he sent it to Judiciary , which was a hostile committee . We told the speaker that this would have to be resolved by April 15th . We went through February and March , getting into April , and he just dragged his feet . So , with Jim Hill , another Republican , the two of us along with the Democratic Caucus , decided the best thing to do at that point was just to be bold . <p> It was April 15th and I made a motion on the House floor to withdraw the bill from its committee , and at that point everything came to a screeching halt . A lot of the Republicans , as I recall , fled the building because they were afraid they would actually have to face the issue . The Democrats just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Speaker , and after about two or three days of this the Speaker finally agreed the bill would be re-drafted and assigned to the Commerce Committee , and that we would have a public hearing , and within a week , a vote . We had the public hearing and a work session one evening and we passed it out of committee with only one " no . " That was the frustration of the thing we knew we had the votes and it was just people playing games with us ; lying and being deceitful . Then we passed it on the House floor a couple of days later 40-20 . A very large margin we were surprised with the bipartisan support . <p> Then it went over to the Senate where we did not have the leverage that we had in the House , and that was it . It was one vote short in the Republican caucus and it never went forward . Its just the way politics tends to be . That 's the way it goes . But we were exhilarated .

With very little notice the leadership wanted me to cut 13 million dollars out of the budget . We had spent a long time on this budget , and then , they wanted us to whack out 13 million dollars in a fifteen-minute hearing . So when the leadership notified me that they wanted me to have this hearing in the morning , I asked for permission to have it later in the afternoon , which they granted . I basically told he activists and the lobbyists that were involved with health care issues and human resources issues , to , you know , load the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 5:00 that afternoon and we had two overflow hearing rooms in addition to the committee hearing room . <p> I opened the hearing by asking the people who were advocating for the cuts to come forward and to explain where those cuts could be made .

So I said , " Well , were just going to give everybody a chance to say what they think . " We spent like three hours having these people parade through , and still no one would come down and advocate why these cuts had to be made . Finally the other Republicans on the committee must have gotten tired and disgusted and they brought the committee co-chairs down to try to get it through . The way the voting is set up , the Chairman votes last . Everybody voted and it was a tie vote , so I was the deciding vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great feeling to be honest with you , because we stuck it back in the leaderships face .

In March 1978 , Ouida Lindsey , a popular WFLD prime time talk show host , interviewed several African American gay men about the challenges of being African American and gay . <p> At the same time , the Chicago Gay Liberation had gained media and cultural exposure in spite of on-going tensions between lesbians and gay men , and between Black homosexuals and their white counterparts . A Women 's Caucus and a Black Caucus , which later became The Chicago Lesbian Liberation and The Third World Gay Revolution , formed within the Chicago Gay Liberation to address the specific concerns of lesbians and Black gay men . <p> By the early 1980s , three African American gay groups had developed : National Coalition of Black Gays " Chicago Chapter ( NCBG ) , Gentle Waves ( Chicago 's Black Lesbian group ) and the Committee of Black Gay Men .

And although it did not mark the beginning of New Yorks LGBT movementmembers of the Mattachine Society of New York ( MSNY ) and the Daughters of Bilitis ( DOB ) had been fighting for civil rights for years when Stonewall took placeit did initiate a new wave of activism , one that differed markedly from the homophile movements that preceded it . <p> In the years following Stonewall , LGBT individuals organized on unprecedented levels , forging new forms of activism that would change the direction of the movement and the consciousness of a generation .

The movement that emerged out of Stonewall was unique in the emphasis it placed on empowering gays , lesbians , and transgender individuals to come out , be proud , and fight back against oppression . But the movement never coalesced around a dominant political philosophy or organizational strategy , and fierce debatesboth within and among different groupspersisted throughout the 1970s .

In Gay New York , Historian George Chauncey argues that adherence to normative gender roles , more than the choice of actual female sexual partners , was the practice from which men derived their sense of masculine integrity during this period . <p> Referring to the fairies and " pansies " who populated the streets of New York 's working class in the first decades of the century , Chauncey claimed : <p> " The determinative criterion in the identification of men as fairies was not the extent of their same sex desire or activity , but rather the gender persona and status they assumed . It was only the men who assumed the sexual and other cultural roles ascribed to women who identified themselves and were identified by others as fairies The fundamental division of male sexual actors , then , was not between ' heterosexual ' and ' Homosexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were regarded as men , and effeminate males , known as fairies or pansies , who were regarded as men as virtual women , or , more precisely , as members of a third sex that combined element of the male and female .

Many of his graduate students ' research projects throughout the 1930s incorporated homosexuals into their analyses of urban life. 3 Student papers described frequent , casual encounters with African American gay men in the city . By the 1930s , Black gay men had become a fixture of Chicago urban life and a legitimate subject for sociology research. 4 <p> " Lester , 16 , Negro " <h> Homosexual Identities on the South Side <p> Homosexual identities on Chicago 's South Side usually revolved around gender identity . <p> In an interview with a University of Chicago sociologist , Leo , a Black homosexual , reported having read that " men who desired men were often effeminate .

For example , Chicago journalist Frank Davis noted that female impersonator Mae West confused her fans because her feminine accessories did not allow one to forget her body built like a " boxer or football player . " Moreover , " although Barrows repeatedly had a weakness for men , " Davis added that he engaged in sexual relations with " a very sexy German girl . " In a similar tone , Clarenz , a female impersonator at 101 Ranch , married Alberta Anderson . <p> This confusion between sexual and gender identities confirms the tensions between the two competing systems . For some , gender identity was independent from sexual orientations , and for others they were connected . <h> " Case of Arthur , Age 20 , Colored , Only Child " <p> Other young African American gay males interviewed by Ernest Burgess and his students confirmed that their identity was deeply grounded in gender identities .
