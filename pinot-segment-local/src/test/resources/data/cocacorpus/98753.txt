When lost for words , we point , wave , motion and otherwise use our hands to attempt to indicate meaning . However , much of this form of communication is intuitive and is not generally seen to be , by itself , an effective substitution for speech . <p> John Bulwer ( 1606 " 1656 ) , an English doctor and philosopher , attempted to record the vocabulary contained in hand gestures and bodily motions and , in 1644 , published Chirologia , or the Naturall Language of the Hand alongside a companion text Chironomia , or the Art of Manual Rhetoric , an illustrated collection of hand and finger gestures that were intended for an orator to memorise and perform whilst speaking . <p> For Bulwer , gesture was the only from of speech that was inherently natural to mankind , and he saw it as a language with expressions as definable as written words . He describes some recognisable hand gestures , such as stretching out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey grief , alongside more unusual movements , including pretending to wash your hands as a way to protest innocence , and to clasp the right fist in the left palm as a way to insult your opponent during an argument . Although Bulwer 's theory has its roots in classical civilisation , from the works of Aristotle , he was inspired by hundreds of different works , including biblical verses , medical texts , histories , poems and orations , in order to demonstrate his conclusions . <p> The language of gesture proved a popular subject in the age of eloquence , and inspired many similar works . Bulwer 's work was primarily meant for the pulpit , but also had applications for the stage . Although we do not know if these hand gestures were ever used by public speakers as they were intended , there is some evidence of the book 's impact on popular culture .

A year later , Cherokee Chief Kanagatucko asked for peace and for an officer to accompany him home as a sign that the hostilities had ended . The man who volunteered for the job was Henry Timberlake . Having first traveled with Chief Kanagatucko to the town of Tomotley where he met Chief Ostenaco , he later arranged for Ostenaco and two other Cherokee leaders to travel to London in 1762 after Ostenaco expressed a wish to meet King George III . Timberlake describes a near cultural faux-pas between the two leaders : <p> They were struck with the youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great an opinion of his affability as of his power , the greatness of which may be seen on my telling them in what manner to behave ; for finding Ostenaco preparing his pipe to smoke with his majesty , according to the Indian custom of declaring friendship , I told him he must neither offer to shake hands or smoke with the King , as it was an honour for the greatest of our nation to kiss his hand . You are in the right , says he , for he commands over all next to the Man above , and nobody is his equal . <p> He also tells of the Cherokees encounter with British alcohol : <p> Once , in particular , one of the young Indians got extremely intoxicated , and committed several irregularities , that ought rather to be attributed to those that enticed them , than to the simple Indians , who drank only to please them .

The book has become the subject of renewed interest in recent years for its innovative graphic conception and its style which prefigures the modernist experiments of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements . Information design writer Edward Tufte refers to the book in his work on graphic design and McLean in his Victorian book design of 1963 . In 2010 Taschen republished the work in a wonderful facsimile edition .

The emblem book phenomenon was a truly pan-European affair , as Saunders notes , " Tracing the various migrations across Europe of the love emblems created in the Netherlands by Heinsius and Vaenius , in their various polyglot forms emblems which , themselves , owed considerable debt to influences from other parts of Europe , shows clearly the extent to which the emblem had become a cross-European phenomenon , accessible to all reading publics either in a Latin text or in one or other of the various European vernanculars included in them .

@@72829499 @1529499/ <h> Photographs of a Falling Cat ( 1894 ) <p> Certain scientific circles of the nineteenth century were home to a rather unexpected preoccupation : the dropping of cats . While at university in Trinity College , Cambridge , James Clerk Maxwell , who would go onto become arguably the greatest theoretical physicist of the nineteenth century , was reportedly well known for the activity . In a letter to his wife reflecting on this reputation hed earned , Maxwell wrote , " There is a tradition in Trinity that when I was here I discovered a method of throwing a cat so as not to light on its feet , and that I used to throw cats out of windows . I had to explain that the proper object of research was to find how quick the cat would turn round , and that the proper method was to let the cat drop on a table or bed from about two inches , and that even then the cat lights on her feet . " He was not the only prominent scientist to be intrigued by the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly were able to defy the laws of Newtonian physics and change motion in mid air to land on their feet . At around the same time , the eminent mathematician George Stokes was also prone to a spot of " cat-turning " . As his daughter relates in a 1907 memoir : " He was much interested , as also was Prof. Clerk Maxwell about the same time , in cat-turning , a word invented to describe the way in which a cat manages to fall upon her feet if you hold her by the four feet and drop her , back downwards , close to the floor . " <p> Despite the many falling cats , neither Maxwell nor Stokes made much headway in their investigations . It was n't until some decades later , with the invention of chronophotography ( which allowed many photographs to be taken in quick succession ) , that a more rigorous study could be applied beyond the limitations of the human eye . The man to do it was the French scientist and photographer +tienne-Jules Marey who in 1894 created a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deductions . The images pictured below , captured at 12 frames per second , debunked the idea that the cat was using the droppers hand as a fulcrum in order to begin the motion of turning at the beginning of the fall . Rather , the pictures showed that the cat had no rotational motion at the start of its descent and so was somehow acquiring angular momentum while in free-fall . Marey published these pictures , and his investigations , in an 1894 issue of Comptes Rendus , with a summary of his findings published in the journal Nature in the same year . The latter summarises Mareys thoughts as follows : <p> M. Marey thinks that it is the inertia of its own mass that the cat uses to right itself . The torsion couple which produces the action of the muscles of the vertebra acts at first on the forelegs , which have a very small motion of inertia on account of the front feet being foreshortened and pressed against the neck .

In the second phase of the action , the attitude of the feet is reversed , and it is the inertia of the forepart that furnishes a fulcrum for the rotation of the rear . <p> In a rather humorous turn the author of the article also states that " The expression of offended dignity shown by the cat at the end of the first series indicates a want of interest in scientific investigation .

After landing on the island of Tahiti , Banks was soon to become an invaluable member of the crew by virtue of the friendly relations he struck up with the islanders ; a mutual trust he built up through his openness , natural curiosity and fascination with their customs and way of life . In his willingness to learn their language , eat their food , sleep in their huts , record their customs and partake in their rituals , Banks was pioneering a new kind of science that of ethnology . As the weeks progressed his botanical observations increasingly gave way to a study of the people ( " studies " that were not always at arms length ! ) .

It was in a place where the shore was not guarded by a reef as is usualy the case , consequently a high surf fell upon the shore , a more deadfull one I have not often seen : no European boat could have landed in it and I think no Europaean who had by any means got into it could possibly have saved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large stones . In the midst of these breakers 10 or 12 Indians were swimming who whenever a surf broke near them divd under it with infinite ease , rising up on the other side ; but their cheif amusement was carried on by the stern of an old canoe , with this before them they swam out as far as the outermost breach , then one or two would get into it and opposing the blunt end to the breaking wave were hurried in with incredible swiftness . Sometimes they were carried almost ashore but generaly the wave broke over them before they were half way , in which case they divd and quickly rose on the other side with the canoe in their hands , which was towd out again and the same method repeated .

Having grown up with her father John George Children " a chemist , mineralogist , and not too successful zoologist " she was surrounded by science and also contributed to her fathers work . Her engravings of shells can be found in her fathers translated edition of Jean-Baptiste de Monet Lamarck 's Genera of Shells , published in 1823 , but it is her work with cyanotypes that she is best known for . Through her father and her husband , Atkins came to know both William Henry Fox Talbot , a pioneer of early photography who invented a process of creating photographs on paper treated with salt and a solution of silver nitrate , and Sir John Herschel , the inventor of the cyanotype printing method . She became interested in the cyanotype process which produced images through so-called sun-printing . The object is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citrate and potassium ferricyanide , after which it is exposed to sunlight and then washed in water , leading to the uncovered areas of the paper turning a dark blue . The process , known as blueprinting , was later used to reproduce architectural and engineering drawings , but Atkins chose to use it for what is considered to be the first work with photographic illustrations , namely her Photographs of British Algae : Cyanotype Impressions ( 1843 ) . Only 13 copies of the handwritten book are known to exist , some of which are in various stages of completion . Later , she would collaborate with another female botanist , Anne Dixon ( 1799 " 1864 ) , in making two more books featuring cyanotypes : Cyanotypes of British and Foreign Ferns ( 1853 ) and Cyanotypes of British and Foreign Flowering Plants and Ferns ( 1854 ) .

@@72829560 @1529560/ <h> The Englishman of Etretat <p> by Guy de Maupassant <p> Translated from the French by Elliot Lewis . <p> An important English poet has just made the crossing to France to greet Victor Hugo . The papers are alive with his name and the salons abuzz with the rumours that surround it . Fifteen years ago , I had the pleasure upon several occasions to meet Algernon Charles Swinburne . I would like to present an account of the man as I knew him , and to capture the uncommon impression he made on me , an impression that remains vivid despite the time that has passed . <p> I did not know him personally , merely by sight : a small man , somewhat flabby though not at all fat , with a reserved gait , and an almost invisible blond moustache . Our paths crossed by chance and I was to discover that this savage ' had pleasant manners , the easy facility peculiar to those English eccentrics that one finds scattered here and there about the earth . He was possessed of an uncommon intellect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired Edgar Poe . He had translated a volume of extraordinary Icelandic Legends of which I would most urgently welcome a French translation . Predisposed to the most intricate of spiritual distortions , he inclined instinctively towards the supernatural , the macabre , the profane , but nevertheless and with typically English phlegm , spoke utterly naturally of such unsettling subjects , his calm and quiet voice conferring thereupon a hallucinatory degree of normality . <p> With a lofty disdain for the conventions , prejudices and moral values of the world , he had nailed to his house a quite brazen name , offering an invitation barely more inviting than a hotel notice marked tourists will be shot ' . Having never previously set foot there , I was to be invited to lunch following my small part in a rescue party formed for a friend of his , carried out to sea . Arriving hurriedly only after the near-completion of the mission , I was nevertheless to receive the effusive thanks of the two Englishmen , and their request of my presence the next day . <p> The rescued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained the body of a child , carrying an enormous head upon slight shoulders and an undeveloped chest . His frail face , all narrow eyes , goateed chin and receding jaw , was almost entirely swallowed up by the great swollen protuberance of a forehead both abnormal and magnificent in stature . And while the former conspired to give him a somewhat reptilian air , the latter suggested nothing less than a veritable genius . This already unusual character was furthermore distinguished by a halting nervousness , moving abruptly and unexpectedly , as a broken jack-in-the-box . His name was Algernon Charles Swinburne , son of an English admiral and maternal grandson of the Earl of Ashburnham . His troubling physiognomy was utterly transformed as soon as he began to speak . Rarely , if ever , have I witnessed such self-possessed elegance , accuracy and eloquence of speech . His words issued forth with a shimmering vitality , galvanised by an imagination both clear and quick , but also hypersensitive and fantastical . Accompanied by his erratic gestures , this sparkling elocution penetrated quite directly the minds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashes of inspiration , as the abrupt flares of a lighthouse , seeming all at once to illuminate a whole world of ideas . <p> The house where these two men resided was a pleasant , if peculiar abode . The walls were replete with astonishing and strange paintings , veritable expressions of insanity . For instance , if my memory serves me correctly , one watercolour depicted a pink seashell carrying afloat a human skull upon an endless sea , beneath a moon of human form . Here and there were scattered skeletal remains . Particularly of note was a flayed hand ; its desiccated skin intact , blackened muscles exposed and ancient traces of blood upon the bright white bone . The lunch was to remain an impenetrable mystery , entirely precluding my ability to judge its merits ; a roasted monkey nevertheless left me without the desire to make of it a regular dining habit . As did the large monkey that ran free about us playfully plunging my head into my glass as I made to drink of the desire to any further keep company with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have left me with the unmistakable impression of two souls utterly apart from society , both weird and brilliant , belonging to that same lineage of tortured brilliance that gave birth amongst others , to Poe and to Hoffman . Genius is commonly held to be a sort of delirium of the highest intelligence , and if this is true , then Algernon Charles Swinburne is undoubtedly a man of genius . Great rational minds are never recognized to attain to genius , while we gladly lavish this highest of titles upon often lesser intelligences touched with a little madness . In any case , this poet remains among the foremost of his generation owing to the originality of his vision and the prodigious facility of his technique . An exalted and furious lyricist , he remains unconcerned by the noble and good truths sought so doggedly by French artists of today . Instead he pursues the subtlest of ideas , dreams and chimeras , offering insights that while occasionally exaggerated are as often wonderful and ingeniously grandiose . <p> Two years later , I returned to find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being sold , and as a souvenir , I bought that frightful flayed hand .

This violent servant-boy was subsequently to flee before the revolver of his enraged master , wandering vagrant and without food for several days before reappearing in the streets as a peddler of barley sugar . He was finally expelled from the country after strangling half to death a dissatisfied customer . <p> The world would be altogether gayer if one chanced more often upon homes like this . <p> ( This story appeared in the " Gaulois , " November 29 , 1882 .

With their radical future visions and alternative realities made plausible by their rooting in science , Wells books have had a huge impact on the way we envisage ( and indeed perhaps shape ) our future .

Toklas , written in the voice of her life partner , Alice B. Toklas , was a bestseller and propelled Stein from the obscurity of a cult literary scene into the limelight of mainstream attention . A lesbian , Stein was the author of one of the earliest coming out stories " Q.E.D " , originally written in 1903 , and her essay " Miss Furr and Miss Skeene " is often considered to contain the first published use of the word " gay " ( which it uses over one hundred times ) in reference to same-sex relationships and those who have them . <p> Born into a vaudeville family in Piqua , Kansas , Keaton became one of the most important figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , producer , writer , and stunt performer , he is best known for his peculiar brand of physical comedy , with his consistently stoic , deadpan expression , which earned him the nickname " The Great Stone Face " .

Of the eight essays only one is written by a woman , Helena Westermarck , a Finnish artist and womens historian active in the suffragette movement . From the rather lavish preface by Sparrow : <p> What is genius ? Is it not both masculine and feminine ? Are not some of its qualities instinct with manhood , while others delight us with the most winning graces of a perfect womanhood ? Does not genius make its appeal as a single creative agent with a two-fold sex ? <p> But if genius has its Mirandas and its Regans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Prospero and Ferdinand to Caliban and Trinculo , its union of the sexes does not remain always at peace within the sphere of art . Sometimes , in the genius of men , the female characteristics gain mastery over the male qualities ; at other times the male attributes of womans genius win empire and precedence over the female ; and whenever these things happen , the works produced in art soon recede from the worlds sympathies , losing all their first freshness . They may guide us , perhaps , as finger-posts in history , pointing the way to some movement of interest ; but their first popularity as art is never renewed . Style is the man in the genius of men , style is the woman in the genius of the fair .

Thus , then , the bisexuality of genius has limits in art , and those limits should be determined by a workers sex . <p> As examples in art of complete womanliness , mention may be made of two exquisite portraits by Madame Le Brun , in which , whilst representing her little daughter and herself , the painter discloses the inner essence and the life of maternal love , and discloses them with a caressing playfulness of passion unattainable by men , and sometimes unappreciated by men . Here , indeed , we have the poetry of universal motherhood , common to the household hearts of good women the wide world over . Such pictures may not be the highest form of painting , but highest they are in their own realm of human emotion ; and they recall to ones memory that truth in which Napoleon the Great ranked the gentler sex as the most potent of all creative artists .

@@72829606 @1529606/ <h> Texts in Sebalds The Rings of Saturn <p> At the time of his death in 2001 at the age of 57 , the German writer W. G. Sebald was cited by many critics as a future winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature . It was his book The Rings of Saturn , written in 1995 ( translated into English in 1998 ) , which went a long way to securing Sebalds reputation as a writer pioneering a new kind of literary fiction . The book is exemplary of his strange and unique style : the hybridity of genres , the blurring of fact and fiction , the indistinct black and white photographs , and his meditation on the destructive nature of history , the human lives affected , and the restorative power of art . <p> The book is , on one level , a walking tour through the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk , Sebalds adopted home ( hed taught literature at the UEA there since 1970 ) .

In and amongst these meandering connections recurring motifs of silk , obscuring mists , combustion and burning are woven throughout to create an intricately patterned whole . <p> Among the many lives of the past encountered is a myriad array of literary figures .

The list begins and ends with the great polymath Thomas Browne , an appropriate framing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a presence which permeates the whole book . Indeed , in the way he effortlessly moves through different histories and voices , it is perhaps in Brownes concept of the Eternal Present which Sebald can be seen to operate , in this mysterious community of the living and the dead . <p> ( The works below are shown roughly in order of their appearance in the book . Where possible the English translations of the non-English works are featured , with links to originals given below . The Sebald quotes given are from the brilliant English translation by Michael Hulse , and page numbers from the 1999 paperback Harvill Press edition . ) <p> Hydrotophia or Urne Buriall and Garden of Cyrus by Thomas Browne ( 1658 ) <p> The invisibility and intangibility of that which moves us remained an unfathomable mystery for Thomas Browne , too , who saw our world as no more than a shadow image of another one far beyond . In his thinking and writing he therefore sought to look upon earthly existence , from the things that were closest to him to the spheres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one might even say of the creator . His only means of achieving the sublime heights that this endeavor required was a parlous loftiness in his language . In common with other English writers of the seventeenth century , Browne wrote out of the fullness of his erudition , deploying a vast repertoire of quotations and the names of authorities who had gone before , creating complex metaphors and analogies , and constructing labyrinthine sentences that sometimes extend over one or two pages , sentences that resemble processions or a funeral cort+ge in their sheer ceremonial lavishness . It is true that , because of the immense weight of the impediments he is carrying , Browne 's writing can be held back by the force of gravitation , but when he does succeed in rising higher and higher through the circles of his spiralling prose , borne aloft like a glider on warm currents of air , even today the reader is overcome by a sense of levitation . The greater the distance , the clearer the view : one sees the tiniest of details with the utmost clarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reversed opera glass and through a microscope at the same time . And yet , says Browne , all knowledge is enveloped in darkness . What we perceive are no more than isolated lights in the abyss of ignorance , in the shadow-filled edifice of the world .

( Pg.18/19 ) <p> Gustave Flaubert was for her by far the finest of writers , and on many occasions she quoted long passages from the thousands of pages of his correspondence , never failing to astound me . Janine had taken an intense personal interest in the scruples which dogged Flauberts writing , that fear of the false which , she said , sometimes kept him confined to his couch for weeks or months on end in the dread that he would never be able to write another word without compromising himself in the most grievous of ways . Moreover , Janine said , he was convinced that everything he had written hitherto consisted solely in a string of the most abysmal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Janine maintained that the source of Flauberts scruples was to be found in the relentless spread of stupidity which he had observed everywhere , and which he believed had already invaded his own head . It was ( so supposedly once he said ) as if one was sinking into sand . This was probably the reason , she said , that sand possessed such significance in all of Flauberts works . Sand conquered all . Time and again , said Janine , vast dust clouds drifted through Flauberts dreams by day and by night , raised over the arid plains of the African continent and moving north across the Mediterranean and the Iberian peninsula till sooner or later they settled like ash from a fire on the Tuileries gardens , a suburb of Rouen or a country town in Normandy , penetrating into the tiniest crevices . In a grain of sand in the hem of Emma Bovarys winter gown , said Janine , Flaubert saw the whole of the Sahara . For him , every speck of dust weighed as heavy as the Atlas mountains .

If you look out from the cliff-top across the sea towards where the town must have been , you can sense the immense power of emptiness . Perhaps it was for this reason that Dunwich became a place of pilgrimage for melancholy poets in the Victorian age . Algernon Charles Swinburne , for instance , went there on several occasions in the 1870s with his companion Theodore Watts-Dunton , whenever the excitement of London literary life threatened to overtax his nerves , which had been hypersensitive since his early childhood .

Initially he spent the periods of convalescence at the family country estate , but later , ever more frequently , he went to the coast with the trusty Watts-Dunton . Rambles from Southwold to Dunwich , through the windblown fields of sedge , worked like a sedative upon him .

Construction ceased after only 47 metres had been completed . The abandoned tower ( known as the Watkins Folly , or The London Stump ) remained a spectacle in the park for a number of years before being deemed unsafe and blown up in 1904 .

In what equated to something akin to a " super-sauna " , Blagden and his co-experimenters ( including a dog ) subjected themselves to enormously hot temperatures . Beginning at a modest 100 degrees Fahrenheit ( 38 degrees Celsius ) , by the 1775 session they progressed to temperatures upward of a whopping 260 degrees Fahrenheit ( 127 degrees Celsius ) . Not surprisingly the air was at times quite literally scorching , and a full cladding of clothing was mostly worn to protect their skin , though Blagden did experiment one time being in the room naked from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rays of the hot irons . Among his many observations , in his latter 1775 report to the Royal Society , Blagden became the first to explicitly recognise the role of perspiration in thermoregulation , seeing that the body temperatures of both the heat-subjected humans and heat-subjected dog were significantly lower than the air they were exposed to . The dog endured a temperature of 236 degrees Fahrenheit ( 113 degrees Celsius ) for a full hour , with seemingly little distress , and recording a body temperature of only 110 Fahrenheit ( 43 degrees Celsius ) higher than a dogs normal body temperature , but significantly cooler than the room . In reality the dogs temperature was probably lower by a few degrees , as Blagden acknowledged he had a bit of trouble taking the measurement . In any case , such a difference in body and room temperature was an important one . Fearing the reliability of his thermometers , Blagden thought up a control for this thermo-regulating tendency of living bodies which hed observed a fat juicy steak . As he explained in his Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallacy in the degree of heat shewn by the thermometer , but that the air which we breathed was capable of producing all the well-known effects of such an heat on inanimate matter , we put some eggs and a beef-steak upon a tin frame , placed near the standard thermometer , and farther distant from the cockle than from the wall of the room . In about twenty minutes the eggs were taken out , roasted quite hard ; and in forty-seven minutes the steak was not only dressed , but almost dry . Another beef-steak was rather overdone in thirty-three minutes . In the evening , when the heat was still greater , we laid a third beef-steak in the same place : and as it had now been observed , that the effect of the heated air was much increased by putting it in motion , we blew upon the steak with a pair of bellows , which produced a visible change on its surface , and seemed to hasten the dressing ; the greatest part of it was found pretty well done in thirteen minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> E-mail : 91052 @qwx711052

The war was fought between the Native American Modoc people and the United States Army between 1872-1873 and had its roots in the forced resettlement of the Native Americans . The Modoc fighting force was spearheaded by Kintpuash AKA " Captain Jack " ( first to be featured below ) and included 52 other warriors in a band of more than 150 Modoc people . After nearly a year of fighting the Modoc warriors were defeated and Jack and three warriors were executed for the murders of two peace commissioners , and two others were sentenced to life imprisonment . The remaining 153 Modoc of the band were held as prisoners of war until 1909 . <p> Heller , a German-born qualified pharmacist and photographer who is believed to have emigrated to the United States in 1855 , was the first photographer on the scene .

One stand out element is the huge number of acts and shows involving female nudity of some kind , though this may tell us as much about the tastes of the cameraman as about the surprisingly liberal ( and sexist ) attitudes of the time . Apparently after one particular topless show called " Living Magazine Covers " , the NYPD made a sweep of the fair to tone down the sexual content of some of the girls shows , only to then label them as " art " . Secondly , although cited as being taken by an " amateur " , this was evidently a pretty serious hobby for the man behind the camera Philip Medicus .

@@72829746 @1529746/ <h> Jap Herron : A Novel written from the Ouija Board ( 1917 ) <p> Jap Herron : a novel written from the ouija board , with an introduction , The coming of Jap Herron ; 1917 ; M. Kennerley , New York . <p> Jap Herron was a novel written , supposedly , by a deceased Mark Twain from beyond the grave , dictated via the medium of a Ouija board . The scribe ( faithfully taking down notes , or perhaps a little more than just that , depending on your view ) was Emily Grant Hutchings , a woman who had actually corresponded with Twain 15 years earlier . In their exchange of letters he had given her advice and , interestingly , also marked one of her letters with the words : " Idiot ! Must preserve " . According to the lengthy introduction by Hutchings , " The Coming of Jap Herron " , she and a woman named Lola Hays began receiving messages from Twain in 1915 when playing around with a Ouija board at a spiritualist meeting in St. Louis . Dallying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it seems receiving literary output from the great beyond was not so unusual either . The Jap Herron book came out at a time when the Ouija board communications of " Patience Worth " via St. Louis writer Pearl Curran , a friend of Hutchings ( who was present during the first " communications " with Worth ) , was also capturing national attention . Indeed , as a New York Times article of the time remarks , Jap Herron was " the third novel in the last few months that has claimed the authorship of some dead and gone being who , unwilling to give up human activities , has appeared to find in the ouija board a material means of expression " . This was , however , the most high profile author to be have been involved . Twains daughter , Clara Clemens , took particular issue with the book , and she , along with the publishers Harper and Brothers , who for 17 years had owned the sole rights to Twains works , went to court to halt the publication . In response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain Professor Hyslop , claimed that Claras father ( after more Ouija board activity ) was " in a state of intellectual torture because of the difficulty he is having in getting his momentous work into print " . The case , however , never went to trial as Hutchings eventually agreed to cease publication , and destroy any copies they could find , meaning surviving copies of the book are extremely rare . <p> Here is the aforementioned , subtly scathing , New York Times article on the book from 1917 , the year it came out : <p> The ouija board seems to have come to stay as a competitor of the typewriter in the production of fiction . For this is the third novel in the last few months that has claimed the authorship of some dead and gone being who , unwilling to give up human activities , has appeared to find in the ouija board a material means of expression . This last story is unequivocal in its claim of origin . For those who are responsible for it appear to be convinced beyond doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided their hands as the story was spelled out on the board . Emily Grant Hutchings and Lola V. Hays are the sponsors of the tale . Mrs. Hays being the passive recipient whose hands upon the pointer were especially necessary . St. Louis is the scene of the exploit , as it is also of the literary labors of that ouija board that writes the " Patience Worth " stories . Emily Grant Hutchings , who writes the introductory account of how it all happened is from Hannibal , Mo. , the home of Mark Twains boyhood , and in her the alleged spirit of the author seems to have put much confidence . Her long description of how the story was written and of the many conversations they had with Mark Twain through the ouija board contains many quotations of his remarks that sometimes have a reminiscent flavor of the humorists characteristic conversation . <p> The story itself , a long novelette , is scened in a Missouri town and tells how a lad born to poverty and shiftlessness , by the help of a fine-souled and high-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manhood and helped to regenerate his town . There is evident a rather striking knowledge of the conditions of life and the peculiarities of character in a Missouri town , the dialect is true , and the picture has , in general , many features that will seem familiar to those who know their " Tom Sawyer " and " Huckleberry Finn . " A country paper fills an important place in the tale , and there is constant proof of familiarity with the life and work of the editor of such a sheet . The humor impresses as a feeble attempt at imitation and , while there is now and then a strong sure touch of pathos or a swift and true revelation of human nature , the " sob stuff " that oozes through many of the scenes , and the overdrawn emotions are too much for credulity . If this is the best that " Mark Twain " can do by reaching across the barrier , the army of admirers that his works have won for him will all hope that he will hereafter respect that boundary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not believe my good fortune to stumble upon this article today , and I have to say right here and now how grateful I am for having done so .

Cade Gall and published in the January 1893 issue of The Strand magazine . On the premise that a book from a hundred years in the future ( published in 1993 ) called The Past Dictates of Fashion has been inexplicably found in a library , the article proceeds to divulge this books contents namely , a look back at the last century of fashion , which , of course , for the reader in 1893 , would be looking forward across the next hundred years into the future . In this imagined future , fashion has become a much respected science ( studied in University from the 1950s onwards ) and is seen to be " governed by immutable laws " . <p> The designs themselves have a somewhat unaccountable leaning toward the medieval , or as John Ptak astutely notes , " a weird alien/Buck Rogers/Dr .

If indeed this was a genuine attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion might look like , its fascinating to see how far off the mark he was , proving yet again how difficult it is to predict future aesthetics . It is also fascinating to see how Gall envisaged the progression of fashions across the decades considering that , from our perspective now , his vision of 1970 does n't  much look much different to 1920 and to see which aspects of his present he was n't even able to consider losing to the march of time ( e.g. the long length of womens skirts and the seemingly ubiquitous frill ) . As is often the case when we come into contact with historic attempts to predict a future which for us is now past , it is like glimpsing into another possible world , a parallel universe that could have been ( or which , perhaps , did indeed play out " somewhere " ) . <h> 1900-1920 <h> 1920s <h> 1930s <h> 1940s <h> 1950s <h> 1960s <h> 1970s <h> 1980s <h> 1993 91047 @qwx711047 <h> Space &amp; The Future 91050 @qwx711050 <p> I find it especially interesting that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs . <p> Andrew <p> They never thought theyd wear shorts ! <p> Mike Gabrieli <p> Nothing has ever made me more appreciative of Coco Chanel and the advent of the genre pauvre . <p> TheLyniezian <p> Apparently they presupposed that fashions of the 20th century would be about taking a mixed bag of ideas from previous centuries and make them appear even more ridiculous . <p> Johnny <p> Did anyone else have the thought that his vision for the 60s was n't too far off ?

After his death in 1881 the Rijksmuseum was able to acquire this important collection of c. 25.000 prints , drawings and books illustrating the history of the Netherlands , including a remarkable series of prints published in 1713 by the Dutch printmaker Abraham Allard under the title t Lust-Hof van Momus ( Fig. 1 ) .

Although Abraham Allard ( 1676-1725 ) was responsible for publishing the collected prints , a large part of the prints had been previously etched and published separately as broadsides by his father Carel Allard ( 1648-1709 ) , more or less simultaneously with the depicted contemporary events . <p> Carel and Abraham Allard were based in Amsterdam and ran a shop between the other publishers and sellers of books and prints in the Kalverstraat near the Dam Square . Carel Allard was one of the major publishers of prints and maps during the Golden Age in the Netherlands and after his death in 1709 his son Abraham took over his father 's business . Both father and son however acquired an i 'll reputation due to accusations of copyright infringement and the publication of obscene images , a reputation which the prints in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1699 applied for privilege to publish prints with the States of Holland he was informed that this would only be possible if he submitted his work to examination in advance .

For example , on the fifteenth of April a severe storm will wreak havoc on the southeastern coast of France and on July 29 king Louis XIV himself will die of a sickness of the stomach . Carel Allard has drawn these predictions literally from a Dutch translation of the English letter Predictions for the Year 1708 , the famous attack on Almanac-makers and astrologers written by Jonathan Swift under the pseudonym of Isaac Bickerstaff .

One of the conditions of the treaty required Louis XIV to expel James Francis Edward Stuart , the old pretender , from France and recognise Anne 's German Protestant successors from the House of Hanover . Allard chose or perhaps the copperplate offered him the chance to illustrate this cutting off of the Jacobean claim to the British throne as an act of castration .

To mark this occasion , a small exhibition at the Library explores the engineering challenges involved in the construction of the Forth Bridge through a selection of photographs , designs , reports and sketches , including the Philip Phillips photographs from the Library 's digital gallery . <h> Designing the Bridge <p> Crossing the Forth had long been problematic for the travelling public in the east of Scotland . Ferries had provided a connection across the river for many centuries , and improvements to piers in the estuary in the early part of the 19th century made it possible for ships to dock irrespective of tides . Alternative crossings were also proposed during this period , with the river surveyed for a tunnel in 1806 , and a design for a suspension bridge considered in 1818 . <p> Detail from " Plans and sections for a bridge of chains proposed to be thrown over the Frith of Forth at Queensferry " , James Anderson , 1818 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing came later in the century with the spread of the rail network , as several railway companies vied to provide a seamless rail link from London to the north of Scotland . At the same time , developments in engineering and manufacture of steel meant that dreams of a bridge on the scale required to enable trains to cross the Forth and Tay could become a reality . <p> Railway engineer Thomas Bouch proposed bridges for both the Tay and the Forth estuaries . In 1873 , the Forth Bridge Company was established to build a bridge to Bouch 's design . William Arrol , with a number of successful construction projects already to his name , was appointed as main building contractor . Construction on the shores of the Forth was underway when , on a stormy December night in 1879 , Bouch 's recently completed Tay Bridge collapsed with the loss of an estimated 75 lives . <p> Work on the Forth Bridge was halted immediately , and the subsequent public inquiry into the disaster found the Tay Bridge to be " badly designed , badly constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irreparably damaged , and his design for the Forth Bridge was officially abandoned in 1881 . <p> " Fallen girders , Tay Bridge " . The damage to the bridge 's structure is clearly seen in this image , one of the series commissioned after the disaster which show in detail the destroyed piers and girders , wreckage of the train and steam engine and other parts salvaged from the Tay Source . When alternative proposals for a bridge were invited , Benjamin Baker and Sir John Fowler submitted a design to the Forth Bridge Company on the cantilever and central girder principle . Fowler and Baker were well-established engineers whose long list of achievements included a substantial role in constructing the London underground rail network . <p> For many years an exponent of the use of cantilevers as the most effective means of constructing long-span bridges , Baker devised the human cantilever to explain the principle at a lecture to the Royal Institution in London in 1887 . As he explained , " when a load is put on the central girder by a person sitting on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension , and the men 's bodies from the shoulders downwards and the sticks come into compression . " The man seated in the centre was Kaichi Watanabe , a Japanese engineer and student of Fowler and Baker who was in the UK to learn Western engineering techniques . <h> Foundations <p> The first major engineering challenge was the construction of the three main stone piers on which the bridge 's superstructure would sit . Half could be built using a dam , where water was excluded from the working area by means of cement bags and liquid grout poured in by divers . <p> The depth of water and conditions of the river bed at the remaining piers meant that a pneumatic or compressed air method was chosen , using wrought iron caissons to enable men to work below the water level . Once in position on the bed of the Forth , a steel edge at the bottom of each caisson extended seven feet below the concrete filled floor . Water was pumped from the space and replaced by compressed air , creating a small chamber in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of a caisson to illustrate their operation to his lecture audience at the Royal Institution in London . <p> Cross section illustrating a caisson , from " Bridging the Firth of Forth " , Benjamin Baker , 1887 . The sinking of caissons was a potentially hazardous affair . One of the Queensferry caissons tilted accidentally whilst being positioned , and the work required to right the cylinder took three months . During this recovery work the caisson ruptured as water was being pumped out , and two men drowned when the damaged structure flooded . <p> Once the foundations were complete , the masonry piers above the waterline were constructed of Aberdeen granite backed with concrete and rubble , and measured 55 feet in diameter at the bottom and 49 feet at the top , with a height of 36 feet . Each contained 48 steel bolts to hold down the superstructure . <h> Superstructure <p> Work on the superstructure began in 1886 , starting with the main towers .

The robust straddle-legged bridge was designed to withstand the enormous pressure placed on it , not just from the weight of trains that would pass over , but from the wind speeds to which it would be subjected . To strengthen the structure further against the wind , the whole was " laced together by lattice girders " , which help give the bridge its distinctive appearance . <p> " Queensferry cantilever at full height from north end of approach viaduct " .

A result of a rivalry between the Russian Empire and the Empire of Japan over the control of areas in Manchuria and Korea , the war would introduce a number of features that came to define 20th-century politics and warfare . It was on its battlefields that many technological innovations of the Industrial Revolution first became used in warfare on a mass scale including modern armaments , such as rapid firing artillery and machine guns paving the way for the devastation of the WW1 in the following decade . In the end , the Japanese victory took the West by surprise and Russia was forced to forfeit its expansion policy in the Far East , with Japan proving it was a force to be reckoned with . As for Russia , the many defeats suffered by the country led to discontent over the Romanov autocracy , and after World War I contributed to the February Revolution of 1917. 91047 @qwx711047 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French writer Guillaume Apollinaire , noted for its use of " caligrams " in which typeface and arrangement of words on the page Continued <p> Name : <p> E-mail : 91052 @qwx711052

The idea is credited to the artist Norman Wilkinson who was serving in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve when he had the idea in 1917 . After the Allied Navies failed to develop effective means to disguise ships in all weathers , the dazzle technique was employed , not in order to conceal the ship , but rather to make it difficult for the enemy to estimate its type , size , speed and direction of travel . After seeing a canon painted in dazzle camouflage trundling through the streets of Paris , Picasso is reported to have taken credit for the innovation which seemed to him a quintessentially Cubist technique . 91047 @qwx711047 <h> Design &amp; Typography 91050 @qwx711050 91046 @qwx711046 91046 @qwx711046 91053 @qwx711053 91052 @qwx711052

At the age of 30 he dropped out of a promising career teaching law and economics to unroll in art school in Munich . The development of his art had many influences , among them Monets later works , in particular his " Haystacks " series , the music of Wagner and the influence of the theosophical movement , including the illustrations he encountered in Besant and Leadbetters Thought Forms ( 1901 ) . Two of the key works from his early experiments in colour was The Blue Rider of 1903 , and in 1908-1909 The Blue Mountain , both first steps in Kandinskys treating colour independent of form . In his so called " Blue Rider " period , from 1911 to 1914 , he began to develop his truly distinctive style , seeing his works as expressing the interior world rather than the exterior , and often using musical terms to identify his paintings .

Born into a difficult aristocratic family , to parents with whom she never felt close , Sitwell spent much of her young adult years living with her governess Helen Rootham , in London throughout World War I and the 20s and Paris during the 30s . Sitwell published her first poem in 1913 at the age of 26 and between 1916 and 1921 edited Wheels , an annual poetic anthology she created with her brothers . In the 20s , with Fa+ade ( performed behind a curtain with a hole in the mouth of a painted face ) , and later also with Gold Coast Customs , Sitwell began to experiment with putting poetry to the rhythms of music , in particular jazz . This innovative approach to poetry was encouraged in her frequent and infamous literary salons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of the literati included Dylan Thomas and Denton Welch . Almost as much as her radical poetry , it was Sitwells manner of dressing which caused much controversy with critics . A towering figure at six foot tall , she would often appear in public laden with gowns of brocade or velvet with gold turbans and a plethora of rings and other jewellery which can now be seen in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum . As well as numerous collections of poetry Sitwell also published many prose works , including a novel I Live Under a Black Sun , based on the life of Jonathan Swift , and two biographies of Elizabeth 1 , whose angular features she was said to share , as well as a birthday . <p> A Dutch painter whose distinctive grid based creations horizontal and vertical lines upon a white background adorned with red , blue and yellow blocks proved one of the most influential experiments with abstraction of the 20th century .

Eventually gaining permission to return to Germany , Nussbaum escaped en route and reunited with Felka again in Brussels where ether lived in hiding . Without residency papers , Nussbaum had to rely on friends to provide him with shelter and art supplies so he could continue to express in art the darkness and difficulties of the next four years , producing some of his best-known work , including Self Portrait with Jewish Identity Card(1943) , and Triumph of Death ( 1944 ) .

The movement seemed to glorify warfare which it saw as the the worlds only hygiene " militarism , patriotism , the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers , beautiful ideas worth dying for , and scorn for woman " . Of the many manifestos brought out by the group in this early period the most famous was perhaps the " Manifesto Against Past-Loving Venice " in which Marinetti demands " fill(ing) the small , stinking canals with the rubble from the old , collapsing and leprous palaces " to " prepare for the birth of an industrial and militarised Venice , capable of dominating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the numerous manifestos and political writings , Marinetti also produced some ( mostly poorly received ) poetry , as well as a novel Mafarka the Futurist , An African novel published in 1910 ( after being cleared of all charges at an obscenity trial ) . As perhaps to be expected , with such an emphasis on militarisation and " progress " , in addition to the Anarchist elements , the Futurists were also closely aligned with Fascism with Marinetti later becoming an active supporter of Benito Mussolini . Throughout the 20s and 30s Marinetti seemed to contradict many of his anti-establishment ideas by trying to ingratiate himself with Mussolinis party .

@@72829839 @1529839/ <h> Lewis Hines Composite Photographs of Child Labourers ( 1913 ) <p> Between 1908 and 1911 , the photographer and social reformer Lewis Hine travelled the U.S. for the National Child Labor Committee ( NCLC ) documenting child labor " in factories , textile mills , canneries , and coal mines " focusing in particular on the Carolina Piedmont . Amongst the hundreds of photographs he made in this time is this unique set of composite photographs of Southern cotton mill workers featured below . Each image was created by purposively rephotographing several workers upon the same photographic plate . The idea of overlaying portraits in this way was not without precedent . The technique was invented in 1880s by Sir Francis Galton who used multiple exposures to create an " average " portrait from many different faces . For Galton , the primary purpose of the method was so as to advance his views on human ideal types , and it could be argued that Hine used it in a similar way ( albeit divorced from the somewhat suspect context of phrenology ) , to generalise his observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on young bodies . However , the fact that Hine overlays faces of quite different physicality perhaps implies a subtler motive , one perhaps more orientated around the haunting quality of the final image . The composites were never published in Hines lifetime , although the portraits of the same children used in the process do appear in posters for the NCLC alongside such headlines as " Making Human Junk : Shall Industry Be Allowed To Put This Cost On Society ? " . In general , Hines heart-rending images from his time with the NCLC " often the result of putting himself at great personal danger " helped to influence the change in several laws , including the Keating-Owen Child Labor Act of 1916. 91047 @qwx711047 <h> People 91050 @qwx711050 <p> Published on the day it is set , April Fool 's Day 1857 , Herman Melville 's last novel concerns a group of passengers travelling by steamboat along the Mississippi and their various encounters with the enigmatic conman of the title .

The book , which Krafft-Ebing continued to expand throughout twelve editions until his death , is a scientific study of sexual deviation consisting of over 200 case studies . Intended for the use of physicians , psychiatrists and judges ( and written partly in Latin in order to discourage the general public from reading it ) , the book explores fetishism , sadism , masochism and homosexuality , as well as nymphomania , necrophilia , and incest . For Krafft-Ebing , any desire for sex unrelated to procreation was a deviation from the heterosexual norm , making , for example , gay sex a " perversion " of the sexual instinct . <p> The photographs featured here are part of Krafft-Ebing 's personal collection .

Although this book ( known as Egerton 1900 ) was purported to reflect a journey made in 1465 by Gabriel Muffel , third son of the Nuremburg patrician Nicholas Muffel , the travelogue is , however , merely a German translation of an account of a journey made more than a century earlier . This actual journey was undertaken by the Franciscan friar Niccolo da Poggibonsi who visited the Holy Land in 1346-50 , and wrote up his travels in the Italian book Libro d'oltramare . The work remained untranslated until Muffel got hold of it , also supplying it with 147 miniatures , a selection of which are presented below . The confusion does n't  stop there .

As the title implies the gynecological exercises are based on those invented by the Swedish obstetrician and gynecologist , Thure Brandt ( 1819-1895 ) . Brandt began treating women in 1861 , combining massage , stretching , and general exercise as a form of treating gynecological conditions . After his methods were examined in Jena by German gynecologists in 1886 , they became widely used in Europe . The images in this particular text are eye-catching today less for the gynecological technique they depict but more the bizarre similarity between the rakishly thin figures employed in demonstrating the exercises ( no doubt an attempt to de-sexualise the images ) and the figure of the so-called " Grey Alien " thin body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another 65 years . 91047 @qwx711047 91049 @qwx711049 91050 @qwx711050 <p> Is it just me or in fig. 42 the gyneco inserts a finger in the womans anus ? <p> Shamfee <p> No , the vagina , the fingertip touches the cervix while the other hand obviously exerts pressure to reposition ( ? ) the uterus from outside <p> Gina Walker <p> what the ? ive seen some strange stuffsquid , etc. but this totally blows my mind . <p> Name : <p> E-mail : 91052 @qwx711052

Ridley of the British Ministry of Information made a short propaganda film , " Lambeth Walk Nazi Style " , which edited footage of Hitler and German soldiers from Leni Riefenstahls classic Triumph of the Will to make it appear as if they were marching and dancing to the song " The Lambeth Walk " . A member of the Nazi Party achieved attention in 1939 by declaring " The Lambeth Walk " ( which was becoming popular in Berlin ) to be " Jewish mischief and animalistic hopping " as part of a speech on how the " revolution of private life " was one of the next big tasks of National Socialism in Germany . The film so enraged Joseph Goebbels that reportedly he ran out of the screening room kicking chairs and screaming profanities .
