If you also share the story of small space-loads of things to fit inside it then read on . Smart living has increased in popularity due to the fact that , well , there 's a lot of people everywhere basically . Not a lot of space to cope with those numbers and so big city apartment owners ( or renters ) this is definitely somethink to take notes about . <p> A small apartment is often associated with a lack of space . Unsuccessful planning can cause a crowded and cluttered appearance . However , it can easily be fixed . Even the smallest and seemingly uncomfortable apartment can be made functional with a few simple tips &amp; tricks . A great opportunity to experiment and create your own unique interior ! <p> 1 . Color . The right choice of color can visually increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for walls and ceiling in light colors ( white , beige , gray , blue , light green ) . If you 're in love with textures then you can also go for wallpapers with fine ornaments , abandoning large drawings . The flooring should be slightly darker , but not too much , otherwise the room will appear low . Try to adhere to monochrome in the room : various interior items ( furniture upholstery , table and chairs ) , made in one color , visually expand the space . We know sometimes you feel like also adding a rainbow in there but maybe not on this one . Leave that to Skittles . <p> 2 . Curtains . If there are large windows in a small room , the curtains are better to hang around the edges so that the windows will seem bigger . Choose long ( to the floor ) curtains and tulle in the same color scheme as the walls . Give preference to light flowing fabrics , which do not weight the space and do not take up a lot visually . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> 3 . Make the most of space . Every piece of interior , especially in a small room , must have its own purpose . Try to use it to the maximum . For example , a wardrobe is an excellent option for those who live in a one-room apartment . It does not take up much space and at the same time combines several types of furniture : a wardrobe , a bookcase , a chest of drawers , a TV cabinet , a mini-bar , shelves for souvenirs , photographs and other small things . And we know we all have a little collection of souveniers from somewhere special . <p> 4 . Reflective and transparent surfaces . Mirrors and other reflective elements of the interior can also visually enlarge the space and make the room lighter due to reflected light . It is desirable that the mirror is situated in front of the window . A cabinet with large mirrored doors or a wall with a mirror tile visually enlarges the room in half . Transparent interior items made of durable plastic , less often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow you to visually expand the space . Furniture with transparent legs creates the effect of lightness and soaring . <p> 5 . Zoning the room . In order for the room to become more functional , divide it into zones . For example , you need to separate the work area from the sleeping one . Use different combinations of colors , divide space with screens , curtains or bookshelves . Use different light sources to create the illusion of two different rooms . Arrange furniture around the room so that it is accessible , and you can move around easily . <p> 6 . Avoid the mess . This is especially noticeable in a small space . Do not fill the room with unnecessary things . Define your priorities : get rid of what you do not need , hide these things in cabinets and drawers . And definitely say goodbye to living like a rebel teenager with everything tossed somewhere in a corner . <p> 7 . More light . Natural and artificial light have the property of expanding space . Even if the window is large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room is not on the sunny side , you can use the built-in light sources around the perimeter of the room . <p> Guest post by : Melisa Marzett , professional writer .

@@25663053 @5663053/ 55129 @qwx255129 <h> Fancy a little IKEA anybody ? <p> A new trend has come upon the interior design worldone that will save you money and time . As many know , one small change can create a wave of difference . So it should come as no surprise that making simple tweaks in your home can completely alter the look and feel of it throughout the year . The best is that with using stores like IKEA , which sell items with multiple functions , you can repeatedly transform any space over and over with a dash of DIY creativity . <p> No idea where to start ? Here are a few tips &amp; trick to get those creative juices flowing : <p> Fill Vertical Space <p> There are two ways to fill the upper regions of a room : with plants and with shelves . Adding a touch of greenery is easy , especially now that most IKEA locations around the world have a variety of plants . Opt for the ones that will do double dutycleansing the air while growing upward . Cactuses are great if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , IKEA has a full range of baskets , boxes , and side tables to perch your plant on . For example , you can go for either the GLADOM or KRAGSTA models , both of which are highly affordable , spray paint or coat it with contact paper to match your color scheme , and use that as a new corner table or indoor garden . <p> Create Scale <p> One of the things that creates a head-turning difference in a room is playing with sizes . An oversized lamp , gargantuan plush lounge chair , a contemporary piece of artwork or collage , or a gathering of all three could go a long way . <p> Start by working with the existing surroundings . So if you already have a load of overhead space and a blank ceiling , consider one of IKEAs funky lamps , like the STOCKHOLM or FILLSTA pendant lamps to add some pizzazz . <p> Mirrors on a back wall or in a corner will also create the illusion of scale , especially in an open floor plan . Adding a couple of LANGESUND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall then swapping the layout once in a while is an affordable and effective way of keeping the look fresh . <p> Swap in Artwork <p> As the seasons come and go , you can cycle pieces of art out . This continuously keeps the room looking new while adding to or taking away from the overall dTcor . It really works when the artwork is of varying sizes , playing with scale and depth . <p> Pop of Color <p> IKEA has a miraculous inventory of storage space , affordable shelves , and cabinets like the LIXHULT series . The various sizes come in a rainbow of colors that can be stacked up or scattered around the room to become a storage place for things that may have otherwise gone unorganized . Plus , the ability to stack these multi-sized boxes is great for filling those corners of the room that may feel unused or lonely . Depending on the color the room is painted in , opt for a contrasting color to bring attention to the space . Think yellow in a gray office or blue in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the littlest of details that make all the difference . Think about the pop a clawfoot bathtub has as opposed to a regular built-into-the-wall tub . Know what adds the wow factor ? The legs ! While IKEA does have a wide variety of table tops , legs , and trestles to choose from , Prettypegs has a wide assortment in a bunch of colors to truly liven up your furniture . <p> Plus , changing the legs may change the height , which is perfect for creating subtle changes that make quite a difference when rearranging your furniture . This gives a whole new character to the room and all by small means . <p> Create a Vignette <p> Candles , votive holders , and even the eye-catching HARLIGA glass dome can all be used as inspiration for a seasonal vignette . A vignette in decorating , in case you do not know , is a gathering of objects that creates a focal point . These little groups are perfect for mantle spaces , coffee tables , counter space , or dining room table tops . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and colors mixed with a display inside a glass dome are infinite . As long as you have elements to add and take away , vignettes are incredibly easy to do . The HARLIGA glass dome can also be used to house potpourri , succulents , bundles of lights , and more . It becomes a hassle free centerpiece that makes a statement no matter what is put inside . <p> Throw Pillows <p> One of the things that any IKEA lover will go crazy over is the array of textiles available . Of course , if you are good with a sewing machine , you can always upcycle some old clothing and transform it into a decorative pillow case . Throw pillows of different shapes , sizes , and textures are fundamental to livening up a space and make furniture look brand new , even if you have had it for years . <p> All it takes is a little DIY-ing and creativity to make a big impact in the look of your home . Swapping colors and pictures , repainting some end tables , and creating some DIY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , simple changes allow for greater flexibility , because you can continuously edit the space whenever you see fit .

That-s why we got curious to get to know their new homes and what inspires the owners when creating a welcoming home . <p> Our first stop was at one of our most beloved models " Estelle Mint that now lives in a home together with Lotta and her family where bohemian elegance meets classy functionalism . This bright top floor Stockholm apartment , with fishbone parquet and marble windowsills , is characterized by a homely atmosphere that consist of new , inherited and flee market findings . You-re very welcome to sneak a peak into this inspiring home where a bulky pale beige 80ies leather sofa will most likely never enter the doorstep ! ( scroll down for pictures ) <p> The kitchen chairs and the Bengt Olson oil painting . We found the chairs on a flea market near our country house , at that point they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to decide what cloth to redress them with , but finally decided on Svenskt Tenn 's Teheran . <p> What is your dream piece that you still don-t have ? <p> Fritz Hansen PK 22 Lounge Chair in cognac leather <p> What furniture will never enter your doorstep ? <p> Remains to be seen , though a bulky 80 ies leather sofa in some pale beige nude color will most likely never end up in my house . <p> How would you describe your style with a few word ? What kind of feeling/atmosphere are you trying to achieve at home ? <p> There are so many designers with great talent that make beautiful things , that it 's more often the time and the place that determines my favorite designer , rather than the actual products . <p> How did you find out about Prettypegs ? <p> A friend of mine had a set of Siri Pink at home that really caught my attention and made me think about my own sofa-s chunky legs . <p> Why did you choose that particular Prettypegs model / colour ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warmth and mix of material with brass , and the beautiful mint green color that reminds me of verdigris copper . <p> What do you think Prettypegs should offer next ? <p> Table legs ! <p> MORE ABOUT THE KITCHEN <p> The gas stove is a dear piece , we had the exact same stove in our old apartment , and loved it so much that we searched all over for it on second hand sites , and after some time we found one ! <p> Vintage dining chairs clothed in Svenskt Tenn 's Teheran . <p> The kitchen table lamp is from Tom Dixon , the red lamp in the window is from Kartell , the kitchen table is borrowed from a friend , the brass knobs/handles are from Superfront and the floor is made out of concrete with heating coil installed that makes it warm and cosy to step on , especially winter time . <p> MORE ABOUT THE LIVING ROOM <p> The sofa is from NK with Pretty Pegs Estelle legs , the armchairs are IKEA design by Thomas Sandell , the pillows are from Marimekko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rug dealer , the sofa table is sort of homemade - the marble top was made for the kitchen , but somehow the measurements went wrong and the marble company gave the piece to us , so all of a sudden we had 100 kg extra marble at home ... so we decided to make a table of it . The legs were custom ordered from a guy at Blocket . The ceiling lamp is from Tom Dixon , the floor lamp in concrete and copper Carl made himself on a boring day : ) The dining chairs are from DIS , and the dining table is from Tavolo.
