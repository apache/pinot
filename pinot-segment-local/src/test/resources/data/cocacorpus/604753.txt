This phase down will apply to all costs incurred for the provision of telephone services and circuit capacity dedicated to providing voice services , including : local phone service , long distance service , plain old telephone services , radio loop , 800 service , satellite telephone , shared telephone service , Centrex , wireless telephone service such as cellular , and interconnected VoIP . <p> Data plans and air cards for mobile devices will remain eligible for support only if a school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cost-effective options for providing internal broadband access for portable mobile devices at its facility . <p> The application separates voice services from internet which is still funded at up to 90 percent , based on the discount matrix . <h> Eligible Category Two Services : <p> Funding for internal connections is available for routers , switches , wireless access points , internal cabling , racks , wireless controller systems , firewall services , uninterruptable power supply , caching , and the software supporting each of these components used to distribute high-speed broadband throughout schools and libraries . <h> E-rate Category Two Budget <p> The FCC has set a budget of $150 per student that may be used over a five year period for Category two services . There is no budget limit for Category One . <p> The pre-discount budget for a school is calculated by multiplying the total number of students at the school by $150 with a minimum of $9,200 if the school has fewer than 62 students . Caveat : the budget is pre-discount ; applicants receive the discounted level of the total . <p> Example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 60 percent : <p> $200x$150=$30,000 pre-discount . Applying the 60% discount , the E-rate support is $18,000 . The school is responsible for the undiscounted portion of $12,000 . <p> The pre-discount budget calculation is for a five-year period , starting with the first funding year ( FY2015 " FY2019 ) in which applicants receive Category Two support . Applicants can utilize the pre-discount budget in a manner that best meets their needs . Applicants can apply to use all of it in FY2015 , spread it out over 5 years or any other combination up to the total . <p> Documentation : <p> Applicants and service providers will be required to file all documents with USAC electronically . USAC will be required to provide all notifications electronically . USAC will phase in this requirement over the next three funding years . <p> The document retention period will be extended from five to 10 years after the latter of the last day of the applicable funding year , or the service delivery deadline for the funding request . This revised document retention period rule is subject to the Paperwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Register of approval by the Office of Management and Budget . <p> Technology Plans are no longer required for any E-rate services . NCEA will no longer certify technology plans since they will not be needed . <h> E-Rate Application Process <p> The application process has several steps to follow and forms to complete in order to successfully apply for and receive E-rate discounts . These steps include : <p> opening the competitive process : Form 470 <p> seeking discounts on eligible services : Form 471 <p> confirming the receipt of services and compliance with Internet Safety requirements : Form 486 <p> invoicing for services : Form 472 <p> Webinars are available online at the USAC reference area for help with each step of application process . <h> How To Calculate Your E-Rate Discount <p> Each school discount rate is based on two factors : <p> the percentage of students eligible for the National School Lunch Program ( NSLP ) <p> the urban or rural status of the location of the school . <p> The U.S. Department of Agriculture income eligibility tables for the current school year can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Category Two <p> Category One <p> Discount Level Percentages <p> Category Two <p> Discount Level Percentages <p> % Students eligible for Federal School Lunch Program <p> Urban <p> Rural <p> Urban <p> Rural <p> &lt; 1 <p> 20 <p> 25 <p> 20 <p> 25 <p> 1-19 <p> 40 <p> 50 <p> 40 <p> 50 <p> 30-34 <p> 50 <p> 60 <p> 50 <p> 60 <p> 35-49 <p> 60 <p> 70 <p> 60 <p> 70 <p> 50-74 <p> 80 <p> 80 <p> 80 <p> 80 <p> 75-100 <p> 90 <p> 90 <p> 85 <p> 85 <p> Urban/Rural Status : The FCC 's definition of rural is new for Funding Year 2015 . The system will automatically provide the Urban/Rural status of the entity based on the physical address for that entity in USAC 's systems .

The film 's director commissioned or sourced footage from top independent filmmakers from more than 25 countries -- and a wide range of religious traditions -- each team contributing a single scene . The film , sweeping in its global reach , yet intensely intimate , is a tour de force that unifies these scenes into a single work , told without narration , without experts and , for long stretches , without words at all .

The crux of Catholic educational leadership is found in the pastoral work associated with helping teachers , administrators , and staff members to discover and appreciate their personal vocations so that they recognize God 's call and revelation in their lives and work inside of Catholic schools . Building Spiritual Leadership Density in Catholic Schools examines how educators can utilize their God-given gifts , talents , and inclinations to translate that mission of Catholic schooling into transformative experiences of mind and heart that , in turn , will enable themselves , their colleagues , and their students to form a very special educational community or what is called a " formative community of disciples . " In this community , young people develop an appreciation for their personal vocations , envision how they might live out those vocations , and grow in holiness of life by conforming themselves to God 's will in all aspects of their lives . This is the sixth volume in the NCEA Catholic Educational Leadership Monograph Series .
