NFNECP funding enables communities to acquire the resources necessary to develop projects that explore the link between environmental contaminants and human health . The results of NFNECP projects provide communities with valuable tools to initiate or influence remediation action on the foundation of better knowledge . <p> The AFN continues to support the program through its participation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Program Champion " , while continuing to advocate for First Nations interests with respect to environmental health issues .

Natural resources are considered to be both mineral ( inorganic ) or biological ( organic ) , renewable and non-renewable , located on the land , under the land , or in water or air , and are used by First Nations to satisfy human needs and promote economic development . First Nations have not traditionally considered the environment as a resource but have found it necessary to assert their rights to natural resources in response to external forces which have limited their ability to participate in traditional activities that depend on the aspects of the environment that are considered to be resources by government , industry and citizens at large . <p> The main issues facing First Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Treaty Rights by federal and provincial legislation ; ongoing disputes over the scope of First Nations rights to natural resources ; and the negative impact on traditional livelihoods and lifestyles that First Nations experience as a result of widespread exploitation of resources .

It is important that reviews and changes are monitored for their potential impacts to First Nations Aboriginal and Treaty Rights . The ESU is committed to monitoring policy changes at the Federal level and advocating for First Nations interests as necessary . <h> Traditional Foods <p> First Nations peoples have a cultural , traditional and social connection to the land and many communities continue to rely on traditional food for their socio-cultural , economic , and physical well-being .

The FNFNES studies statistically relevant data on levels of contaminants in traditional foods for all regions and ecozones of the country . The study collects baseline data on the presence of pharmaceutical products in surface water , and will determine the body burden of mercury through hair sample analysis . This study will potentially aid future decisions made on the national , provincial and municipal government levels . <p> This study is national in scope and will provide important information about contaminants . <p> Resolution 30/2007 , First Nations Food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly , supports a research study on traditional food safety and First Nations health . <p> This research is a collaborative effort between the AFN , the University of Northern British Columbia and the University of Montreal .

First Nations have countless layers of intricate traditional knowledge , much of which is unique to each group . ATK is passed along from person to person and it is rich in innovation , grounded in First Nation science , and is based on hundreds of years of observation . Current intellectual property laws have created the conditions in which ATK is misused , misappropriated and stolen by outsiders , researchers , companies , and others .

The nature of waste has changed significantly , however , and now presents many challenges in some First Nations communities . Inadequate long-term and short-term funding to operate well-managed landfill sites and transfer stations poses considerable risks in some First Nations communities . <p> There are many considerations and challenges that present themselves to First Nation communities when dealing with waste disposal , these include : water contamination , poor air quality , and insufficient capacity . <p> Awareness building within communities is needed to curb the continued creation of large amounts of waste . Changing the way that we think about waste is a step towards reducing it . <p> Establishing composting and recycling programs can minimize the amount of waste in landfills , resulting in healthier environments for communities . <p> A well managed landfill is critical to protecting the community from exposure to toxic chemicals .

" We want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address the problems exposed in this report so that no child suffers from delays or denial of important services . That 's exactly what Jordans Principle is about ensuring that the care and support of a child who needs services is not held up by bureaucratic red tape .

" <p> Jordans Principle , named in honour of Jordan River Anderson , aims to give First Nations children equal and fair access to services ordinarily available to other children and to shield them from jurisdictional disputes . Jordan River Anderson died tragically after spending two and a half years unnecessarily in hospital because government officials could not decide who should pay for his at-home care because he was First Nations . <p> Have a Heart day is about First Nations and caring Canadians standing together to honour Jordans Principle and to end inequality in other services for kids .

The element of Air stands for the life force that brings all people into existence from their first breath . The ancient ones have long understood that the wind is the intermediary plain which connects the spirit world to our own . Air also symbolizes the mental and spiritual process which brings understanding and inspiration through thought and form . <p> Clean air is important to all forms of life . In the modern age , air pollution has become an increasing concern for society and government . Air pollution is a result of the disturbances to the composition of compounds in the atmosphere through : excess emission of gases ; saturation of chemical compounds and particulates ; and the emergence of new chemical reactions . In addition , air quality is also damaged by excessive noise . Global warming , acid rain , smog , ozone depletion are some effects of air pollution . <p> Air pollution stems from many sources including factories , coal fired plants , automobiles , incinerators and forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ozone , nitrogen oxides , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , and sulphur dioxide have harmful effects on natural ecosystems . They can kill plants and trees by destroying their leaves , and can kill animals , especially fish in highly polluted rivers . <p> Air pollution is responsible for major health effects and can affect many body organs and systems . Different chemicals in the air affect the human body in negative ways . Children , elderly and Indigenous people are highly vulnerable to diseases induced by air pollution . Because people are exposed to so many potentially dangerous pollutants , it is often hard to know exactly which pollutants are responsible for causing sickness . Also , because a mixture of different pollutants can intensify sickness , it is often difficult to isolate those pollutants that are at fault . <p> Our actions today will determine the quality of air for the next seven generations . <p> POLICY AREAS <h> Acid Rain <p> Acid rain is a form of air pollution .

The vapour falls to earth in the form of rain , snow , sleet or hail . <p> The majority of acid rain is generated by the burning of coal in coal fired plants and other industrial sources . Acid rain can have detrimental affects on animals , plant life , and waterways . Acid rain particles , in the form of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide , are a key element of smog and are a significant health hazard . These particles lodge deep within the lungs and can cause inflammation and tissue damages , resulting in long term breathing problems . <h> Air Pollution <p> Air pollution is a common concern for First Nations that live both on reserve as well as those living in urban settings .

Since industrial pollution does not respect geographic boundaries , communities located near to or down-wind from industrial facilities face increased exposure to air pollutants . <h> Climate Change <p> The changing climate is at the very core of First Nations concerns , affecting their ability to access their traditional foods , medicines and territories . First Nations are more directly and immediately affected by environmental change because they live closer to the land .

First Nations have a long history in this country of dealing with laws that threaten our rights so we are always on guard against any legislation that could affect our rights , our citizens and our traditional territories . <p> The key issues at stake in Bill C-51 are the States power to place individuals or groups under surveillance , to monitor their everyday activities , to create criminal offenses that affect our ability to exercise our legally recognized rights , and the overall relationship of State power to fundamental human and Indigenous rights . <p> On these issues , First Nations have expertise and hard experience to offer this Committee , the government and Canadians as a whole . <p> First Nations people are often forced to take a stand against actions or initiatives by governments that refuse to respect or protect our rights . These activities are often deemed " protests " when in fact we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which include the recognition and affirmation of inherent Aboriginal rights and Treaties in Canadas own Constitution . <p> So at the core of this discussion for First Nations is the unfinished business of balancing federal and provincial laws and authorities with the inherent jurisdiction and sovereignty of First Nations . At its core , this discussion is about reconciliation - reconciling Canadas claims to sovereignty with our pre-existing rights , title and jurisdiction , and Canadas Treaty obligations . <p> We need to finish that work . It is the way forward . But until we do , First Nations as individuals and as nations will assert our fundamental civil and political rights . We 've had to do this many times in the past in the face of a history of imposed , oppressive laws - laws that we are always told are good for us and good for Canada . But in fact they were outright attacks on our identity and our rights . <p> We have suffered under laws that banned our cultural and spiritual practices , laws that denied our right to vote , laws that prevented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laws that gave the State the power to steal our children and assault their minds and bodies , to try and kill our languages and traditions . We have been subjects of surveillance and suspicion , and seen as a threat for as long as this country has existed . Why ? Because our cultures , values and laws place a priority on protecting the lands and waters , they place primacy on sharing and sustainability . Canada knows that our existence as peoples and nations qualifies and calls into question its claims to absolute sovereignty . But our people survived and prevailed over all the assaults against us because our ancestors and Elders stood up for our people and our rights . And this generation is not going to forsake our ability to protect our lands and territories and rights that has ensured our survival . <p> We will continue to assert our inherent sovereignty and sacred responsibility to protect the land and the waters .

We believe in the right to safety and security but the federal government 's rush to ram this legislation through is undemocratic and it violates our individual and collective rights . <p> We have many concerns with this legislation . First , the proposed Security of Canada Information Sharing Act sets out an overly broad definition of " activity that undermines the security of Canada " . We see this as a euphemism for an " excuse to spy on " First Nations when they exercise their collective and individual rights . Our people could find themselves under increasing surveillance because of the broad , vague concepts and activities covered by this phrase . It clearly goes way beyond the current Criminal Code definition of " terrorist activity .

The days are gone when absolute parliamentary supremacy trumps human rights and First Nations rights . But we still see this government struggling to accept the Constitution Act of 1982 - both Part 1 , the Charter , and Part II which recognizes and affirms our Treaty and Aboriginal rights . Both sets of rights are at stake in Bill C-51 . <p> First Nations maintain that Bill C-51 will infringe our freedom of speech and assembly , our right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure , our right to liberty , our fundamental rights as peoples under section 35 of the Constitution Act , 1982 , our Treaty rights and our right to self-determination .

This is not an abstract argument for our people . Weve been labelled as terrorists when we stand up for our rights and our lands and our waters .

First Nations know better than anyone how easy it is for government to ignore , erode and eradicate our most basic human rights and freedoms until you barely recognize the land you 're living in . <p> First Nations deserve better , Canadians deserve better .

Working with the Chiefs Committee on Claims ( CCoC ) , the AFN carried out significant advocacy to ensure First Nation perspectives were represented . The review was finalized in 2014 , but former federal Minister Valcourt refused to release it . In 2016 the new federal Liberal government made the review public , and tabled a Ministers report to parliament acknowledging First Nation concerns and committing Canada to work with the AFN to develop recommendations for change . <p> In fall 2016 , following the Ministers report , the Office of the Auditor General ( OAG ) released an audit of the specific claims process . The audit found that Canada had failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Canada accepted the OAG recommendations and again committed to working with First Nations and the AFN to address the specific claims process . <p> These commitments resulted in the development of an AFN-Canada Joint Technical Working Group ( JTWG ) mandated with examining Canadas specific claims process and developing recommendations for change . The JTWG began meeting in November , 2016 , and has had a number of meetings since then . <p> The JTWG is made up of AFN policy staff , First Nation technical experts from across Canada , and INAC officials . The JTWG is looking to develop recommendations for review by First Nation leadership by winter 2017 . <p> As part of this process , and to assist the JTWG , the AFN hosted a dialogue session in March and is hostinga second western dialogue session in Vancouver on June 19-20 in Vancouver . The sessions are focused on identifying issues with the specific claims process and developing solutions .

" <p> The United Nations Human Development Index shows a human rights and development gap where Canada consistently ranks in the top ten but First Nations rank at 63 or lower .

The Court of Appeal also made a number of observations about how the Crown should conduct itself in discussions with First Nations on their preferences for meeting the Crowns long neglected treaty land entitlement obligations . The Court said that Treaty land entitlement agreements must be seen in their proper historical context ; and Canada must show a genuine , bona fide desire , intention and commitment " to engage in a process to rectify Canadas broken promise in Treaty No. 1 .

When the Crown does not meet its Treaty land entitlement promises and its duty to consult , the honour of the Crown is placed in question and sacred Treaty promises remain unfulfilled .

The Crown is also required to engage in meaningful dialogue and explain its proposed course of action in response to First Nations concerns and the reasons for its response . He went on to say " The Federal Court of Appeals decision demonstrates the federal Crown is required to manage its duty to consult obligations fully and honourably as well as acting expeditiously on its treaty land entitlement obligations .

Canada informed the First Nations in this case that the Kapyong Barracks lands were not considered eligible for meeting these obligations ( because of a federal policy decision ) .

These issues are generally key considerations , particularly where large-scale developments are concerned . <p> Need to safeguard FPIC <p> Our organizations are deeply concerned by the continued opposition to FPIC by some states . There appear to be increasing efforts to undermine or roll back this vital human rights standard . <p> At the time of its endorsement of the UN Declaration in December 2010 , the United States indicated that FPIC calls for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily ... agreement ... , before the actions addressed in those consultations are taken . " In May 2011 , at the Commission on Sustainable Developments Working Group on Mining , Canada , Australia , New Zealand and the United States asked for deletion of " free , prior and informed consent " regarding indigenous and local communities . <p> In Canada , where many of our organizations are from , a number of large banks have recently trumpeted their adoption of FPIC , when what they really mean is free , prior and informed consultation . This raises serious concerns that momentum toward implementation of free , prior and informed consent may be lost or diverted by the misleading use of the inadequate standard of free , prior and informed consultation . <p> Replacing the established standard of consent with the lesser standard of consultation would mean that at the conclusion of such a process taking place , governments or corporations would continue to be free to act in their own interests and the interests of other powerful sectors of society while unilaterally and arbitrarily ignoring the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very purpose of FPIC . <p> Positive steps towards FPIC <p> The International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) - part of the World Bank Group has approved a revised version of the Sustainability Framework that it uses to guide investment decisions . These decisions , which often concern large-scale projects , have the potential for profoundly detrimental impacts on the identities , cultures and well-being of Indigenous peoples . <p> In the past , the IFC claimed that it did not need to bring its policies into line with the standard of free , prior and informed consent , because free , prior and informed consultation was " functionally equivalent " to this human rights norm . Such an approach still exists in the latest version , with some changes and is now being called " Informed Consultation and Participation " . <p> On May 12 , 2011 , IFC announced : " For projects with potential significant adverse impacts on indigenous peoples , IFC has adopted the principle of Free , Prior , and Informed Consent informed by the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required , the positive steps taken on FPIC should be acknowledged and built upon . <p> In the development context , FPIC should not apply to a fixed list of " special circumstances " even if such lists may be broadly stated . While such IFC lists may serve to provide useful examples , there could still be substantial impacts on Indigenous peoples in other situations that require their consent . In Haida Nation , Canadas highest court ruled in 2004 that the nature and scope of the Crowns duty to consult would require the " full consent of the aboriginal nation on very serious issues " . To date , the government of Canada has evaded addressing this criterion of " consent " and focused on those potential consequences that are less serious . <p> In March 2011 , the government of Canada issued its " Updated Guidelines for Federal Officials to Fulfill the Duty to Consult " . These Guidelines fail to consider the right of Indigenous peoples to FPIC , except to indicate Canadas concern when such consent is " interpreted as a veto " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore serious situations that require Indigenous consent under Canadas Constitution . The UN General Assembly has repeatedly emphasized the " importance of non-selectivity , impartiality and objectivity " , when addressing human rights . <p> Canadas Guidelines also declare that the UN Declaration " does not alter the legal duty to consult " in Canada . This ignores the rule of law . The Supreme Court of Canada has repeatedly ruled that declarations and other international instruments are " relevant and persuasive sources for interpretation " of human rights in the domestic context . <p> In the Nagoya Protocol on access and benefit sharing of genetic resources , only " established " rights and not other rights based on customary use appear to receive some protection . As CERD has concluded , such kinds of distinctions are discriminatory . They serve to dispossess Indigenous peoples of their rights relating to genetic resources , including FPIC . <p> We recommend the following measures to the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues ( PFII ) , in relation to " free , prior and informed consent " of Indigenous peoples . These recommendations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies to adopt a standardized interpretation of FPIC , consistent with international human rights standards . <p> Highlight the need to address the unequal bargaining power generally existing between state/third party developers and Indigenous peoples , by ensuring that the peoples concerned have the necessary financial , technical and other assistance to fully and effectively participate at all stages .

In this context , the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is inseparable from states obligations under diverse treaties . <p> Urge states to fully respect FPIC , in regard to all customary rights of Indigenous peoples to genetic resources without discrimination .

Common principles have arisen about working toward government-to-government arrangements that fully meet the financial needs for First Nations programs and services while providing primary accountability to First Nations citizens and improving outcomes for them . First Nations continued to press for a new fiscal relationship and are doing the hard work of examining the many issues involved , while waiting for a willing partner in the Government of Canada to move forward with the fundamental changes required . <p> In December 2015 , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated : " Its time for a new fiscal relationship with First Nations that gives your communities sufficient , predictable and sustained funding .

@@110656207 @6056207/ <h> Confederacy of Nations <p> INTRODUCTION <p> The Confederacy of Nations is one of seven principle organs of the Assembly of First Nations ( AFN ) established in the AFN Charter in 1985 . There have been numerous attempts and efforts to address concerns , to update and to ensure the organization , mandate and structure evolves and adapts according to the direction of First Nations including major efforts reflecting on Nation-building and the need for protocols in 1996/97 and then a larger formal effort undertaken by the AFN Renewal Commission in 2004/05 . <p> Throughout all of these efforts , beginning with the formation of the League of Indian Nations , the National Indian Brotherhood and the Declaration adopted in 1980 , there is a common guiding philosophy that establishes the foundation for todays Assembly of First Nations as a forum for coordination , advocacy and support for First Nations as they rebuild their Nations and strive to achieve self-reliance and self-determination as Nations . <p> With regard to recent developments , the following note provides a record of organizational matters pertaining to the Confederacy of Nations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Early Ideas <p> A review of records has identified a number of challenges with practical implementation of the Confederacy since its very inception . The Confederacy of Nations was established as an organ of the AFN as part of its transition from the National Indian Brotherhood in 1983 . Before its first meeting a report from Rarihokwats to National Chief Ahenakew identified a number of issues with the newly created structure : <p> " The National Chief has been put probably unintentionally in an impossible position . He is elected by the chiefs , and presumably responsible to them . However , a resolution of the Assembly instructs him to report to and take direction from the Confederacy , which in turn is to report to and take direction from the Assembly how can the Confederacy take direction from the Assembly , when each member is entitled to represent the wishes of his First Nation , tribe or treaty area ? Are Confederacy members responsible to their nation , or to the Assembly as a whole ? " <p> Chiefs convened a Chiefs Committee on Structure in 1983 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or recognized within a Charter . The CCS identified challenges with the Confederacy of Nations and made specific recommendations with regard to its accountability : <p> " Clearly , even if both provincial and nation boundaries were equally appropriate , when an intermediate body is based upon one constituency while the larger body is based upon another constituency , the intermediate body can not be said to be accountable to the same larger body or to its own constituents.This appears to be the current situation with respect to the Confederacy of First Nations . While they attempt to hold the National Chief accountable between Assemblies , they can not , for their members find their primary constituency through other associations or through very different electoral processes . They are not elected nor accountable to the Assembly as a whole . How can they be accountable to a body that does not elect them ? <p> <p> Should it be decided by First Nation Chiefs to continue with an intermediary body within the structure of the Assembly , its members must be selected and accountable to the Assembly as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it should not be permitted to interfere with the decision-making authority granted the Office of the National Chief . This body would be unable to hold the National Chief accountable between assemblies , nor should they be allowed to do so . The National Chief is elected by the Assembly as a whole and can only be accountable to that body . This situation would be different if the intermediary body was to elect the National Chief , who would then become accountable to the intermediary body . " <p> ( p. 23 - 24 ) <h> Adoption of the AFN Charter <p> Despite the discussions and various regional positions leading up to the adoption of the AFN Charter , the Charter itself represents the final agreed to structure of the Confederacy of Nations . The scope of the Confederacy and its accountability to Chiefs-in-Assembly was written in the Charter adopted in 1985 as follows . <p> THE CONFEDERACY OF NATIONS <p> COMPOSITIONARTICLE 11 <p> The Confederacy of Nations shall be composed of First Nations representatives of each region on the basis of one representative for each region plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region . <p> For the purposes of representatives and quorum , the Executive Committee shall maintain a record of the First Nations populations of each region which shall be British Columbia , Alberta , Saskatchewan , Manitoba , Ontario , Quebec and Labrador , Nova Scotia and Newfoundland , New Brunswick , and Prince Edward Island , Northwest Territories , Yukon Territory . <p> FUNCTIONS AND POWERSARTICLE 12 <p> The Confederacy of Nations exists and functions as the governing body between assemblies of the First Nations-in-Assembly , with authority : <p> a ) To review and enforce decisions and directions of the First Nations-in-Assembly . <p> b ) To interpret resolutions , decisions and directions of the First Nations-in-Assembly in cases where ambiguity or conflict arises in the interpretation of resolutions , decisions . <p> c ) To ensure that the Secretariat and Executive Committee ( including the National Chief ) conform to , and implement , the decisions and directions of the First Nations-in-Assembly . <p> d ) To take corrective and remedial disciplinary measures in respect of any member of the Secretariat or Executive Committee ( including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national mandate . <p> e ) To receive , consider , make decisions and take appropriate action on any matter raised by an individual First Nation or collectively of First Nations between meetings of the First Nations-in-Assembly provided that the response and action undertaken is within the scope of existing delegated mandates of the First Nations-in-Assembly , and provided resources that may be required are available and within the budget of the organization , and further provided that the matter dealt with does not have a detrimental effect on the rights and interests of all First Nations . <p> f ) To address any emergency in matters of a fundamental nature affecting one or more First Nations . The Confederacy of Nations shall consider , first , whether that matter is of a fundamental , second , whether an emergency exists before any decision or action is taken on that matter . Any decision made shall be referred to the First Nations-in-Assembly at the earliest opportunity for ratification . <p> g ) To approve , allocate , monitor and control the fiscal resources of the Assembly of First Nations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish priorities consistent with the directions and decisions of the First Nations-in-Assembly . <p> i ) To ensure that quarterly written reports are submitted directly to the Chiefs of the First Nations . <p> ACCOUNTABILITYARTICLE 13 <p> The Confederacy of Nations shall be accountable to , shall report to and take direction from the First Nations-in-Assembly . <h> Implementation Challenges <p> Even following adoption of the Charter , implementation and legitimacy challenges continued with regards to the Confederacy of Nations . <p> In 2002 , the National Chief requested a discussion paper : Leading to an Appropriate Structure for the Assembly of First Nations ( also written by Rarihokwats ) . <p> The paper notes " The transition from one organization to the other was never completed . The political needs of the times could n't wait while organizational details were worked out . Political activism came first , organizational niceties could wait . <p> the still-to-be-finished structure , with two competing governing systems is causing the Assembly of First Nations to consume a high proportion of its energies in maintaining its own governance with little energy and resources left over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( p.2 ) <p> The paper outlines how the organization was formed without a view to structure , and those who created it had different understandings of what the organization would look like . <p> " The result is that the Assembly of First Nations today is a structure with inherent conflicts and cross-purposes . It is governable by the goodwill of all concerned , but if goodwill is lacking , the conflicts will prevail and render the Assembly inoperative , dysfunctional and unable to fulfill the high purpose for which it was created " ( p. 21 ) <p> " It was in the AFNs second year , 1983 , that there was concern for worry . The Confederacy and the Assembly of Chiefs were taking different sides on the same question . The Assembly would close one day , the Confederacy would meet the next , and the National Chief was faced with two resolutions to follow , each headed in opposite directions from the other . " ( p. 22 ) <p> Numerous times , Chiefs have given direction to seriously consider options for restructuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nations . Generally , these have been eclipsed by substantive policy matters that Chiefs have come together to address , and restructuring and clarification have been put aside . <p> The Confederacy of Nations was last active in 2003 2004 . At that time there was great concern regarding selection of delegates and opportunity for all Chiefs to exercise their voice and vote in the Assembly of First Nations . <p> In an internal memo to the AFN Executive in May 2003 , it was identified that " by practice and convention Confederacies are taking on the role of an Assembly . The confederacy of Nations does not meet four times a year as laid out in the charter but twice a year . Confederacy decisions are not being reviewed or ratified by First Nations-in-Assembly . Confederacy meetings are using the same rules as a General Assembly or Special Assembly " <p> The December 2003 Confederacy of Nationssaw a deliberate decision among Chiefs upon adoption of the rules to function upon a " one First Nation-one vote " model as opposed to the delegation as outlined in the Charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convened a Spring Confederacy Meeting to take place in May 2004 , including the following commentary in the notice : <p> " At the commencement of the December 2003 Confederacy meeting , the Chair read the usual Rules of Procedure for AFN Assemblies with the exception that the Confederacy would follow Article 11 of the Charter concerning representatives . He then called a vote , and the Rules were accepted . However , once the Chair asked for the regions to identify their official representatives , some Chiefs raised concerns about inadequate Notice . They pointed out that all of the Chiefs or proxies in attendance had travelled to Ottawa with the belief that they would have full representative status . <p> After debating the issue , the delegates voted to follow the usual Rules of Procedure for AFN Assemblies of allowing all Chiefs or their proxies to participate fully in the Confederacy meeting . However the Chair gave verbal notice to these Chiefs and proxies in attendance that the next Confederacy Meeting would be held pursuant to Article 11 of the AFN Charter . " <p> Direct correspondence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs , Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak and AFN Quebec and Labrador , along with individual First Nations , objecting to restricting delegations of the Confederacy to the process prescribed in Article 11 of the AFN Charter . <p> At the 2003 Spring Confederacy of Nations meeting , a number of structural changes were discussed and advanced , with consensus reached that a broad dialogue was needed among First Nations on the structure and function of the AFN . In response , the AFN Renewal Commission began its work in January 2004 as an independent commission operating at arms-length from the AFN . <h> THE AFN RENEWAL COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS <p> The Renewal Commission noted in its introduction , " Since the Assembly of First Nations was established in the early 1980s , many options for change to its organization and procedures have been advanced . Despite this , a substantial and deep reform of the AFN has never been accomplished . Twenty years after its ratification at the 1985 Annual General Assembly in Vancouver , the AFN Charter remains largely unchanged , as do its rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brotherhood . " <p> As part of its review , the AFN Renewal Commission made the following observations and recommendations : <p> The Confederacy of Nations <p> At the AFNs formation , it was intended that the Confederacy of Nations and the First Nations-in-Assembly would be distinct entities , with distinct memberships , purposes and decision-making functions . The Confederacy of Nations , a smaller body than the First Nations-in-Assembly , comprises the National Chief , AFN Regional Chiefs and one representative for every 10,000 First Nation citizens in each region . In practice , the Confederacy has approximately 74 participants and meets on a quarterly basis . The Confederacy was created to review , interpret and enforce decisions and directions of the First Nations-in-Assembly and provide ongoing direction to the AFN and the Executive Committee between Assemblies . <p> Today , there appears to be little separation between the Confederacy and the First Nationsin-Assembly . Over time , an AFN custom has emerged where any Chief may exercise delegate privileges , including voting rights , at a Confederacy meeting . The two structures share the same type of authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The apparent duplication of function and activity , sometimes working at cross-purposes , has led the AFN membership to conclude that the Confederacy and its meetings are unnecessary . <p> The volume of commentary and testimony received by the Commission concerning the Confederacy rivaled that received on the subject of the overall representativeness of the AFN . Participants in the Renewal Commissions public hearing process expressed concerns regarding representation within the Confederacys structure , its processes and accountability . Many expressed their view that the Confederacy is irrelevant and should be eliminated . <p> <p> Decisions taken by the First Nations-in-Assembly are often subject to reversal by the Confederacy of Nations . As a result , the Confederacy is sometimes viewed as an inefficient , even counterproductive force in the pursuit of a coherent , consistent , integrated national First Nation agenda . <p> One of the reasons for this situation , in which there is conflict , duplication and overlap in the activities of the two assembly structures , is that the Confederacy often does not rigorously adhere to the mandate it has been given in the AFN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion leaders and officials express concerning the role of the Confederacy and their participation in Confederacy meetings . <p> The Commission concludes a renewed AFN can and will function effectively and efficiently without the Confederacy of Nations . " <p> It is important to note that while the Renewal Commission recommended that the Confederacy be dissolved , this was in the context of other fundamental organizational and accountability changes being implemented including Citizens Forums , National Policy Forums and changes to Assemblies , voting for National Chief and roles of Regional Chiefs . <p> Chiefs-in-Assembly endorsed the Renewal Report Recommendations and instructed a Taskforce to move forward on AFN Renewal in Resolution 21-2007 . A review of progress in 2008 shows that the majority of recommendations were implemented throughout the organization . At that time there was recommendation for a Special Assembly to be called to amend the AFN Charter and address actions regarding fundamental structural change , including dissolving of the Confederacy ( summary 08-04-17 attached ) . This Assembly did not take place again due to overriding policy issues as opposed to organizational matters requiring attention . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Resolution 20-2013 directs reconsideration of AFN decision-making to reflect and respond to Nation building efforts . <h> CONSIDERATIONS <p> From the very inception of the AFN there have been challenges in terms of adequate understanding of the role and function of the Confederacy of Nations and its implementation , keeping with the overall vision of the Assembly of First Nations functioning akin to a United Nations model , as the Nations re-build and achieve self-reliance and self-determination . While there have been numerous proposals for structural change , these have not been formally incorporated into the structure of the AFN . <p> It is important to note that even while the Confederacy met on an active basis , it did not retain its own authority between meetings , and was fully supported through the AFN Secretariat . The Secretariat is defined in the AFN Charter as a distinct organ to provide administrative , technical and support services to the Assembly of First Nations . It is also an incorporated body and therefore is required to operate pursuant to the Corporations Act . <p> The political and social environment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a responsive and reflective body to the direction of First Nations in a manner consistent with their political evolution and the broader context . It remains that such fundamental change needs to be made by First Nations rebuilding and functioning as Nations through extensive engagement and dialogue and should not be driven solely by regional interests . <p> This is an opportune time to fully examine the role and function of AFNs organizational structures , and move forward on changes to strengthen inclusive and responsive decision-making and support for all Nations . The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples 1996 identified nation re-building and affirmation as critical elements of progress in Crown-First Nation relationships . Many diverse efforts among Nations and Treaty groups are underway across the country . <p> AFN Renewal called on AFN to be respected by all levels of Government , rooted in our languages and cultures , representative of the diverse Nations , responsive to emerging needs and interests of all First Nations as they assert their rights and jurisdiction <p> Building on initial an exchange at the December 2013 SCA in furtherance of resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Chiefs , it may be important to now advance this conversation on restructuring at the 2014 Annual General Assembly with options generated for deliberation and direction at the December Special Chiefs Assembly .

@@110656211 @6056211/ <h> Resource Development and Indigenous Peoples : Finding the path to co-operation <p> Acknowledge Elder Jacqui LaValley , Regional Chief Angus Toulouse as well as the many prominent leaders from our community within the legal field , Justice Harry Laforme and Justice Todd Ducharme and my many friends and colleagues <p> First of all , I want to thank the Law Society of Upper Canada and the Indigenous Bar Association - President Margaret Froh for the kind invitation to speak to you today . <p> Today , I want to challenge all of us to set aside some misconceptions and false choices . <p> I 'd like to set out for you a path of cooperation as opposed to conflict , and to envision a future of mutually supportive commitments to economic development and governance . <p> Some of you might already be saying to yourself , " Well , heard that before ! " <p> But I am speaking about a major shift , a massive transformation one that I believe is possible , even essential , and it does not require new ideas . <p> After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treaty and other alliances - trade , economic and military alliances . Their vision is still instructive . <p> First , they understood , there was no difference between a rights agenda and an economic agenda . They would have rejected that false choice . They are the same agenda obviously . <p> Second , they would have rejected the false choice between the environment versus economic development . <p> Our ancestors were committed to sustainable development practices that respect our traditions and our world view that includes all things living and non-living long before that concept was articulated by non-aboriginal scientists . <p> Our agenda is , and always has been , unique . <p> It respects each Nations right to advance development agendas that accord with the communitys views and values . Environmental groups and industry have far too often rushed to impose their values and their views on our interests . <p> They too often show too little respect for our interests , which include fostering positive relations with our neighbours , feeding our families and offering hope and opportunity to our young people . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice on us <p> Permit me to lay out a new path for you : a path that guards Indigenous economic interests , our rights , and our sacred commitment to the health of the planet . A plan that is confident in our ability to be major players , and one that is optimistic about creating hope and opportunity for our children and their children . <p> The Assembly of First Nations is committed to supporting our families and communities and new approaches to education and health . We help build capable governments and institutions . And we work hard to advance economic and environmental partnerships to address our communities needs , including our right to safety and wellness . <p> We believe it is the moral imperative of our leadership to fight for better education and to foster a better quality of life for our people who are too often the poorest of the poor in a rich country built on our traditional homelands . <p> There is a compelling economic and political argument for action . If we can close the gaps in employment and education we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another $115 Billion in public expenditures that result from First Nation poverty . <p> And now , more and more , we are seeing strong legal reasons to bring First Nations fully into the economic livelihood of this country . Whether it is logging in Grassy Narrows territory in northwestern Ontario , Nuu-chah-nulth fisheries in my home community at Ahousaht , or the recent decisions in Bastien and Dube that speak to our right to participate in the commercial mainstream - more and more we are seeing our rights upheld and affirmed , accompanied by a clear directive for industry and government to work with us . <p> The government estimates that there will be $400 Billion of resource-based economic activity in Canada in the coming years . Much of this will take place on or involve the traditional territories of First Nations . This along with our young and growing population , Canadas future workforce - make us major players in the economy now and in the future . We have much to gain by working together and a lot to lose if we do n't  - because those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement , without our involvement and without our active engagement from start to finish . <p> Let me cite two examples of how not to do it , how the old way inevitably leads to misunderstanding and confrontation , wasted time and wasted money on all sides , and , ultimately , the death of sensible economic development partnerships that could have brought benefit to all . <p> The first is the KeystoneXL pipeline . Confrontation was created through inadequate consultation , failure to listen , and insensitivity to our rights and culture . The problem with this project and many others is that to this point the effort required to address concerns simply has n't  been there . Massive development projects like this one typically have a planning process that spans decades . Despite this , too often First Nations are never considered in the planning . There seems to be a sense that at the late , last stages our consent can be sought or bought . This does not work . We are forced to react and to fight to protect our interests . <p> Then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territories in my home province . Incredibly , an enormous mining project was prepared with no interaction with the First Nations communities on whose land it was going to be built , a territory that had deep spiritual meaning to the people and also provided them with food and a way of life . The mine would have poisoned a pristine environment that supported these communities for centuries . <p> Years of planning by government and the private sector ignored these peoples , peoples with an intimate knowledge of every aspect of the territory , peoples who had fought the Tsilhqotin wars over a century ago defending their way of life and their lands . Quite incredible to imagine that this is still happening in the twenty-first century in Canada <p> The Tsilhqotin did participate later in the environmental assessment process and everyone from the very , very elderly to small pre-school children spoke about their sacred lake and their concerns . <p> This led to a scathing environmental assessment the Environment Minister at the time , Jim Prentice , called it one of the most severely critical he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Government of Canada stop the project . And they did . It was a difficult decision for the Government in these challenging economic times and in the face of immense pressure from industry and the provincial and municipal governments . <p> Now , only a few months later , a " revised " proposal has again come forward seeking government approval . Again , there has been no direct engagement , no discussion or negotiation with the Tsilhqotin so of course again there is immediate resistance and an apparent path of conflict ahead . This pattern is absolutely absurb and will never produce mutual benefit . <p> There is another path . The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples compels both states and Indigenous peoples to work together in mutual partnership and respect . It also sets out the standard of free , prior and informed consent . <p> Canada and other states have said they want to constrict this standard saying that it is an impossible threshold , too close to a veto and therefore unacceptable . Again , I ask you to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed consent " can work . It is clearly established in international human rights standards . The right of Indigenous peoples to approve or reject activities that affect their rights is a fundamental element of self-determination . It is also an important safeguard for other Indigenous rights by ensuring we are included in the development and decision-making process . <p> It is clear , we have work to do in creating understanding of this standard . At the Commission on Sustainable Developments Working Group on Mining , the delegations from Canada , Australia , New Zealand and the US asked for the removal of " free , prior and informed consent " regarding Indigenous and local communities . <p> Yet as you know , the 2004 Haida Nation decision , the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the nature and scope of the Crowns Duty to consult would require " the full consent of the aboriginal nation on very serious issues " . The Government of Canada has not addressed this criterion of " consent " and instead has worked to narrow the definition of " very serious issues " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fulfill the Duty to Consult " , released last March , does not address the right of Indigenous peoples to free , prior and informed consent , except to note Canadas concern about such consent being " interpreted as a veto " . <p> Canadas Guidelines also state that the UN Declaration " does not alter the legal duty to consult " in Canada , yet the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled repeatedly that declarations and other international instruments are " relevant and persuasive sources for interpretation " of human rights in the domestic context . <p> This approach of denying or minimizing our rights is both misinformed and , frankly , dangerous . All governments have a clear role to play in ensuring sustainable resource development including respect for fundamental human rights which include international indigenous human rights standards . We have a clear right to determine the course and shape of development in our territories and to benefit from development activities in our lands . <p> The Courts have been clear , the precedents in Human Rights law are clear , the common sense test of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to move down the path that these tests dictate . IT is time to bring Canadian law in line with the international instruments and case law recognizing indigenous land rights and jurisdiction . We must not slide down the old slippery slope towards new conflicts . We must march forward on a new path . <p> This new path provides an avenue for developing mutual understanding . It requires us to work with federal and provincial governments to review and revamp regulatory systems . It is a useful and appropriate tool for defining and regulating contractual relationships . It can guide resource development projects to ensure an open , ongoing and equitable relationship between business , First Nations and government parties . The right to consent , and the freedom to withhold it , can represent the start of discussions and a powerful means to build the confidence of First Nations and to create successful , mutually beneficial projects . <p> Put simply it is about building relationships ; it is about respect it requires discussion early and discussion often . And clearly - it just makes sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Nations are participating in , and even leading the development of new opportunities for our peoples , but only when government and industry work with us . <p> That path of consultation and co-operation is driving dozens of projects in mining and forestry , from northern BC -- to the Ring of Fire here in Ontario to northern Quebec . <p> But let me clear , and say again : They will proceed only with the full participation of First Nations . <p> We can move from poverty to prosperity in ways that are responsible , sustainable , respectful of our rights and mutually beneficial to all parties . <p> We appreciate that the private sector seeks certainty and guidance in understanding the practical requirements of indigenous rights . Much is available in the growing body of international norms and jurisprudence and were working hard to make this fully accessible and straight-forward . <p> This is one of the main reasons why the AFN held the highly successful International Indigenous Summit on Energy and Mining in June in Niagara Falls . We co-hosted the Summit with the National Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were co-chairs . <p> President Keel emphasized that it is our sovereign duty as the First Nations of this land to be responsible for the management of our energy and natural resources . First Nations and American Indians must do so together , across North America , across borders not of our making . The Obama administration sent several key officials to our Summit because the United States is fully aware that both First Nations and American Indians have become key partners in providing future energy security for North America . <p> As a result of the collaboration between the AFN and the NCAI , our organizations agreed to chart a path for tribally-driven development of Indigenous resources on Indigenous territory in North America where the Indigenous nations are ready , willing and have a central role . <p> The Caucus of Indigenous Leaders of First Nations and Tribal Nations in North America unanimously stated the desire and commitment to build indigenous capacity to negotiate the terms of energy development . <p> Based on the dialogue at this event , the AFN and the NCAI are working to foster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Indigenous lands in a way that works for us , our nations , the environment and our economies . <p> The AFN and the NCAI are now collaborating to : <p> examine the possibility of a North American Indigenous Task Force on Energy , comprised of representative organizations ; <p> participate in global leadership forums to help promote awareness of strategies that include Indigenous peoples ; <p> And to build specific capacity through the creation of an Indigenous Virtual Institute on Energy and Mining . This Virtual Institute will work to : <p> Assist Indigenous nations in building and strengthening business acumen <p> Engage private industry and federal agencies to help enhance the capacity of nations ; and <p> and Enable tribes and Indigenous nations to track and take advantage of existing market trends and opportunities such as debt financing , power export , and carbon markets . <p> This Institute and all of our follow-up efforts from the Summit will strengthen the capacity that is needed for First Nations to come to the table with equal bargaining power as government and industry to ensure that consent is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Nations to engage at the earliest point of consideration and exploration right through to de-commissioning . First Nations can become the drivers of initiatives , identifying both the trouble spots and the opportunity before projects designs are finalized . <p> These are the first important steps in the transformation that I see as essential . <p> Essential for indigenous rights and survival ; <p> Essential to create a path of mutual respect and cooperation , as opposed to perpetual conflict ; <p> And essential to generate mutually beneficial outcomes building indigenous economies and playing an increasingly important role in the broader Canadian and North America economies . <p> In the two months since our Summit in Niagara Falls , I am pleased to report that those efforts are ongoing and we are gaining support on an almost daily basis . We have rapidly increased our work with international interests across North America and far beyond . Through strategic engagement with China and the China Investment Corporation an Indigenous trade and cultural mission is confirmed for this October . Two years ago China invested 1.7 Billion in a single mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to directly engage , and that is exactly what we are doing to advance and protect our interests . <p> Canada has recently strengthened trade relations with a number of South American interests . We have increasingly close relations with Indigenous peoples across South America as well as states including Brazil and others that offer a potential for billions in two-way trade with Canada . <p> A delegation of Amazonas from Brazil attended our Summit in June . They are very interested in cooperating with First Nations to develop green energy projects . <p> Brazilian companies already active in Canada , such as Vale . Vale is one of the largest mining companies in the world , and its recognizing the important role of Indigenous peoples . They participated in our Summit and are now a major sponsor of the " One Laptop Per Child " program operated by the Belinda Stronach Foundation ( providing laptops to Indigenous schools ) . <p> The new path I am describing begins always with First Nations at the table and the parties reaching their destination by finding First Nations consent and a mutually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in our Energy and Mining Summit at the Council of the Federation meeting held a couple months ago in Vancouver .

We have carefully constructed our work to build on key elements of transformation the apology to survivors of residential school - including the commitment to reconciliation - and Canadas endorsement of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . These realities , along with the evolution in affirmation of our rights in section 35 and subsequent Supreme Court decisions , create the framework and the confidence to achieve real change . <p> On this basis we have set out a practical and balanced agenda through a Joint Action Plan with Canada . The Plan commits to addressing key interests including education and community safety right upfront as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transforming policies to unlock First Nation economic potential . <p> Let me say a few words on a subject that is close to my heart , at the top of my agenda . First Nations leaders clearly instructed the AFN almost 2 years ago to make education our top priority we know the status quo is utterly unacceptable . This comes decades after the movement known as Indian control of Indian education - these same objectives apply today but today we have to push farther . The past decades have seen improvement due to our own educators and leaders taking charge and nurturing our kids we 've seen post secondary graduation rates grow from a handful to tens of thousands a remarkable achievement . <p> But too many of our children today are still facing a future without decent schools , and we owe them the same opportunity as every other child in this country . <p> As the Auditor-General pointed out repeatedly the system is fundamentally flawed . There is no stability , no fairness and no accountability to our children and our communities for the way education is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tertiary education , as enjoyed by every other families children across the country . Our schools are funded through annual contribution agreements that do not cover many essential elements such as libraries , science equipment , computers . <p> Capital funding of our schools has failed to keep pace with basic needs of repairs , maintenance and , of course , population growth . The end result is simply unacceptable . Again , this is why I see the need for massive transformation grounded in our rights and responsibilities and focused on delivering opportunity and nurturing the success of our kids . <p> With education and training , our young people can fill the growing labour force gap in Canada especially in the west and the north . The mining industry alone will need 100,000 workers by 2020 . Many First Nations communities are located near resource and green energy development . With the proper approach and investment , we can be partners in the next natural resource boom and the creation of clean , green energy for generations . <p> The Joint Action Plan also commits to transforming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government of Canada in the creation of the Specific Claims Tribunal . We see the same potential of improving the comprehensive claims policy . Our objectives are clear we must create the conditions for fair , expeditious settlement . <p> No one has an interest in endless negotiation we must establish good faith processes with a clear mandate to reach just conclusions . This is the way forward . <p> We have also worked very hard to build a national treaty strategy . Treaties are and will always be the basis of the Crown-First Nation relationship for many parts of Canada . We are all Treaty people . Weve pulled together Indigenous Treaty leaders and are working with them to advance the concept of a Treaty Tribunal . Again a mechanism that will give effect to rights , to achieve change and to move beyond perpetual negotiation , stalling and lack of recognition . <p> First Nations from coast-to-coast-to coast are pursuing self-determination . This pushes us far beyond the constraints of the Indian Act and towards the affirmation and realization of our rights , our governments , our economies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on our rights that build capacity , dispute resolution and affirm direct engagement , as we are doing by taking forward our challenge on child welfare to the Canadian Human Rights Commission . <p> Through the dedicated efforts of professionals such as those of you here today , through the determination of our youthful leadership and by being grounded in our rights and our traditions we will succeed . We will unlock economic potential and we will again realize our place as Indigenous Nations within Canada and North America . <p> Experience has shown that getting past conflict requires bridge building , mutual respect and , often , putting deposits in a joint trust account to build opportunity and success . We must commit to the effort required to turn around the situation for the Tsilhqotin and others <p> We must not stoke the fires of conflict and division but light the fires of peace and friendship . We need to engage in dialogue about economic potential in our territories and the potential to yield benefit for all of the surrounding communities . <p> Following this new path will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow us to build a stronger , more prosperous , fair and just country for all the citizens of this land . The year ahead could be a milestone in the rebirth and resurgence of our economies . We can and we will become the new drivers of Canadas economy , one built on the foundation of our rights , title and jurisdiction . And we invite those who embrace the values of foresight and fairness to travel with us . <p> Kleco kleco ! <p> There are many examples across the country of positive , partnership arrangements . <p> In Nova Scotia , Membertou First Nation entered into a joint-venture business partnership in July 2010 with GrupoGuascor , a Spanish renewable energy company with projects around the world . Membertou and GrupoGuascor will develop wind , solar , and bio-energy projects including equipment designed specifically for rural and remote communities in the United States and Canada . <p> Henvey Inlet First Nation in Ontario has signed the largest Indigenous Feed-In-Tariff contract with the Province of Ontario . Once completed , their $1 billion 300 megawatt wind farm will supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eeyou Power is a 100% Cree Limited Partnership that includes six of the nine Cree communities in Eeuyou Istchee ( Cree Territory ) . <p> The Haida Nation , the Lax Kw'alaams First Nation and the Metlakatla First Nation are partners in NaiKun Wind Development , Canada 's largest offshore wind energy project . <p> There are many more examples but these simply indicate the range and scope of potential projects for First Nations , with one another and with industry and government .

For the reasons outlined below , the Assembly of First Nations strongly recommends approval of Bill C-641 the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act . We urge all Members of Parliament to vote unequivocally in favour of the adoption of this Bill . <p> 1 . Prior Canada-Indigenous collaboration . For over 30 years , Indigenous peoples in Canada and worldwide have been involved in the formulation , adoption and implementation of the UN Declaration . In the final years of negotiations , the Canadian government played a key role together with Indigenous peoples in crafting texts on the right of self-determination ; Treaties ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 2 . Consensus human rights instrument . The Declarationis currently a consensus international human rights instrument . No country in the world formally objects to it . The UN Declaration is included in the list of " Universal Human Rights Instruments " on the web site of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights ( OHCHR ) . The Rule of Law Unit of the UN Secretary-General includes the Declaration as a key instrument . <p> 3 . Comprehensive balancing provisions . The Declaration includes one of the most comprehensive balancing provisions in any international human rights instrument . Every provision in the Declaration must be interpreted in accordance with the " principles of justice , democracy , respect for human rights , equality , non-discrimination , good governance and good faith " . These are the same core principles as in the Canadian and international legal systems . These are also the same principles that have been denied Indigenous peoples throughout history . <p> 4 . Canada 's obligations . The Declaration stipulates in article 38 : " States , in consultation and cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including legislative measures , to achieve the ends of this Declaration . " Article 42 adds : " States shall promote respect for and full application of the provisions of this Declaration and follow up the effectiveness of this Declaration . " <p> 5 . In April 2008 , a Motion was adopted by the House of Commons that called for the government to endorse the Declaration and that " Parliament and Government of Canada fully implement the standards contained therein . " Bill C-641 , if adopted , would serve to ensure that such implementation is realized . <p> 6 . Canada 's endorsement . In its November 2010 endorsement of the Declaration , the federal government concluded : " We are now confident that Canada can interpret the principles expressed in the Declaration in a manner that is consistent with our Constitution and legal framework . " <p> 7 . In February 2012 , the Canadian government conceded to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in Geneva that the UN Declaration could be used to interpret domestic laws including Canada 's Constitution . This would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35 of the Constitution Act , 1982 . <p> 8 . The Declaration recognizes the " urgent need to respect and promote the inherent rights of indigenous peoples " . Following his October 2013 visit to Canada , former Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples , James Anaya , concluded in his 2014 Report to the UN Human Rights Council : <p> Canada faces a continuing crisis when it comes to the situation of indigenous peoples of the country . The well-being gap between aboriginal and non-aboriginal people in Canada has not narrowed over the last several years , treaty and aboriginals claims remain persistently unresolved , indigenous women and girls remain vulnerable to abuse , and overall there appear to be high levels of distrust among indigenous peoples toward government at both the federal and provincial levels . <p> 9 . UN Declaration a principled framework . In addressing the human rights challenges and injustices facing Indigenous peoples , Anaya also concluded : " The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples , which has been endorsed by Canada , provides a common framework within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be addressed . " In his 2014 Report relating to Canada , Anaya makes repeated references to the " human rights situation " of Indigenous peoples and their " human rights concerns " as well as " devastating human rights violations " in relation to residential schools , the " sixties scoop " of Indigenous children , exclusion of access to lawyers and Canadian courts for grievances relating to Indigenous lands , and many other critical contexts . <p> 10 . Importance of human rights-based approach . In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and modern international law , Canada and other States have a duty to respect and protect human rights without discrimination . The UN Declaration affirms that the " human rights ... of all shall be respected " ( arts . 46(2) and ( 3 ) ) . <p> 11 . In its 2013 " Core Document " forming part of its reports to UN human rights treaty bodies , Canada includes Aboriginal and Treaty rights in section 35 under the heading " Legal framework for protecting human rights at the domestic level " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized as an instrument of justice and reconciliation . In July 2012 , the Canadian Association of Statutory Human Rights Agencies ( CASHRA ) has called on " all levels of government across Canada to implement the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . " CASHRA members include the Canadian Human Rights Commission and most provincial and territorial human rights commissions . <p> 13 . Redressing urgent human rights issues . In regard to murdered and missing Indigenous women , the UN Declaration is particularly instructive : " States shall take measures , in conjunction with indigenous peoples , to ensure that indigenous women and children enjoy the full protection and guarantees against all forms of violence and discrimination " ( art . 22(2) ) . <p> 14 . Indigenous peoples ' consent . The federal government claims it has concerns with " free , prior and informed consent " when used as a veto . However , the term " veto " is never used in the UN Declaration and the government has refused to indicate what the term means . The term " veto " implies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proposed development regardless of the facts and law in any given case . However , human rights , including the rights of Indigenous peoples , are generally relative and not absolute . <p> 15 . In Tsilhqot'in Nation v. British Columbia , the Supreme Court of Canada highlighted Indigenous " consent " in 9 paragraphs ; " right to control " the land in 11 paras. ; and " right to determine " land uses in 2 paras . The Court added that the " right to control " means that the governments and others seeking to use the land must obtain the consent of the Aboriginal title holders . Such paras . are consistent with Indigenous peoples ' right to development and right to self-determination in international law . Such rulings of Canada 's highest court must be respected . <p> 16 . " Consent " is not limited to Aboriginal title and applies to other Aboriginal rights . As described in 2004 by the Supreme Court in Haida Nation v. British Columbia ( Minister of Forests ) , the high end of the spectrum of consultation requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues . " <p> 17 . The UN Declaration did not create the standard of free , prior and informed consent as it applies in Canada . The Supreme Court of Canada raised " consent " in Delgamuukw v. British Columbia over seventeen years ago . In the past ten years , the number of First Nation-industry partnerships have steeply risen , suggesting that recognition and implementation of a requirement for full consent can enhance sustainable development , environmental safeguards and well-being for all . <p> 18 . In his 2014 report on Canada , former Special Rapporteur Anaya concluded : " In accordance with the Canadian constitution and relevant international human rights standards , as a general ruleresource extraction should not occur on lands subject to aboriginal claims without adequate consultations with and the free , prior and informed consent of the indigenous peoples concerned . " ( para . 98 ) <p> 19 . Business and human rights . The " Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights " , endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011 by consensus , affirms : " The responsibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human rights " . In the UN Global Compact 's 2013 Business Reference Guide on the UN Declaration , it is affirmed : " The concept of free , prior and informed consent ( " FPIC " ) is fundamental to the UN Declaration as a measure to ensure that indigenous peoples rights are protected . " The Business Reference Guide adds : <p> FPIC should be obtained whenever there is an impact on indigenous peoples substantive rights ( including rights to land , territories and resources , and rights to cultural , economic and political self-determination ) . ( p. 26 ) <p> 20 . Cooperative federalism must apply to Indigenous peoples . Reconciliation is an ongoing process that requires effective and ongoing Crown-Indigenous peoples cooperation . The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that the underlying constitutional principle of federalism demands nothing less than cooperation . Cooperative federalism must include federal , provincial and Aboriginal governments . In regard to its implementation , the UN Declaration requires States as a minimum standard to take measures " in consultation and cooperation with Indigenous peoples " ( arts . 38 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Treaties , agreements and other constructive arrangements , and the relationship they represent , are the basis for a strengthened partnership between indigenous peoples and States . <p> 21 . As indicated in its preamble , the UN Declaration was solemnly proclaimed " as a standard of achievement to be pursued in a spirit of partnership and mutual respect " . Adoption of Bill C-641 provides a crucial opportunity for the federal government to engage in genuine partnership with Indigenous peoples . <p> 22 . Canada currently lacks an effective strategy for implementation of inherent Aboriginal and Treaty rights . The UN Declaration provides a principled and balanced legal framework for development of laws , policies and judicial decisions to implement First Nations rights , consistent with Canada 's international obligations . In September 2014 , at the UN General Assembly , all States committed to develop National Action Plans to implement the UN Declaration in cooperation with Indigenous peoples . Bill C-641 , if passed and implemented , could substantially contribute to that commitment . <p> In recent years , Canada has ranked between sixth and eighth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been estimated to fall at 63rd or lower depending on the year . The UN Declaration offers a principled framework for closing the gap between First Nations and Canadians in a manner , which both implements our collective rights and uplifts our economic , social and cultural conditions . The UN Declaration is not just an instrument for indigenous peoples improving living conditions for First Nations will uplift all Canadians and usher in a new era of prosperity for all . Again , the Assembly of First Nations commends your efforts and offers our support for Bill C-641.

This year those severely affected are the First Nation communities in the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia and Nova Scotia on the coasts of Canada ; from severe storms , runoff from snowmelt that leads to groundwater saturation , overflowing rivers and lakes , to sea-storm surges . <p> These problems are particularly severe for the regions of Saskatchewan , Alberta , and Manitoba as they are geographically flat , and for Ontario which has an abundance of fresh water lakes . Spring runoff and groundwater easily flood out communities when it can not be fed out into already overwhelmed rivers and streams . <p> Climate change impacts and the resulting changing weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , flooding is the result of man-made manipulations to river flows to satisfy the demand of hydro-electric energy projects . <p> Emergency Management Act ( S.C . 2007 , c. 15 ) <p> The Emergency Management Act defines emergency management as the prevention and mitigation of , preparedness for , response to , and recovery from emergencies . Under the Emergency Management Act , the Minister of Public Safety is responsible for coordinating the Government of Canadas response to an emergency . The Federal Emergency Response Plan ( FERP ) is the Government of Canadas " all-hazards " response plan . <p> Federal government institutions are responsible for developing emergency management plans in relation to risks in their areas of accountability . For First Nations , Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada ( AANDC ) has this responsibility . AANDC established the Emergency Management Assistance Program ( EMAP ) to assist First Nation communities living on reserves in managing emergencies . The program is to cover all four pillars of emergency management : mitigation , preparedness , response , and recovery .

In some cases , the province has further delegated this responsibility to another level . <p> This delegation of responsibility to the provinces has created concerns regarding the level of support , response times , fairness of response , and compensation during the recovery phase , when compared to what is the norm for off-reserve communities . <p> Impact and Debt <p> Flood impacts on First Nation communities can cause varying degrees of damage , some of which have lasting and severe consequences for First Nations . Floods threaten water damage to First Nation housing and subsequent rampant mold problems , loss of livelihood and income , loss of traditional hunting and fishing grounds for sustenance , and loss of traditional grounds for ceremony and burial . These cultural activities are critical to First Nations , more so than the loss of a summer cottage , and must be preserved and restored to ensure the heritage of First Nation communities . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to structural damage , and due to mold have suffered developing and worsening health issues especially for those that suffer from respiratory illnesses . <p> Damage attributed to flooding can not be overestimated and is sometimes unseen . There are 1,927 First Nation evacuees still living in hotels in Manitoba due to the emergency flood evacuation in 2011 . These evacuees have suffered a total loss of their way of life and the situation has had a devastating impact on families . <p> The systems that are in place to alleviate and compensate in times of emergency , have also compounded to this situation , as there are First Nation communities still unpaid for the effects of emergency events two years prior and are now facing financial strain under already less than adequate core funding , while non-Native communities affected by the same emergency have been paid for their losses almost from the outset . <p> Flooding can overwhelm a communitys capacity to deal with the issue if they are caught unprepared and without the necessary emergency management support required . Simply making funding available as a reactive measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooding problems and their related costs reduce First Nation communitys already insufficient core funding while they await reimbursement from Disaster Financial Assistance . Long term Mitigation and Resilience strategies must be developed by both the federal and respective provincial governments in collaboration with affected First Nations , to introduce new solutions to these recurring problems . <p> First Nation communities have been suffering the effects of recurrent flooding from British Columbia to Nova Scotia , with the most devastating in the Prairie Provinces from Alberta to Manitoba . <p> The total number First Nations impacted by flooding with evacuations recorded on June 17 , 2011 was 1429 ; on June 29 , 2012 , the total number of First Nations evacuees recorded due to flooding was 2323 . <p> Today as the 2013 flooding season begins , there are currently still seven First Nation communities with evacuations from previous flood events , with a combined total of 1933 evacuees .

Discussions with other communities are also underway . First Nations collectively insist on far greater effort , attention and urgency being brought to bear in resolving this longstanding critical situation . It is absolutely unacceptable and intolerable for entire communities to be displaced , for their entire way of life to be erased , for their culture and heritage to be threatened , for families to be torn apart and for children and others to face interruptions in education and health services all for want of a successful flood mitigation strategy . <p> Such a strategy is not only essential for First Nations but will also provide significant sustained benefit to other communities and demonstrate due diligence on behalf of all levels of governments . <p> Currently , water levels continue to rise in areas across the country impacting many First Nations in Ontario , Manitoba , Saskatchewan and Alberta .

Our organizations strongly support human rights education . We urge all Canadians to engage with Indigenous peoples , to help educate others , and to support the current movement of awareness raising and ensuring vital reforms .

This exceptional exhibit runs until December 23 , 2016 . It is a must-see . <p> Since 2011 , the museum has won 11 recognition awards . In a little more than six months , the museum won four awards of excellence and recognition : the SociTtT des musTes du QuTbec Excellence Award , the National Aboriginal Cultural Tourism Award , the Quebec Aboriginal Tourism Award in the Interpretation Site category , and the Canadian Museums Association Award of Excellence . <p> The museum earned these awards of distinction for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotes understanding and learning . I invite my colleagues to not only come visit the Abenaki Museum this summer , but also and especially to come discover and learn about the rich heritage of the Abenaki people . <p> June 17 , 2015 <h> The Environment <p> Mr. Speaker , just off the coast of my riding is a cluster of islands in the Salish Sea that encompasses the best marine and coastal environment in urban Canada . Home to migratory birds , rare plants , orca whales and sacred sites for the Songhees First Nation , today these are under-protected and under threat . Lack of coordination and enforcement have left them vulnerable , and we must act now to prevent further damage . <p> The University of Victoria ' s Environmental Law Centre has studied the legal designations available to protect this area and preserve the uses , rights and title of the Songhees First Nation . Many of these designations require the direct support of the federal government . Others require Ottawa to work with the Songhees First Nation , the province of British Columbia , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers the options in this new report , I hope we will find a true partner in Ottawa . We have a rare moment to save a precious environment , so let us work together . <p> Mr. Speaker , this government has apologized for that . We have brought to the attention of the Pope and the Catholic Church the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission . It will be up to the Catholic Church to decide how to respond to the recommendations that are pertinent to it . <p> The kind of change Canadians are seeking is change that means more prosperity , lower taxes and greater trade . That is the kind of change they are looking for . They are not looking for the high tax , protectionist , anti-prosperity agenda of the NDP . <h> Aboriginal Affairs <p> Mr. Speaker , four decades after the waterways around Grassy Narrows were contaminated , a new report has revealed that the mercury levels in parts of the English-Wabigoon river system are increasing . The mercury is an obvious risk to the health of the Grassy Narrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been any adequate study of the impact of these levels on people 's health . <p> A new report calls for a comprehensive study to be concluded . Will the government support this study , yes or no ? <p> Mr. Speaker , the health and well-being of first nations is a priority for our government , and we continue to work with the Mercury Disability Board and the Province of Ontario to support their work in addressing the issue of mercury contamination . We have been working in partnership with the first nation and the Province of Ontario for a number of years , and that good co-operation and work will continue . <p> Mr. Speaker , there is yet no answer to this question for the people of Grassy Narrows First Nation . <p> Let us move on to the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women . <p> This Friday , the RCMP is expected to publish a report talking about this ongoing tragedy . Indigenous people have called for the full analysis and details of what numbers are out there so that all systemic factors can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inquiry as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has also recommended . <p> When will the government take seriously the issue of the national epidemic that is missing and murdered indigenous women in Canada ? <p> Mr. Speaker , these are terrible crimes against innocent people , and the RCMP said in its own study that the vast majority of these cases are addressed and solved through police investigations . <p> We do not need another study . We have already had over 40 studies that have been done . We need to move forward with the action plan that is going to improve the lives of women and children living on reserves . <h> Aboriginal Affairs <p> Mr. Speaker , I am honoured to rise here today to continue the pressure on an issue I raised in this House a few weeks ago . <p> A question that I repeatedly asked both as the NDP aboriginal affairs critic and as the member of Parliament for Churchill is how the government can justify egregiously long wait times when dealing with indigenous communities . <p> First Nations , MTtis , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response on issue after issue . When it comes to first nations settling land claims , implementing treaties , claiming treaty land entitlements , and creating additions to reserves , the government needs to act . Nations are waiting for the government to enable them to create economic opportunities for the prosperity and welfare of their people and across the country in all regions . <p> Unfortunately , it is the glacial response or sheer inaction on the part of the minister and his department that is standing in the way . <p> I am here to raise the issue faced by the Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation , or NCN , a first nation in northern Manitoba that has been attempting to convert an addition to reserve package known as the Mystery Lake parcel for 12 long years . The minister has given no reason for the delay , which is costing the first nation millions of dollars . That is money that could be spent to improve the lives of their people . <p> Chief Marcel Moody from NCN came all the way to Ottawa to advocate for his people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said : <p> We 've been trying to convert that property to an urban reserve for the last 12 years . It 's been a slow and cumbersome process . ... <p> It has taken that long . Over that time we have lost between $20 million and $30 million because that property has n't been converted to a reserve . ... <p> The support from the mayor and council of Thompson has been great . ... The support has been always been there from Thompson . It 's a process that 's so slow , and it really impedes our ability to move forward as a community . <p> In most cases when the government is delaying ATR implementation , it is the municipalities that are ready and willing partners in the exchange . In fact , when Chief Moody came to testify at the aboriginal affairs committee , so did Tim Johnston , the previous mayor of Thompson . He spoke in support of the first nation : <p> One of the comments we make is that the challenge , when we 're talking access to capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create capital . Unfortunately , right now , at the federal level there are real challenges with doing that between programs and policies among departments , which counteract , in many ways , the ability of first nations to accumulate wealth . <p> Mystery Lake is a prime example of this problem . The process has been under way for 12 years , including many years prior to that in negotiations . ... This is absolutely a shame . <p> The NCN 's Mystery Lake package is a done deal and will work to benefit both the first nation , the City of Thompson , and our region as a whole . It is only now being stalled because the government is not prioritizing this case . <p> Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise to speak to the question from the member for Churchill . <p> Our government is committed to improving community access to lands and resources and simplifying processes for additions to reserves . Completing additions to reserves is part of our government 's overall commitment to helping unlock the economic potential of reserve land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land brings to first nation communities . It increases their self-sufficiency and allows them to participate more fully in Canada 's economy . <p> Since forming government , we have been committed to improving the Indian Act land administration to promote economic development on reserve and to provide first nations with the tools they need to take greater control of their own affairs . For example , by clarifying processes and improving alignment with provincial and municipal practices , the land designation and additions to reserve processes have become far more streamlined than in the past . <p> Our government supports the treaty land entitlement process in Manitoba , which includes the Cree nation mentioned by the member . We know that the fulfillment of treaty land entitlement agreements assists in building partnerships and spurring economic development on reserves and in surrounding communities . Businesses and citizens of nearby communities are able to feel the effects of the increased prosperity enjoyed by first nations in the area . <p> Adding land to reserve is just one way in which we are working with first nations to drive economic participation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to support the first nations land management regime . This very successful first nation-led initiative enables first nations to manage their own lands , resources and environment outside the limitations imposed by the Indian Act . Currently , this regime has benefited 94 first nations across the country . <p> Our government remains focused on ensuring Cree nations benefit from economic opportunities such as these . This is one of the most effective ways to improve the well-being and quality of life of aboriginal people in Canada . Our government is committed to working with first nations so that more first nations can access lands , resources and economic opportunities . <p> Mr. Speaker , I thank the member of the government for her response . Many of us have said that the government has made a commitment to treaty land entitlement and additions to reserve . However , the issue here is not what has been said . The issue is the lack of action . <p> This is an addition to reserve situation . It is something the municipality is firmly behind . It is something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is asking for this to be done as soon as possible . When will this addition to reserve be completed ? <p> Mr. Speaker , as I have already said , our government is committed to improving community access to lands and working collaboratively with first nations to deliver on our additions to reserve commitments . <p> Expanding the reserve land base through additions to reserve is an important mechanism by which first nations can foster economic development in their own communities . That is why our government remains committed to working with all Cree nations . We understand that improving the additions to reserve can create jobs , growth and long-term prosperity in first nation communities right across our country . This benefits not only aboriginal communities , but all Canadians . <h> June 18 , 2015Aboriginal Affairs <p> Mr. Speaker , the facts are well known , and women across Canada live the reality of gender-based violence every single day . However , indigenous women face the starkest reality . They are more than three times more likely to be victims of violence and seven times more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence , we need to come to grips with the factors that cause it . Why is the government refusing to listen to indigenous women who are calling for an inquiry to do just that ? <p> Mr. Speaker , as I have said before , these are terrible crimes against innocent people , and the best way of dealing with these issues is to make sure that we are taking action . This has been studied many times over , but what aboriginal women have told me across this country is that we need action . That is why we tabled in this House an action plan in September 2014 to move forward on preventative projects to make sure that there is support for the victims of these terrible crimes as well as to make sure that they are protected . I still do not understand why the opposition members refuse to support that action plan . <p> Mr. Speaker , what indigenous peoples are saying and what we are saying is that it is time for the toxic current government to go . <p> Translation <p> The Aboriginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality of aboriginal and non-aboriginal people will not be achieved even by 2022 . First nations on reserve had the worst results for almost all indicators , including employment and education . <p> Mr. Speaker , as I said yesterday , we welcome this report and we thank the committee for its work . <p> Our government understands that economic development is essential to improving the living conditions of aboriginal peoples . Since the beginning of our mandate , we have taken steps to improve the living conditions of first nations by giving them the means to fully benefit from Canada 's economic prosperity . We also created the first nations job fund and made investments to improve the education system , and we will continue in that vein . <p> Mr. Speaker , the question is this . When will the government step up and put an end to the third-world living conditions that first nations face across this country ? <p> Today the Manitoba government is making a historic apology for the Sixties Scoop , a file that has been long ignored by the federal government . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government still significantly underfunds child welfare services on reserve , and the results are devastating . In fact , there are more children in care today than there were at the height of the residential school system . <p> The question is this : How in good conscience can the Conservative government continue to discriminate against first nations children ? <p> Mr. Speaker , we remain committed to the health , safety and well-being of first nation children . The hon. member ought to know that child welfare services are delivered throughout the country according to provincial law and standards . We will continue to take action to ensure that children and families have the support they need to lead healthy lives . <h> Mohawk Lake <p> Mr. Speaker , Mohawk Lake is Brantford 's most untapped natural asset , an urban lake minutes from our downtown , bordering on historic parkland to the north and land that is primed for redevelopment to the south . <p> It is surrounded by history , including the site of Ontario 's first ever hydro generating station and important first nations sites like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadly , today the lake sits polluted and abandoned . <p> However , our government supported local efforts to clean up the neighbouring polluted land , and when we have finished the job of cleaning up the liquid brownfield next door , the Greenwich-Mohawk lake district will become one of the most promising destinations for future development in our community . <p> The Mohawk Lake working group was formed as a community effort to finally restore the lake into an asset that everyone can enjoy , and by working together , I know we can achieve the goal of finally bringing yesterday back to tomorrow and unlocking the true potential of this ecological gem . <h> Aboriginal Affairs <p> Mr. Speaker , yesterday 's report of the National Aboriginal Economic Development Board confirmed that under the Conservative government , gaps between aboriginal people and the rest of Canada are getting worse . <p> Underfunding education , inaction on overcrowded housing , crumbling water systems and inferior health care are not only morally reprehensible , but economic incompetence . <p> When will the government make the concrete investments necessary to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and MTtis deserve ? <p> Mr. Speaker , as I said earlier , we welcome the report of the National Aboriginal Economic Development Board and we thank the board for its work . <p> We agree that economic development is key to improving the living conditions of aboriginal peoples everywhere in Canada . That is why since coming to office we have taken measures to improve first nations ' well-being by enabling them to take full advantage of Canada 's prosperity . We will continue to work with willing partners to continue in that vein . <p> June 19 , 2015 <h> National Aboriginal Day <p> Mr. Speaker , this Sunday is National Aboriginal Day , and by happy coincidence I will not be in Ottawa this year but will have the privilege of joining my brothers and sisters of Fort William First Nation at Mount McKay in their celebrations . <p> In addition to the traditional celebrations , this year we will also reflect upon the findings and recommendations of Justice Sinclair and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission . I would also like to personally wish Ontario Regional Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his strong leadership over his many years of service in his many important roles . <p> With the election of a New Democratic government this October , Canadians will finally have a federal government that accepts responsibility for the immense injustices perpetrated upon our founding people by those who came later , a federal government that will make a solemn promise to ensure that these injustices are never repeated , a federal government that will finally work on a nation-to-nation basis with Canada 's first peoples so that we can walk together , hand in hand , towards a better future . <p> Mino-giizhigad . Happy Aboriginal Day . Meegwetch . <h> Aboriginal Affairs <p> Mr. Speaker , Sunday is National Aboriginal Day , and we have sadly just learned that the economic conditions in aboriginal communities have gotten worse under the Conservative government . According to The Aboriginal Economic Progress Report , the employment rate for people on reserve is 9% lower than that for other Canadians . <p> Mr. Speaker , I urge the member to read the entire report . She will see that significant progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that economic development is necessary to improve living conditions for aboriginal peoples . <p> Since the beginning of our mandate , we have taken measures to improve living conditions for the first nations by giving them the means to fully take advantage of the country 's economic prosperity . We have invested in education and training , for example , and we brought in income assistance reform to give these children personalized services to help them acquire skills . <p> Mr. Speaker , with answers like that one , I think that Canadians need a real change in government . <p> Today the RCMP will release a new report on missing and murdered aboriginal women . The families of these victims , aboriginal groups , the provinces , the territories , the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada and even the United Nations all agree that we need a national inquiry to understand and put an end to this tragic problem . <p> Will the government stop ignoring this issue and launch a national inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women ? <p> Mr. Speaker , we do not need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is our government that continues to stand up for victims of violence . Since coming into office , we have toughened sentences for murder , sexual assault , and kidnapping and have imposed mandatory prison sentences . <p> We also passed historic legislation that gave aboriginal women on reserves the same matrimonial rights that member has , including emergency protection orders , and that member and her party voted against it . <p> It is our government that is taking action . It is our government that stands up for aboriginal women and girls , not that side of the House . <p> Mr. Speaker , the Conservatives ' idea of tangible action to end violence against indigenous women is funding a website . It will take a lot more than a website to end this horrendous violence . The Truth and Reconciliation Commission , national aboriginal organizations , Amnesty International , and victims like Rinelle Harper have been very clear : we need a national inquiry . <p> Canadians are tired of the current government playing partisan games with the lives of women . When will the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappearances of indigenous women ? <p> Mr. Speaker , it is our Conservative government that brought the action plan to address family violence and violent crimes against aboriginal women and girls as well as the family violence protection program . That member and her party , once again , voted against them . Since coming to office , we have passed more than 30 criminal justice and safety initiatives . That member and her party voted against them . Again , we passed Bill S-2 . That party and the member voted against it . <p> While our government takes action , the opposition party does not . That side of the House never votes to support women and girls in Canada . <p> Mr. Speaker , a website is not action , and that is not the end of it . Canadians know that under the current government , aboriginal unemployment has increased and the wage gap has increased . Instead of helping aboriginal communities , the government does not even count unemployment on reserves . It allows businesses on reserves to bring in temporary foreign workers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could help communities develop . They have been left in dire poverty . Why are the Conservatives ignoring our indigenous communities ? <p> Mr. Speaker , the NDP and that member can try to play politics with the situation of first nations and aboriginal Canadians , but it will lead nowhere . The fact of the matter is that since we have come to office , we have taken measures to improve the well-being of first nations . For example , in the last budget , we again increased significant resources to expand the first nations land management regime , which has led to some $300 million in further investments in aboriginal communities . Again , the opposition voted against it . <p> Highlights from the Senate <p> June 16 , 2015 <h> National Roundtable on Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women and Girls <h> InquiryDebate Adjourned <p> Hon. Lillian Eva Dyck rose pursuant to notice of March 25 , 2015 : <p> That she will call the attention of the Senate to the National Roundtable on missing and murdered aboriginal women and girls and the Government of Canada 's Action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women and Girls . <p> She said : Honourable senators , I rise today to speak to my inquiry into the National Roundtable on Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women and Girls and the Government of Canada 's Action Plan to Address Family Violence and Violent Crimes Against Aboriginal Women and Girls . <p> Our previous three speakers have talked about human rights issues . In fact , this , too , is a human rights issue quite simply because , according to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , section 15 , of the law without discrimination . " <p> Now , of course , we know about the issue of missing and murdered Aboriginal women who do not receive the equal protection of law , so it 's a human rights issue . <p> A historic roundtable of provincial , territorial and Aboriginal leaders , two federal ministers and family members of missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls was held on February 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,200 Aboriginal women and girls have been murdered or gone missing since 1980 . Aboriginal females are three times more likely to be murdered and four times more likely to disappear than other Canadian women . <p> ( 1810 ) <p> Incredulously , though almost all provincial and territorial leaders have called for a national commission of inquiry into the issue of missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls , the Prime Minister has said repeatedly that his government would not do so . After the historic roundtable meeting , Ministers Leitch and Valcourt held a separate press conference to reiterate that their action plan released last September was all that was needed . <p> After the roundtable , Minister Leitch stated : <p> No single community , no individual , no organization or government can end violence against Aboriginal women and girls alone . We all have a shared responsibility . . . and the federal government is committed to doing its part . <p> Honourable senators , while the issue of missing and murdered Aboriginal women is indeed a shared responsibility , by holding a separate news conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appears that the federal ministers have essentially off-loaded their primary responsibility onto the provincial , territorial and Aboriginal leaders . <p> Honourable senators , after the roundtable , Minister Leitch said the federal government would not undertake a national inquiry into missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls . The ministers think their national action plan is sufficient , but how good is their national action plan ? Sadly , it is too narrow in its focus and most of the actions are too late after the victim has been murdered or made missing . <p> Worse yet , the national action plan is fixated on the as yet unsubstantiated premise that Aboriginal men are the main perpetrators . This significantly limits the effectiveness of the national plan in preventing the disappearance and murder of Aboriginal women and girls . <p> Honourable senators , let 's examine the Conservative government 's national action plan . There are four major budgetary items totalling $25 million over five years : $8.6 million over five years for community safety plans ; $2.5 million over five years for projects to break intergenerational cycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs ; and $7.5 million over five years for victim services . <p> The national action plan budget is about $5 million per year and , while the federal ministers may imply that this is substantial , it is a small amount of money compared to the $100 million per year spent by Aboriginal Affairs fighting First Nations on various matters in the courts , and the more than $100 million spent on Canada 's Economic Action Plan ads since 2009 . <p> It was just reported that Aboriginal Affairs did n't even spend its entire budget for the last five years $1 billion was unspent . That 's correct , $1 billion : $200 million per year was unspent for the last five years . Can you imagine what we could have done with that billion dollars ? <p> Let 's review the four components of the Conservative action plan . When we examine these programs and their effectiveness to address what we know about the issue of missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls , we find that the national action plan falls significantly short . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that enough research has been done on missing and murdered women and that it 's time to take concrete actions to ameliorate this tragedy . Having said that , you would expect that the government members responsible for this issue would have read the 40 reports that they refer to and you would expect that they would have thoroughly reviewed the research findings from the RCMP and the Native Women 's Association of Canada . Clearly , that has not been the case . <p> Honourable senators , the Conservative government has developed a national action plan that is based on their assumption that most Aboriginal women and girls are murdered or made missing by the actions of the Aboriginal men living on First Nations reserves . <p> Minister Valcourt , at a private meeting with Treaty 7 and 8 chiefs stated that Aboriginal men were responsible for 70 per cent of the missing and murdered Aboriginal women cases . At first the RCMP stated that they would not verify the minister 's statement because they do n't do race-based analyses . However , RCMP Commissioner Paulson later stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another report with statistics would be released in May . <p> I 've been waiting for these numbers to include in my speech , but the RCMP have not yet released any new information . As of today , the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network said the RCMP will release an update tomorrow , but there will be no such numbers on the racial identity of the perpetrators . <p> Now , to get back to the plan : First , $8.6 million over five years has been promised for the development of community safety plans on reserves across Canada . While this sounds great , it 's not a new initiative . The Aboriginal Community Safety Planning program was launched in 2010 . Surely this Conservative government could have initiated something new . After all , they had 40 reports and more than 700 recommendations to aid their planning . The safety planning program is flawed because it focuses only on First Nation reserves . It does not address the safety issues for the majority of Aboriginal women who live in urban or rural areas . The Metis and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of First Nations people . <p> Honourable senators , policing is also included under the community safety plan . The First Nations Policing Program received funding for $612.4 million over five years in 2013 . Again , while this may sound good , First Nation policing is underfunded . Gosh , where could that $1 billion been helpful here ? <p> In 2014 , for example , the Nishnawbe Aski and Anishinabek police services in Ontario and the band constable program in Manitoba all faced critical funding shortages . In the case of Manitoba , the federal government unilaterally withdrew their band constable funding program . Fortunately , the provincial government stepped up and provided funds at twice the federal level . <p> Colleagues , surely if the Conservative government was serious about making Aboriginal communities safe , they would have provided sufficient funding for policing on reserves , especially in Manitoba which , like Saskatchewan , is an area where Aboriginal women and girls have the greatest risk of being murdered or made missing . <p> If the Conservative government officials think that the main problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut the resources for on-reserve police in one of the most unsafe areas of the country ? It just does n't make sense . <p> Honourable senators , now let 's examine the second item in the government 's action plan : $2.5 million over five years to break intergenerational cycles of violence stemming from abuse in the Indian residential schools . Included under this second item of the national action plan are the Family Violence Prevention Programs . While this is a good initiative , its main focus again is reserve communities . As I said before , Inuit , Metis and First Nation families who live off reserve are neglected . <p> It 's important to note that the intergenerational violence that occurs on reserves stems from the deliberate actions and policies of the government aimed at Aboriginal people . The residential schools system , the Indian Act and the political marginalization of Aboriginal people in Canada are all factors that created an intergenerational cycle of abuse and violence on Indian reserves . The present Government of Canada should not forget that this cycle of violence was created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , Minister Valcourt stated that Aboriginal men were responsible for 70 per cent of the murders of Aboriginal women . His statement angered the chiefs to whom he was speaking . Valcourt 's statement was outrageous . It ignored the root causes of the high rates of family violence , the intergenerational legacy of abuse and violence , and the devaluation of women learned at Indian residential schools . How can he blame Aboriginal boys and men for violent behaviours without taking into account that federal government legislation and policies created the residential schools and gave Aboriginal women fewer rights than Aboriginal men ? <p> How can Minister Valcourt say that First Nation men have a lack of respect towards women on reserves without acknowledging that this is part of the cultural norm for all Canadians ? He should know that that teaching was part of the assimilationist agenda imposed on Aboriginals through the Indian residential schools which eradicated the traditional respect that Aboriginal women received before colonization . <p> Just two weeks ago , the Truth and Reconciliation Commission held their final public event here in Ottawa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a link between Indian residential schools , intergenerational trauma and family violence , and missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls . What is of prime importance is that the commissioners also made it clear that non-Aboriginal Canadians have learned to devalue and denigrate Aboriginals . <p> ( 1820 ) <p> Colleagues , the third item under the Conservative national action plan is $5 million over five years for anti-violence programs . While a new awareness program to denounce violence against Aboriginal women is to be developed in conjunction with the Native Women 's Association of Canada , the emphasis once again is on family violence and Aboriginal boys and men on reserve . While this is an important aspect , Aboriginals know that an awareness campaign to educate Canadian society at large on ending violence against Aboriginal women and girls is also needed . Furthermore , as noted earlier , the Truth and Reconciliation report makes it crystal clear that non-Aboriginal communities have also been taught to devalue Aboriginal women . <p> Colleagues , the fourth item under the national action plan is $7.5 million over five years for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , children and families on reserve who are victims of family violence . This program also funds 41 women 's shelters on reserve . <p> According to an APTN news article , however , money provided for new family violence protection programs is not new money but was money taken from the budget for on-reserve women 's shelters . While more money is available for new programming , there is less money available for shelters . Clearly this makes little sense as the two actions are contradictory . The national action plan is , in effect , increasing the risk of violence against Aboriginal women by decreasing funding earmarked for shelters . <p> Honourable senators , it is clear that the four measures contained in the national action plan are inadequate . <p> The premise that it is Aboriginal men living on reserve who are responsible for the murder or disappearance of Aboriginal women and girls was first mentioned by suspended Senator Brazeau in 2010 , during our study of the matrimonial property rights act . Unfortunately , Minister Valcourt has followed Senator Brazeau 's thinking . <p> Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of respect for women and girls on reserves . . . if the guys grow up believing that women have no rights , that is how they are treated . <p> He , of all people , must surely know that the reason why Aboriginal women have fewer rights on reserves was because of the Indian Act . The minister is blaming Aboriginal men for disrespecting Aboriginal women , when he should be blaming the treaty-era White men in 1876 who developed the Indian Act , which granted fewer rights to Indian women than to men . <p> Contrary to what Brazeau and Valcourt have claimed , the Native Women 's Association of Canada reported that most Aboriginal woman and girls are most likely to be murdered or to be disappeared off reserve . According to their 2010 research report , only 7 per cent go missing from a reserve and only 13 per cent are murdered on a reserve . Seventy per cent of Aboriginal women and girls disappeared from an urban area and 60 per cent were murdered in an urban area . <p> Could I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaker pro tempore : Is it agreed , honourable senators ? <p> Hon. Senators : Agreed . <p> Senator Dyck : Furthermore , the Native Women 's Association of Canada data show that Aboriginal women and girls are three times more likely to be murdered by a stranger . It is obvious that the Harper government has ignored these findings and thus has made a serious mistake by focusing their actions on family violence on Indian reserves . <p> Honourable senators , perhaps the most damming indictment of the Conservative 's national action plan is that it ignores the role of non-Aboriginals in the murders and disappearance of Aboriginal women and girls . Most everyone knows that non-Aboriginal men have murdered Aboriginal women . There are many well-known cases , such as the serial killers Willie Pickton and John Crawford . <p> The 2010 NWAC research report What Their Stories Tell Us : Research findings from the Sisters in Spirit initiative clearly documents that both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal men murder Aboriginal women . Their data show that at least 23 per cent of the murderers were non-Aboriginal ; 36 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown race . It 's very difficult to determine the race with any degree of certainty . That 's why there 's such a high percentage there . <p> On March 20 , however , Minister Valcourt claimed that 70 per cent of the murderers of Aboriginal females were indigenous , according to unreleased RCMP data . He indicated that this data would be reported to the public . Initially , the RCMP said they do n't collect this type of data and wo n't be releasing any data on the racial identity . Then , as noted earlier , Commissioner Paulson said the numbers would be released last month , but so far nothing has been released . Today , APTN is saying the RCMP will release a report tomorrow , but the update report will not include information on the ethnicity of the perpetrators . We 're back to square one . The credibility of Minister Valcourt and the veracity of his statement are thus very questionable . <p> Honourable senators , the actions taken by the government to prevent the murder or disappearance of Aboriginal women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the available facts . While there are some good individual programs in the action plan , it is clear that it is an action plan to tackle intergenerational family violence on reserves , but it is not an action plan on missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls . While family violence may be part of the root causes , there are other root causes and factors that lead to the greater risk of Aboriginal women to be made missing or murdered . The federal government has not designed an action plan to specifically address missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls . Even the words " missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls " are not in the title of their action plan . <p> Honourable senators , the only way to get an effective national action plan to prevent Aboriginal women and girls from going missing or being murdered is to launch an independent commission of inquiry . An independent commission of inquiry would not be unduly influenced by preconceived ideas about Aboriginal women and men and at least an independent commission would recognize that non-Aboriginal men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aboriginal women and girls . We could access all available data , including any that the RCMP may have but will not release . <p> Colleagues , over the last two years , there has been a steadily increasing public awareness about the large numbers of missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls . An Angus Reid poll conducted last October showed that three-quarters of Canadians are in favour of a national inquiry . Just two weeks ago , the Truth and Reconciliation Commissioners also recommended a public inquiry . <p> Recommendation 41 of their summary states : <p> We call upon the federal government , in consultation with Aboriginal organizations , to appoint a public inquiry into the causes of , and remedies for , the disproportionate victimization of Aboriginal women and girls . The inquiry 's mandate would include : <p> i . Investigation into missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls . <p> ii . Links to the intergenerational legacy of residential schools . <p> Honourable senators , seven years ago , in June 2008 , Prime Minister Harper apologized for the imposition of the Indian residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet today he still refuses to call a commission of inquiry into the missing and murdered Aboriginal women .

" <p> The AFN applauds the Canadian governments recognition of the essential role of Aboriginal peoples by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands , waters , plants and animals . Through AFNs work in this area , the ESU is committed to ensuring First Nations have a voice and active role in matters pertaining to wildlife preservation , as this affects their ability to use and further Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge ( ATK ) and to pursue traditional lifestyles . The ESU supports ongoing work to ensure that First Nations perspectives and voices are continuously recognized , both in the wording of federal acts like the Species At Risk Act and in the actions and regulations pursued under those acts . <p> The AFN participates in the SARA legislated National Aboriginal Council On Species At Risk ( NACOSAR ) and the councils policy and planning sub-committee . The ESU remains committed to ensuring that implementation of the Species At Risk Act furthers First Nations enjoyment of their Aboriginal and Treaty Rights . <h> Biomonitoring <p> People are exposed to a variety of contaminants , chemicals and heavy metals . These enter into the body by breathing , touching objects , eating and drinking . In many cases , contaminants can stay inside ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have impacts to ones health . <p> Biomonitoring is a scientific technique that can detect the level of environmental contaminants by collecting samples of human fluids and/or tissues such as blood , urine , breast milk , hair , nails , expelled air , etc . <p> The First Nations Biomonitoring Initiative ( FNBI ) is a First Nations specific study that will allow for the assessment and measurement of contaminants in the First Nation population . Currently there is no baseline data for the level of chemical contamination in First Nations peoples . The FNBI will fill this existing gap in biomonitoring research and serve to complement the Canadian Health Measures Survey ( CHMS ) , a national health survey of the Canadian population that began in 2008 , that excludes First Nations peoples living on reserve . <p> The First Nations Biomonitoring Initiative pilot project was successfully carried out ( winter 2011 ) in two First Nation communities , after signing community research agreements with both communities and consent forms with each participant . A total of 252 First Nations people - randomly selected and above 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemicals measured include trace metals ( e.g. mercury , uranium , etc. ) as well as persistent organic pollutants ( PCBs , pesticides , etc . ) . The results were sent to participants and a final report was presented to the community . The AFN will be custodian of the data collected , guarantying that OCAP principles are observed at all times . <p> The FNBI full-scale project took place during the summer/fall 2011 with the sampling of 13 communities south of 60 and a participation of 503 First Nations people . Individual results were sent to participants and community reports were completed in the fall 2012 . <p> The ESU plans to obtain a First Nation national picture on environmental contaminants as well as to advocate for a national expansion of the study to include 200 First Nation communities.ESU resources . <h> Canadian Environmental Protection Act <p> The Canadian Environmental Protection Act ( CEPA ) , 1999 is riddled with weaknesses that compromise its ability to adequately protect the environment and First Nations Aboriginal and Treaty Rights ( which depend on having healthy natural ecosystems and environments ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as First Nations , who are dependent on the health of the natural environment to support their traditions , livelihoods and culture . <p> CEPA implementation has failed thus far to incorporate government-to-government partnership with First Nation governments and to be respectful of First Nation tradition and protocols . <p> First Nations require information on required federal legislation that impacts their lands , waters and air in order to properly participate in the processes of reviewing , changing or implementing the legislation . Information must be provided in a culturally sensitive manner that acknowledges First Nations needs and the lack of capacity that exists for most First Nation communities wanting to participate in environmental advocacy initiatives to steward their lands , waters and air . <p> The ESU strives to bring First Nations environmental concerns and interests into the spotlight in order to ensure that the Government of Canada is proactive in including First Nation governments in environmental decision-making . <p> The AFN has encouraged strengthening of CEPA , 1999 to provide more protection to First Nation communities . <p> The AFN has drafted three written interventions for the parliamentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEPA in protecting vulnerable ecosystems and peoples , and in cooperating with First Nation governments . <p> The AFN developed CEPA 99 toolkits in both official languages and distributed them at First Nations meetings and workshops in order to inform First Nations across Canada of the possible implications of this Act on their rights and economic interests . <h> Contaminants <p> First Nations people , especially children and elders , are experiencing extensive negative health impacts as a result of exposure to toxic chemicals , poor air quality , contaminated water and other environmental hazards . <p> Contaminant emissions into air , water and earth must be reduced at the source by those who are creating them . <p> Extensive environmental clean-up is required to account for past degradation of air , lands and waterways . <p> First Nations require tools and capacity support to develop their own programs in support of environmental stewardship to increase current ecosystem vitality and to ensure ecosystem health for seven generations to come . <h> Environmental Health <p> Environmental Health " comprises of those aspects of human health , including quality of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social , and psychosocial factors in the environment . It also refers to the theory and practice of assessing , correcting , controlling , and preventing those factors in the environment that can potentially affect adversely the health of present and future generations . " <p> World Health Organization ( WHO ) draft definition developed at a WHO consultation in Sofia , Bulgaria , 1993 . <p> First Nations people have long recognized that the health of the environment and the health of the individual are intimately connected . From a First Nations holistic perspective , health includes the physical , mental , emotional , social and spiritual aspects . The environment plays a vital role with respect to all aspects of health . Understanding the linkages between the environment and the health of First Nations peoples is crucial in order to enhance the protection of their health from exposure to future environmental hazards . <p> Environmental health is a vital component of the overall health of First Nations people , as many continue to rely heavily on the environment for their social , cultural , economic and physical survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependence on the land has also presented higher than normal risks to health . The consumption and use of traditional plant species and " wild " foods has significantly increased exposure to chemical and biological contaminants which has in turn resulted in a suspected decline in the overall health status of First Nations people either due to consuming contaminated traditional foods and/or by turning to less nutritious processed market foods . <p> The ESU is actively engaged in environmental health issues . With the ESUs environmental health program , we are conducting research on ways to improve quality of life by reducing health and safety risks that result from interactions between people and their environments . The ESU is also working with government and First Nation communities on primary prevention of illnesses through a combination of surveillance , education , enforcement , and assessment programs that identify , prevent , and abate the environmental conditions that adversely impact human health . <h> FNEHIN <p> The First Nations Environmental Health Innovation Network ( FNEHIN ) is a national network that aims to link First Nations communities and organisations with practical environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate goal of FNEHIN is to assist First Nations in identifying , researching and solving Environmental Health problems by providing relevant information and supporting partnerships in a network approach that builds capacity , strengthens institutions and promotes self-reliance . <h> National First Nations Environmental Contaminants Program <p> The National First Nations Environmental Contaminants Program ( NFNECP ) was launched in 1999 as a collaborative research program between the Assembly of First Nations ( AFN ) and the Medical Services Branch , now known as the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch ( FNIHB ) , Health Canada . <p> The objective of the NFNECP is to help First Nations of Canada assess the extent of their exposure to environmental contaminants and the potential for associated risk to their health and well-being . NFNECP funding enables communities to acquire the resources necessary to develop projects that explore the link between environmental contaminants and human health . The results of NFNECP projects provide communities with valuable tools to initiate or influence remediation action on the foundation of better knowledge . <p> The AFN continues to support the program through its participation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Program Champion " , while continuing to advocate for First Nations interests with respect to environmental health issues . The ESU will develop a lobbying strategy to advocate for more federal funding for the program and will highlight and showcase the best practices and successes of the program . <h> Natural Resources <p> Aboriginal and Treaty Rights apply to First Nations dominion over natural resources in their traditional lands . Natural resources are considered to be both mineral ( inorganic ) or biological ( organic ) , renewable and non-renewable , located on the land , under the land , or in water or air , and are used by First Nations to satisfy human needs and promote economic development . First Nations have not traditionally considered the environment as a resource but have found it necessary to assert their rights to natural resources in response to external forces which have limited their ability to participate in traditional activities that depend on the aspects of the environment that are considered to be resources by government , industry and citizens at large . <p> The main issues facing First Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Treaty Rights by federal and provincial legislation ; ongoing disputes over the scope of First Nations rights to natural resources ; and the negative impact on traditional livelihoods and lifestyles that First Nations experience as a result of widespread exploitation of resources . The ESU is committed to advocating for First Nations in order to ensure that resource extraction causes the least possible environmental impact and follows principles of sustainable use and corporate social responsibility . <p> Federal and provincial governments are engaged in reviewing , altering , and in some cases simplifying legislation on an ongoing basis . It is important that reviews and changes are monitored for their potential impacts to First Nations Aboriginal and Treaty Rights . The ESU is committed to monitoring policy changes at the Federal level and advocating for First Nations interests as necessary . <h> Traditional Foods <p> First Nations peoples have a cultural , traditional and social connection to the land and many communities continue to rely on traditional food for their socio-cultural , economic , and physical well-being . However , there is increasing concern about environmental contaminants , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations and the ESU have a special interest in preserving and protecting the environment to provide a healthy future for generations to come . <p> Traditional food systems and a way of life are being threatened by numerous outside impacts including climate change , degradation of plant and animal habitats and widespread environmental contamination . <p> Preservation of First Nations traditional lifestyles , cultures and health ( physical , mental , spiritual and emotional ) depends on the persistence of country foods in First Nations traditional territories . <p> Loss of access to traditional foods ( through contamination , at-risk populations , extirpations or extinctions ) translates into a loss of food security , as these foods are the culturally acceptable staples of First Nations diets . <p> Loss of access to traditional foods must be remediated by provision of access to safe , affordable and culturally acceptable alternative food choices and through environmental stewardship action aimed at restoring endangered plant and animal populations and minimizing exposure to environmental contaminants , as well as managing the risks associated with consumption of traditional foods . <p> Loss of traditional food sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traditional country foods . Research and action aimed at guaranteeing the ongoing health of traditional food sources is essential for First Nation communities and personal health and well-being . <h> First Nations Food , Nutrition and Environment Study <p> The First Nations Food , Nutrition and Environment Study ( FNFNES ) documents traditional and market food consumption ; estimates exposure to contaminants and intake of nutrients of concern across communities ; documents self-reported health status and lifestyle habits across communities ; and documents food related needs and concerns will help to support development of sound food consumption practices . The FNFNES studies statistically relevant data on levels of contaminants in traditional foods for all regions and ecozones of the country . The study collects baseline data on the presence of pharmaceutical products in surface water , and will determine the body burden of mercury through hair sample analysis . This study will potentially aid future decisions made on the national , provincial and municipal government levels . <p> This study is national in scope and will provide important information about contaminants . <p> Resolution 30/2007 , First Nations Food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly , supports a research study on traditional food safety and First Nations health . <p> This research is a collaborative effort between the AFN , the University of Northern British Columbia and the University of Montreal . The project is funded by Health Canada who has also contributed in-kind expertise and resources . <p> The goals of this research include : addressing the environmental concerns of First Nations regarding the safety and security of their traditional food sources . <p> Information obtained from this project will help develop plans for protecting traditional food systems and promoting well-being and healthy lifestyles . <p> This is a 10-year national study to be implemented in 100 First Nations communities across Canada . It is currently in its fourth year of implementation . <p> The first Regional Report , Results from British Columbia was released on March 3 , 2011 at the First Nations Summit in Vancouver , BC . <p> The results for BC indicate that traditional foods are safe to eat and BC First Nations are healthier when they eat traditional foods but serious problems remain with excess body weight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall satisfactory , but continued close monitoring is needed . Mercury exposure is not a health concern . <p> For more information about the First Nations Food , Nutrition and Environment Study please visit the official website:http : //fnfnes.ca/ <h> &gt;Traditional Knowledge , Innovations and Cultural Expressions <p> The protection of Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge ( ATK ) is of the utmost importance to the AFN . First Nations have countless layers of intricate traditional knowledge , much of which is unique to each group . ATK is passed along from person to person and it is rich in innovation , grounded in First Nation science , and is based on hundreds of years of observation . Current intellectual property laws have created the conditions in which ATK is misused , misappropriated and stolen by outsiders , researchers , companies , and others . The ESU is involved in a number initiatives , both domestically and internationally , that seeks to reform intellectual property laws to make them conform to customary systems of ownership . The ESU seeks changes in the international regimes to ensure ATK continues to provide a framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge to the youth and future generations . <h> Waste <p> Historically , waste presented little difficulty for First Nations as they relied on natural materials that were easily disposed of and naturally recycled back into the environment . The nature of waste has changed significantly , however , and now presents many challenges in some First Nations communities . Inadequate long-term and short-term funding to operate well-managed landfill sites and transfer stations poses considerable risks in some First Nations communities . <p> There are many considerations and challenges that present themselves to First Nation communities when dealing with waste disposal , these include : water contamination , poor air quality , and insufficient capacity . <p> Awareness building within communities is needed to curb the continued creation of large amounts of waste . Changing the way that we think about waste is a step towards reducing it . <p> Establishing composting and recycling programs can minimize the amount of waste in landfills , resulting in healthier environments for communities . <p> A well managed landfill is critical to protecting the community from exposure to toxic chemicals . The development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help to reduce environmental and health risks to the community and Mother Earth . <p> Limited funding is available from Indian and Northern Affairs Canada ( INAC ) through the First Nation Infrastructure Fund . In order to access these funds , First Nations communities are required to submit an application form , including their project proposal by September of each year , from 2007 to 2011 . <p> The First Nations Environmental Health Innovation Network ( FNEHIN ) is a national network that aims to link First Nations communities and organisations with practical environmental health information , tools and environmental health researchers . The ultimate goal of FNEHIN is to assist First Nations in identifying , researching and solving Environmental Health problems by providing relevant information and supporting partnerships in a network approach that builds capacity , strengthens institutions and promotes self-reliance.

" <p> As reported by Health Canada in 2011 , First Nation communities participating in a national survey between 2008-2010 , reported that alcohol and drug use and abuse was considered to be the number one challenge for community wellness faced by on-reserve communities ( 82.6% of respondents ) , followed by housing ( 70.7% ) and employment ( 65.9% ) . The same report cited a growing population of First Nation people who identify their psychological pain or trauma and associated prescription drug use as being linked to their experience in residential schools and child welfare . <p> The national strategy will be available on the CCSA website at www.ccsa.ca. 195421 @qwx1055421

There are thousands of stories about children being taken from their families and forced to deny their culture and language . Many of them were physically and sexually abused . This is a veritable tragedy and a blot on Canada 's history . <p> Will the Prime Minister seize this opportunity and finally answer the call of our first nations ? <p> Mr. Speaker , the record will show that in 2008 , on behalf of all Canadians , the Prime Minister apologized to all survivors , their families and the communities affected by this dark chapter in Canadian history . <p> We know that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada is finishing its work this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue supporting reconciliation . <p> Mr. Speaker , Commissioner Murray Sinclair was clear : " ... it takes more than words . In addition to the apology , there has to be atonement and there has to be action " . <p> First nations have been dismayed by the government 's failure to embrace reconciliation . The Truth and Reconciliation Commission had to go to court to get key documents released . Victims have been denied compensation or treated with suspicion and hostility . <p> Will the government change its attitude and work with first nations to achieve reconciliation ? <p> Mr. Speaker , when the Prime Minister made an historic apology on behalf of all Canadians in 2008 , the government recognized that the Indian residential schools caused great harm and had no place in Canada . <p> While we can not undo the past , we can learn from it , and we are taking steps necessary to bring closure to the legacy of the Indian residential schools . <p> We encourage all Canadians to continue promoting reconciliation between aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians . <p> Mr. Speaker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has changed for indigenous people . The legacy of residential schools is still present today in high rates of poverty and unemployment , in the high number of children in foster care , and the unacceptably high number of missing and murdered indigenous women . <p> If the government is serious about reconciliation , it will have to do a lot more to show it . <p> Will the government commit to honouring the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission ? <p> Mr. Speaker , we welcome the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission , and we thank the commissioners for their hard work in uncovering and documenting the truth about residential schools in Canada . <p> We look forward to receiving a full report to be able to fully understand and respond to the recommendations . <p> Mr. Speaker , the government 's record following the apology does not give a lot of hope .

The government will continue to fulfill its obligations as set out in the agreement . <p> Mr. Speaker , the government must take this opportunity to take a serious look at its chronic failure to act . <p> Some 20 years after the last residential school closed , education programs for first nations children are receiving less money than those for other children . The same goes for health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are constantly being treated as second-class citizens . <p> Will the government ever do something to ensure that every child has the same chance for success ? <p> Mr. Speaker , tomorrow the Truth and Reconciliation Commission will release the long-anticipated report of its important work . Canadians will learn a great deal about the truth of this dark chapter in Canadian history . However , essential work lies ahead in order to achieve genuine reconciliation . <p> Would the government commit to following up on the symbolism of the apology with concrete actions to facilitate real healing for the survivors and their families , and to engaging all Canadians in the real work of reconciliation ? <p> Mr. Speaker , as I indicated earlier , we welcome the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission . We thank the commissioners and the survivors who came forward to tell their stories because it was time that all Canadians know the truth about that sad legacy of Canada . <p> The government remains committed to working with first nations , all aboriginal peoples across Canada , to address the challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of that history .

This will be achieved by acknowledging , learning from and addressing past wrongs , being responsive to aboriginal peoples ' expressed needs and priorities , actively engaging Canadians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboriginal peoples and cultures to Canadian society . <p> The stained glass window installed in the Centre Block of Parliament is a poignant reminder of the true meaning of reconciliation , not only for the members of Parliament who enter through the door above which it sits , but for all Canadians . <p> I am confident that we will be able to continue healing as a nation , building on the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission . It is in this spirit that Canada pledges that it will continue its efforts to advance reconciliation . <p> Mr. Speaker , meegwetch . As I always do when I rise in this House , in this august place , I want to first acknowledge that this House sits on unceded , unsurrendered Algonquin territory of the Anishnabeg . In fact , in the spirit of true reconciliation , we should consider making that acknowledgement the norm whenever we rise in this House . <p> Allow me to thank the minister for his statement today and , with equal importance , express my gratitude to the minister for his participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As a survivor of the residential school system , I especially want to acknowledge and welcome to Ottawa the many fellow survivors who will be in town this week along with their families and friends . I pay homage to my fellow survivors . Very few Canadians realize that since our days in residential school , the TRC events for many of us are the only moments we get together again or the only moments we see one another again to share our stories , to say something that many members may take for granted : we are still here ; we made it . <p> Members will have guessed that as a survivor it is with great anticipation that I await the release of the commission 's report tomorrow , and I want to take this opportunity to thank Justice Sinclair , Commissioner Wilson and Commissioner Littlechild for their hard work and commitment to this cause . <p> After the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples almost 20 years ago , our common history will provide us with yet another moment to restore harmony among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow is that moment . Let us pause for a moment tomorrow and reflect on the way forward . History will have given us yet another occasion . Canadians want change . Canadians want us to seize the moment . Change and reconciliation go together . <p> As a survivor , I can appreciate the fundamental importance of the moment we are about to experience tomorrow . Let us all collectively seize it , and collectively commit to genuine change in our relations with the first peoples of this country . Let us set out to do what 148 years of successive governments have not managed to achieve , and that is reconciliation . <p> Reconciliation is about healing relationships , building trust and working out our differences . It is about redress and respect for the rights of all . Reconciliation means a meaningful commitment to change , to honesty , and engaging and reconceptualizing relationships to create a future of peace , a future of justice and a future of renewed hope for all of us . I suggest that it is not possible to conceive of reconciliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society have been honestly willing to engage in a dialogue to obtain truth , dignity and , above all , reconciliation . <p> ( 1520 ) <p> Today , and into our shared future , we must continue the difficult work of building honourable relations , a fair society and a real dialogue to which the justice and the commissioners have invited us . <p> The adoption of the TRC report , important though it is , would not in itself change the everyday lives of women , men and children whose experiences it honours and gives witness to . No . For this , we need the political and constitutional commitment of not only the governments but the support and goodwill of the public , of all Canadians , to create and implement substantial and meaningful changes in co-operation , in partnership , with indigenous peoples themselves . We are all in this together . <p> Change is what Canadians want , and it happens that , along with my colleagues , I have come here to do exactly that : to bring that change . <p> Mr. Speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we must always acknowledge when we speak in the House that we are speaking on the unceded and unsurrendered territory of the Algonquin people . <p> It is an honour to speak here on the eve of the release of the much-anticipated report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission . It is important to reflect upon the broader intent of the apology which created it , to create healing and reconciliation and build a renewed relationship on a foundation of trust and partnership . These aspirations were reflected in the words of the apology , but have sadly found no expression in the ongoing paternalistic policies of the government . <p> After the Prime Minister stood in the House in 2008 and delivered the residential school apology on behalf of all Canadians , there was a groundswell of goodwill from aboriginal people from coast to coast to coast . On that day , the Prime Minister did the right thing and should be credited for that important step toward reconciliation . However , there was a disappointing lack of follow-up after that seminal milestone but still a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2012 Crown-First Nations Gathering . <p> Unfortunately , and sadly , his actions and those of his government since that important symbolic gesture have failed to live up to the hopeful spirit of the apology . In fact , far from supporting the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and its important work , it was disappointing that the government withheld crucial documents and actually fought the commission in court to obstruct its progress . Further , I am saddened that the antagonistic approach of the government toward aboriginal people , and its refusal to deal with appalling gaps in outcomes and deplorable living conditions for far too many , has further eroded the already fragile trust of aboriginal people . <p> Put simply , the government has damaged the honour of the Crown and squandered the tremendous opportunity of apology to foster more positive relationships with first nations , Inuit , and MTtis communities . Canada needs a new nation-to-nation relationship with aboriginal communities based on the spirit of partnership , respect , and co-operation for mutual benefit . These were the principles at the core of our original relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It will be essential to educate and work with all Canadians to understand the truth about the historic and ongoing pain , achieve true reconciliation , and move toward a future based upon the realization of the original , respectful , and collaborative nation-to-nation partnership with all aboriginal communities . Honouring and reinforcing the spirit and intent of that original relationship , while recognizing and implementing the rights that flow from it , are not only the responsibility of elected politicians but of every Canadian . <p> The apology means nothing if Canadians do not understand why it was necessary and do not understand the devastating multi-generational impacts that colonization and specifically the residential school system have had on aboriginal peoples . Tomorrow , the TRC report will be an important step in establishing the truth of what happened , but we must all commit to carrying on the important work of reconciliation going forward . <p> We thank Commissioners Sinclair , Wilson , and Littlechild for their painstaking and heart-wrenching work . The release of this report will represent another seminal opportunity for the Government of Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apology . Meaningful reconciliation will not come until we live up to our past promises and ensure the equality of opportunity necessary to create a prosperous shared future . <p> It is time to rebuild our relationship with first nations , Inuit , and MTtis in Canada on a foundation of inherent and treaty rights . It is important that we ensure we have the healing for the survivors and their families and begin that process of reconciliation as a responsibility of all Canadians . It is rooted in the principles of the United Nations Declarations on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . <p> ( 1530 ) <p> The minister mentioned the stained glass window installed in the Centre Block as a poignant reminder of the true meaning of reconciliation , not only for members of Parliament but for all Canadians . I believe that will not be enough . May all MPs , as they enter this building under artist Christi Belcourt 's beautiful stained glass window commemorating the 2008 apology , be reminded every day of each of our responsibilities . May they be reminded of our responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that indigenous and non-indigenous people in Canada can go forward in a good way , in the words of the commission , " For the child taken , for the parent left behind " . <p> In closing , I would like to thank the minister for walking with us yesterday in the Walk for Reconciliation , and for being there at the opening of the commission hearings this morning . However , I have to ask the minister why he has chosen to make a statement of reconciliation before the commission report is released . <p> Canadians expect the Prime Minister of Canada to respond in a timely manner to the recommendations in that report with concrete action . <h> Aboriginal Affairs <p> Mr. Speaker , today 's release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission 's recommendations is the culmination of a six-year journey of healing , but that journey must not end today . <p> We now know the truth about a dark chapter in our history . It is time for all governments , civil society , and every Canadian to commit to carrying on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal government to initiate this sustained action by making a commitment to implement all of the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada . <p> English <p> It is time to fundamentally restructure Canada 's relationship with aboriginal peoples , in the spirit of respect , trust , and partnership , and rooted in the principles of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . As Gitxsan chief Ray Jones said to me this morning : <p> Member spoke in Gitxsanimaax and provided the following translation : <p> The canoe must be uprighted . <h> Aboriginal Affairs <p> Mr. Speaker , it is my honour to rise today representing the riding of ParkdaleHigh Park , the traditional territory of the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation . My riding also includes the ancient first nations ' site of the Toronto Carrying Place Trail , a portage route connecting Lake Simcoe and Lake Ontario along the east bank of the Humber River . The trail was used for nearly a thousand years as an important trade route for first nations . In 1615 , 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route . <p> Today is a historic day , with the release of the final report from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission . We thank all those whose emotional testimony made this report possible . We need to respond with a serious commitment to reconciliation . On this 400th anniversary , it is a chance to build a renewed relationship based on respect and equality . <p> Mr. Speaker , I would like to acknowledge that we are on an unceded Algonquin territory . <p> Today , the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Canada 's Indian residential schools issued its final report . The documentation is of a tragedy , a cultural policy of assimilation carried out by the Canadian government and institutions that stole children and childhoods , devastated communities and destroyed lives . Over 6,000 students died while in residential schools . <p> Translation <p> More than 150,000 aboriginal children were sent to residential schools , and the intergenerational traumas persist : poverty , health problems and addiction . <p> It is time for the government to be part of the solution . <p> English <p> As Commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a Canadian problem " . <p> This is a tragedy that spans generations . We must honour it through action . It is time for true reconciliation . <h> Aboriginal Affairs <p> Mr. Speaker , I would like to acknowledge that we are on unceded Algonquin territory . <p> My colleague , the member of Parliament for **29;925;TOOLONG , presented a bill to fully implement the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples , a United Nations document that my colleague actually helped draft . The Prime Minister and all Conservatives voted against it . <p> In light of today 's report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission , is the Prime Minister willing to vote to implement the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples ? <p> Mr. Speaker , I would point out that Canada is one of the very few countries in the world where aboriginal treaty rights are fully recognized in our Constitution . That is one of the reasons why the government accepted the UN declaration as an aspirational document . <p> We have taken specific actions to enhance the rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all aboriginal people , under the Canadian Human Rights Act . Sadly , the NDP and the opposition parties voted against it . I hope they will reconsider some of those positions . <p> Mr. Speaker , our government signed the residential schools agreement and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada . <p> Our government has implemented many initiatives to improve the lives of first nations in this country , and our government will keep working with aboriginal communities and individuals to improve the lives of aboriginal people . <p> Mr. Speaker , I addressed these issues some seven years ago in the House of Commons when I spoke about the devastation caused by a policy of Indian residential schools . This was a policy of forced assimilation that not only destroyed the lives of individuals but of entire families and societies , and it has had long-lasting implications on entire communities in our country . <p> That is why we have moved forward with the apology and why this government has taken multiple actions over the years to improve the lives of aboriginal Canadians . We continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken . The NDP members have voted against every single one of them . I would encourage them to start to do something positive on this . <p> Mr. Speaker , our government has taken action on many fronts to improve the lives of aboriginal people . <p> English <p> I would just mention that in the most recent budget we put in place funding for training first nations people for available jobs , and new opportunities for economic development through the first nations land management regime . Vast amounts of money are being made available for further progress and reform on first nations education , including more post-secondary scholarships and opportunities . There are also some health investments , particularly in mental health , on reserves . These are concrete things . <p> I would encourage the NDP , rather than opposing them all , to actually support some of these initiatives . <p> Mr. Speaker , this government arrived at an historic agreement with the Assembly of First Nations to do just that , to make investments to modernize the education system so first nations children would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadians . The NDP fought that tooth and nail . <p> We will continue to move forward with investments and continue to move forward with willing partners , because it is important that first nations children have those opportunities . <p> Mr. Speaker , the Truth and Reconciliation Commission asks for meaningful actions to address residential schools ' legacy of cultural genocide and the ongoing impacts on first nations , on the MTtis nation and on Inuit communities . Canada has not yet taken these actions , and so reconciliation remains elusive . <p> Will the Prime Minister match the sincere apology he made seven years ago with a commitment to real action , nation to nation , on reconciliation ? <p> Mr. Speaker , once again , it was this government that for the first time in Canadian history recognized the full extent of the damage done by residential schools , not just the destruction of communities and families , and the abuse but also the loss of life in many cases . <p> That is why we issued the historic apology . That is why we signed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have moved forward with various initiatives in every single budget , every single year , on a series of things to improve the lives of aboriginal Canadians . <p> I encourage the Liberal Party to actually support some of those rather than just give us rhetoric . <p> Mr. Speaker , the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has clearly said that we can no longer simply talk about reconciliation ; the time has come to act . The commission has made 94 recommendations for beginning the process of reconciliation and rebuilding our relationship with first nations , Inuit , and Metis peoples . <p> The Liberal Party of Canada accepts these 94 recommendations and commits today to implementing them . Will the Prime Minister do the same ? <p> Mr. Speaker , the government will begin by examining the report and the commission 's recommendations before deciding what the next steps should be . <p> We have been following through on specific measures in this area for quite some time . In the most recent budget , we addressed employment , economic development , education and health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific initiatives to help aboriginal people . I encourage the Liberals to change tactics . <p> Mr. Speaker , the commission issued 94 recommendations to advance the process to close the quality of life gaps that exist , to revitalize indigenous languages and cultures , and to restore the original respectful relationship with first nations , MTtis nation and Inuit peoples . <p> The Liberal Party , today , accepts and commits to implement these recommendations . Will the Prime Minister stand in this place and do the same ? <p> Mr. Speaker , I am not sure there ever was an original relationship that , quite frankly , was as satisfactory as the hon. leader of the Liberal Party would like to say . <p> What I would say is that obviously the commission has spent a long time on this report , a commission established by this government . It has issued a large number of recommendations . We are still awaiting the full report . The government will examine all of these and , obviously , read them before deciding what the appropriate next steps are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from survivors and from the commission . Reconciliation is more than just words ; it is also meaningful action . We need to start fresh , nation to nation , with a new approach . <p> It is in this spirit that I want to reach out to the members across the aisle and I ask the Prime Minister whether he will implement the principles set out in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . <p> Mr. Speaker , we thank the commission for its work . As was said , Canada is one of the only countries in the world where aboriginal and treaty rights are entrenched in the Constitution . We have endorsed the United Nations declaration as an aspirational document and as a significant step forward in strengthening relations with aboriginal peoples . <p> We will continue to take concrete measures to improve the living conditions of aboriginal peoples . <p> Mr. Speaker , our government remains committed to a fair and lasting resolution to the legacy of the Indian residential schools . As acknowledged in the Prime Minister 's historic apology on behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Canada for the attitudes that inspired the Indian residential school system to ever prevail again . <p> We continue to make significant investments in aboriginal education . Economic action plan 2015 committed substantial funding for education on reserve and built upon a $500-million investment announced by the Prime Minister . We will continue to work with first nations parents , teachers , and schools to improve the quality of education on reserve . <p> Mr. Speaker , today we heard the testaments of survivors who want the commission 's final report to finally be a step towards reconciliation and towards healing . Concrete recommendations have been made , and one of them calls for a national inquiry into murdered and missing aboriginal women . However , the minister prefers to sit back and do nothing . <p> My question is therefore for the Prime Minister : will he show some leadership and call a national inquiry ? <p> Mr. Speaker , these were terrible crimes against innocent people . The RCMP said in its own study that the vast majority of these cases are addressed and are solved through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , as I have mentioned before , as some 40 studies have already been done . What we need is a place to catch those responsible and ensure that they are punished . What we need now is action , action like what our government has taken on matrimonial property rights , the creation of safety plans , or making sure that there are shelters available for women on reserves . <p> Mr. Speaker , reconciliation , as we heard today , includes an national inquiry into missing and murdered women . <p> Let us move to housing . One third of first nations in Manitoba live in inadequate housing conditions . I have seen them first hand in our north : families in overcrowded houses , houses in deep need of repair , homes infected with black mould . <p> As national Chief Bellegarde said , how can we expect reconciliation when people live in these conditions ? Will the government finally listen to first nations and act on addressing the deplorable housing conditions in first nations in the spirit of reconciliation ? <p> Mr. Speaker , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in providing safe housing . Since 2006 , our government 's investments for on-reserve housing have resulted in the construction of close to 12,000 new homes and the renovation of nearly 22,000 existing homes in first nations communities . <p> While we continue to work in collaboration to improve first nations ' quality of life and infrastructure on reserve , the opposition has voted against all of our aboriginal housing investments , all of our infrastructure investments on reserve , and everything we have done to improve the lives of people living on first nations reserves . <p> Mr. Speaker , the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has called on the government to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . Justice Murray Sinclair has described it as " the starting point for reconciliation " , but the Conservative government has steadfastly refused to implement the declaration , has voted against our bill , and has spent hundreds of millions of dollars fighting aboriginal rights in court . <p> Will the government listen to the commission , and will it finally implement the United Nations declaration ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada is one of the only countries in the world where aboriginal rights are protected under the Constitution . We have endorsed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as an aspirational document in strengthening the relationship between aboriginal Canadians and the government . <p> We will continue to take concrete measures , and we would ask that the opposition support our concrete measures to bring things like the same rights for women living on reserve , to bring the same water and waste water standards that other Canadians expect , and to bring the Canadian Human Rights Act on reserve . All of these things we have done , the opposition has opposed . It should get on board . <p> Mr. Speaker , for too long first nations waited for redress for the injustices they suffered at Canada 's residential schools . Students were forced to live in inhumane conditions , and many experienced abuse . Tragically , thousands never returned home . Today , survivors face social , psychological , and health barriers to overcoming the trauma . Yet too many first nation communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will the government finally close the gap in first nations ' health outcomes and guarantee that survivors can access the medical care they require and so desperately need ? <p> Mr. Speaker , our government is very proud of the relationship Health Canada has with first nations . It has provided over $2.5 billion a year in health care on first nations reserves . In fact , we support $200-million worth of mental health services on reserve , and I am very proud to see in the latest budget a new investment in mental health task crisis teams that can go onto first nation reserves to support them at crisis times . <p> Mr. Speaker , we need to bring the sad residential school legacy to an end . Far too many children were subject to heinous acts of abuse . More than 6,000 of them did not survive . Today , the survivors still suffer the effects of a stolen childhood . They suffer from health problems that also affect their families . They need help and support . <p> We have a moral obligation to provide that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboriginal healing centres ? <p> Again , Mr. Speaker , we are providing primary care , and most importantly , I think , mental health services on first nation reserves for families and children who require it . We have 24/7 access to essential nursing services in almost 80 remote communities across Canada , and we have home and community care in almost 500 first nation communities across Canada . <p> As I said , we have a very good relationship with first nations , especially when it comes to mental health services . <p> Mr. Speaker , this is the legacy of the residential schools : more than 150,000 children forced to abandon their culture and their language ; thousands of cases of abuse , humiliation and heinous acts ; mothers and fathers who never saw their children again after they were taken from their arms ; more than 6,000 children deada mortality rate similar to that of the Second World War ; and intergenerational trauma that is still present today . <p> We have a moral obligation to take action . Will the government finally show some leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we certainly thank the residential school survivors for their strength and courage in sharing their stories with the commission and with all Canadians . Our government remains committed to a fair and lasting resolution to the legacy of Indian residential schools . <p> As acknowledged in the Prime Minister 's historic apology on behalf of all Canadians in 2008 , there is no place in Canada for the attitudes that inspired the Indian residential school system to ever prevail again . Our government will continue to move forward in the spirit of reconciliation and to take concrete measures to improve the living conditions of aboriginal people . <p> Mr. Speaker , the House apologized to the generation of the residential school survivors , but who will make it right for this generation ? We have schools that are crippled by the 2% funding cap , children scooped from their families into a broken child welfare system , a minister who refuses to provide support to fight youth suicide and then blamed their parents . <p> Children have only one childhood . It is a resource too precious to be squandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding gap . In the spirit of reconciliation , will it address the education crisis today and make it right for this generation of indigenous children ? <p> Our government remains committed to a fair and lasting resolution to the legacy of Indian residential schools , and as acknowledged in the Prime Minister 's historic apology on behalf of all Canadians in 2008 , there is no place for the attitudes that led to the Indian residential school system . We will continue to make significant investments in aboriginal education . In the last budget , $200 million more was committed to aboriginal education . The Prime Minister committed $500 million to first nations ' schooling infrastructure , and we will continue to work with first nation parents , teachers , schools , and leaders to improve the quality of education on reserve . <h> Aboriginal Affairs <p> Mr. Speaker , after six years of work , the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada released its report and recommendations this morning . The report contains 94 recommendations , some of which the government can implement immediately . <p> When will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rights of Indigenous Peoples , and when will it work with aboriginal groups to develop and implement a first nations education funding plan , as outlined in the Bloc QuTbTcois 's Bill C-599 in 2010 ? <p> Mr. Speaker , again , we would like to thank the residential school survivors for sharing their stories , and the commission for its work to bring this to the attention of all Canadians . <p> As acknowledged in the Prime Minister 's historic apology in 2008 , the attitude that gave rise to the Indian residential schools was unacceptable and has no place in Canada . We will continue to move forward in the spirit of reconciliation , and take concrete measures to improve the lives of aboriginal people . <h> National Institutional Abuse Awareness Day Act <p> He said : Mr. Speaker , I rise today in the House to table a private member 's bill calling on the Government of Canada to establish a national day of awareness for people who have been abused by clergy , lay officials , and institutions in Canada . <p> A national day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By shining a light on the abuse , promoting awareness and education , decreasing stigma , and addressing the harm that has occurred through clergy , lay officials , and institutions as a whole , we can start to move forward . <p> This bill proposes that June 1 be set aside as the national day of awareness , because it is the beginning of the National Aboriginal History Month in Canada and the day the Roman Catholic Church in Newfoundland and Labrador closed Mount Cashel orphanage for good . <p> By setting aside a national day , Canadians can engage in their communities to work together to ensure that this never happens again . <p> I call on all members of the House to support this bill . <p> June 3 , 2015 <h> Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada <p> Mr. Speaker , I was astounded by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada 's report on residential schools . That dark time in history during which entire generations of aboriginal children were uprooted from their families and communities is a gaping wound in our relationship with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine point on what happened , clearly stating that it was cultural genocide , we have a duty to fundamentally alter our relationship with aboriginal peoples to help heal the wound . <p> Let us put an end to the federal government 's paternalistic attitude . Let us put an end to its condescension toward first nations , Inuit and MTtis people . Let us get rid of the Indian Act , an archaic law that upholds a regime that inspired others to create apartheid . <p> Let us give aboriginal peoples the tools they need to keep their languages and cultures alive and ensure the economic , social and environmental development of their communities . That is the least we can do . <h> Aboriginal Affairs <p> Mr. Speaker , it is important for us to acknowledge that we are on unceded Algonquin territory . <p> Yesterday , on this territory , the Truth and Reconciliation Commission issued its final report . <p> Translation <p> The testimony was clear : we need to put an end to previous governments ' inaction in order to move toward reconciliation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of chronic underfunding of education and a lack of access to quality health care , clean drinking water and housing . <p> In 2015 , it is high time we put an end to this cycle of poverty starting right now . That is what an NDP government will do . We will not forget the testimony given by the thousands of survivors . We will not forget the 6,000 or more children who never came home . <p> English <p> In the words of the commissioners , " Collective efforts from all peoples are necessary to revitalize the relationship between Aboriginal peoples and Canadian society reconciliation is the goal " . <h> Aboriginal Affairs <p> Mr. Speaker , yesterday , we heard a clear message from the survivors and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada : words are not enough . There also needs to be concrete action . <p> However , the Prime Minister is once again refusing to implement key recommendations , such as the recommendation to apply the principles set out in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move toward reconciliation ? <p> Mr. Speaker , we again thank the TRC for its work . We thank the former residential school students for the courage and strength they showed in sharing their stories with Canadians . <p> Canada is one of the only countries in the world where aboriginal and treaty rights are entrenched in its Constitution . We have endorsed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as an aspirational document , and a significant step forward in improving our relationship with aboriginal peoples . <p> We will continue to take concrete measures to improve the living conditions of aboriginal peoples . <p> Mr. Speaker , it is too bad the government lacks the courage and strength to act . <p> It said no to an inquiry on missing and murdered indigenous women . It passed legislation affecting aboriginal rights without any consultation . It voted against implementing the UN declaration . It has underfunded first nations education and social services . It has spent hundreds of millions of dollars fighting aboriginal and treaty rights . <p> Mr. Speaker , it was our government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on behalf of all Canadians , and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada . <p> It was this Prime Minister who made the historic apology to former students of Indian residential schools , their families and their communities . Our government has implemented many initiatives to improve the lives of first nations living in this country . <p> Our government will keep working with aboriginal communities and individuals to improve their lives . We would like the opposition to actually get on board and support those concrete measures that we have taken to improve the lives of aboriginal peoples . <p> Mr. Speaker , reconciliation is not just about what happened in the past , it is about what is still happening today . <p> Twenty years after the last residential school closed , the state of first nations education in Canada is a disgrace . There are too many first nations children who do not have a safe , quality school to attend in their local community . First nations students still receive an average of $8,000 less than students in the rest of Canada . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another generation suffers from these discriminatory education policies ? <p> Mr. Speaker , our government remains committed to a fair and lasting resolution to the legacy of Indian residential schools . <p> As acknowledged by the Prime Minister 's historic apology on behalf of all Canadians in 2008 , there is no place in Canada for the attitudes that inspired Indian residential schools to ever prevail again . <p> We continue to make significant investments in aboriginal education . Our recent budget committed substantial funding for education on reserve , and builds upon an investment of $500 million that was announced last year by the Prime Minister for first nations education infrastructure . <p> We will continue to work with first nations , parents , teachers , schools and leaders to improve the quality of first nations education on reserve . <p> Mr. Speaker , as I said , Canada is one of the only countries in the world where aboriginal and treaty rights are recognized in its Constitution . We have endorsed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . <p> We have also done more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to women . Women living on reserve were given the same rights as women living off reserve . We brought the Canadian Human Rights Act to bear on reserve . When we do that , the opposition always votes against it . <p> Mr. Speaker , reconciliation is about more than just words . It is also about taking concrete action . We need to start fresh , in a nation-to-nation relationship , and that is what the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples would allow us to do . However , the Prime Minister is still caught up in his ideology . <p> Why is he refusing to protect the fundamental rights of aboriginal peoples ? Why ? <p> Mr. Speaker , actions do speak louder than words . Every time we take action to improve the lives of first nation people , the NDP votes against it . <p> We have brought in matrimonial property rights for women living on reserve . We have brought in water and waste water standards , like all other Canadians expect , for Canadians living on reserve . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living on reserve . The NDP always votes against aboriginal Canadians whenever it is presented with the chance in the House . <p> Mr. Speaker , we do thank the truth and reconciliation commission and the commissioners for their work and salute the former residential school students who shared their stories with Canadians . We appreciate that being documented for all Canadians . <p> We will take the time to consider the recommendations in the light of the full report , which will be released at the end of this year , so we can carefully consider those . Unlike the Liberal Party , we believe that we need to take a close look at those recommendations and consider them in the light of the full report . <p> Mr. Speaker , the chair of the truth and reconciliation commission , Justice Sinclair , says the abhorrent system of residential schools was an exercise in cultural genocide . The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada agrees , as do previous prime ministers , and Canadians more generally . <p> However , judging by comments made by Judge Sinclair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government is not yet on the same page . <p> Would the government explicitly acknowledge the cultural genocide that has taken place and will it agree with the TRC 's recommendations ? <p> Mr. Speaker , when the Prime Minister made the historic apology on behalf of all Canadians in 2008 , the government recognized that the Indian residential schools caused great harms to individuals , to communities and to an entire society , and that the attitudes that gave way to that policy had no place in Canada . <p> While we can not undo the past , we can learn from it . We have taken the steps necessary to bring closure to the legacy of Indian residential schools . We will continue to promote reconciliation between aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians , and we will consider the recommendations of the report in the context of the full report , which will be released later this year . <p> Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present , in both official languages , the seventh report of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women , entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pursuant to Standing Order 109 , the committee requests that the government table a comprehensive response to this report . <p> Mr. Speaker , on behalf of the NDP , I stand to present the dissenting opinion on this report , calling on the government for a national action plan to end violence against women and for a national public inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women , <p> Witnesses strongly urge the government to take action to address the root causes of violence against women and the systemic inequality that perpetuates it . <p> New Democrats recognize that the causes of violence are complex and the solution needs to be comprehensive . Unfortunately , this report presented by the committee fails to address the urgent situation . <h> Northern Development <p> Mr. Speaker , the Conservative government has failed northerners when it comes to nutrition north . It has failed to provide affordable , nutritious food to northern remote families . The Auditor General clearly reported that the minister and his department failed to ensure that food subsidies were being passed along to northern residents who needed it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this crisis and why is food security in the north not a priority for Conservatives ? <p> Mr. Speaker , we have taken action . We have invested additional funds into nutrition north Canada . We have accepted the Auditor General 's recommendations . <p> However , we have changed the program from the old food mail program under the Liberal Party . We believe that nutritious , perishable foods that improve the health of northerners should be what we subsidize . Liberal members believe in subsidizing snowmobile parts , tires , cans of Coke and chips . We are focusing on healthy foods for the north and we are getting the job done . <h> Aboriginal Affairs <p> Mr. Speaker , as the national chief said , we can not move toward reconciliation when far too many aboriginal communities are living in desperate conditions . <p> Despite that , now we have learned that the Conservatives preferred to leave $1 billion just sitting there in the coffers of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs instead of funding essential services like education and access to clean water and housing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not true . Lapsed funding is not lost funding , and in the last five years , over 97% of what was marked as lapsed funding in the public accounts has been carried forward to future years and spent on a wide range of programs , programs that member and that party voted against . <p> The delay in spending of these funds is not uncommon , because actually spending this money often involves negotiations with other parties or community votes from first nations memberships . <p> We will continue to make concrete investments in aboriginal peoples , and we would like the opposition to actually get on board and support that . <p> Mr. Speaker , the question is this . How can these Conservatives look at themselves in the mirror every day when indigenous peoples live in this country in third world conditions , in mouldy homes and in schools that are falling apart , and without safe drinking water ? We find out that the Conservatives have lapsed $1.1 billion returned to their coffers , money that was allocated to them . How can they stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country this gross negligence ? <p> Mr. Speaker , of course that member knows that is not true . She knows that 97% of those lapsed funds were spent on aboriginal programming in the following year . She knows that it takes time to negotiate and get community votes for first nations spending . She also knows that she voted against water treatment plants in first nations reserves . She voted against matrimonial property rights for women on reserves . She voted against the Canadian human rights being brought onto reserve . <p> The New Democrats always vote against aboriginal people when they have the chance here in the House of Commons . <h> Aboriginal Affairs <p> Mr. Speaker , every year , the Conservative government intentionally underspends in excess of $200 million . This is now five years in a row that has taken place . <p> Every member of this chamber , I am sure , is aware of the many reserves that rely on boiling their water in order to have drinking water . Many reserves are on an advisory . Every member is aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Conservative government justify stealing over $200 million a year in the past five years when the needs are so great in Canada 's first nations <p> Mr. Speaker , of course , that member does know that lapsed funding is not money that has disappeared . In fact , 97% of that funding was carried forward to future years and spent on a wide range of programs . <p> Every time we spend money on aboriginal programming or aboriginal infrastructure in this House , whether it is for waste water treatment , water treatment , education , or to give women on reserve the same rights as women living off reserve , we can count on the Liberal Party to vote against it . <p> Highlights from the Senate <h> June 2 , 2015 <h> Truth and Reconciliation Commission <p> Hon. Lillian Eva Dyck : Honourable senators , this week the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is holding its final public event in Ottawa . Since 2010 , the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has heard testimony from about 7,000 survivors across the country about their horrific experiences in residential schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents and were placed in residential schools to " kill the Indian in the child . " Many experienced brutal physical , emotional and sexual abuse . Children were abused , beaten , subjected to unethical scientific experiments and even tortured with homemade electric chairs . It is estimated that about 6,000 children died and many were buried in unmarked graves . <p> From the 1880s until 1996 , when the last residential school closed in Saskatchewan , Aboriginal children were taught that they were inferior and punished for speaking their own native languages . The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada , Beverley McLachlin , has called this " cultural genocide " . This morning , Justice Sinclair said it was nothing short of " cultural genocide . " <p> Honourable senators , my mother , Eva McNab Quan , from the Gordon First Nation , attended residential schools . She never talked about it . With all the work that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has done , we now understand why Mum was so ashamed of being Indian , why she pretended to be Scottish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just Chinese . Residential school had taught her to be deeply ashamed of being an Indian . That shame was passed on to us and was reinforced by actions and attitudes of people around us . I express my deep gratitude to the late Elders Laura Wasacase and Emma Sand , who showed me how to be proud of my Cree Indian heritage . <p> Honourable senators , the effects of past government policies to kill the Indian in the child are still being seen today . The intergenerational legacy of residential schools is manifested by the high rates of family violence and addictions , the huge numbers of Aboriginal children in foster care , the over-representation of Aboriginals in jails and the hundreds of missing and murdered Aboriginal women . All of these can be traced back to the damage done by residential schools . <p> The Truth and Reconciliation Commission released the summary of its final report this morning . The truth and reconciliation final report may illuminate a dark and deeply disturbing past , but it will show us the way forward through the 94 recommendations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Indigenous People and initiating a national commission of inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls . Thank God for that . <p> My heartfelt thanks to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Chair , Justice Murray Sinclair , and Commissioners Chief Wilton Littlechild and Dr. Marie Wilson for their dedication and leadership in their groundbreaking work on Indian residential schools . Their speeches this morning were inspiring and stirred a lot of emotions . I felt deep sadness and also a great sense of relief . No one can deny the long lasting detrimental legacy of Indian residential schools on Aboriginal peoples . The truth can no longer be denied or ignored . Thank you . <p> Hon. Senators : Hear , hear . <h> June 3 , 2015 <h> Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development <h> Truth and Reconciliation Commission ReportGovernment 's Response <p> Hon. Sandra Lovelace Nicholas : Honourable senators , my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate . <p> As you know , the Prime Minister initially refused to offer an apology to First Nations . After much pressure , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has 94 recommendations . Will the government honour the 94 recommendations from the report , in particular the inquiry into missing and murdered Aboriginal women that was mentioned ? <p> Translation <p> Hon. Claude Carignan ( Leader of the Government ) : Our government recognizes that there have been dark chapters in the story of the Government of Canada 's relationship with First Nations . Unfortunately , we can not erase the past , but we can learn from it and ensure that these things never happen again . <p> As Prime Minister Harper said during the historic apology he made on behalf of all Canadians in 2008 , there is no place in Canada for the attitudes that inspired the Indian residential schools system to ever prevail again . <p> As for the recommendations , we will examine the report and the commission 's recommendations in order to decide what the next steps should be . <p> English <p> Senator Lovelace Nicholas : Does the government accept that this was a history of cultural genocide against the First Nations people of Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't erase the past . History has been marked by some dark chapters , and it is important to ensure that these kinds of extremely tragic events never happen again . That is why Prime Minister Harper made a historic apology to Canada 's Aboriginal peoples in 2008 . <p> English <p> Senator Lovelace Nicholas : Will the government ensure that the report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission be made available to all Canadians and , in particular , distributed to all Aboriginal schools and , in fact , all schools across Canada at the expense of the government ? <p> Translation <p> Senator Carignan : Senator , the government will examine the commission 's recommendations and pay particular attention to what the next steps should be . I invite you to consult the Prime Minister 's website , which just posted , a few minutes ago , a press release on the closing ceremony of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada , in which he thanks the commissioners for their hard work . You can have a look at the Prime Minister 's remarks in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary , I was hurt and disappointed that not all Aboriginal senators were invited to the closing of this historic ceremony . <p> Senator Cordy : Shame . <p> Translation <p> Senator Carignan : I 'm a little surprised by what you are saying . I was watching the ceremony earlier and I saw that Senator Dyck and Senator Watt were there . Senators who represent First Nations communities were also there . I am not aware of any reason why you were n't invited to attend , which is what I understood from your remark . However , as I was watching the ceremony on television , live from Rideau Hall , I saw Senator Dyck and Senator Watt . In fact , they were seated next to their Liberal Leader , Justin Trudeau . <p> English <p> Senator Lovelace Nicholas : Yes , this is all fine and good , but I did n't get an invitation . I do n't know how they got in there . Senator Sibbeston did not get an invitation , either , and I think that 's a shame . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how they got in either , if that was your question . One thing is certain : They were there . With regard to the report , it is public and can be consulted . <p> English <h> Public Safety <h> Murdered and Missing Aboriginal Women and Girls <p> Hon. Mobina S. B. Jaffer : Honourable senators , I was very touched by the way the Leader of the Government talked about the history , and that we are all responsible for the history and that we all have to work to make things better . <p> The issue of murdered and missing Aboriginal women is not history . I come from British Columbia and , sadly , this is a continuing issue . If we can learn anything from history , it 's that this pain is continuing . We have to stop it . Will the government now appoint a national inquiry ? <p> ( 1520 ) <p> Translation <p> Hon. Claude Carignan ( Leader of the Government ) : Over 40 studies have been conducted on this particular issue . As I have said numerous times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take action because people need concrete action , such as we are taking right now . <p> English <p> Senator Jaffer : I have a supplementary question . Leader , I agree things have to be done . I would appreciate knowing what the government is going to do to stop the murder and disappearance of Aboriginal women , especially in my province . <p> Translation <p> Senator Carignan : Senator , as I already said , we have taken strong and significant action on this issue . We introduced the Action Plan to Address Family Violence and Violent Crimes Against Aboriginal Women and Girls and the Family Violence Prevention Program . <p> Since coming to power , our government has passed 30 new criminal justice and public safety measures to protect Canadians , including tougher sentences for murder , sexual assault and kidnapping and mandatory prison sentences for the most serious crimes . We also passed historic legislation that gives Aboriginal women living on First Nations reserves the same matrimonial rights enjoyed by other Canadian women , including access to emergency protection orders in violent situations . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ensuring that hundreds of thousands of people living on First Nations reserves would have the same human rights protections enjoyed by other Canadians . <p> Senator , I believe that our government has taken concrete action and that it will continue to take measures to combat violence against Aboriginal women and girls .
