The more simple truths of the gospel , or the first principles of the oracles of God , such as repentance , saving faith , baptism , laying on of hands , the resurrection of the dead , the eternal judgment ( Hebrews 6:1-2 ) , belong to babes in Christ ; but those of full age are supposed to need stronger food . <p> In Hebrews 5:11 we learn that this apostle would have been glad to feed the Hebrews upon some of the strong meat found in the economy of grace , but that he could not , as they were dull of hearing . Allow me to quote this text from Conybeare and Howson : " Of whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since ye have grown dull in understanding .

You may hear some talk about having faith to remove mountains , but you will not understand ; or you may hear some talk of having faith that the meal in the barrel will not fail , but you will not understand . These Hebrew Christians had once been enlightened ; they had had a zeal and had been earnest ; they had keenly relished the strong meat ; but they had become dull of hearing , or as the Greek implies , " difficult to move .

Another brings out the thought that it is impossible for those who have become so dull and sluggish and seared over as to fall entirely away , to shake off the dead , stupifying power , and that only God can do it . Whatever may have been in the mind of the apostle , I feel like warning everyone that is enlightened , against becoming dull of hearing ; and if some of my readers are already stupid , may God help you to arouse and shake off the spell before you fall away . <p> Those who can feed only upon milk are " unskilful in the word of righteousness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in connection with the more solid foods , but milk alone is not sufficient for them .

Every time you obey a commandment or believe a promise , you become a little more like God . Suppose you are in very great need and you come humbly to God in prayer .

The Christian experience of others may not be absolute proof of this doctrine , nor that we may possess a like blessed experience ; but if it can be shown that such an experience and the possibility of all attaining to it is taught in the Bible , then we may confidently seek for the experience if we have not already attained it . <h> Hindrances to Belief in a Second Work of Grace <p> Before undertaking to set forth the teaching of the Scriptures on this important Bible doctrine , let us first consider some general facts relative to the doctrine and endeavor to remove any obstacles to a fair consideration of the subject . <p> Those who have doubts about a second cleansing often wrongly suppose that nearly all Christians believe that in regeneration they are saved from native depravity . But the truth is just the opposite . The belief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains in the regenerate believer . Nearly all Protestants believe this . This is held by the Episcopal Church ; by the Westminster creed , representing the various Presbyterian bodies ; it is held also by Methodists and Baptists . In fact , according to Dr. Miley , the theory of a complete deliverance from depravity in regeneration was new with Count Zinzendorf , the Moravian , in the eighteenth century . At present that theory is held only by some Pentecostal people and a few other small sects . Among those denominations who hold depravity in the regenerate have been numbered many devout Christians who are respected as great ministers , martyrs , and missionaries . Were these mistaken both as to the teaching of the Scriptures and the facts of their own experience of salvation ? Reason leads us to believe they were not mistaken in this . The point where many have erred is in supposing that this depravity in the regenerate believer can not be removed until death , whereas numbers of the more spiritual from their own religious brotherhoods have come to experience this second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine of depravity in believers is proof of it , but it does show the unreasonableness of questioning the doctrine on the ground that few hold it . <p> Another hindrance to the acceptance of the doctrine are the unwise attempts to support it by unsound argument and texts that do not apply to the subject . But it is unreasonable to reject a doctrine on this ground when other sound proofs of it can be given . In rejecting the unsound supports of it one should not make the mistake of rejecting the doctrine itself . Such would be as unreasonable as it would be to reject the idea of Gods existence simply because certain teachers of theism have attempted to prove it by what is known as the ontological argument , which many able thinkers consider no proof whatever of the existence of God . Is it not better to believe in the divine existence , sanctification , and every other Bible truth for which clear proofs exist than to get our eyes on the unsound supports of them to such an extent that we are hindered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal happiness ? <p> Another thing that seems to have prejudiced some very good people against sanctification is the fact that some professors of the experience have been known to live ungodly and disgraceful lives . It is regrettable that such persons do put a stumbling-block in the way of good peoples accepting this glorious truth . Yet it is not reasonable to give place to prejudice because of such persons . As well might one reject the teaching and reality of regeneration because many profess it and live sinful lives , though the Bible plainly teaches that " whosoever is born of God regeneration doth not commit sin . " * ( 1 John 3:9 ) We believe in regeneration because it is clearly set forth in the Bible , and many actually have the experience . May we not as reasonably accept sanctification on similar grounds in spite of false professors ! <p> Extreme claims as to what sanctification will do for one have also been a fruitful source of confusion concerning the doctrine . <p> Extravagant teaching that if one is sanctified he will not have certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did not get the results described , to doubt either their being sanctified personally or the possibility of anyones receiving a cleansing of the heart subsequent to conversion . It is unsound reasoning to decide that because sanctification is not exactly what someone has taught it to be it is therefore nothing . Wrong views of the nature of native depravity have led to some of these errors . <p> Another hindrance to some is that they suppose the doctrine of a second cleansing subsequent to conversion was new with John Wesley , and was not known to Christian theology prior to that time . But if a second work of grace is set forth in the New Testament , if it was taught by Jesus and by Paul , and the experience was enjoyed by the apostolic church , we have abundance of ground for accepting it regardless of its place or lack of place in the history of Christian doctrine . Likewise the doctrines of divine healing and the Holy Spirit organization of the church , though clearly taught in the Bible , were not formulated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by faith was never very clearly stated until Luther . The doctrines of the Trinity and of the twofold nature of Christ were not clearly set forth until the fourth century , when heretical teachings made a clear statement of these doctrines imperative . Like other doctrines that were lost in the apostasy and recovered at or after the Reformation , so sanctification was recovered in Wesleys day , when the occasion demanded a clear statement of the Bible teaching . The clear formulation of any phase of Christian doctrine usually takes place only when erroneous teaching and practice make such necessary . As Dr. Sheldon has said in his History of Christian Doctrine , " A system wrought out in conscious antagonism to a contrasted system naturally has sharper outlines than one developed apart from such antagonism .

But where is a doctrine that does not possess such difficulties ? Though there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties in rejecting it ? This question is worthy of consideration by those who question sanctification because of its difficulties . We do not reject other doctrines and facts because of unexplainable things connected with them . Many problems arise in connection with the proofs of theism or Christian evidence , but we accept the arguments we can understand in spite of those points that we can not understand . The doctrine of the Trinity , which lies at the center of all Christian doctrine , is generally accepted by Christians , yet it is not only difficult for thought , but it transcends reason . Still we accept it because of the unanswerable proofs of the doctrine that we can comprehend . Should we not be as reasonable in our consideration of the doctrine of sanctification ? Simply because our minds can not comprehend the vastness of limitless space , shall we refuse to use a measuring rule or to recognize the reality of space ? Or if we can not grasp the vastness of eternity , shall we deny the actuality of time and destroy our clocks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so than it is to refuse to believe facts that can be known about sanctification because some things about it are unknowable to us . <p> Others question sanctification because it is not discernible by the senses . This is a great fallacy . They overlook the fact that sanctification is a spiritual operation in the soul and does not have to do with the material , therefore can not be known by the senses . A thought is somewhat parallel to this in that it is a spiritual operation . But what is thought ? How is it effected ? We do not know ; psychologists can not tell . All they can know about it is the phenomena of it . So likewise it is not possible to explain exactly what sanctification is . We know in experience the phenomena of a depraved nature . After sanctification we know by experience the phenomena resulting from a pure heart . So also it is in the new birth . Jesus answered this objection hundreds of years of the Spirit .

The first we notice concerning his sons is , they were " sons of Belial " that is , they were worthless and profaneand they " knew not the LORD . " * ( 1 Samuel 2:12 ) They had no respect for their father , nor his office as the priest of God . They were idle , loose , and indolent . In some way their father had made the sad mistake that so many parents are making todaypermitting their sons to have their own way , and to rise up in rebellion against home government and law , to do what they please , to go where they please and when they please . And if the parent should say a word of opposition against them , there would be a storm of anger poured out upon them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defeated parents would be glad to keep still and let the young rebels have their way , rather than disturb the peace of the home by any further efforts to correct or restrain . <p> The sons of Eli were doubtless permitted to grow up in this manner . Their father was occupied with his duties in the office of priest much of the time , no doubt , and may have felt justified in the negligence of his family ; but God did not look at it in this manner . What the attitude of the mother of these sons was toward them , we have no knowledge . Whether she was tolerant toward their misbehavior and failed to fill the place of a true mother or not , this did not excuse the father from his responsibility , he had to answer before God for his neglect , and the sons with him had to suffer the penalty . <p> These sons were permitted to defile the sacred sacrifices of God , and the people were caused to abhor the true worship . The failure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their younger years compel them to respect and reverence the worship of God . It was his business as the very leader of worshipers to see that every man who brought his offerings and sacrifices to God did so in the most sacred and reverential manner , and above all it was his business to see that his own household set the example for the people to follow . Eli had the authority to execute every command of God , and see that order and sacred devotion were maintained in Israel . But he failed to do this . He permitted his boys to run loose and careless and bring disorder in the tabernacle of God . The very place and spot that was to be the most sacred on earth was desecrated in this manner . He certainly knew that this was wrong , but neglected to correct and instruct his children in these necessary things . They grew up in this improper manner , and thus brought upon themselves exposures to greater evils . <p> Being unrestrained and unpunished in their first offenses of defiling the offerings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , their father , the people of God , and themselves , and actually committed open adultery at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation . The same weakness and lack of parental management that Eli had before manifested , is strikingly noticeable now in his remonstrance with his sons in this abominable crime . He said unto them : " Why do ye such things ? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people . Nay , my sons ; for it is no good report that I hear : ye make the LORDS people to transgress. " * ( 1 Samuel 2:23-24 ) Of course , the boys did not care for such a plea . They were too far gone in debauchery and iniquity , and simply scorned such correction . It would take the most sensitive and conscientious person to be affected by such soft reproof as this . These calloused-hearted sinners cared nothing for it , and went right on in their wickedness . <p> We see parents today treat their children just as Eli did . They say : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ought not to smoke or chew or swear or dance or play cards and such things . It does not look well to see such things in our home . You know it is contrary to our principles to have such things going on , " etc . The proud , haughty young fellow just sneers at such entreaty , and goes ahead in his open disobedience and rebellion as long as he pleases to do so . Then when he pleases to go away from home and have his own way , he soon finds himself face to face with a violated law , inside some prison wall , or in some other way a reproach to his family , himself , and his country . <p> Had Eli brought down upon the backs of those boys the rod of correction when they first began their wicked deeds , or had he executed the penalty of disobedience upon them as he heard of their misconduct , he would have saved them and himself the sad results that followed .

This is the same soft-heartedness that Satan imposes upon many a parent today , and causes a sad neglect in the proper training of our rising generation ; and the result is a crop of worthless vagabonds , unfit for any responsible position in life , in the home , in the community , or in the nation . Who is to blame ? The parents who failed to instruct and correct their children from their infancy up to as long as they had shelter under the parental roof . <p> Listen how God charged Eli with kicking at His sacrifice and offering which He had commanded in Israel . Why was Eli charged with this ? Because he tolerated the evil in his sons . He was partaker of this evil in that he tolerated it .

Let us administer punishment and correction whenever and wherever it is needed , and hold our children under our perfect control as long as we are responsible for them , and keep them in the love and fear of God . We must answer for our children at the great day of reckoning , and we must fill our responsibility toward them for their earthly and eternal good .

God in His mercy means that we take heed and escape even a sorer punishment than this . Notice what the decree says : " For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knoweth ; because his sons made themselves vile , and he restrained them not . And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli , that the iniquity of Elis house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering forever .

Surely these are some of the things that were written for our admonition , and by being careful lest we let some of the precious truths on this subject slip , we can profit by the mistakes of those who have gone over this parental pathway before us . We can see by the Word of God what is required of us , and grasp our opportunities with a stronger determination that we will , by the grace of God , conquer every opposing power that is bent to overthrow the well-being of our loved ones whom God has entrusted to our care . <p> Let us take courage , dear fellow parents .

It is more difficult for some to have faith for the small things than for the great things . If you have but two pieces of meat , do not hesitate to give one piece to the needy .

A poor sister , who is rich in grace , desired to have a part in the matter . She began to ask the Lord to give to her that she might be able to give something to his good work . It was one dollar she was praying for . The Lord gave her in a marvelous way little by little until she had ninety-five cents . She then earnestly sought the Lord for the remaining five cents .

@@72205082 @905082/ <h> The Mind of Christ Retained Through Prayer <p> The Christian has the mind of Christ . The Scripture says , " Let this mind be in you , which was also in Christ Jesus " * ( Philippians 2:5 ) ; " But we have the mind of Christ . " * ( 1 Corinthians 2:16 ) These words contain a very deep thought . It is too deep for our finite mind to fathom . We can readily see , however , that it means to be humble-minded , meek , lowly , patient , longsuffering and loving , like Jesus . Yes , it means to have a disposition like His , but it means more . A deeper thought is that we have such a union with Jesus that we can think His thoughts . We are one body with Christ . " We are members of his body , of his flesh , and of his bones .

The glass is not so dark that we can see nothing of God . The Spirit of God reveals to us something of the scenes we shall see hereafter . We catch far-away glimpses of them , so to speak .

It was that light which shone around Saul on the road to Damascus . It was so bright that it blinded Saul .

Many others have seen this light . In this life we can see and know something of God and of the world beyond . <p> The mind of the Christian is in touch with the mind of the Lord . The minister who preaches under the anointing of the Holy Spirit is but expressing the mind of God . The thoughts of the Lord become his thoughts and he expresses them .

There was such a person in Nazareth . <p> The Bible does n't  say a whole lot about how she looked on the outside , but it says considerable about how she looked on the inside . Now I reckon that if you met Mary , down in this little place of Nazareth , over there in Galileea kind of backward area , it was so regardedIm sure you would have found her dress , her hair , her mannerisms , her way of speech , were all consistent with the condition of her heart .

If Mary had had that kind of pride in her heart , God would have been resisting her , not sending an angel to tell her those things . That 's pretty plain , is n't it ? I believe that God would like to do a lot of things with a lot of people in their lives , if they would just humble themselves and get into a position where He could speak to them .

Mary was the kind of person that was used to talking with the Lord and dealing with Him and inquiring in the things that were spiritual .

After a while the emotions die down and they began to think , " I did n't  realize all that was involved .

Her marriage ended up falling apart . <p> This sister that were reading about in the Bible todayI get the feeling that this was a girl that was used to giving serious , sober , reflections to things .

Oh , that 's way , way late ! <p> This girl had been getting ready for thisI do n't  know how long . I suspect a long while . And her immediate reaction of her thinking proves , does n't  it ?

" <h> be no end . " * ( Luke 1:29-33 ) <p> Now , this is like a bomb going off . Do you see ? Can you consider what it meant for this young woman to nod her head to this ? She did . And she suffered for it the rest of her life ! A reproach hung over her that was undeservedthe rest of her life . It nearly wrecked her relationship with her future husband . It was an awful trial for this young woman to have to face this . <p> When God chooses His trials to give to each of us , He knows what He s doing . I used to think that : Oh , here 's a trial , can I make it ? Will I fail ? That 's before I realized how carefully God measures them out .

The Lord knew that Mary , by His grace and help , could go through this . A lot of people could n't . He designed this for her . He sent His angel with this trial to her . And it was a sore trial .

For this to happen to Mary in this way , outside of human experience , was going to completely take away her good name . And it did . How can you explain such a thing ? Who would believe you ? The man that she was planning to marry ; he loved her and she loved him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his mind he was deeply disappointed in her . He was a kind man , the Bible says , " not willing to make her a public example , " ( which he could of done ) , so he was minded " to put her away privily , " * ( Matthew 1:19 ) that is , secretly . And he wouldve done it , too , except for one thing . The One who gave Mary this trial stepped into the picture . He appeared to Joseph in a dream and told him the truth . Joseph picked up his side of this trial . <p> All in all , by human reasoning , it does n't  look like an auspicious way for the Son of God to come into the world , does it ? With such a reproach hanging over it ; a reproach that was thrown at Him all His life . In the midst of one of the spiritual discussions in which He was telling others the truth and they were resisting it , they threw back this taunt in His face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " * ( John 8:41 ) This was a trial . This ranks up there in the major ones . <p> Let 's look at how this sister reacted to this : " Then said Mary unto the angel , How shall this be , seeing I know not a man ? " * ( Luke 1:34 ) I am pure ; I who was called barren . " * ( Luke 1:36 ) Isnt it wonderful how the Lord knows exactly how much we can bear and just what we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This may have proved too much for Marys strength , her trust in God , her long sufferingand the Lord had put with it another miraculous thing to stand by it . And that was that her cousin Elisabeth had conceived and was six months with child . At that time , pretty soon , what do we find ? Mary visiting Elisabeth and Elisabeth testifying to this . <p> See , amid all , what we do n't  have mentioned in the Bible : the rejection , the shame , the ridicule , the envy of others that was finally brought about : " Marys always been such a good girl , but see now . " All of those things that go with human life . She went over here and found her cousin , and it was just like the Lord had told her . And her cousin received her and believed the story she had to tell , and , indeed , she said the babe in her womb leaped for joy when she first heard her voice . All of these were what sustained this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was more : " For with God nothing shall be impossible . And Mary said , Behold the handmaid of the Lord . " * ( Luke 1:37-38 ) <p> Oh , there 's depths in this ! She did n't  just say , " Lord , you sent this angel and I guess I do n't  have anything to say about it , I am just stuck . " She did n't  just go on and doubt in her heart and say , " Well I guess well see if this will come true . " No , she accepted what the Lord had given her . " Behold the handmaid of the Lord . " <p> Now a handmaids position in life is a very humble position . Handmaids are those peopletheyre not the cleaning lady ; they 're not the cooktheyre the folks that are around to do whatever the mistress says to do . The handmaid gets pretty intimately involved . Its not that she does great , big tasks all the time ; its the little thingsIm here ; I 'm ready for service ; I 'm at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes about how this young woman walked with God . " Lord , I 'm yours ; I belong to you , my job is to just stay around you and do whatever you ask me to do at any given time . " <p> What a calling to be a handmaiden ! Little things , little errands , relatively unimportant things that the mistress could easily do for herself if she desired to . " Lord , I 'm your handmaid . You do n't  have to have me . " But God has handmaids , and Mary was one of them . <p> " Mary , I am calling on you to do this . " <p> " Behold the handmaid of the Lord . " <p> Oh , its a beautiful picture , is n't it ? Are you ready for service ? Can God just tap you on the shoulder and tell you , " I want you to do this today " ? Are you the Lords handmaid ? Mary was . <p> " Behold the handmaid of the Lord ; be it unto me according to thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord , I accept the trial . I accept the reproach of the trial .

And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were of many hearts may be revealed . " * ( Luke 2:25-35 ) <p> It was so , was n't it ? Do you see this same young woman , now getting older steadily ? She was a mother many times overJesus had brothers and sisters . She had a many-pierced heart . Long before it ever came to His public ministry , the prophecy of Simeon came true . This was a trial that went on and on and on and on .

There 's a coldness there . <p> And then we 've got some other folks , do n't  we ? We have people whose love for God is not hot . They cringe at the cross . They draw back from the trials . They shrink , and yet , its not that they do n't  love the Lord at alltheyre afraid . They cant bring themselves to say , " Lord , I want to serve You even if it costs me a great deal . " Theyre lukewarm . Not cold , not hot , but lukewarm . Staying enough true to God to keep from entirely dying in the soul , but not living with that " amen " in their heart and the " yes " to God that is so vital for Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . <p> The Lord knew that Mary would react to this thing the way that she did . When He sent Gabriel down there to talk to her , He knew the temperature of her love for Him in her heart . She wanted to serve the Lord ; she wanted to please Him . She wanted her life to count for God . And when He opened up His will to her , she staggered for a moment ; she did n't  know what to think ; she was troubled ; but when she began to realize that this was what God was calling her to do , there was in her a ready answer . She said from the very depths of her heart , " Behold the handmaid of the Lord ; be it unto me according to thy word . " <p> Here is heat . Here is hotness . Here is what 's necessary for you and me to please God and be used of Him . Do you love the Lord ? Do you love Him hotly todayor have you cooled off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gods blessing or do you want to do what you want to do ? How much are you stirred by the Lords love for you ? <p> Many say , " Lord , I am willing to serve You as long as its comfortable . " " Lord , I am willing to do it just as long as I get to have lots of things to enjoy . " <p> What if God has other plans for you ? How hot is your love for the Lord ? Are you interested ? Does it mean something to you , what God has for you ? Do you hunger to know what the Lord has for you ? <p> Behold the handmaid of the Lord . " I 've placed myself at Gods disposal . I am not setting out to design or do anything in life on my own . I am setting out to do just what the Lord wants me to do . " Gods handmaid , Gods servant ; that 's what I want . <p> This makes all the difference in the world . And when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and He knows who really loves Him and who does n't  ) when He does that , its according to what He said wert cold or hot . " * ( Revelation 3:15 ) <p> Do you get the message ? God would that were hot , but if we wont be hot , Hed rather have us cold , than to be in between . Many people do n't  think this . They have the idea that the Lord ought to be thankful for what He gets ; but , no , God is interested in us being either hot or cold . He wants us to go all the way or none at all . Lukewarmness brings a terrible reproach . God cant count on you . God can count on the folks that are hot in their love for Him , whatever He tells them to do , theyll do it . And , strangely enough , God can count on the people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . But what is the Lord going to do with people that are lukewarm ? He ca n't count on them to be saints . He ca n't count on them to be examples . He ca n't count on them to even take some ridicule for the kingdom of heavens sake . He ca n't count on them to be devoted to Him because they 're of a mixed mind . They 're looking out for their own interest sometimes , and for Gods interests sometimes too . Its in and out , all the time . He can never be sure that of my mouth . " * ( Revelation 3:15-16 ) Now this is a solemn scripture to think about , is n't it ? When I get down in my experience to where my love begins to cool off toward the Lord , and I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a degree , and other times I do n't  . When I get to that state in my mind and my heart , then the Lord begins to become very displeased with me . He seeks to stir us . <p> We have a story of a barren tree with which the gardener was working , and the master came and began to look at it and said , " Why should we let this tree stand ? Why cumbereth it the ground ? Its here inside the the vineyard , but its not bearing any fruit . " Then the gardener said , " Lord , let it alone this year also , till I shall dig about it , and dung it . " * ( Luke 13:8 ) Let 's see if we can stir the life in this tree , till somehow it begins to bear fruit . Let 's see if you will live for God , or if you will not . Now if you wo n't , then after awhile the Lord will take care of this . Hell get rid of you in your lukewarmness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come on you that will take you away . Hell spue you out . Youll be carried off by something . Its dangerous to be lukewarm . Its dangerous to be anything less than deeply in love with the Lord . <p> Mary was hot in her soul . She wanted what God wanted for her . I think it would be fair to say that Joseph was hot . When the Lord began to show him in his heart , what was involved in this matter , and he saw the truth of it , he , too , embraced the will of God . No lukewarmness in these folks , was there ? There was something there that glorified God . <p> Is your life glorifying the Lord ? Are you sending out a picture that shows Jesus to people ? Its quite possible to sit right in the same congregation with others that are hot in their experience , and to cool off on your own and grow lukewarm . <p> In Second Chronicles 25 , and starting in verse 1 , it says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reign , and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . And his mothers name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem . And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , but not with a perfect heart . " * ( 2 Chronicles 25:1-2 ) He went through the motions pretty well . " The Lord says were not supposed to have any idols around here , and we 've been careful not to have any idols . " But the things that lead to idolatry and the certain loves and the lack of diligence and love for God and His wayswell , those remained around , but he was real careful not to have any idols . His heart was not perfect . <p> When you 've been raised the way that you young people have been raised , its easy to become gospel-hardenedtheres devotions every morning , you 're encouraged in every way to live right and do right . To pick up the habit of acting like a holy person is not difficult at allyouve been well trained . But there 's one thing that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for God , and the temperature of that love . Whether you 're going to be hot and fervent in your soul is a determination you make between you and God . Youll be a child of God because you serve Him with all your heart and He accepts your service . There 's no other way .

It is beyond the price of exchange . <p> Most human beings do not value their soul as they should , but are instead incredibly careless . This neglect of the soul is beyond irresponsible , beyond criminal , beyond comprehension . It defies credulity . And so the souls of men become easy pickings for the enemy of mankind . And Satans appetite for human souls is insatiable . " Therefore hell hath enlarged herself , and opened her mouth without measure . " * ( Isaiah 5:14 ) <p> Once the human soul is created , it exists forever ( Psalms 22:26 ) . The human body waxes old and comes down to the grave , but the soul is not subject to aging . It is one of the things which is eternal . If the human soul is sinful , it can not enter heaven , for it would defile that holy place ( Revelation 21:27 ) . There is only one other placehell . There " their worm dieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Mark 9:44 ) This place is to be avoided at all costseven the cost of a hand , a foot , or an eye . Yet many make light of such a place , without realizing what they are saying or doing . <p> But it is not merely the careless souls that Satan seeks ; he wants them all . He revels in the challenge of ensnaring the wary , the conscientious . He is not daunted by men or women who have long walked with God ; he tempted the Son of God Himself when Jesus walked the earth in fashion as a man . Satan fashions the most ingenious snares for the human soul ; he offers the most enticing baits . <p> One of the most subtle of these traps is a feeling of helpless inadequacy . This disposition is commonly referred to in our day as an inferiority complex . The dictionary definition of this phrase is a persistent sense of inadequacy or a tendency to self-diminishment . At first glance , this appears as humility , a lack of pride , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to avoid the heavy and weighty responsibility of the souls welfare by transferring that welfare to someone else . It is this voluntary humility that is so dangerous and deceitful . We have been warned : " Let no man beguile you of your reward in by his fleshly mind , and not holding the Head , from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered , and knit together , increaseth with the increase of God . " * ( Colossians 2:18-19 ) <p> God knows that a given human being is indeed inadequate to the keeping of his soul . He knows that " it is not in man to direct his steps . " * ( Jeremiah 10:23 ) He designed the inner man to have a constant Companion , a Guide , a Comforter , which should abide with us forever ( John 14:16 ) .

That fatal characteristic cuts us off from the great benefit which flows from the Head , so that we do not receive the spiritual " nourishment ministered , " and are not " knit together " with other saints of Gods choosing . We are hindered to the extent that we do not grow and increase , but instead must battle hard to keep what we may have obtained , and generally will stagnate , decrease , and decline . In short , we are not blessed if we are not walking by living , active faith in God . We feel inadequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . We struggle on our own , whereas we were meant to thrive by laboring together with God . <p> Men attempt to fill this great need of companionship and guidance by turning to other men who seem to be doing better . That which God only can fill they attempt to satisfy by riding on the coattails of the spiritual , or at least those whom they think are spiritual . Truly spiritual people perceive the situation at once , for they became truly spiritual by doing business with God themselves . They know by experience that no soul is safe , nor does an experience of salvation actually work , except by a human soul being hidden in Christ in God . <p> This whole situation is outlined in the parable of the ten virgins , as related in Matthew 25:1-13 . Five took no oil , but the other five saw to it that they bought and had the oil they would need . When the crisis came and the five foolish realized they did not have what they would need , they said to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lamps are gone out . " * ( Matthew 25:8 ) This is what commonly occurs today . Many realize they are not prepared , that they need help ; but instead of applying to those that sell , and buy for themselves , they try to get from man what they need . But the truth is still the truth : " My soul is continually in my hand . " <p> I was talking with a young man who suffered from an inferiority complex of this kind , and had recently attached himself to a cult-like group because he felt he was not saved . This young man had tried to live a saved life for a number of years , but never felt satisfied between himself and God . Whatever he had obtained from God , he soon threw away by doubting and " a persistent sense of inadequacy or tendency to self-diminishment . " There were forces in his background that subconsciously focused him on looking to men , rather than to God . He prayed and prayed , fasted and fasted , did all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He read his Bible more carefully and conscientiously than many devout Christians , studied religious writings fervently , and longed and yearned for soul satisfactionwithout finding it . What he did n't  do was really exercise believing faith in God , which would have brought a real settled peace and possession to his own soul between him and God ( Hebrews 11:6 ) . The doing is meant to bring us to believing God . It is quite possible that the means to the end ( doing ) can fail to bring us to the end ( believing ) . <p> The young man had visited everywhere he could find people who seemed to have something . While overlooking the quiet and satisfying lives of many who did walk with God and were blessed , he finally found something hot and fervent . He then had " mens persons in admiration because of advantage . " * ( Jude 1:16 ) Determining to get what they had , he entered into a course of discipleship and process of their design that he believed would finally result in soul satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the Author of salvation ) as he should , and the blessing evaded him . Furthermore , he was only dimly conscious that adherence to this group and its standards was separating him from people that did have a walk with God . The promising process was not knitting him together with Gods people at all . But he clung to his mentors . Indeed , a man-fear spirit had seized upon him , and he was ensnared . He was afraid even to talk with someone else without the presence of these people to whom he had entrusted his soul . The inspired writer said , " The fear of man bringeth a snare : but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe . Many seek the rulers favour ; but every mans judgment cometh from the LORD . " * ( Proverbs 29:25-26 ) <p> The saddest part of the experience of this most earnest , fervent manthis most ensnared young manwho longs for soul satisfaction , is that , in spite of whole-hearted fervent " seeking of the rulers favor , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible says , however , he has obtained judgment , a most fair and righteous judgment , from the God of heaven , the Creator of his soul . " For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth , to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him . " * ( 2 Chronicles 16:9 ) The Lord is not unsympathetic to the needs and desires of the young man , but God has designed a waythe waythat is perfect and right . If we want what God has , we must come Gods way . He will not give His glory to another . But , oh , how willing and able He is to satisfy the need of the heart when we come in the way that He has devised and provided ! For " the blessing of the LORD , it maketh rich , and he addeth no sorrow with it . " * ( Proverbs 10:22 ) <p> God has delivered the responsibility of ones soul into the hands of each possessor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our attempts . In talking with this young man and his mentors , one of them quoted 1 Corinthians 14:32 : " And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets . " This was advanced as supposed proof that their method of instruction , discipline , and oversight was justified and taught in the Bible . If the verse read , " And the spirits are subject to the prophets , " then they would have a better chance of proving their point . ( However , such a perversion of the scriptures would not blend with other texts such as 1 John 2:27 . ) But the scriptures does not read that ( all ) the spirits are subject to the prophets , but that the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets . In others words , when God uses a person as a prophet , He also allows that individual control over his prophesying sufficient that he can speak or not speak as is good in a general assembly . This interpretation is in complete accord with the burden of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Another group of people , who regularly discipline and control their people as seems good to them , like to recite the excuse Cain gave to God , " Am I my brothers keeper ? " * ( Genesis 4:9 ) Their reasoning is that this murderer tried to excuse himself from the responsibility of keeping his brother , so it is righteous and proper for us to " keep " each other , therefore , " I am my brothers keeper . " Under this false reasoning , they devised endless rules for allall for the supposed purpose of spiritually keeping each other . One who escaped this false standard observed that we were not adequate to keep each other . As the Word says , " Behold , he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep . The LORD is thy keeper . " * ( Psalms 121:4-5 ) <p> Men have no salvation to give to men .

" * ( 2 Timothy 3:17 ) But each of us is equal in Gods sight by virtue of the fact that each is personally , individually saved by God Himself . This equality is very important . No branch in the Vine is more important or less important than any other branch @ @ @ @ @ But it shall not be so among you . " * ( Matthew 20:25-26 ) The reason that children of God do not exercise dominion over others or exercise authority upon other children of God is because of the common salvationit puts them on an equal footing before God . And , other than the authority that comes from living holy lives ( John 12:48 ; 1 Corinthians 6:2 ) , they do not exercise authority or dominion over unsaved people , either . The only advantage the saved have over the unsaved is that they have received the grace of God which is freely given . All are offered the same grace , and all have the privilege of doing business with God and receiving what others have received . As Brother Peter said , " Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons . " * is unprofitable for you . " * ( Hebrews 13:17 ) This does not mean that they give account for your soul ; it means they give account for their own soul . The scope of the watchmans responsibility is shown in Ezekiel 33:1-9 . The watchman is to receive the Word of God at the mouth of God and to warn the people . If he does not do this , he bears a responsibility for what happens to the people . " If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way , that wicked man shall die in his iniquity ; but his blood will I require at thine hand . " * ( Ezekiel 33:8 ) But once he warns the people of what God says , his responsibility , the rulership of his watchman office , is concluded . Then the responsibility is upon the hearer . " Nevertheless , if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it ; if he do not turn from his way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the watchman is not to go beyond the role of him who watches and warns . He can not and should not attempt to make the people do right ; he can not save themthey have their own responsibility . The watchman has an important function , but if the people look to the watchman and trust him to be responsible for them , he has gone beyond the God-appointed role and taken too much upon himself . In that case , he will end up usurping the place of the Holy Ghost in each persons life and will be held accountable by God for that trespass . <p> If this were not enough on this point , we read shall be upon him . " A father is charged with certain responsibilities of his son , and he is accountable to God for those responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place between God and the son into which the father can not enterthat is between the sons soul and his Maker . The son might say to the father , " You are older and wiser than I , and God has chosen you to be my parentyou answer to God for me , " but God will not accept the substitution . " For there is one God , and one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus . " * ( 1 Timothy 2:5 ) Just onethe man Christ Jesus . <p> It is blasphemous and profane for other men to enter into this position of mediation between a soul and God . It is a grievous sin , and God views it in that way when watchman take too much upon them and attempt to midwife the salvation of a soul by stepping ( even cautiously ) into that exclusive place between that soul and God . To twist Hebrews 13:17 into that kind of relationship is to distort it from the true watchmans authorized scope . <p> We observe another example of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon , a professor of Gods salvation , who was baptized and attended services with others in Samaria who were saved . Peter tells him the truth of his condition and warns him solemnly . This is the watchmans function ; this is what God required Peter to do . But does the man of God go beyond this ? No . We see no barring of Simon from the services of the saved . Even though the poor unsaved man is told , " Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter : for thy heart is not right in the sight of God . " * ( Acts 8:21 ) Even though he is told , " For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness , and in the bond of iniquity. " * ( Acts 8:23 ) So what is the poor unsaved professor of salvation advised to do ? " Submit yourself to our discipleship until we can pray and get you right with God " ? No !

" 1 If God has agents on earth who can control who gets saved and who does n't  , then a basis for inequality is already laid before an individual even gets saved . But listen to the words of Peter : " Neither as being lords over Gods heritage , but being ensamples to the flock .

" He was to be subject to them ( or rather , to the Lord in them ) , and they were to be subject to him ( that is , the Lord in him ) . Now the basis for this kind of relationship in the saved is laid in how God saves souls . He saves them so that there are no big Is and little yous . All the truly saved understand that no one else saved them , but God . No one else keeps them saved , but God . " None of them can by any means redeem his brother , nor give to God a ransom for him . " * ( Psalms 49:7 ) No matter how useful or helpful someone else is to a given soul , they can not save that soul or keep him saved .

The two hearts give themselves to one another , to be no longer two but one . A union of souls takes place , which makes all that belongs to one the property of the other . Separate interests and separate paths in life are no longer possible . Things which were lawful before become unlawful now , because of the nearness of the tie that binds .

If , then , you are hearing the sweet voice of your Lord calling you into a place of nearness to Himself , which will require a separation from all else , and which will make this enthusiasm of devotedness not only possible , but necessary , will you shrink or hesitate ?

Let your heart and your hand be as free to serve Him , as His heart and His hand were to serve you . Let Him have all there is of you , body , soul , and spirit , time , talents , voice , everything . Lay your whole life open before Him that He may control it . Say to Him each day , " Lord , how shall I regulate this day so as to please Thee ? Where shall I go ? what shall I do ? whom shall I visit ? what shall I say ?

" * ( 2 Peter 3:18 ) To grow in grace we must necessarily grow also in the knowledge of Jesus . We should get no stronger in the grace of God if we did not get to know Him better . This is a command , or an expression of Gods will to us . Think of it ! God wills you to grow in grace ; and if you are not growing in grace , you are not accomplishing Gods will . This is a weighty matter . Growing in grace includes more than the pleasure and the benefit of your own improvement ; God is grieved if you are not growing .

Grace is the favor of God to us . It is His good will . It is an impartation of strength from God . We are saved by grace . This is the favor , or goodwill , of God and also the influence of the Spirit renewing the heart and imparting life to the soul . The apostle says , " I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. " * ( Philippians 4:13 ) By the strengthening grace of Christ he could do all things . His grace is sufficient to help bear trials and afflictions . God gives us grace to resist temptation , to endure afflictions , and to be conquerors over sin and Satan .

I am acquainted with people that know much about God , the Bible , and the plan of salvation , and yet have no grace at all . Be not deceived . That you know better how Christians should live is no sure evidence that you are growing in grace . That you can pray longer and testify or preach better , or be more eloquent and forward and active in these duties and have less embarrassment in their performance , is not sure evidence of your growing in grace . By mere practice and human effort one can make improvement in all these ways . <h> 3 .

The stockman desires to know how to promote the growth of his animals . To that end he studies books and experiments . The more valuable an animal is , the more careful he is that it should make good growth . The Christian desires to know how to grow in grace . Someone may say , " I do know how . " I have met farmers who knew much about farming , but I have never met one such farmer that was not eager to know more . A farmer that thinks he knows all about farming and needs not to know any more does not know anything as he ought to know it . All true , wide-awake Christians are eager to know how to grow in grace . <p> To grow in grace , the conditions for growth must be complied with .

The Christian can no more grow in grace ; he can no more get to be like Jesus or have a closer walk with Him , without feeding frequently and bountifully upon Gods word , than the child can grow as He should without eating the foods so necessary to growth . <p> But it seems I hear someone saying , " I have not time . " Then you can not grow . Oh ! why will people make such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your soul ? Do you not regard Gods will or pleasure ? I pray God to awaken you out of your indifference and fire your heart with desire to be built up in the grace of God . <p> Read the Bible daily , thoughtfully , prayerfully , devouringly . Read it believingly . If you believe it fully , then it becomes a truth in your heart . Suppose we open the Bible to the forty-sixth Psalm and read , " God is our refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble . " * ( Psalm 46:1 ) Believing this fully , makes you strong ; you can face any danger ; you can conquer any foe . When we implicitly believe the first verse , then the second one becomes our own experience " Therefore will not we fear . " * ( Psalm 46:2 ) Though all things around us are crumbling , we sweetly rest in God . Remember , you must daily feast upon the word of God if you would grow in grace . This will require time . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God by hurriedly reading a chapter . You must meditate upon it and get it down into your heart by believing it fully . It seems I am so unable to say what I feel is needful to be said that many of my dear readers might be made to understand the need of taking plenty of time to feast upon the Scriptures . In the early morning take time to be alone with God , and in the twilight hour , oh ! do take time to commune with Him who loves you and is all to you . <p> Another condition of growth in grace is perfect obedience to all the word and will of God . Be careful not to grieve or quench the Spirit of God . The Holy Spirit is the medium through which life from God flows into and through the soul . Close up those little channels in the young oak through which flows the life-giving sap , and what will be the result ? You will meet with the same result in your spiritual being if you grieve the Spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit is calling on you to do , you lose grace . If the Spirit of God is speaking to your heart and mind to visit that poor sick man , to give of your means for the cause of Christ , or to fast for the needy and the work of God , you will degenerate if you do not obey . <p> If you have a desire to grow in grace , see to it that you are active in every Christian duty . But you are not to be active in Christian duty for the mere purpose of growth . The child is not active in its play for the mere purpose of growing , but is simply following out the law of life , and growth is the result . In being active in Christian duties , you are merely obeying the law of spiritual life in your inner being , and the result is growth . We do not , as I have said in a previous chapter , gain heaven merely by good works , and yet we must work as if we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they are Christians and growing in grace because they are active in church work , etc . It is not our works that makes us Christians ; we must have life in the soulthe life of God . As well take up the dead body of a child and walk it about to bring it into life as to think of becoming a Christian by good works . All the performances of a jumping-jack will not bring it into life , for it is a dead body . All the activity in church-work of a dead sinner will never bring him into life . But when a child is born into life , then in obedience to a law of that life it exercises , and the result is growth . The dead professor or the sinner must be born of the Spirit into spiritual life ; then in obedience to a law of that life he is active in every Christian duty , and growth is the result . <p> Let us open your Bible to Galatians and read , " And let us not be weary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we faint not household of faith . " * ( Galatians 6:9-10 ) To refuse to do good to all men or to any man as we have opportunity is to grieve the Holy Spirit and to lose grace out of the soul . <p> Another requisite for growth is intense earnestness . The only effectual way to increase in the grace of God is to be deeply interested in the things of God . It is folly to expect to grow in grace if you are unconcerned about the cause of God . If you are not intently interested in the salvation of souls and are not doing all you can to save them , you can make no progress in spiritual life . There is a great lack of interest in the salvation of souls . I have been in homes where were many ornamental and expensive things which told me of an awful blindness to Gods will . Oh ! how can men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spend money for unnecessary things ? <p> Of how to grow in grace this is the sum . <p> Read the word of God daily , prayerfully , devouringly . <p> Be deeply interested in the cause of God and the salvation of souls . <p> Be prompt to obey the commandments of the Bible and the leading of the Holy Spirit . <p> Be active in every for all saints . " * ( Ephesians 6:18 ) <h> 4 . Some evidences of growth in grace . <p> Experiencing greater joy in acts of self-denial for the good and benefit of others is an evidence of growing in the grace of God . Look closely for a moment into your own heart . As sure as you are growing in grace , so sure do you find greater joy in denying self for the welfare and the happiness of others and for the cause of God . You can not have this fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so full of grace that it is a joy to them to give to the poor or to the cause of God the last cent they have . They deprive themselves of luxuries and sometimes even of the necessities of life , that they may do something for Jesus and perishing souls . <p> Another evidence of growing in grace is getting farther from the world . To comprehend what is meant by being dead to the world is very difficult for many . It may sound hard and harsh to some , but nevertheless I am sure that many do not know what a complete death to the world implies . They have too much mind and thought about the world and too much communing with it . Only God can help people to see . <p> Another evidence of growing in grace is having more implicit faith in God and a stepping out on His promises with a feeling of security . You have less fear of any earthly evil . You do not fear " for the terror by night ; nor for the arrow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in darkness ; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.

Your feelings , or emotions , may cause you to do some things sometimes to attract attention or to appear a little better than you may really be , but you do not will it so .

@@72205109 will of God . " * ( Romans 12:1-2 ) <p> In this chapter we will notice the scriptures upon the theme of consecration and dedicationthe important step necessary on the part of the justified believer , before he can enter into this blessed grace of entire sanctification . <p> We find that in the old dispensation everything that was to be employed in the service of God necessarily had to be consecrated . In the tabernacle and temple service every vessel and article of furniture , even the smallest spoon , the tongs , and snuffers , together with the building itself , and all the priests and their garments , were consecrated wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than divine service . This setting apart for holy service was the Old Testament sanctification . The setting apart of these things , together with the ceremonial application of what God had ordained to be used in this dedication , was acceptable in His sight . <p> This consecration in the old dispensation is but a shadow of the new . It was Gods own way of sanctificationmaking things holy unto Himself . The mere declaration on the part of Moses , in the consecration of these things , that they were now holy , would not have been sufficient without the careful observance of the application of the blood of animals and the holy anointing oil , which were typical of the blood of Jesus and the Holy Spirit . Some of the articles of the tabernacles and temple were sanctified simply by a setting apart and sprinkling with oil ( Leviticus 8:10 ) , while others required the application of oil and blood ( Leviticus 8:11,15 ) . In the consecration of Aaron and his sons the anointing oil and the blood were applied ( Leviticus 8:30 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The apostle speaks of this in his letter to the Hebrews " For if the blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean , sanctifieth to the purifying the living God ? " * ( Hebrews 9:13 ) <p> The importance of an exclusive dedication to the service of God should impress our minds with deep solemnity . Anything held back from such a dedication would most certainly have been rejected in the old dispensation , and truly it is the same in the new . Many professing to follow Jesus into a thorough consecration , are at heart disposed to keep back some treasured idol . Many have doubtless made a profession of sanctification , and yet have never made a definite consecration . Such are deceived , and never know the joys of this glorious experience . The cleansing blood and the Holy Spirit will never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It is both scriptural and logical that we present our bodies a living sacrifice , not only for service but for actual sacrifice in a definite and absolute consecration . We have no bad things to present to the Lord in this consecration ; for we are not sinners . We would not be proper candidates for sanctification if we were clinging to anything sinful . Everything sinful must be forsaken and denounced by the guilty sinner when he comes to God for pardon . Otherwise he would never be forgiven of his sins . The world , the flesh , and the devil are forsaken in true repentance . " Denying ungodliness and worldly lusts , we should live soberly , righteously , and godly , in this present world . " * ( Titus 2:12 ) Therefore all sinful things are laid aside forever in repentance . This is the Bible signification of repentance : to give up all sinful things . But the Bible signification of consecration is to present to Jesus all the sacred treasures of our heartsgive up all our good things . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has no good things to bring to God . He is guilty and condemned in the sight of God . It is the justified believer who has learned by experience that his inward spiritual condition is not yet satisfactory . It may have been for a time ; but he sooner or later becomes aware that there is a deeper work of grace needed . He doubts not that he is justified . but knows that something more must be wrought within . Through the ministry of the word of God and the blessed guidance of the Holy Spirit , he is soon taught that a definite consecration must be made as one of the Bible conditions for sanctification . Now comes the searching and far-reaching question : Are you willing to make this consecration ? This means everything to the soul . All the sacred God-given treasures around which the hearts affections have so closely entwined , and which have become a part of the very life itself , are now required to be yielded up to Jesus as a voluntary offering . There is no danger that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God will reveal every hidden treasure , and make known the depths of meaning to the soul , which will be astounded to know as never before how much it means to lay all of itself and sacred treasures at the feet of Jesus . There comes an inward struggle , perhaps . The hearts affections tighten around the sacred objects of its love , until they seem dearer than ever before ; but while this is being done there comes a sadness stealing over the soul ; for whereas these objects seem so sacred and precious , there is a consciousness within that Jesus is slighted . The affections are divided between Jesus and these treasures . He asks the question , " Lovest thou me more than these ? " * ( John 21:15 ) You can answer , " Yea , Lord ; thou knowest that I love thee.* ( John 21:15 ) But must I give up these treasures , these sacred things of my heart for thee ? Can not I have both them and thee ? " This is where death must set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only road to this glorious Canaan of soul-rest . <p> It soon becomes a significant fact thoroughly understood that Jesus requires the undivided heart and every affection . You can not refuse him . He has done too much for you . He suffered without the gate that He might sanctify you with His own blood . He gave Himself for the church that He might sanctify and cleanse it ; and now how can you withhold anything from Him ? He has a just right to all your affections . He gave His all for you , and now it is right that you should give your all for Him . He sacrificed His life for you ; now you are brought to the sacrifice of your life for Hima living sacrifice . You see that this claim is right and just . It is a reasonable requirement on his part ; a " reasonable service " * ( Romans 12:1 ) on your part . <p> But , dear reader , the question must be answered . Are you going to yield ? You may answer , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . Usually when the soul is brought face to face with this consecration and begins to become willing to yield up its treasures , it let 's go the easiest ones first , and as one by one they are counted over to the Lord there comes a final struggle ; the dearest one of all is now before you . The emotions of the heart begin to deepen as the affections cling to this treasure . Everything has now centered upon this one object . It is to be sacrificed for Jesus or He must be sacrificed for it . Which will it be ? It must be Jesus only . Much reasoning may arise upon this important matter , but all is vain . There must be the yielding . You must say from the depths of your soul , " Thy will be done . " * ( Matthew 26:42 ) You have often said this before , but it never meant nearly what it does now .

Jesus demands that you let go and drop completely into His will . You desire to do this , but your soul shrinks . It seems so dark below . Many a one has here taken counsel with his own soul and decided to swing back upon the side of self , thereby losing incalculable wealth , and missing this glorious soul-rest which " remaineth therefore to the people of God .

" Your Pentecost is just in reach . Will you have it , or will you not ? <p> In the dedication of the tabernacle we have a beautiful type of the dedication of ourselves to this " reasonable service " of God . The erection of the tabernacle , the placing of all the furniture , and the arrangement of the entire structure had to be made in every respect " according to the pattern " * ( Hebrews 8:5 ) shown to Moses on the mount . In the completion of all the work , we read that it was now all done " as the LORD commanded Moses . " * ( Exodus 40 ) He might have thought it did not matter much about some of these things , and that the Lord would not require every small thing to be done according to the pattern ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that obedience to every requirement of the Lord was his only safety ; so he made everything according to the pattern . The record says , " So Moses finished the work . " * ( Exodus 40:33 ) <p> Dear soul , can this be said of you ? Have you finished the work ? Have you ceased from your own works ? You must reach this point in your consecration , so you can realize just as definitely as Moses did , that you have truly finished the work . When this was the condition in the dedication of the tabernacle , " a cloud covered the tent of the congregation , and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle . And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation , because the cloud abode thereon , and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle . " * ( Exodus 40:34-35 ) When Moses had finished the work and the dedication was complete , the glory of the Lord came into the tabernacle . So it is with the consecrated heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the dedication of the temple we also have a type of this Pentecostal experience . " Solomon , and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark , sacrificed sheep and oxen , which could not be told nor numbered for multitude . " * ( 2 Chrononicles 5:6 ) See the sacrifice unto the Lord . Nothing was too great ; everything was fully yielded up to Him without reserve . " And it came to pass , when the priests were come out of the holy place : ( for all the priests that were present were sanctified , and did not then wait by course : Also the Levites which were the singers , all of them of Asaph , of Heman , of Jeduthun , with their sons and their brethren , being arrayed in white linen , having cymbals and psalteries and harps , stood at the east end of the altar , and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets : ) It came even to pass , as the trumpeters and singers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in praising and thanking the LORD ; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick , and praised the LORD , saying , For he is good ; for his mercy endureth for ever : that then the house was filled with a cloud , even the house of the LORD ; So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud : for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God . " * ( 2 Chronicles 5:11-14 ) Thus we see that when the sacrifice was complete and everything was in perfect order , the glory of God filled the temple . <p> This was but a type of the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem . In the type , the glory of the Lord filled the consecrated temple . In the antitype , the consecrated hearts ( the temples of the Holy Ghost ) were filled with the glory of the Lord . Now this is just what Jesus will do with every consecrated heart today . " He shall baptize you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Matthew 3:11 ) But the consecration must be complete . It is reasonable that Jesus should require us to yield up everything to Him . Our hearts can not be purified until every affection is yielded . He requires this for our own highest good . He wants the supreme right of way so that He can work His own will in our entire being . He wants the absolute control , so that He can get between us and everything . Praise His name ! This is for our benefit , which we will plainly see when once we have paid the full price . When His will is completely wrought in us , then He will with Himself freely give us all things for our greatest good and His highest glory . Even an hundredfold shall be our delightful portion . But the loss of all things must precede this wonderful increase . An absolute death must precede this abundant life . Then and then only can the Holy Ghost come into and possess the temple . Oh , that every professed believer in Jesus might see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is serious indeed ; but the unspeakable glory that follows causes the enraptured soul to be astonished at the marvelous gain for so small a loss .

They are ready to admit that the writers of the New Testament were inspired of God , but no others have been but them . Just as distinct an inspiration from God is necessary to the preaching of the Bible as there was to the writing . God does not inspire all men to do the same work , but no one can do Gods work except he be inspired . Bezaleel could never have constructed the tabernacle except he had been inspired of God ( Exodus 35:30-35 ) . Bezaleel means " in the shadow of God .

The Holy Spirit is to dwell in us , walk in us , witness in our hearts . <p> We are led by the Spirit . Did you ever consider what it meant to be led by the Spirit ? The bird is led to build its nest , the spider to weave its web , the migrating fowl to fly southward in autumn and northward in the spring . These are all taught of God . We call this instinct .

Humanity is weak , yes , very weak , and the more we live in our humanity , the weaker we will be , but the more we live by the power of God , the stronger we will be .

This is very true , but except the word of God comes as an inspiration to our hearts , we will get no understanding of His thoughts toward us . The word of God is Spirit , and it is life ( John 6:63 ) . Man can not know Gods will simply through his intelligence or human wisdom . The preaching of the Word of God is foolishness to the worldly wise .

We are strangers in the world and not only strangers , but also are on a journeywe are strangers here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is altogether out of place and unbecoming , and contrary to our heavenly nature to become attached to anything of earth . We beg of you to study the life of Jesus , and note how He went through this world . His life is the model life . Just a little undue attachment to any earthly thing will dull the souls sensibilities , until it can not receive the impulses of God . The soul must be kept sensitive , by the Holy Spirit , to heavenly things to be able to receive impressions from the Lord . We speak kindly , and in sympathy with all , but we do fear that many a child of God is taking too much thought about earthly things , is striving to get around them something of this world to the neglect of their souls best interest , laboring to the neglect of prayer , spending money for things that are nice and convenient , humanly speaking , but could have been sacrificed for the helping of Gods cause and been far more pleasing to Him . You say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like , you do not have the joy in prayer , God is not as real to you as you wish , you do not get the help in healing of your body as you believe to be your privilege , you do not have the unction of the Holy Spirit upon your soul in heavenly sweetness . It is because however unconscious of it you may be , you are too much in the flesh and not enough in the Spirit . <p> A word more in the conclusion of this chapter . In Isaiah are these words , " And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD . " * ( Isaiah 11:3 ) These words were spoken of Jesus , but they are applicable to man filled with the Holy Spirit . It is our privilege to be of " quick understanding in the fear of the LORD , " by the inspiration of the Almighty . In the margin of the Bible , you will notice that instead of " understanding , " it is " scent " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verse two shall rest upon Jesus , and these shall make Him of quick scent . Now the spirit of wisdom , of understanding , of counsel , of might , of knowledge , and of the fear of the Lord will also rest upon every child of God that will come close to God , and they will make him quick-scented . There are depths in these words . It is our privilege to detect spiritual ill-odors . If you live in the impure air of an unventilated room , you can not detect the foulness of the air , but if you will step outside and breathe the pure air of the outside world awhile and then step inside that room , you will scent the ill-odor . Those who live too much in the flesh and the love of earthly things can not detect the deadly spiritual miasma that is lurking there , but if they would step into God and breathe for a time the atmosphere of heaven , and let Him breathe the Spirit in us , then we will be quick to scent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in the Spirit and the fear of the Lord that we may be able to detect the ill-odor in some things . This thing seems to be necessary ; this will be very convenient ; this will be quite useful ; I need this badly ; this literature is harmless ; this fellowship will not affect me ; this amusement is innocent . And all the while , there is a smell of fleshliness about these things we have not been able to detect , and we wonder why we can not understand Gods will more perfectly . If you will read Hebrews 5:12-14 you will learn that it is our privilege and duty to cultivate our spiritual senses to the degree that we can know what is good and what is evil . Because of the importance of this subject , we loathe to leave it . There are many other Bible examples and texts teaching us how to know the will of God by His inbreathing into our spirit , but we must , for want of space , conclude , praying that we all may so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give us understanding of His will . <p> He who teaches the spider how to build its trap and weave its web and teaches the bird how to rear its young , can teach us of His will and of His way . If we will walk in the Spirit , He will breathe upon us a knowledge of His will in all the details of life . 
@@72205113 @905113/ <p> There is no distinction in the two expressions , for both refer to the same thing . True speaking in tongues of Acts 2:4 is a manifestation of the Spirit , as implied by the words , " as the Spirit gave them utterance . " The fact that the true tongues are given of the Spirit necessarily means they are a " gift " of the Spirit . In the 1 Corinthians 12 both expressions are used interchangeably and speak of the same spiritual gift . We read , " To one is given by the Spirit divers kinds of tongues , " * ( 1 Corinthians 12:8,10 ) referring to the gift of tongues . Then in verse 30 we read , " Do all speak with tongues ? " which also refers to the same gift , just as the " gift of miracles " and " working of miracles " * ( 1 Corinthians 12:10 ) are equivalent expressions . We understand that this distinguishing theory was introduced in the year of 1900 by C. F. Parham . The early church never taught it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongues-evidence theory . <h> Error 2 : The baptism of the Holy Ghost is in every instance attended by the initial physical sign of speaking in other tongues as the Spirit gives utterance . <p> The Scripures nowhere teach that speaking in tongues is required as evidence that the Holy Ghost is received . If you can , quote us one direct Scriptural requirement on this point . Paul asks , " Do all speak with tongues ? " * ( 1 Corinthians 12:30 ) No , is the implied answer , for in the preceding verses he had explained that there were " differences of administration " * ( 1 Corinthians 12:29 ) in the manifestation of the Spirit , meaning that the Spirit does not manifest Himself through the same particular gift in every person , " but the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal . " * ( 1 Corinthians 12:7 ) You know that all are not apostles , all are not workers of miracles ( 1 Corinthians 12:29 ) , neither do all speak with true tongues . Speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit gives utterance , " * ( Acts 2:4 ) is only a manifestation , or gift , of the Spirit in common with other special gifts . According to this error , the Holy Spirit is denied unless He chooses to manifest Himself in a certain manner . The Holy Ghost Himself is the satisfactory evidence . " Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness . " * ( Hebrews 10:15 ) " The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit . " * ( Romans 8:16 ) If the reception of the Spirit must be evidenced by an outward physical sign , surely ones conversion should be determined by a special sign in all cases . Since such is not true , then there is no necessity of that particular witness for the baptism , or for any other special work or favor from God . <p> On the day of Pentecost the first disciples exercised the gift of prophecy , as well as the gift of tongues , when they received the Holy Ghost . Also , the twelve disciples at Ephesus prophesied when they received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Therefore , the special gift of prophecy should be given preference if either of the gifts were to be accepted as the evidence of the reception of the Holy Ghost for " greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues " * ( 1 Corinthians 14:5 ) ; and Paul further exhorts , " Desire spiritual gifts , but rather that ye may prophesy . " * ( 1 Corinthians 14:1 ) <h> Error 3 : The baptism of the Holy Ghost is received just like it was on the day of Pentecost ( Acts 2 ) . <p> Do the modern tongues people manifest the same signs as then ? Let us notice more closely the Pentecostal scene . The first outward sign was the coming of " a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting " * ( Acts 2:2 ) ; the second outward sign was , " There appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire , and it sat upon each of them " * ( Acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak with other tongues languages as the Spirit gave them utterance . " * ( Acts 2:4 ) The modern movement does not reproduce these signs as claimed in the above error . They discard the first two , and emphasize the last . However , the first sign is just as important as the last in this particular scene , being only a literal fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy at the ushering in of the Holy Spirit dispensation . The manifestation of tongues which people generally receive today are not languages as spoken on the day of Pentecost , but only a false gibber through Satanic power or nervous derangement . Therefore , in no sense do they reproduce the Pentecostal outpouring . No hint is made at the Pentecostal scene that the disciples spoke in unknown tongues , nor to God alone , neither did they need an interpreter , but these languages were spoken direct to the people of different nations and were given specifically for the purpose of spreading the gospel to various nations through prophecy or preaching , a special gift which they also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a language , and is given as an aid to prophecy when needed . <p> Evidently the disciples on this occasion did not talk in different languages a few minutes only , for the incident was noised abroad and the multitude representing different nationalities came together , and each " heard them speak in his own language , " * ( Acts 2:6 ) which no doubt continued the greater part of the day , each disciple talking in order , Peters sermon being recorded in this chapter . If speaking these various languages was the only evidence that they had the Holy Ghost , then when they ceased to speak the apostles could have rightly concluded that they had lost the Holy Ghost . How inconsistent ! Our Pentecostal friends would endeavor to satisfy us with a momentary evidence , but thank God , the infilling of the Spirit is not dependent upon transitory evidences , for the Holy Spirit in the heart is the abiding evidence Himself . <h> Error 4 : That one should " tarry " for the baptism of the Spirit , evidenced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tarry at Jerusalem until they were endued with power from on high ( Luke 24:49 ) . We know that this refers to Pentecost ( Acts 1:8 ) . To fulfill Old Testament type , the Spirit would not be given until " the day of Pentecost was fully come . " * ( Acts 2:1 ) This tarrying applied only to the disciples before Pentecost , meaning for them to await that special time . On that day we find them " with one accord in one place , " * ( ) and they were " sitting " * ( Acts 2:2 ) denoting no physical exertion . Literal tarrying is not needed so much now as meeting the conditions for the reception of the Spirit . Divine operations are spiritual and are wrought in the heart by faith ( Ephesians 2:8 ) . Faith is receiving where there is no sight or physical evidence , for faith is " the evidence of things not seen . " * ( Hebrews 11:1 ) " He that believeth hath the witness in himself . " * ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Galatians 3:14 ) . Therefore , faith is omitted when one looks to the physical evidence as the goal , and one is not satisfied until he receives the " tongues . " Under such conditions of tarrying , physical exertion , and omission of faith , wonderful opportunities are afforded the devil to give counterfeit tongues or spirits ( 1 John 4:1 ) . It is easy for the devil to counterfeit physical manifestations of the Spirit , and this alone makes the theory unreliable . Then , too , no allowance is made for counterfeit manifestations , many of which the Word of God directly condemns . People who are demon-possessed very often speak in tongues . To my knowledge a number of persons have escaped from the tongues movement , and in order to get Bible salvation they had to have the devils cast out by the power of God . In fact , in every case where they had sought and received the delusion of tongues , the power of the devil had to be broken before they could get salvation . This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The tongues movement , through this supernatural delusive power , has ensnared a multitude of people . " Lying wonders " * ( 2 Thessalonians 2:9 ) are performed by them . It is also a refuge for those who " receive not the love of the truth .

@@72205114 @905114/ <h> Thought He Had Sinned Away His Day of Grace <p> The enemy of souls has laid many plans and has many devices to deceive people and harass their minds and thereby cause them to bring unnecessarily heavy burdens upon themselves . One of his common impositions is to make a person think that he has committed the unpardonable sin and that all hope of ever obtaining favor with God again is forever gone . When such persons are told that they are laboring under a delusion , and that there is hope for them ; that others have felt the same way and formed the same conclusion , but afterwards learned that it was only a deception of the enemy , and were able to renounce the delusion and obtain a good experience and keep it , the answer in most cases is , " My case is different . " " Had I taken advantage of past opportunities when I had a chance to do so , I might have been saved , but now it is too late . " <p> Time after time I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " different " from that of anyone else , and that hope was beyond their reach . The situation and feelings seemed so real that no amount of reasoning or evidence to the contrary could change their minds until they became submissive enough to submit themselves to the mercy of God and accept advice and counsel and act upon it . Then they were very soon liberated from the oppressions of the enemy and set free by the grace of God . <p> One laboring under a deception frequently undergoes as deep suffering of mind and soul as if the situation and conditions were real . A lady once received what was supposed to be an authentic report that her son had been killed in a railway wreck . Circumstances were such that she could receive no communication from him , which apparently added evidence to the truthfulness of the story . Her mother-heart was griefstricken . In the anguish of her bereavement she refused to be comforted . Later she was told that there was a possibility of his having escaped death , that he was probably yet alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , her feelings were too real , her grief was too great , for her to be deceived , she declared . One day her son arrived home sound and well , and did not even know that there had been a trainwreck at the place whence the report came . The mother then found that her sorrow and grief had been groundless . She accepted the status of affairs , cast aside the false report and her bad feelings , and was happy . <p> Not long ago I met an old acquaintance , a man above seventy years of age , whom I had not seen for many years . At the time of our former meeting he was enjoying the blessings of a Christian experience and was happy in the service of the Lord . Through devotional neglect , and perhaps for other reasons , he began to entertain doubts concerning his spiritual experience , and he questioned whether or not he had any right , under the circumstances , to lay claim to Christian fellowship with those whom he knew to be spiritual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he needed not to waver in faith . But the tempter was there to suggest that he had lost his experience and might just as well give up the struggle . He then concluded that the brethren did not have confidence in him , and therefore he dropped his profession . <p> His heart was still tender , and he did not feel disposed to indulge in sin . In a short time he made " another start " to serve the Lord and tried to repent ; but , having so little to repent over , and finding it difficult to have the same earnestness as before , he claimed the victory " by faith , " but was soon in " doubting castle " again . These up-and-down experiences continued for many months , during which his spiritual realm was more down than up . Discouragement laid hold upon him , despair followed hard on his track , and the enemy whispered that it was of no use to try any more . The way began to be more and more dreary . Occasionally , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose from the state of lethargy into which he had fallen , but alas ! his victories were of short duration . These experiences were followed by the accusations of the enemy that he was possessed with devils . Brethren who prayed with him declared that such was not the case . <p> The darkest scriptures of judgment and everlasting destruction seemed to have been written for him , and , as he viewed the matter , they exactly fitted his case . He had doubted so often when it seemed the Lord was offering a helping hand , that now it was too late ; the last cord was severed , the last ray of hope had vanished . It was no difficult matter to believe that he had committed the unpardonable sin , and that God had forever hid His face from him . He resigned himself to the hopelessness of the situation , to meet his fate at the end of his life here upon earth and spend eternity in the regions of the lost . He spent a number of years in this condition . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , I felt much concerned about his deliverance from such a state and condition . Upon my approaching him on the subject , he immediately informed me that it was useless to waste any of my efforts on him , for his was a hopeless case , as he had sinned against the Holy Ghost . Having met similar cases before , I assured him that there was hope for him , and told him that I could prove by the Word of God and by his own testimony that he had not committed the crime that would cause him to be forever lost , as he had supposed . <p> Taking my Bible , I turned Spirit of grace ? " <p> " Have you trodden under foot the Son of God as herein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " he replied ; " I have never doubted that there is a God nor that Jesus Christ is His Son . " <p> " Have you counted the blood of the covenant an unholy thing , that is , that there is no more virtue in the blood of Jesus Christ than there is in the blood of a cow or some other unholy thing ? " <p> " No , sir . I have never denied the power of the blood of Jesus nor done despite to the Spirit of grace , " he replied . <p> " Then , according to the Bible and your own testimony , you have not blasphemed against the Holy Ghost , nor , as you say , committed the unpardonable sin by sinning against the Holy Ghost . You must forever cease to entertain the idea that you have committed such a sin . " <p> He reluctantly admitted the truth in regard to that point , but said , " There is such a thing as a mans going too far , of trifling so with God that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was clearly pointed out to him that he had never reached such an experience and that he should cast aside his doubts and fears and call upon God , and was assured that the Lord would save him . He then declared that he had no will of his own , no power to exercise his will if he had any , and was helpless . I told him that anyone who could read human nature would at once conclude that he was a man of strong willpower , and that no doubt he frequently made others aware of that fact . <p> His wife said , " That is true ; he knows very well how to exercise his willpower . " <p> He was then told to assert his manhood and take a decided stand . <p> But he replied , " I have no manhood ; I have no power to assert myself in any way . " <p> " But , " I replied , " you have been in this town for the past few days , and have asserted your manhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect gentleman . What you need to do now is to kneel with us here in prayer and yield yourself to God , and He will save you the same as He has saved others who thought they were beyond the reach of mercy .

If you act according to the instructions given , you will soon be different . Your heart will be changed . Do your part in making the effort , and the Lord will help you to pray , and you will have all the feeling necessary . " <p> We knelt in prayer , laid our hands upon his head , and with a fervent prayer rebuked the deceptive and binding power of Satan , and asked the Lord to save him . He made an effort to pray , but his few words were soon mingled with his sobs and feelings of deepest contrition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation . His doubts and fears had vanished , and his burden was gone . He was once more a free man and had no more fears of death and the judgment . The next day he returned home with a joyful heart . I have frequently heard from him since that time , and he has always sent a message concerning his victorious life . <p> There are many others who have been harassed by the enemy in like manner ; who have lost all hope of recovering their favorwith God ; who think that they are " different , " " hard-hearted , " " hopeless , " " have sinned away the day of grace , " " are under the control of Satan , " or in some such like condition .

@@72205117 @905117/ <h> Personal Experience <p> In conclusion I desire to add my humble testimony of a personal experience of the glorious work of entire sanctification . <p> At the age of seventeen years I was converted . All who were acquainted with me had no reason to doubt the genuine , inwrought grace of pardon and the new life which at once began to bring forth fruit unto God . But the one to whom this mighty change seemed the most marvelous was myself . My poor soul , which for several years had been held under the terrible bondage and darkness of sin , was now turned from darkness unto light and from the power of Satan unto God , and there was no room either internally or externally to question that I had received forgiveness of sins . The glory and blessedness of that sacred hour and that hallowed spot " when love divine first found me " * can never be erased from my memory . I will not say , as I have often heard others testify of their own , that my experience was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see how it could have been any more wonderful to me than it was , and it is but useless to make an effort to tell it . All who have come into this precious life , and have the Spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God , understand what it means to be justified by faith and have this sweet peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ . <p> But this peace with God meant war with the enemy of my soul , and I soon learned that the battle was a serious one . The artful schemes of the enemy were deeply planned for my overthrow , and while attending school the spirit of the world succeeded in leading me into defeat , and I decided to yield myself again unto the world , and gave up the struggle against sin . But , oh , what darkness ! God only knows what horrors I suffered . I had been saved but a few months and had had the taste of true happiness which so spoiled me for the empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable that life was a burden . But , thank God , this condition of life was only of about two months duration . Through the burning tears of my precious mother , which fairly bathed my face and neck one day as she suddenly came into my room and clasped her arms around me , I was enabled again to decide for God and heaven . This decision was so thoroughly burned in upon my soul by those scalding tears that , by the grace of God , I believe it will last from that day to my latest breath . The sweet joy and peace of heaven was restored and I believe I enjoyed salvation as much as anyone could in my circumstances . I knew I was a child of God , but it was not long until I became fully conscious that there was a deeper work of grace needed within me . My parents both professed entire sanctification at the time of the conversion of the four oldest children , which included myself , but my life was much occupied in securing an education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my studies , then afterward became engaged in educational work for a number of years . It needed no arguments to prove that my parents possessed a deeper spiritual life than I did , and although the doctrine of sanctification was not so clearly taught and understood then as now , yet I was fully aware this was what I needed . Sometimes I thought I had obtained the experience , but soon it was proved by unmistakable evidence that I was not sanctified . I had not come to the point of a definite and absolute consecration , and really did not understand how to make this consecration . My great ambition in life was to make a mark in the world . This was so deeply implanted within me that I caused every energy to bend in that direction . I dearly loved God and fully realized my utter dependence upon him , but my love was not perfected . Then unfortunately I had a quick temper , which I found justification had not destroyed . It was materially repressed and generally held under control , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence ; and sometimes , I am sorry to say , it brought me under condemnation and I had cause to repent and regain the sweet peace of God . <p> But the manner of my life , I believe , as a whole , was such that none of my most intimate acquaintances had any reason to question the sincerity of my heart or my profession as a Christian . The one who was most dissatisfied with my inward condition was myself , and for more than eight years I knew that a deeper work must be wrought before I could be satisfied . Oh , how truly I could understand the prayer of David when he so longed for a clean heart ; and had I been brought to the knowledge of the complete consecration , I might have been living in this blessed Canaan rest of soul soon after my conversion . But God was good and full of tender mercy . He carried me along and forgave my defeats and so lovingly bore with me , even though my heart was divided between Him and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to follow Jesus , but unconsciously these objects would come between Jesus , the object of my love , and myself , and thus hinder the perfect communion of the Holy Spirit . About one year prior to my entering into this perfect rest , the doctrine of sanctification was quite thoroughly agitated . Some advocates of the Zinzendorf doctrine produced some strong efforts to overthrow the doctrine of the second work of grace . I had studied the scriptures carefully and honestly , and while I did not have the experience of the second grace myself , I was certain that the one-work teaching was not correct ; for I knew I had received all that my heart could receive in the grace of pardon , and knew also that I soon found that I needed just exactly what the term sanctification implies , and what the dear ones who believed in , and were advocating the second work of grace were testifying to by word and deed . <p> In the winter of 1883-4 , while dear companion and myself were engaged with some sanctified ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were brought as never before face to face with the stern necessity of more spiritual power and life . We were shown by the Holy Spirit that there is but one route to the promised land and that is by crossing the Jordan . Death was inevitable if we would come into this abundant life . We paused and reflected , looked backward and forward , but there was no alternativedeath was our doom . One day while I was absent from home , and dear companion was left alone , the Lord spoke to her so plainly that she had one cherished idol that must necessarily be sacrificed . It was a God-given blessing , but must be yielded freely to him . She obeyed and entered into the glory of sanctification . When I returned home I soon found that the work in her was done . Something marvelous had been accomplished . It was wonderful what a change . She told me of the death she had to pass through and I fully realized it . The divine glory which had come into her heart was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same death . I was desirous to yield and cross over with her , but I found a resistance in my will which held me back . I came to my cherished treasures , some of which were God-given blessings , but unquestionably the Holy Spirit said they must be yielded up a burnt offering unto the Lord . My will must become swallowed up into the will of God completely , even to this death . I said , " Yes , Lord , I will " ; but the yes found a hesitancy . It did not reach the depths of my heart . I kept saying it over and over " Yes , Lord " and tried to get it deeper every time I said it ; but the Lord knew it did not reach the inmost depths . That was a wonderful day to me , but it was not the day of my death , as it was of my companion . She told in meeting that evening what the Lord had wrought . I told what I was trying to say to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed by and I still hesitated . I wanted the Lords perfect will , but also wanted just a little of my will . I wanted both , but the Lord showed that I could have but one ; and I plainly knew which one , if I was ever to obtain the grace of sanctification . The life of my companion was a daily testimony which only added to my trouble . I knew she had what she never had before . Her life before was all that I ever expected to find in a true , devoted , Christian woman , but now in some marvelous manner there was vastly more heaven in her life than before , and the marked absence of everything unlike heaven . I knew she was sanctified , and I knew I was not . She had just what I must have , and what my soul was longing for these years . Oh , why could I not just now say , " Yes ! " with my whole heart and die the death and gain the abundant life ? Sometimes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked God to forgive me for not yielding up my whole heart as I knew He would have me do . <p> Weeks and months passed and my attention became absorbed in business and the cares of life , but these months were more unsatisfactory than all my previous Christian life , and some of this time I certainly lived on a very low plane of spirituality , and it is evident that I at last came to the point where my justification would have been forfeited had I not gone over and possessed the land . I struggled and suffered sometimes unutterably . After the struggle was over and I was sanctified I could look back and see where I had come up to a deep chasm so deep and dark that I could not see the bottom . It was too wide for me to step across . On the other side was everything my soul longed for . I could see the beautiful plane and way of sanctification . My loved ones were walking on it and rejoicing in its glory . Above the chasm there seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my weight , and it seemed that I could easily take hold of this rope and by a desperate effort swing myself across the chasm . I had taken hold of the rope and was for a long time hesitating about making the leap . The chasm was the depth I must drop into in order to reach sanctification , but it seemed awfulso deep and dark , and no assurance that I would ever see life again . The rope was my will . I had presumed to swing across without going into the death , but God knew that would not be His way , and there I stood , gazing with fear and trembling into the immensity of this dark chasm into which to leap meant certain death . Later I had taken hold of the rope and swung myself away from where I had been standing , with the hope of reaching the other side . I could not reach it and now was worse off than before , for I was now suspended above the chasm and could neither go back nor go forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and yet the Holy Spirit kept saying , " Let go . " <p> My sufferings increased until I began to feel that death would be a relief . At that time God sent a brother to us who preached a sermon from the text , 1 Peter 4:1-2 , with emphasis upon the clause , " For he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin . " The holy Spirit applied this to me and revealed to my soul the utter necessity of death to gain sanctification . The end came , I let go my death grip of the rope and said as I never said before , " Yes , Lord , Thy will be done ! " I knew that it reached the uttermost depth of my soul . God knew it , and I am certain that Satan knew it . At the close of that meeting I said , " I am now offered up . " There was no consicous change only I knew my will was yielded , and I am certain that not an atom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late in the evening , and as I was retiring I knelt once more before God and simply told Him that now after these months of struggle it was all ended and I was so thankful to Him that I could say so sweetly , " Thy will be done . " My hold upon the rope had become so weary . How sweet and blessed now to rest so securely in that infinite will . The great chasm was deep and dark , but I was so glad that I had let go and dropped into it ; for I was so conscious now that even in the darkness and depths I was in His will . As I dropped , loving arms of Jesus had caught me and I was glad to be in death with Him . I felt within me that something wonderful was about to take place , I arose from my knees and scarcely had time to lie down when truly I experienced a taste of death . Wholly unconscious of my earthly surroundings , but knowing I was in the presence of Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after which the baptism of pentecostal fire and the Holy Ghost came upon me .

@@72205123 @905123/ <h> Preface <p> This is not a theological book . I frankly confess I have not been trained in theological schools , and do not understand their methods nor their terms . But the Lord has taught me experimentally and practically certain lessons out of His Word , which have greatly helped me in my Christian life , and have made it a very happy one . And I want to tell my secret , in the best way I can , in order that some others may be helped into a happy life also . <p> I do not seek to change the theological views of a single individual . I dare say most of my readers know far more about theology than I do myself , and perhaps may discover abundance of what will seem to be theological mistakes . But let me ask that these may be overlooked , and that my reader will try , instead , to get at the experimental point of that which I have tried to say , and if that is practical and helpful , forgive the blundering way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absolute truth which lies at the foundation of all " creeds " and " views , " and to bring the soul into those personal relations with God which must exist alike in every form of religion , let the expression of them differ as they may . <p> I have committed my book to the Lord , and have asked Him to counteract all in it that is wrong , and to let only that which is true find entrance into any heart . It is sent out in tender sympathy and yearning love for all the struggling , weary ones in the Church of Christ , and its message goes right from my heart to theirs . I have given the best I have , and could do no more . May the blessed Holy Spirit use it to teach some of my readers the true secret of a happy life ! <h> Gods Side and Mans Side <p> In introducing this subject of the life and walk of faith , I desire , at the very outset , to clear away one misunderstanding which very commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which effectually hinders a clear apprehension of such teaching . This misunderstanding comes from the fact that the two sides of the subject are rarely kept in view at the same time . People see distinctly the way in which one side is presented , and , dwelling exclusively upon this , without even a thought of any other , it is no wonder that distorted views of the whole matter are the legitimate consequence . <p> Now there are two very decided and distinct sides to this subject , and , like all other subjects , it can not be fully understood unless both of these sides are kept constantly in view . I refer , of course , to Gods side and mans side ; or , in other words , to Gods part in the work of sanctification , and mans part . These are very distinct and even contrastive , but are not contradictory ; though , to a cursory observer , they sometimes look so . <p> This was very strikingly illustrated to me not long ago . There were two teachers of this higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternate hours . One spoke only of Gods part in the work , and the other dwelt exclusively upon mans part . They were both in perfect sympathy with one another , and realized fully that they were each teaching different sides of the same great truth ; and this also was understood by a large proportion of their hearers . But with some of the hearers it was different , and one lady said to me , in the greatest perplexity , " I can not understand it at all . Here are two preachers undertaking to teach just the same truth , and yet to me they seem flatly to contradict one another . " And I felt at the time that she expressed a puzzle which really causes a great deal of difficulty in the minds of many honest inquirers after this truth . <p> Suppose two friends go to see some celebrated building , and return home to describe it . One has seen only the north side , and the other only the south . <p> The first says , " The building was built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories and ornaments . " <p> " Oh , no ! " says the other , interrupting him , " you are altogether mistaken ; I saw the building , and it was built in quite a different manner , and its ornaments and stories were so and so . " <p> A lively dispute would probably follow upon the truth of the respective descriptions , until the two friends discover that they have been describing different sides of the building , and then all is reconciled at once . <p> I would like to state as clearly as I can what I judge to be the two distinct sides in this matter ; and to show how the looking at one without seeing the other , will be sure to create wrong impressions and views of the truth . <p> To state it in brief , I would just say that mans part is to trust and Gods part is to work ; and it can be seen at a glance how contrastive these two parts are , and yet not necessarily contradictory . I mean this . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be delivered from the power of sin , and are to be made perfect in every good work to do the will of God . " Beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord , " we are to be actually " changed into the same image from glory to glory , even as by the Spirit of the Lord . " * ( 2 Corinthians 3:18 ) We are to be transformed by the renewing of our minds , that we may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God . A real work is to be wrought in us and upon us . Besetting sins are to be conquered . Evil habits are to be overcome . Wrong dispositions and feelings are to be rooted out , and holy tempers and emotions are to be begotten . A positive transformation is to take place . So at least the Bible teaches . Now somebody must do this . Either we must do it for ourselves , or another must do it for us . We have most of us tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed ; then we discover from the Scriptures and from our own experience that it is a work we are utterly unable to do for ourselves , but that the Lord Jesus Christ has come on purpose to do it , and that He will do it for all who put themselves wholly into His hand , and trust Him to do it . Now under these circumstances , what is the part of the believer , and what is the part of the Lord ? Plainly the believer can do nothing but trust ; while the Lord , in whom he trusts , actually does the work intrusted to Him . Trusting and doing are certainly contrastive things , and often contradictory ; but are they contradictory in this case ? Manifestly not , because it is two different parties that are concerned . If we should say of one party in a transaction that he trusted his case to another , and yet attended to it himself , we should state a contradiction and an impossibility . But when we say of two parties in a transaction that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that other goes to work and does it , we are making a statement that is perfectly simple and harmonious . When we say , therefore , that in this higher life , mans part is to trust , and that God does the thing intrusted to Him , we do not surely present any very difficult or puzzling problem . <p> The preacher who is speaking on mans part in this matter can not speak of anything but surrender and trust , because this is positively all the man can do . We all agree about this . And yet such preachers are constantly criticized as though , in saying this , they had meant to imply there was no other part , and that therefore nothing but trusting is done . And the cry goes out that this doctrine of faith does away with all realities , that souls are just told to trust , and that is the end of it , and they sit down thenceforward in a sort of religious easy-chair , dreaming away a life fruitless of any actual results . All this misapprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preacher has neglected to state , or the hearer has failed to hear , the other side of the matter ; which is , that when we trust , the Lord works , and that a great deal is done , not by us , but by Him . Actual results are reached by our trusting , because our Lord undertakes the thing trusted to Him , and accomplishes it . We do not do anything , but He does it ; and it is all the more effectually done because of this . The puzzle as to the preaching of faith disappears entirely as soon as this is clearly seen . <p> On the other hand , the preacher who dwells on Gods side of the question is criticized on a totally different ground . He does not speak of trust , for the Lords part is not to trust , but to work . The Lord does the thing entrusted to Him . He disciplines and trains the soul by inward exercises and outward providences . He brings to bear all the resources of His wisdom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He makes everything in the life and circumstances of such a one subservient to the one great purpose of making him grow in grace , and of conforming him , day by day and hour by hour , to the image of Christ . He carries him through a process of transformation , longer or shorter , as his peculiar case may require , making actual and experimental the results for which the soul has trusted . We have dared , for instance , according to the command in Romans 6:11 , by faith to reckon ourselves " dead unto sin . " The Lord makes this a reality , and leads us to victory over self , by the daily and hourly discipline of His providences . Our reckoning is available only because God thus makes it real . And yet the preacher who dwells upon this practical side of the matter , and tells of Gods processes for making faiths reckonings experimental realities , is accused of contradicting the preaching of faith altogether , and of declaring only a process of gradual sanctification by works , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now , sanctification is both a sudden step of faith , and also a gradual process of works . It is a step as far as we are concerned ; it is a process as to Gods part . By a step of faith we get into Christ ; by a process we are made to grow up unto Him in all things . By a step of faith we put ourselves into the hands of the Divine Potter ; by a gradual process He makes us into a vessel unto His own honor , meet for His use , and prepared to every good work . <p> To illustrate all this : suppose I were to be describing to a person , who was entirely ignorant of the subject , the way in which a lump of clay is made into a beautiful vessel . I tell him first the part of the clay in the matter , and all I can say about this is , that the clay is put into the potters hands , and then lies passive there , submitting itself to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is really nothing else to be said about the clays part . But could my hearer argue from this that nothing else is done , because I say that this is all the clay can do ? If he is an intelligent hearer , he will not dream of doing so , but will say , " I understand . This is what the clay must do ; but what must the potter do ? " " Ah , " I answer , " now we come to the important part . The potter takes the clay thus abandoned to his working , and begins to mold and fashion it according to his own will . He kneads and works it , he tears it apart and presses it together again , he wets it and then suffers it to dry . Sometimes he works at it for hours together , sometimes he lays it aside for days and does not touch it . And then , when by all these processes he has made it perfectly pliable in his hands , he proceeds to make it up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheel , planes it and smooths it , and dries it in the sun , bakes it in the oven , and finally turns it out of his workshop , a vessel to his honor and fit for his use . " <p> Will my hearer be likely now to say that I am contradicting myself ; that a little while ago I had said the clay had nothing to do but lie passive in the potters hands , and that now I am putting upon it a great work which it is not able to perform ; and that to make itself into such a vessel is an impossible and hopeless undertaking ? Surely not . For he will see that , while before I was speaking of the clays part in the matter , I am now speaking of the potters part , and that these two are necessarily contrastive , but not in the least contradictory , and that the clay is not expected to do the potters work , but only to yield itself up to his working . <p> Nothing , it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two apparently contradictory sorts of teaching on this subject . What can be said about mans part in this great work , but that he must continually surrender himself and continually trust ? <p> But when we come to Gods side of the question , what is there that may not be said as to the manifold and wonderful ways in which He accomplishes the work intrusted to Him ? It is here that the growing comes in . The lump of clay would never grow into a beautiful vessel if it stayed in the clay-pit for thousands of years . But once put into the hands of a skillful potter , and , under his fashioning , it grows rapidly into a vessel to his honor . And so the soul , abandoned to the working of the Heavenly Potter , is changed rapidly from glory to glory into the image of the Lord by His Spirit . <p> Having , therefore , taken the step of faith by which you have put yourself wholly and absolutely into His hands , you must now expect Him to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have intrusted to Him may be different from your way . But He knows , and you must be satisfied . <p> I knew a lady who had entered into this life of faith with a great outpouring of the Spirit , and a wonderful flood of light and joy . She supposed , of course , this was a preparation for some great service , and expected to be put forth immediately into the Lords harvest field . Instead of this , almost at once her husband lost all his money , and she was shut up in her own house , to attend to all sorts of domestic duties , with no time or strength left for any Gospel work at all . She accepted the discipline , and yielded herself up as heartily to sweep , and dust , and bake , and sew , as she would have done to preach or pray or write for the Lord . And the result was that through this very training He made her into a vessel " meet for the masters use , and prepared unto every good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another lady , who had entered this life of faith under similar circumstances of wondrous blessing , and who also expected to be sent out to do some great work , was shut up with two peevish invalid nieces , to nurse , and humor , and amuse them all day long . Unlike the first lady , this one did not accept the training , but chafed and fretted , and finally rebelled , lost all her blessing , and went back into a state of sad coldness and misery . She had understood her part of trusting to begin with , but not understanding the divine process of accomplishing that for which she had trusted , she took herself out of the hands of the Heavenly Potter , and the vessel was marred on the wheel . <p> I believe many a vessel has been similarly marred by a want of understanding these things . The maturity of Christian experience can not be reached in a moment , but is the result of the work of Gods Holy Spirit , who , by His energizing and transforming power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . And we can not hope to reach this maturity in any other way than by yielding ourselves up utterly and willingly to His mighty working . But the sanctification the Scriptures urge as a present experience upon all believers does not consist in maturity of growth , but in purity of heart , and this may be as complete in the babe in Christ as in the veteran believer . <p> The lump of clay , from the moment it comes under the transforming hand of the potter , is , during each day and each hour of the process , just what the potter wants it to be at that hour or on that day , and therefore pleases him . But it is very far from being matured into the vessel he intends in the future to make it . <p> The little babe may be all that a babe could be , or ought to be , and may therefore perfectly please its mother , and yet it is very far from being what that mother would wish it to be when the years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect apple for June . It is the best apple that June can produce . But it is very different from the apple in October , which is a perfected apple . <p> Gods works are perfect in every stage of their growth . Mans works are never perfect until they are in every respect complete . <p> All that we claim then in this life of sanctification is , that by a step of faith we put ourselves into the hands of the Lord , for Him to work in us all the good pleasure of His will ; and that by a continuous exercise of faith we keep ourselves there . This is our part in the matter . And when we do it , and while we do it , we are , in the Scripture sense , truly pleasing to God , although it may require years of training and discipline to mature us into a vessel that shall be in all respects to His honor , and fitted to every good work . <p> Our part is the trusting , it is His to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , He never fails to do His , for no one ever trusted in the Lord and was confounded . Do not be afraid , then , that if you trust , or tell others to trust , the matter will end there . Trust is only the beginning and the continual foundation ; when we trust , the Lord works , and His work is the important part of the whole matter . And this explains that apparent paradox which puzzles so many . They say , " I labored yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me. " * ( 1 Corinthians 15:10 ) For we are to be his workmanship , not our own ( Ephesians 2:10 ) . <p> And in fact , when we come to look at it , only God , who created us at first , can re-create us , for He alone understands the " work of His own hands . " All efforts after self-creating , result in the marring of the vessel , and no soul can ever reach its highest fulfillment except through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counsel of his own will . " * ( Ephesians 1:11 ) <p> In this book I shall of course dwell mostly upon mans side in the matter , as I am writing for man , and in the hope of teaching believers how to fulfill their part of the great work . But I wish it to be distinctly understood all through , that unless I believed with all my heart in Gods effectual working on His side , not one word of this book would ever have been written . <h> The Scripturalness of This Life <p> When I approach this subject of the true Christian life , that life which is hid with Christ in God , so many thoughts struggle for utterance that I am almost speechless . Where shall I begin ? What is the most important thing to say ? How shall I make people read and believe ? The subject is so glorious , and human words seem so powerless ! But something I am impelled to say . The secret must be told . For it is one concerning that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John 5:4 ) that promised deliverance from all our enemies , for which every child of God longs and prays , but which seems so often and so generally to elude their grasp . May God grant me so to tell it , that every believer to whom this book shall come , may have his eyes opened to see the truth as it is in Jesus , and may be enabled to enter into possession of this glorious life for himself . <p> For sure I am that every converted soul longs for victory and rest , and nearly everyone feels instinctively , at times , that they are his birthright . Can you not remember , some of you , the shout of triumph your souls gave when you first became acquainted with the Lord Jesus , and had a glimpse of His mighty , saving power ? How sure you were of victory then ! How easy it seemed , to be more than conquerors , through Him that loved you . Under the leadership of a Captain who had never been foiled in battle , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of you , how different has been your real experience . The victories have been but few and fleeting , the defeats many and disastrous . You have not lived as you feel children of God ought to live . There has been a resting in a clear understanding of doctrinal truth , without pressing after the power and life thereof . There has been a rejoicing in the knowledge of things testified of in the Scriptures , without a living realization of the things themselves , consciously felt in the soul . Christ is believed in , talked about , and served , but He is not known as the souls actual and very life , abiding there forever , and revealing Himself there continually in His beauty . You have found Jesus as your Savior and your Master , and you have tried to serve Him and advance the cause of His kingdom . You have carefully studied the Holy Scriptures and have gathered much precious truth therefrom , which you have endeavored faithfully to practice . <p> But notwithstanding all your knowledge and all your activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly starving , and you cry out again and again for that bread and water of life which you saw promised in the Scriptures to all believers . In the very depths of your hearts you know that your experience is not a Scriptural experience ; that , as an old writer says , your religion is " but a talk to what the early Christians enjoyed , possessed , and lived in . " And your souls have sunk within you , as day after day , and year after year , your early visions of triumph have seemed to grow more and more dim , and you have been forced to settle down to the conviction that the best you can expect from your religion is a life of alternate failure and victory ; one hour sinning , and the next repenting ; and beginning again , only to fail again , and again to repent . <p> But is this all ? Had the Lord Jesus only this in His mind when He laid down His precious life to deliver you from your sore and cruel bondage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial deliverance ? Did He intend to leave you thus struggling along under a weary consciousness of defeat and discouragement ? Did He fear that a continuous victory would dishonor Him , and bring reproach on His name ? When all those declarations were made concerning His coming , and the work He was to accomplish , did they mean only this that you have experienced ? Was there a hidden reserve in each promise that was meant to deprive it of its complete fulfillment ? Did delivering us " out of the hands of our enemies " mean only a few of them ? Did " enabling us always to triumph " mean only sometimes ; or being " more than conquerors through him that loved us " * ( Romans 8:37 ) mean constant defeat and failure ? No , no , a thousand times no ! God is able to save unto the uttermost , and He means to do it . His promise , confirmed by His oath , was that " he would grant unto us , that we , being delivered out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in holiness and righteousness before him , all the days of our life . " * ( Luke 1:74-75 ) It is a mighty work to do , but our Deliverer is able to do it . He came to destroy the works of the devil , and dare we dream for a moment that He is not able or not willing to accomplish His own purposes ? <p> In the very outset , then , settle down on this one thing , that the Lord is able to save you fully , now , in this life , from the power and dominion of sin , and to deliver you altogether out of the hands of your enemies . If you do not think He is , search your Bible , and collect together every announcement or declaration concerning the purposes and object of His death on the cross . You will be astonished to find how full they are . Everywhere and always His work is said to be , to deliver us from our sins , from our bondage , from our defilement ; and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be only the limited and partial one with which the Church so continually tries to be satisfied . <p> Let me give you a few texts on this subject . When the angel of the Lord appeared unto Joseph in a dream , and announced the coming birth of the Savior , he said , " And thou shalt call his name JESUS : for he shall save his people from their sins . " * ( Matthew 1:21 ) <p> When Zacharias was " filled with the Holy Ghost " at the birth of his son , and " prophesied , " * ( Luke 1:67 ) he declared that God had visited His people in order to fulfil the promise and the oath He had made them , which promise was , " he would grant unto us , that we , being delivered out of the hand of our enemies , might serve him without fear , in holiness and righteousness before him , all the days of our life . " * ( Luke 1:74-75 ) <p> When Peter was preaching in the porch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Unto you first , God , having raised up his Son Jesus , sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities. " * ( Acts 3:26 ) <p> When Paul was telling out to the Ephesian church the wondrous truth that Christ had loved them so much as to give Himself for them , he went on to declare , that His purpose in and without blemish . " * ( Ephesians 5:26-27 ) <p> When Paul was seeking to instruct Titus , his own son after the common faith , concerning the grace of God , he declared that the object of that grace was to teach us " that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts , we should live soberly , righteously , and godly in this present world " * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason of of good works . " * ( Titus 2:14 ) <p> When Peter was urging upon the Christian , to whom he was writing , a holy and Christ-like walk , should follow his steps : Who did no sin , neither was guile found in his mouth . " * ( 1 Peter 2:21-22 stripes ye were healed . " * ( 1 Peter 2:24 ) <p> When Paul was contrasting in the Ephesians the walk suitable for a Christian , with the walk of an unbeliever , he sets before them the truth in Jesus as being this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man , which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts ; And be renewed in the and true holiness . " * ( Ephesians 4:22-24 ) <p> And when , in Romans 6 , he was answering forever the question as to continuing in sin , and showing how utterly foreign it was to the whole spirit and aim of the salvation of Jesus , he brings up the fact of our judicial death and resurrection with Christ as an unanswerable argument for our practical deliverance from it , and says , " God forbid . How shall we , that are dead to sin , not serve sin . " * ( Romans 6:6 ) <p> Dear Christians , will you receive the testimony of Scripture on this matter ? The same questions that troubled the Church in Pauls day are troubling it now : first , " Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound ? " * ( Romans 6:1 ) And second , " Do we then make void the law through faith ? " Shall not our answer to these be Pauls emphatic " God forbid " ; and his triumphant assertions that instead of making it void , " we establish the law " * ( Romans 3:31 after the Spirit . " * ( Romans 8:3-4 ) ? <p> Can we suppose for a moment that the holy God , who hates sin in the sinner , is willing to tolerate it in the Christian , and that He has even arranged the plan of salvation in such a way as to make it impossible for those who are saved from the guilt of sin to find deliverance from its power ? <p> As Dr. Chalmers well says : <p> Sin is that scandal which must be rooted out from the great spiritual household over which the Divinity rejoices . Strange administration , indeed , for sin to be so hateful to God as to lay all who had incurred it under death , and yet when readmitted into life that sin should be permitted ; and that what was before the object of destroying vengeance , should now become the object of an upheld and protected toleration . Now that the penalty is taken off , think you that it is possible the unchangeable God has so given up His antipathy to sin , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perseveringly indulge under the new arrangement in that which under the old destroyed him ? Does not the God who loved righteousness and hated iniquity six thousand years ago , bear the same love to righteousness and hatred to iniquity still ? I now breathe the air of loving-kindness from Heaven , and can walk before God in peace and graciousness ; shall I again attempt the incompatible alliance of two principles so adverse as that of an approving God and a persevering sinner ? How shall we , recovered from so awful a catastrophe , continue that which first involved us in it ? The cross of Christ , by the same mighty and decisive stroke wherewith it moved the curse of sin away from us , also surely moves away the power and the love of it from over us . <p> And not Dr. Chalmers only , but many other holy men of his generation and of our own , as well as of generations long past , have united in declaring that the redemption accomplished for us by our Lord Jesus Christ on the cross at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as from its guilt , and that He is able to save to the uttermost all who come unto God by Him . <p> A quaint old divine of the seventeenth century says : <p> There is nothing so contrary to God as sin , and God will not suffer sin always to rule His masterpiece , man . When we consider the infiniteness of Gods power for destroying that which is contrary to Him , who can believe that the devil must always stand and prevail ? I believe it is inconsistent and disagreeable with true faith for people to be Christians , and yet to believe that Christ , the eternal Son of God , to whom all power in heaven and earth is given , will suffer sin and the devil to have dominion over them . <p> But you will say no man by all the power he hath can redeem himself , and no man can live without sin . We will say , Amen , to it . But if men tell us that Gods power can not be effected , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin , then we can not agree ; nor I hope you neither . <p> Would you approve of it , if I should tell you that God puts forth His power to do such a thing , but the devil hinders Him ? That it is impossible for God to do it because the devil does not like it ? That it is impossible that any one should be free from sin because the devil hath got such a power in them that God can not cast him out ? This is lamentable doctrine , yet hath not this been preached ? It doth in plain terms say , though God doth interpose His power , it is impossible , because the devil hath so rooted sin in the nature of man . Is not man Gods creature , and can not He new make him , and cast sin out of him ? If you say sin is deeply rooted in man , I say so , too , yet not so deeply rooted but Christ Jesus hath entered so deeply into the root of the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his works , and to recover and redeem man into righteousness and holiness . Or else it is false that " he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him . " * ( Hebrews 7:25 ) We must throw away the Bible , if we say that it is impossible for God to deliver man out of sin . <p> We know , when our friends are in captivity , as in Turkey , or elsewhere , we pay our money for their redemption ; but we will not pay our money if they be kept in their fetters still . Would not any one think himself cheated to pay so much money for their redemption , and the bargain be made so that he shall be said to be redeemed , and be called a redeemed captive , but he must wear his fetters still ? How long ? As long as he hath a day to live . <p> This is for bodies , but now I am speaking of souls . Christ must be made to me redemption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner anywhere ?

I am poor ; I have nothing ; I can not redeem myself ; who will pay a price for me ? There is One come who hath paid a price for me . That is well ; that is good news , then I hope I shall come out of my captivity . What is His name , is He called a Redeemer ? So , then , I do expect the benefit of my redemption , and that I shall go out of my captivity . No , say they , you must abide in sin as long as you live . What ! must we never be delivered ?

It is the same old story that has filled with songs of triumph the daily lives of many saints of God throughout all ages ; and is now afresh being sounded forth to the unspeakable joy of weary and burdened souls . <p> Do not reject it , then , dear reader , until you have prayerfully searched the Scriptures to see whether these things be indeed so . Ask God to open the eyes of your understanding by His Spirit , hand in the heavenly places . " * ( Ephesians 1:19-20 ) And when you have begun to have some faint glimpses of this power , learn to look away utterly from your own weakness , and , putting your case into His hands , trust Him to deliver you . <p> In Psalms 8:6 , we are told that God made man to " have dominion over the works of his hand . " The fulfillment of this is declared in 2 Corinthians 2 , where the apostle cries , " thanks be unto God , which always causeth us to triumph in Christ . " * ( 2 Corinthians 2:14 ) If the maker of a machine should declare that he had made it to accomplish a certain purpose , and if upon trial it should be found incapable of accomplishing that purpose , we would all say of that maker that he was a fraud . <p> Surely then we will not dare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made , to accomplish the declared object for which he was created . Especially when the Scriptures are so full of the assertions that Christ has made it possible . <p> The only thing that can hinder is the creatures own failure to work in harmony with the plans of his Creator , and if this want of harmony can be removed , then God can work . Christ came to bring about an atonement between God and man , which should make it possible for God thus to work in man to " will and to do of His good pleasure . " * ( Philippians 2:13 ) Therefore we may be of good courage ; for the work Christ has undertaken He is surely able and willing to perform . Let us then " walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , " * ( giving glory to God ; And being fully persuaded that , what he had promised , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <h> The Life Defined <p> In my last chapter I tried to settle the question as to the scripturalness of the experience sometimes called the Higher Christian Life , but which to my own mind is best described in the words , the " life hid with Christ in God . " * ( Colossians 3:3 ) I shall now , therefore , consider it as a settled point that the Scriptures do set before the believer in the Lord Jesus a life of abiding rest and of continual victory , which is very far beyond the ordinary line of Christian experience ; and that in the Bible we have presented to us a Savior able to save us from the power of our sins , as really as He saves us from their guilt . <p> The point to be next considered is , as to what this hidden life consists in , and how it differs from every other sort of Christian experience . <p> And as to this , it is simply letting the Lord carry our burdens and manage our affairs for us , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are like a man who was toiling along the road , bending under a heavy burden , when a wagon overtook him , and the driver kindly offered to help him on his journey . He joyfully accepted the offer , but when seated , continued to bend beneath his burden , which he still kept on his shoulders . <p> " Why do you not lay down your burden ? " asked the kind-hearted driver . <p> " Oh ! " replied the man , " I feel that it is almost too much to ask you to carry me , and I could not think of letting you carry my burden too . " <p> And so Christians , who have given themselves into the care and keeping of the Lord Jesus , still continue to bend beneath the weight of their burden , and often go weary and heavy-laden throughout the whole length of their journey . <p> When I speak of burdens , I mean everything that troubles us , whether spiritual or temporal . <p> I mean , first of all , ourselves . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most difficult thing we have to manage is self . Our own daily living , our frames and feelings , our especial weaknesses and temptations , and our peculiar temperaments , our inward affairs of every kind , these are the things that perplex and worry us more than anything else , and that bring us oftenest into bondage and darkness . In laying off your burdens , therefore , the first one you must get rid of is yourself . You must hand yourself and all your inward experiences , your temptations , your temperament , your frames and feelings , all over into the care and keeping of your God , and leave them there . He made you , and therefore He understands you and knows how to manage you , and you must trust Him to do it . Say to Him , " Here , Lord , I abandon myself to Thee . I have tried in every way I could think of to manage myself , and to make myself what I know I ought to be , but have always failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou take entire possession of me . Work in me all the good pleasure of Thy will . Mould and fashion me into such a vessel as seemeth good to Thee . I leave myself in Thy hands , and I believe Thou wilt , according to Thy promise , make me into a vessel unto Thine honor , sanctified , and meet for the masters use , and prepared unto every good work.* ( 2 Timothy 2:21 ) " And here you must rest , trusting yourself thus to Him continually and absolutely . <p> Christians always commit the keeping of their souls for eternity to the Lord , because they know , without a shadow of a doubt , that they can not keep these themselves . But the things of this present life they take into their own keeping , and try to carry on their own shoulders , with the perhaps unconfessed feeling that it is a great deal to ask of the Lord to carry them , and that they can not think of asking Him to carry their burdens too . <p> I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It took away her sleep and her appetite , and there was danger of her health breaking down under it . One day , when it seemed especially heavy , she noticed lying on the table near her a little tract called , " Hannahs Faith . " Attracted by the title , she picked it up and began to read it , little knowing , however , that it was to create a revolution in her whole experience . <p> The story was of a poor woman who had been carried triumphantly through a life of unusual sorrow . She was giving the history of her life to a kind visitor on one occasion , and at the close the visitor said , feelingly , " Oh , Hannah , I do not see how you could bear so much sorrow ! " <p> " I did not bear it , " was the quick reply ; " the Lord bore it for me . " <p> " Yes , " said the visitor " that is the right way . You must take your troubles to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but we must do more than that ; we must leave them there . Most people , " she continued , " take their burdens to Him , but they bring them away with them again , and are just as worried and unhappy as ever . But I take mine , and I leave them with Him , and come away and forget them . And if the worry comes back , I take it to Him again ; I do this over and over , until at last I just forget that I have any worries , and am at perfect rest . " <p> My friend was very much struck with this plan and resolved to try it . The circumstances of her life she could not alter , but she took them to the Lord , and handed them over into His management ; and then she believed that He took it , and she left all the responsibility and the worry and anxiety with Him . As often as the anxieties returned she took them back ; and the result was that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in perfect peace in the midst of them . She felt that she had found out a blessed secret , and from that time she tried never again to carry he own burdens , nor to manage anything for herself . <p> And the secret she found so effectual in her outward affairs , she found to be still more effectual in her inward ones , which were in truth even more utterly unmanageable . She abandoned her whole self to the Lord , with all that she was and all that she had , and , believing that He took that which she had committed to Him , she ceased to fret and worry , and her life became all sunshine in the gladness of belonging to Him . And this was the Higher Christian Life ! It was a very simple secret she found out . Only this , that it was possible to obey Gods be made known unto God " * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the result would inevitably be , according to through Christ Jesus . " * ( Philippians 4:7 ) <p> There are many other things to be said about this life hid with Christ in God , many details as to what the Lord Jesus does for those who thus abandon themselves to Him . But the gist of the whole matter is here stated , and the soul that has got hold of this secret has found the key that will unlock the whole treasure-house of God . <p> And now I do trust that I have made you hunger for this blessed life . Would you not like to get rid of your burdens ? Do you not long to hand over the management of your unmanageable self into the hands of One who is able to manage you ? Are you not tired and weary , and does not the rest I speak of look sweet to you ? <p> Do you recollect the delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed at night , after a day of great exertion and weariness ? How delightful was the sensation of relaxing every muscle , and letting your body go in a perfect abandonment of ease and comfort . The strain of the day had ceased for a few hours at least , and the work of the day had been thrown off . You no longer had to hold up an aching head or a weary back . You trusted yourself to the bed in an absolute confidence , and it held you up , without effort , or strain , or even thought on your part . You rested . <p> But suppose you had doubted the strength or the stability of your bed , and had dreaded each moment to find it giving away beneath you and landing you on the floor ; could you have rested then ? Would not every muscle have been strained in a fruitless effort to hold yourself up , and would not the weariness have been greater than not to have gone to bed at all ? <p> Let this analogy teach you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your souls lie down upon His sweet will , as your bodies lie down in your beds at night . Relax every strain and lay off every burden . Let yourselves go in perfect abandonment of ease and comfort , sure that when He holds you up you are perfectly safe . <p> Your part is simply to rest . His part is to sustain you , and He can not fail . <p> Or take another analogy , which our Lord Himself has abundantly sanctioned , that of the child-life . For " Jesus called a little child unto him , and set him in kingdom of heaven . " * ( Matthew 18:2-3 ) <p> Now , what are the characteristics of a little child and how does he live ? He lives by faith , and his chiefest characteristic is thoughtlessness . His life is one long trust from years end to years end . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusts his teachers , he even trusts people often who are utterly unworthy of trust , because of the confidingness of his nature . And his trust is abundantly answered . He provides nothing for himself , and yet everything is provided . He takes no thought for the morrow , and forms no plans , and yet all his life is planned out for him , and he finds his paths made ready , opening out to him as he comes to them day by day , and hour by hour . He goes in and out of his fathers house with an unspeakable ease and abandonment , enjoying all the good things it contains , without having spent a penny in procuring them . Pestilence may walk through the streets of his city , but he regards it not . Famine and fire and war may rage around him , but under his fathers tender care he abides in utter unconcern and perfect rest . He lives in the present moment , and receives his life without question as it comes to him day by day from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy house , where there was only one adopted child , upon whom was lavished all the love and tenderness and care that human hearts could bestow or human means procure . And as I watched that child running in and out day by day , free and light-hearted , with the happy carelessness of childhood , I thought what a picture it was of our wonderful position as children in the house of our Heavenly Father . And I said to myself , " If nothing could so grieve and wound the loving hearts around her , as to see this little child beginning to be worried or anxious about herself in any way , about whether her food and clothes would be provided for her , or how she was to get her education or her future support , how much more must the great , loving heart of our God and Father be grieved and wounded at seeing His children taking so much anxious care and thought ! " And I understood why it was that our Lord had said to us so emphatically , " Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Luke 12:22 ) <p> Who is the best cared for in every household ? Is it not the little children ? And does not the least of all , the helpless baby , receive the largest share ? As a late writer has said , the baby " toils not , neither does he spin ; and yet he is fed , and clothed , and loved , and rejoiced in , " and none so much as he . <p> This life of faith , then , about which I am writing , consists in just this ; being a child in the Fathers house . And when this is said , enough is said to transform every weary , burdened life into one of blessedness and rest . <p> Let the ways of childish confidence and freedom from care , which so please you and win your hearts in your own little ones , teach you what should be your ways with God ; and leaving yourselves in His hands , learn to be literally " careful for nothing " * ( Philippians 4:6 ) ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peace of God , which passeth all understanding , shall keep as in a garrison your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus . " * ( Philippians 4:7 ) Notice the word " nothing " in the above passage , as covering all possible grounds for anxiety , both inward and outward . We are continually tempted to think it is our duty to be anxious about some things . Perhaps our thought will be , " Oh , yes , it is quite right to give up all anxiety in a general way ; and in spiritual matters , of course anxiety is wrong ; but there are things about which it would be a sin not to be anxious ; about our children , for instance , or those we love , or about our church affairs and the cause of truth , or about our business matters . It would show a great want of right feeling not to be anxious about such things as these . " Or else our thoughts take the other tack , and we say to ourselves , " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our outward affairs to the Lord , but when it comes to our inward lives , our religious experiences , our temptations , our besetting sins , our growth in grace , and all such things , these we ought to be anxious about ; for if we are not , they will be sure to be neglected . " <p> To such suggestions , and to all similar ones , the answer is found in our text <p> In Matthew 6:25-34 , our Lord illustrates this being without anxiety , by telling us to behold the fowls of the air and the lilies of the field , as examples of the sort of life He would have us live . As the birds rejoice in the care of their God and are fed , and as the lilies grow in His sunlight , so must we , without anxiety , and without fear . Let the sparrows speak to us : <p> " I am only tiny sparrow , A bird of low degree ; My life is of little value , But the dear Lord cares for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I neither sow nor reap ; God gives me a sparrows portion , But never a seed to keep . <p> " I know there are many sparrows ; All over the world they are found ; But our heavenly Father knowethWhen one of us falls to the ground . <p> " Though small , we are never forgotten ; Though weak , we are never afraid ; For we know the dear Lord keepethThe life of the creatures He made . <p> " I fly through the thickest forest , I light on many a spray ; I have no chart nor compass , But I never lose my way . <p> And I fold my wing at twilightWherever I happen to be ; For the Father is always watching , And no harm will come to me . <p> I am only a little sparrow , A bird of low degree , But I know the Father loves me ; Have you less faith than we ? " <h> How to Enter In <p> Having tried to settle the question as to the scripturalness of the experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little of what it is ; the next point is as to how it is to be reached and realized . <p> And first , I would say that this blessed life must not be looked upon in any sense as an attainment but as an obtainment . We can not earn it , we can not climb up to it , we can not win it ; we can do nothing but ask for it and receive it . It is the gift of God in Christ Jesus . And where a thing is a gift , the only course left for the receiver is to take it and thank the giver . We never say of a gift , " See to what I have attained , " and boast of our skill and wisdom in having attained it ; but we say , " See what has been given me , " and boast of the love and wealth and generosity of the giver . And everything in our salvation is a gift . From beginning to end , God is the giver and we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do great things , but to those who " receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness , " * ( Romans 5:17 ) that the richest promises are made . <p> In order , therefore , to enter into a realized experience of this interior life , the soul must be in a receptive attitude , fully recognizing the fact that it is to be Gods gift in Christ Jesus , and that it can not be gained by any efforts or works of our own . This will simplify the matter exceedingly ; and the only thing left to be considered then will be to discover upon whom God bestows this gift , and how they are to receive it . And to this I would answer in short , that He bestows it only upon the fully consecrated soul , and that it is to be received by faith . <p> Consecration is the first thing . Not in any legal sense , not in order to purchase or deserve the blessing , but to remove the difficulties out of the way and make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lump of clay to be made into a beautiful vessel , it must be entirely abandoned to the potter , and must lie passive in his hands . And in order for a soul to be made into a vessel unto Gods honor , " sanctified , and meet for the masters use , and prepared unto every good work , " * ( 2 Timothy 2:21 ) it must be entirely abandoned to Him , and must lie passive in His hands . This is manifest at the first glance . <p> I was once trying to explain to a physician , who had charge of a large hospital , what consecration meant , and its necessity , but he seemed unable to understand . At last I said to him , " Suppose , in going your rounds among your patients , you should meet with one man who entreated you earnestly to take his case under your especial care in order to cure him , but who should at the same time refuse to tell you all the symptoms , or to take all your prescribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite willing to follow your directions as to certain things , because they commend themselves to my mind as good , but in other matters I prefer judging for myself and following my own directions. What would you do in such a case ? " I asked . <p> " Do ! " he replied with indignation , " do ! I would soon leave such a man as that to his own care . For of course , " he added , " I could do nothing for him , unless he would put his whole case into my hands without any reserves , and would obey my directions implicitly . " <p> " It is necessary then , " I said , " for doctors to be obeyed , if they are to have any chance to cure their patients ? " <p> " Implicitly obeyed ! " was his emphatic reply . <p> " And that is consecration , " I continued . " God must have the whole case put into His hands without any reserves , and His directions must be implicitly followed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I see it ! And I will do it . God shall have His own way with me from henceforth . " <p> Perhaps to some minds the word " abandonment " might express this idea better . But whatever word we use , we mean an entire surrender of the whole being to God ; spirit , soul , and body placed under His absolute control , for Him to do with us just what He pleases . We mean that the language of our soul , under all circumstances , and in view of every act , is to be , " Thy will be done . " We mean the giving up of all liberty of choice . We mean a life of inevitable obedience . <p> To a soul ignorant of God , this may look hard . But to those who know Him , it is the happiest and most restful of lives . He is our Father , and He loves us , and He knows just what is best , and therefore , of course , His will is the very most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do not understand how it is that Satan has succeeded in blinding the eyes of the Church to this fact . But it really would seem as if Gods own children were more afraid of His will than of anything else in life ; His lovely , lovable will , which only means loving-kindnesses and tender mercies , and blessings unspeakable to their souls . I wish I could only show to everyone the unfathomable sweetness of the will of God . Heaven is a place of infinite bliss because His will is perfectly done there , and our lives share in this bliss just in proportion as His will is perfectly done in them . He loves us , loves us , and the will of love is always blessing for its loved one . Some of us know what it is to love , and we know that could we only have our way , our beloved ones would be overwhelmed with blessings . All that is good , and sweet , and lovely in life would be poured out upon them from our lavish hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will for them . And if this is the way of love with us , how much more must it be so with our God , who is love itself . Could we but for one moment get a glimpse into the mighty depths of His love , our hearts would spring out to meet His will , and embrace it as our richest treasure ; and we would abandon ourselves to it with an enthusiasm of gratitude and joy , that such a wondrous privilege could be ours . <p> A great many Christians actually seem to think that all their Father in heaven wants is a chance to make them miserable , and to take away all their blessings , and they imagine , poor souls , that if they hold on to things in their own will , they can hinder Him from doing this . I am ashamed to write the words , and yet we must face a fact which is making wretched hundreds of lives . <p> A Christian lady who had this feeling , was once expressing to a friend how impossible she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and how afraid she should be to do it . She was the mother of only one little boy , who was the heir to a great fortune , and the idol of her heart . After she had stated her difficulties fully , her friend said , " Suppose your little Charley should come running to you tomorrow and say , Mother , I have made up my mind to let you have your own way with me from this time forward . I am always going to obey you , and I want you to do just whatever you think best with me . I know you love me , and I am going to trust myself to your love. How would you feel towards him ? Would you say to yourself , Ah , now I shall have a chance to make Charley miserable . I will take away all his pleasures , and fill his life with every hard and disagreeable thing I can find . I will compel him to do just the things that are the most difficult for him to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Oh , no , no , no ! " exclaimed the indignant mother . " You know I would not . You know I would hug him to my heart and cover him with kisses , and would hasten to fill his life with all that was sweetest and best . " <p> " And are you more tender and more loving than God ? " asked her friend . <p> " Ah , no , " was the reply , " I see my mistake , and I will not be afraid of saying Thy will be done , to my Heavenly Father , any more than I would want my Charley to be afraid of saying it to me . " <p> Better and sweeter than health , or friends , or money , or fame , or ease , or prosperity , is the adorable will of our God . It gilds the darkest hours with a divine halo , and sheds brightest sunshine on the gloomiest paths . He always reigns who has made it his kingdom ; and nothing can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but a glorious privilege that is opening before you when I tell you that the first step you must take in order to enter into the life hid with Christ in God , is that of entire consecration . I can not have you look at it as a hard and stern demand . You must do it gladly , thankfully , enthusiastically . You must go in on what I call the privilege side of consecration ; and I can assure you , from a blessed experience , that you will find it the happiest place you have ever entered yet . <p> Faith is the next thing . Faith is an absolutely necessary element in the reception of any gift ; for let our friends give a thing to us ever so fully , it is not really ours until we believe it has been given and claim it as our own . Above all , this is true in gifts which are purely mental or spiritual . Love may be lavished upon us by another without stint or measure , but until we believe that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose most Christians understand this principle in reference to the matter of their forgiveness . They know that the forgiveness of sins through Jesus might have been preached to them forever , but it would never have become theirs consciously until they believed this preaching , and claimed the forgiveness as their own . But when it comes to living the Christian life , they lose sight of this principle , and think that , having been saved by faith , they are now to live by works and efforts ; and instead of continuing to receive , they are now to begin to do . This makes our declaration that the life hid with Christ in God is to be entered by faith , seem perfectly unintelligible to them . And yet it is plainly declared , that " As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord , so walk ye in him . " * ( Colossians 2:6 ) We received Him by faith , and by faith alone ; therefore we are to walk in Him by faith , and by faith alone . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just the same as the faith by which we were translated out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of Gods dear Son ( Colossians 1:13 ) , only it lays hold of a different thing . Then we believed that Jesus was our Savior from the guilt of sin , and according to our faith it was unto us . Now we must believe that He is our Savior from the power of sin , and according to our faith it shall be unto us . Then we trusted Him for our justification , and it became ours ; now we must trust Him for our sanctification , and it shall become ours also . Then we took Him as a Savior in the future from the penalties of our sins ; now we must take Him as a Savior in the present from the bondage of our sins . Then He was our Redeemer , now He is to be our Life . Then He lifted us out of the pit , now He is to seat us in heavenly places with Himself . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and judicially I know that every believer has everything the minute he is converted . But experimentally nothing is his until by faith he claims it . " Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon , that have I given unto you . " * ( Joshua 1:3 ) God " hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ , " * ( Ephesians 1:3 ) but until we set the foot of faith upon them they do not practically become ours . " According to your faith " * ( Matthew 9:29 ) is always the limit and the rule . <p> But this faith of which I am speaking must be a present faith . No faith that is exercised in the future tense amounts to anything . A man may believe forever that his sins will be forgiven at some future time , and he will never find peace . He has to come to the now belief , and say by faith , " My sins are now forgiven , " before he can live the new life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a future deliverance from the power of sin , will ever lead a soul into the life we are describing . The enemy delights in this future faith , for he knows it is powerless to accomplish any practical results . But he trembles and flees when the soul of the believer dares to claim a present deliverance , and to reckon itself now to be free from his power . <p> To sum up , then : in order to enter into this blessed interior life of rest and triumph , you have two steps to take : first , entire abandonment ; and second , absolute faith . No matter what may be the complications of your peculiar experience , no matter what your difficulties or your surroundings or your associations , these two steps , definitely taken and unwaveringly persevered in , will certainly bring you out sooner or later into the green pastures and still waters of this higher Christian life . You may be sure of this . And if you will let every other consideration go , and simply devote your attention to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , your progress will be rapid and your soul will reach its desired haven far sooner than now you can think possible . <p> Shall I repeat the steps , that there may be no mistake ? You are a child of God , and long to please Him . You love your precious Savior , and are sick and weary of the sin that grieves Him . You long to be delivered from its power . Everything you have hitherto tried has failed to deliver you , and now in your despair you are asking if it can indeed be , as these happy people say , that the Lord is able and willing to deliver you . Surely you know in your very soul that He is ; that to save you out of the hand of all your enemies is in fact just the very thing He came to do . Then trust Him . Commit your case to Him in an absolute abandonment , and believe that He undertakes it ; and at once , knowing what He is and what He has said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you believed at first that He delivered you from the guilt of sin because He said so , believe now that He delivers you from the power of sin because He says so . Let your faith now lay hold of a new power in Christ . You have trusted Him as your dying Savior , now trust Him as your living Savior . Just as much as He came to deliver you from future punishment , did He also come to deliver you from present bondage . Just as truly as He came to bear your sins for you , has He come to live His life in you . You are as utterly powerless in the one case as in the other . You could as easily have got yourself rid of your own sins , as you could now accomplish for yourself practical righteousness . Christ , and Christ only , must do both for you , and your part in both cases is simply to give the thing to Him to do , and then believe that He does it . <p> A lady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was seeking in great darkness and perplexity to enter in , said to the friend who was trying to help her , " You all say , Abandon yourself , and trust , abandon yourself , and trust , but I do not know how . I wish you would just do it out loud , so that I may see how you do it . " <p> Shall I do it out loud for you ? <p> " Lord Jesus , I believe that Thou art able and willing to deliver me from all the care , and unrest and bondage of my Christian life . I believe Thou didst die to set me free , not only in the future , but now and here . I believe Thou art stronger than Satan , and that Thou canst keep me , even me , in my extreme of weakness , from falling into his snares or yielding obedience to his commands . And , Lord , I am going to trust Thee to keep me . I have tried keeping myself , and have failed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I will trust Thee . I will give myself to Thee ; I keep back no reserves . Body , soul , and spirit , I present myself to Thee , a worthless lump of clay , to be made into anything Thy love and Thy wisdom shall choose . And now , I am Thine . I believe Thou dost accept that which I present to Thee ; I believe that this poor , weak , foolish heart has been taken possession of by Thee , and Thou hast even at this very moment begun to work in me to will and to do of Thy good pleasure . I trust Thee utterly , and I trust Thee now ! " <p> Are you afraid to take this step ? Does it seem too sudden , too much like a leap in the dark ? Do you not know that the steps of faith always " fall on the seeming void , but find the rock beneath " ? <p> A man , having to descend a well by a rope , found , to his horror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too short . He had reached the end , and yet was , he estimated , about thirty feet from the bottom of the well . He knew not what to do . He had not the strength or skill to climb up the rope , and to let go was to be dashed to pieces . His arms began to fail , and at last he decided that as he could not hold on much longer , he might as well let go and meet his fate at once . He resigned himself to destruction , and loosened his grasp . He fell ! To the bottom of the well <p> Just three inches ! <p> If ever your feet are to touch the " rock beneath , " you must let go of every holding-place and drop into God ; for there is no other way . And to do it now may save you months and even years of strain and weariness . <p> In all the old castles of England there used to be a place called the keep . It was always the strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were hidden all who were weak and helpless and unable to defend themselves in times of danger . Had you been a timid , helpless woman in such a castle during a time of siege , would it have seemed to you a leap in the dark to have hidden yourself there ? Would you have been afraid to do it ? And shall we be afraid to hide ourselves in the keeping power of our Divine Keeper , who neither slumbers nor sleeps , and who has promised to preserve our going out and our coming in , from this time forth and even forever more ? <h> Difficulties Concerning Consecration <p> It is very important that Christians should not be ignorant of the devices of the enemy ; for he stands ready to oppose every onward step of the souls progress . And especially is he busy when he sees a believer awakened to a hunger and thirst after righteousness , and seeking to reach out to apprehend all the fulness that is in the Lord Jesus Christ for him . <p> One of the first difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning consecration . The seeker after holiness is told that he must consecrate himself ; and he endeavors to do so . But at once he meets with a difficulty . He has done it , as he thinks , and yet does not feel differently from before ; nothing seems changed , as he has been led to expect it would be , and he is completely baffled , and asks the question almost despairingly , " How am I to know when I am consecrated ? " <p> The one grand temptation which has met such a soul at this juncture is the temptation which never fails to assert itself on every possible occasion , and generally with marked success , and that is in reference to feeling . The soul can not believe it is consecrated until it feels that it is ; and because it does not feel that God has taken it in hand , it can not believe that He has . As usual , it puts feeling first and faith second . Now , Gods invariable rule is faith first and feeling second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable when we seek to make it different . <p> The way to meet this temptation , then , in reference to consecration , is simply to take Gods side in the matter , and to put faith before feeling . Give yourself to the Lord definitely and fully , according to your present light , asking the Holy Spirit to show you all that is contrary to God , either in your heart or life . If He shows you anything , give it to the Lord immediately , and say in reference to it , " Thy will be done . " If He shows you nothing , then you must believe that there is nothing , and must conclude that you have given Him all . Then you must believe that He takes you . You positively must not wait to feel either that you have given yourself or that He has taken you . You must simply believe it , and reckon it to be the case . <p> If you were to give an estate to a friend , you would have to give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An estate is not a thing that can be picked up and handed over to another ; the gift of it and its reception are altogether a mental transaction and therefore one of faith . Now , if you should give an estate one day to a friend , and then should go away and wonder whether you really had given it , and whether he had actually taken it and considered it his own , and should feel it necessary to go the next day and renew the gift ; and if on the third day you should still feel a similar uncertainty about it , and should again go and renew the gift , and on the fourth day go through a like process , and so on , day after day for months and years , what would your friend think , and what at last would be the condition of your own mind in reference to it ? Your friend certainly would begin to doubt whether you ever had intended to give it to him at all ; and you yourself would be in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the estate was yours , or his , or whose it was . <p> Now , is not this very much the way in which you have been acting towards God in this matter of consecration ? You have given yourself to Him over and over daily , perhaps for months , but you have invariably come away from your seasons of consecration wondering whether you really have given yourself after all , and whether He has taken you ; and because you have not felt any differently , you have concluded at last , after many painful tossings , that the thing has not been done . Do you know , dear believer , that this sort of perplexity will last forever , unless you cut it short by faith ? You must come to the point of reckoning the matter to be an accomplished and settled thing , and leaving it there , before you can possibly expect any change of feeling what ever . <p> The very law of offerings to the Lord settles this as a primary fact , that everything which is given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart from all other things , and can not without sacrilege be put to any other uses . " Notwithstanding no devoted thing , that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath , both of man and beast , and of the field of his possession , shall be sold or redeemed : every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD . " * ( Leviticus 27:28 ) Having once given it to the Lord , the devoted thing henceforth was reckoned by all Israel as being the Lords , and no one dared to stretch forth a hand to retake it . The giver might have made his offering very grudgingly and half-heartedly , but having made it , the matter was taken out of his hands altogether , and the devoted thing by Gods own law became " most holy unto the LORD . " <p> It was not the intention of the giver that made it holy , but the holiness of the receiver . " The altar sanctifies the gift . " And an offering once laid upon the altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can imagine an offerer who had deposited a gift , beginning to search his heart as to his sincerity and honesty in doing it , and coming back to the priest to say that he was afraid after all he had not given it right , or had not been perfectly sincere in giving it . I feel sure that the priest would have silenced him at once with saying , " As to how you gave your offering , or what were your motives in giving it , I do not know . The facts are that you did give it , and that it is the Lords , for every devoted thing is most holy unto Him . It is too late to recall the transaction now . " And not only the priest but all Israel would have been aghast at the man who , having once given his offering , should have reached out his hand to take it back . And yet , day after day , earnest-hearted Christians , who would have shuddered at such an act of sacrilege on the part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar act , by giving themselves to the Lord in solemn consecration , and then through unbelief taking back that which they have given . <p> Because God is not visibly present to the eye , it is difficult to feel that a transaction with Him is real . I suppose if , when we made our acts of consecration , we could actually see Him present with us , we should feel it to be a very real thing , and would realize that we had given our word to Him and could not dare to take it back , no matter how much we might wish to do so . Such a transaction would have to us the binding power that a spoken promise to an earthly friend always has to a man of honor . And what we need is to see that Gods presence is a certain fact always , and that every act of our soul is done right before Him , and that a word spoken in prayer is as really spoken to Him , as if our eyes could see Him and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have such vague conceptions of our relations with Him , and shall feel the binding force of every word we say in His presence . <p> I know some will say here , " Ah , yes ; but if He would only speak to me , and say that He took me when I gave myself to Him , I would have no trouble then in believing it . " No , of course you would not ; but He does not generally say this until the soul has first proved its loyalty by believing what He has already said . It is he that believeth who has the witness , not he that doubteth . And by His very command to us to present ourselves to Him a living sacrifice , He has pledged Himself to receive us . I can not conceive of an honorable man asking another to give him a thing which , after all , he was doubtful about taking ; still less can I conceive of a loving parent acting so towards a darling child . " My son , give me thine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure warrant for knowing that the moment the heart is given , it will be taken by the One who has commanded the gift . We may , nay we must , feel the utmost confidence then that when we surrender ourselves to the Lord , according to His own command , He does then and there receive us , and from that moment we are His . A real transaction has taken place , which can not be violated without dishonor on our part , and which we know will not be violated by Him . <p> " Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God , and to walk in his ways , and to keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his judgments , and to hearken unto his voice : And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people , as he hath promised thee , and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God , as he hath spoken . " <p> When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will walk in His ways and keep His commandments , He avouches us to be His , and that we shall keep all His commandments . And from that moment He takes possession of us . This has always been His principle of working , and it continues to be so . " Every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD . " * ( Leviticus 26:27 ) This seems to me so plain as scarcely to admit of a question . <p> But if the soul still feels in doubt or difficulty , let me refer you to a New Testament declaration which approaches the subject from a different side , but which settles it , I think , quite as definitely . It is in 1 John we desired of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be entirely consecrated to Him ? There can be , of course , but one answer to this , for He has commanded it . Is it not also according to His will that He should work in you to will and to do of His good pleasure ? This question also can have but one answer , for He has declared it to be His purpose . You know , then , that these things are according to His will , therefore on Gods own word you are obliged to know that He hears you ; and knowing this much , you are compelled to go further and know that you have the petitions that you have desired of Him . That you have , I saynot will have , or may havebut have now in actual possession . It is thus that we " obtain promises " by faith ( Hebrews 11:33 ) . It is thus that we have " access by faith " into the grace that is given us in our Lord Jesus Christ ( Romans 5:2 ) . It is thus , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " purified by faith , " and are enabled to live by faith , to stand by faith , to walk by faith . <p> I desire to make this subject so plain and practical that no one need have any further difficulty about it , and therefore I will repeat again just what must be the acts of your soul in order to bring you out of this difficulty about consecration . <p> I suppose that you have trusted the Lord Jesus for the forgiveness of your sins , and know something of what it is to belong to the family of God , and to be made an heir of God through faith in Christ . And now you feel springing up in your soul the longing to be conformed to the image of your Lord . In order for this , you know there must be an entire surrender of yourself to Him , that He may work in you all the good pleasure of His will ; and you have tried over and over to do it , but hitherto without any apparent success . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . What you must do now is to come once more to Him in a surrender of your whole self to His will , as complete as you know how to make it . You must ask Him to reveal to you by His Spirit any hidden rebellion ; and if He reveals nothing , then you must believe that there is nothing , and that the surrender is complete . This must , then , be considered a settled matter . You have abandoned yourself to the Lord , and from henceforth you do not in any sense belong to yourself ; you must never even so much as listen to a suggestion to the contrary . If the temptation comes to wonder whether you really have completely surrendered yourself , meet it with an assertion that you have . Do not even argue the matter . Repel any such idea instantly and with decision . You meant it then , you mean it now , you have really done it . Your emotions may clamor against the surrender , but your will must hold firm . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that purpose , and your purpose , or will , is therefore the only thing you need attend to . <p> The surrender , then , having been made , never to be questioned or recalled , the next point is to believe that God takes that which you have surrendered , and to reckon that it is His . Not that it will be at some future time , but is now ; and that He has begun to work in you " to will and to do of his good pleasure . " * ( Philippians 2:13 ) And here you must rest . There is nothing more for you to do , for you are the Lords now , absolutely and entirely in His hands , and He has undertaken the whole care and management and forming of you ; and will , according to His word , work in you " that which is wellpleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ . " * ( Hebrews 13:21 ) But you must hold steadily here . If you begin to question your surrender , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce a wavering experience , and He can not work . But while you trust He works , and the result of His working always is to change you into the image of Christ , from glory to glory , by His mighty Spirit . <p> Do you , then , now at this moment surrender yourself wholly to Him ? You answer , Yes . Then , my dear friend , begin at once to reckon that you are His ; that He has taken you , and that He is working in you " to will and to do of his good pleasure . " And keep on reckoning this . You will find it a great help to put your reckoning into words , and to say over and over to yourself and to your God , " Lord , I am Thine ; I do yield myself up to Thee entirely , and I believe thatTthou dost take me . I leave myself with Thee . Work in me all the good pleasure of Thy will , and I will only lie still in Thy hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily definite act of your will , and many times a day recur to it , as being your continual attitude before Him . Confess it to yourself . Confess it to your God . Confess it to your friends . Avouch the Lord to be your God continually and unwaveringly , and declare your purpose of walking in His ways and keeping His statutes ; and you will find in practical experience that He has avouched you to be His peculiar people and that you shall keep all His commandments , and that you will be " an holy people unto the LORD thy God , as he hath spoken . " * ( Deuteronomy 26:19 ) <p> A few simple rules may be found helpful here . I would advise the use of them in daily times of devotion , making them the definite test and attitude of the soul , until the light shines clearly on this matter . <p> I. Express in definite words your faith in Christ as your Savior ; and acknowledge definitely that you believe He has reconciled you to God ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be all the Lords , body , soul , and spirit ; and to obey Him in everything where His will is made known ( Romans 12:12 ) . <p> IV . Believe and continue to believe , against all seemings , that God takes possession of that which you thus abandon to Him , and that He will henceforth work in you to will and to do of His good pleasure , unless you consciously frustrate His grace ( 2 Corinthians 6:17-18 ; Philippians 2:13 ) . <p> V. Pay no attention to your feelings as a test of your relations with God , but simply attend to the state of your will and of your faith . And count all these steps you are now taking as settled , though the enemy may make it seem otherwise ( Hebrews 10:22-38 ) . <p> VI . Never , under any circumstances , give way for one single moment to doubt or discouragement . Remember , that all discouragement is from the devil , and refuse to admit it ( John 14:1,27 ) . <p> VII . Cultivate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat often , " I am all the Lords and He is working in me now to will and to do of His good pleasure " ( Hebrews 13:21 ) . <h> Difficulties Concerning Faith <p> The next step after consecration , in the souls progress out of the wilderness of Christian experience , into the land that floweth with milk and honey , is that of faith . And here , as in the first step , the enemy is very skilful in making difficulties and interposing obstacles . <p> The child of God , having had his eyes opened to see the fulness there is in Jesus for him , and having been made to long to appropriate that fulness to himself , is met with the assertion on the part of every teacher to whom he applies , that this fulness is only to be received by faith . But the subject of faith is involved in such a hopeless mystery in his mind , that this assertion , instead of throwing light upon the way of entrance , only seems to make it more difficult and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be by faith , " he says , " for I know that everything in the Christian life is by faith . But then , that is just what makes it so hard , for I have no faith , and I do not even know what it is , nor how to get it . " And , baffled at the very outset by this insuperable difficulty , he is plunged into darkness , and almost despair . <p> This trouble all arises from the fact that the subject of faith is very generally misunderstood ; for in reality faith is the plainest and most simple thing in the world , and the most easy of attainment . <p> Your idea of faith , I suppose , has been something like this . You have looked upon it as in some way a sort of thing , either a religious exercise of soul , or an inward gracious disposition of heart ; something tangible , in fact , which , when you have got , you can look at and rejoice over , and use as a passport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase His gifts . And you have been praying for faith , expecting all the while to get something like this , and never having received any such thing , you are insisting upon it that you have no faith . Now faith , in fact , is not in the least this sort of thing . It is nothing at all tangible . It is simply believing God , and , like sight , it is nothing apart from its object . You might as well shut your eyes and look inside to see whether you have sight , as to look inside to discover whether you have faith . You see something , and thus know that you have sight ; you believe something , and thus know that you have faith . For , as sight is only seeing , so faith is only believing . And as the only necessary thing about seeing is , that you see the thing as it is , so the only necessary thing about believing is , at you believe the thing as it is . The virtue does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe . If you believe the truth you are saved ; if you believe a lie you are lost . The believing in both cases is the same ; the things believed in are exactly opposite , and it is this which makes the mighty difference . Your salvation comes , not because your faith saves you , but because it links you on to the Savior who saves ; and your believing is really nothing but the link . <p> I do beg of you to recognize , then , the extreme simplicity of faith ; that it is nothing more nor less than just believing God when He says He either has done something for us , or will do it ; and then trusting Him to do it . It is so simple that it is hard to explain . If any one asks me what it means to trust another to do a piece of work for me , I can only answer that it means letting that other one do it , and feeling it perfectly unnecessary for me to do it myself . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others in this way , and has felt perfect rest in thus trusting , because of the confidence we have had in those who have undertaken to do it . How constantly do mothers trust their most precious infants to the care of nurses , and feel no shadow of anxiety ? How continually we are all of us trusting our health and our lives , without a thought of fear , to cooks and coachmen , engine drivers , railway conductors , and all sorts of paid servants , who have us completely at their mercy , and could plunge us into misery or death in a moment , if they chose to do so , or even if they failed in the necessary carefulness ? All this we do , and make no fuss about it . Upon the slightest acquaintance , often , we thus put our trust in people , requiring only the general knowledge of human nature , and the common rules of human intercourse ; and we never feel as if we were doing anything in the least remarkable . <p> You have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it continually . You would not be able to live in this world and go through the customary routine of life a single day , if you could not trust your fellow-men . And it never enters into your head to say you can not . <p> But yet you do not hesitate to say , continually , that you can not trust your God ! <p> I wish you would just now try to imagine yourself acting in your human relations as you do in your spiritual relations . Suppose you should begin tomorrow with the notion in your head that you could not trust anybody , because you had no faith . When you sat down to breakfast you would say , " I can not eat anything on this table , for I have no faith , and I can not believe the cook has not put poison in the coffee , or that the butcher has not sent home diseased meat . " So you would go starving away . Then when you went out to your daily avocations , you would say , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no faith , and therefore I can not trust the engineer , nor the conductor , nor the builders of the carriages , nor the managers of the road . " So you would be compelled to walk everywhere , and grow unutterably weary in the effort , besides being actually unable to reach many of the places you could have reached in the train . Then , when your friends met you with any statements , or your business agent with any accounts , you would say , " I am very sorry that I can not believe you , but I have no faith , and never can believe anybody . " If you opened a newspaper you would be forced to lay it down again , saying , " I really can not believe a word this paper says , for I have no faith ; I do not believe there is any such person as the queen , for I never saw her ; nor any such country as Ireland , for I was never there . And I have no faith , so of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually felt and touched myself . It is a great trial , but I can not help it , for I have no faith . " <p> Just picture such a day as this , and see how disastrous it would be to yourself , and what utter folly it would appear to any one who should watch you through the whole of it . Realize how your friends would feel insulted , and how your servants would refuse to serve you another day . And then ask yourself the question , if this want of faith in your fellow-men would be so dreadful , and such utter folly , what must it be when you tell God that you have no power to trust Him nor to believe His word ; that " it is a great trial , but you can not help it , for you have no faith " ? <p> Is it possible that you can trust your fellow-men and can not trust your God ? That you can receive the " witness of men , " and can not receive the " witness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can believe mans records , and can not believe Gods record ? That you can commit your dearest earthly interests to your weak , failing fellow-creatures without a fear , and are afraid to commit your spiritual interests to the blessed Savior who shed His blood for the very purpose of saving you , and who is declared to be " able also to save you to the uttermost " * ( Hebrews 7:25 ) ? <p> Surely , surely , dear believer , you , whose very name of believer implies that you can believe , will never again dare to excuse yourself on the plea of having no faith . For when you say this , you mean of course that you have no faith in God , since you are not asked to have faith in yourself , and you would be in a very wrong condition of soul if you had . Let me beg of you then , when you think or say these things , always to complete the sentence and say , " I have no faith in God , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon become so dreadful to you , that you will not dare to continue it . <p> But you say , I can not believe without the Holy Spirit . Very well ; will you conclude that your want of faith is because of the failure of the blessed Spirit to do His work ? For if it is , then surely you are not to blame , and need feel no condemnation ; and all exhortations to you to believe are useless . <p> But , no ! Do you not see that , in taking up this position , that you have no faith and can not believe , you are not only " making God a liar , " but you are also manifesting an utter want of confidence in the Holy Spirit ? For He is always ready to help our infirmities . We never have to wait for Him , He is always waiting for us . And I for my part have such absolute confidence in the blessed Holy Ghost , and in His being always ready to do His work , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can believe now , at this very moment , and that if you do not , it is not the Spirits fault , but your own . <p> Put your will then over on to the believing side . Say , " Lord I will believe , I do believe , " and continue to say it . Insist upon believing , in the face of every suggestion of doubt with which you may be tempted . Out of your very unbelief , throw yourself headlong on to the word and promises of God , and dare to abandon yourself to the keeping and saving power of the Lord Jesus . If you have ever trusted a precious interest in the hands of any earthly friend , I conjure you , trust yourself now and all your spiritual interests in the hands of your Heavenly Friend , and never , never , never allow yourself to doubt again . <p> And remember , there are two things which are more utterly incompatible than even oil and water , and these two are trust and worry . Would you call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of a friend to attend to for you , and then should spend your nights and days in anxious thought and worry as to whether it would be rightly and successfully done ? And can you call it trust , when you have given the saving and keeping of your soul into the hands of the Lord , if day after day and night after night you are spending hours of anxious thought and questionings about the matter ? When a believer really trusts anything , he ceases to worry about that thing which he has trusted . And when he worries , it is a plain proof that he does not trust . Tested by this rule , how little real trust there is in the Church of Christ ! No wonder our Lord asked the pathetic question , " When the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ? " * ( Luke 18:8 ) He will find plenty of activity , a great deal of earnestness , and doubtless many consecrated hearts ; but shall he find faith , the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a solemn question , and I would that every Christian heart would ponder it well . But may the time past of our lives suffice us to have shared in the unbelief of the world ; and let us everyone , who know our blessed Lord and His unspeakable trustworthiness , set to our seal that He is true , by our generous abandonment of trust in Him . <p> I remember , very early in my Christian life , having every tender and loyal impulse within me stirred to its depths by an appeal I met with in a volume of old sermons to all who loved the Lord Jesus , that they should show to others how worthy He was of being trusted , by the steadfastness of their own faith in Him . And I remember my soul cried out with an eager longing that I might be called to walk in paths so dark , that an utter abandonment of trust might be my blessed and glorious privilege . <p> " Ye have not passed this way heretofore , " * ( Joshua 3:4 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege to prove , as never before , your loyal confidence in the Lord by starting out with Him on a life and walk of faith , lived moment by moment in absolute and childlike trust in Him . <p> You have trusted Him in a few things , and He has not failed you . Trust Him now for everything , and see if He does not do for you exceeding abundantly above all that you could ever have asked or thought ( Ephesians 3:20 ) ; not according to your power or capacity , but according to His own mighty power , that will work in you all the good pleasure of His most blessed will . <p> You find no difficulty in trusting the Lord with the management of the universe and all the outward creation , and can your case be any more complex or difficult than these , that you need to be anxious or troubled about His management of it . Away with such unworthy doubtings ! Take your stand on the power and trustworthiness of your God , and see how quickly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust in the dark , trust in the light , trust at night , and trust in the morning , and you will find that the faith , which may begin by a mighty effort , will end sooner or later by becoming the easy and natural habit of the soul . <p> All things are possible to God , and " all things are possible to him that believeth. " * ( Mark 9:23 ) Faith has , in times past , " subdued kingdoms , wrought righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the the armies of the aliens " * ( 33-34 ) ; and faith can do it again . For our Lord Himself be impossible unto you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a child of God at all , you must have at least as much faith as a grain of mustard seed , and therefore you dare not say again that you can not trust because you have no faith . Say rather , " I can trust my Lord , and I will trust Him , and none of the powers of earth or hell shall be able to make me doubt my wonderful , glorious , faithful Redeemer ! " <p> In that greatest event of this century , the emancipation of our slaves , there is a wonderful illustration of the way of faith . The slaves received their freedom by faith , just as we must receive ours . The good news was carried to them that the government had proclaimed their freedom . As a matter of fact they were free the moment the Proclamation was issued , but as a matter of experience they did not come into actual possession of their freedom until they had heard the good news and had believed it . The fact had to come first , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling would follow last of all . This is the divine order always , and the order of common-sense as well . I. The fact . II . The faith . III . The feeling . But man reverses this order and says , I. The feeling . II . The faith . III . The fact . <p> Had the slaves followed mans order in regard to their emancipation , and refused to believe in it until they had first felt it , they might have remained in slavery a long while . I have heard of one instance where this was the case . In a little out-of-the-way Southern town a Northern lady found , about two or three years after the war was over , some slaves who had not yet taken possession of their freedom . An assertion of hers , that the North had set them free , aroused the attention of an old colored auntie , who interrupted her with the eager question : <p> " O missus , is we free ? " <p> " Of course you are , " replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure ? " urged the woman , with intensest eagerness . <p> " Certainly , I am sure , " answered the lady . " Why , is it possible you did not know it ? " <p> " Well , " said the woman , " we heered tell as how we was free , and we asked master , and he lowed we was n't , and so we was afraid to go . And then we heered tell again , and we went to the cunnel , and he lowed wed better stay with ole massa . And so wes just been off and on . Sometimes we 'd hope we was free , and then again we 'd think we was n't . But now , missus , if you is sure we is free , wo n't you tell me all about it ? " <p> Seeing that this was a case of real need , the lady took the pains to explain the whole thing to the poor woman ; all about the war , and the Northern army , and Abraham Lincoln , and his Proclamation of Emancipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened with the most intense eagerness . She heard the good news . She believed it . And when the story was ended , she walked out of the room with an air of the utmost independence , saying as she went , " Is free ! Is ai n't  agoing to stay with ol massa any longer ! " <p> She had at last received her freedom , and she had received it by faith . The government had declared her to be free long before , but this had not availed her , because she had never yet believed in this declaration . The good news had not profited her , not being " mixed with faith " * ( Hebrews 4:2 ) in the one who heard it . But now she believed , and believing , she dared to reckon herself to be free . And this , not because of any change in herself or her surroundings , not because of any feelings of emotions of her own heart , but because she had confidence in the word of another , who had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Need I make the application ? In a hundred different messages God has declared to us our freedom , and over and over He urges us to reckon ourselves free . Let your faith then lay hold of His proclamation , and assert it to be true . Declare to yourself , to your friends , and in the secret of your soul to God , that you are free . Refuse to listen for a moment to the lying assertions of your old master , that you are still his slave . Let nothing discourage you , no inward feelings nor outward signs . Hold on to your reckoning in the face of all opposition , and I can promise you , on the authority of our Lord , that according to your faith it shall be unto you . <p> Of all the worships we can bring our God , none is so sweet to Him as this utter self-abandoning trust , and none brings Him so much glory . Therefore in every dark hour remember that " though now for a season , if need be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1 Peter 1:6 ) it the appearing of Jesus Christ . " * ( 1 Peter 1:7 ) <h> Difficulties Concerning the Will <p> When the child of God has , by the way of entire abandonment and absolute trust , stepped out of himself into Christ , and has begun to know something of the blessedness of the life " hid with Christ in God , " * ( Colossians 3:3 ) there is one form of difficulty which is very likely to start up in his path . After the first emotions of peace and rest have somewhat subsided , or if , as is sometimes the case , they have never seemed to come at all , he begins to feel such an utter unreality in the things he has been passing through , that he seems to himself like a hypocrite , when he says or even thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief does not go below the surface , that it is a mere lip-belief , and therefore of no account , and that his surrender is not a surrender of the heart , and therefore can not be acceptable to God . He is afraid to say he is altogether the Lords , for fear he will be telling an untruth , and yet he can not bring himself to say he is not , because he longs for it so intensely . The difficulty is real and very disheartening . <p> But there is nothing here which will not be very easily overcome , when the Christian once thoroughly understands the principles of the new life , and has learned how to live in it . The common thought is , that this life hid with Christ in God is to be lived in the emotions , and consequently all the attention of the soul is directed towards them , and as they are satisfactory or otherwise , the soul rests or is troubled . Now the truth is that this life is not to be lived in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore the varying states of emotion do not in the least disturb or affect the reality of the life , if only the will is kept steadfastly abiding in its center , Gods will . <p> To make this plain , I must enlarge a little . Fenelon says somewhere , that " pure religion resides in the will alone . " By this he means that as the will is the governing power in the mans nature , if the will is set straight , all the rest of the nature must come into harmony . By the will I do not mean the wish of the man , nor even his purpose , but the choice , the deciding power , the king , to which all that is in the man must yield obedience . It is the man , in short , the " Ego , " that which we feel to be ourselves . <p> It is sometimes thought that the emotions are the governing power in our nature . But , as a matter of practical experience , I think we all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions , and behind our wishesan independent selfthat after all decides everything and controls everything . Our emotions belong to us , and are suffered and enjoyed by us , but they are not ourselves ; and if God is to take possession of us , it must be into this central will or personality that He shall enter . If , then , He is reigning there by the power of His Spirit , all the rest of our nature must come under His sway ; and as the will is , so is the man . <p> The practical bearing of this truth upon the difficulty I am considering is very great . For the decisions of our will are often so directly opposed to the decisions of our emotions , that , if we are in the habit of considering our emotions as the test , we shall be very apt to feel like hypocrites in declaring those things to be real which our will alone has decided . But the moment we see that the will is king , we shall utterly disregard anything that clamors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let the emotions rebel as they may . <p> I am aware that this is a difficult subject to deal with , but it is so exceedingly practical in its bearing upon the life of faith , that I beg of you , dear reader , not to turn from it until you have mastered it . <p> Perhaps an illustration will help you . A young man of great intelligence , seeking to enter into this new life , was utterly discouraged at finding himself the slave to an inveterate habit of doubting . To his emotions nothing seemed true , nothing seemed real ; and the more he struggled the more unreal did it all become . He was told this secret concerning the will , that if he would only put his will over on to the believing side ; if he would choose to believe ; if , in short , he would , in the Ego of his nature , say , " I will believe ! I do believe ! " he need not trouble about his emotions , for they would find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony . <p> " What ! " he said , " do you mean to tell me that I can choose to believe in that way , when nothing seems true to me ; and will that kind of believing be real ? " <p> " Yes , " was the answer , " your part is only thisto put your will over on Gods side in this matter of believing ; and when you do this , God immediately takes possession of it , and works in you to will of His good pleasure , and you will soon find that He has brought all the rest of your nature into subjection to Himself . " <p> " Well , " was the answer , " I can do this . I can not control my emotions , but I can control my will , and the new life begins to look possible to me , if it is only my will that needs to be set straight in the matter . I can give my will to God , and I do ! " <p> From that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which continually accused him of being a wretched hypocrite , this young man held on steadily to the decision of his will , answering every accusation with the continued assertion that he chose to believe , he meant to believe , he did believe ; until at the end of a few days he found himself triumphant , with every emotion and every thought brought into captivity to the mighty power of the blessed Spirit of God , who had taken possession of the will thus put into His hands . He had held fast the profession of his faith without wavering , although it had seemed to him that , as to real faith itself , he had none to hold fast . At times it had drained all the will power he possessed to his lips , to say that he believed , so contrary was it to all the evidence of his senses or of his emotions . But he had caught the idea that his will was , after all , himself , and that if he kept that on Gods side , he was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change his emotions or control his being . The result has been one of the grandest Christian lives I know of , in its marvellous simplicity , directness , and power over sin . <p> The secret lies just here . That our will , which is the spring of all our actions , is in our natural state under the control of self , and self has been working it in us to our utter ruin and misery . Now God says , " Yield yourselves up unto Me , as those that are alive from the dead , and I will work in you to will and to do of my good pleasure . " And the moment we yield ourselves , He of course takes possession of us , and does work in us " that which is wellpleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ , " * ( Hebrews 13:21 ) giving us the mind that was in Christ , and transforming us into His image ( Romans 12:1-2 ) . <p> Let us take another illustration . A lady , who had entered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great prospective trial . Every emotion she had within her rose up in rebellion against it , and had she considered her emotions to be her king , she would have been in utter despair . But she had learned this secret of the will , and knowing that , at the bottom , she herself did really choose the will of God for her portion , she did not pay the slightest attention to her emotions , but persisted in meeting every thought concerning the trial , with the words , repeated over and over , " Thy will be done ! Thy will be done ! " asserting in the face of all her rebelling feelings , that she did submit her will to Gods , that she chose to submit , and that His will should be and was her delight ! The result was , that in an incredibly short space of time every thought was brought into captivity ; and she began to find even her very emotions rejoicing in the will of God . <p> Again , there was a lady who had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but which in her will she hated . Having believed herself to be necessarily under the control of her emotions , she had therefore thought she was unable to conquer it , unless her emotions should first be changed . But she learned this secret concerning the will , and going to her knees she said , " Lord , Thou seest that with one part of my nature I love this sin , but in my real central self I hate it . And now I put my will over on thy side in the matter . I will not do it any more . Do Thou deliver me . " Immediately God took possession of the will thus surrendered to Himself , and began to work in her , so that His will in the matter gained the mastery over her emotions , and she found herself delivered , not by the power of an outward commandment , but by the inward power of the Spirit of God working in her that which was well pleasing in His sight . <p> And now , dear Christian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your difficulties . Cease to consider your emotions , for they are only the servants ; and regard simply your will , which is the real king in your being . Is that given up to God ? Is that put into His hands ? Does your will decide to believe ? Does your will choose to obey ? If this is the case , then you are in the Lords hands , and you decide to believe , and you choose to obey ; for your will is yourself . And the thing is done . The transaction with God is as real , where only your will acts , as when every emotion coincides . It does not seem as real to you ; but in Gods sight it is as real . And when you have got hold of this secret , and have discovered that you need not attend to your emotions , but simply to the state of your will , all the Scriptural commandsto yield yourself to God , to present yourself a living sacrifice to Him , to abide in Christ , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you ; for you are conscious that , in all these , your will can act , and can take Gods side : whereas , if it had been your emotions that must do it , you would sink down in despair , knowing them to be utterly uncontrollable . <p> When , then , this feeling of unreality or hypocrisy comes , do not be troubled by it . It is only in your emotions , and is not worth a moments thought . Only see to it that your will is in Gods hands ; that your inward self is abandoned to His working ; that your choice , your decision , is on His side ; and there leave it . Your surging emotions , like a tossing vessel , which , by degrees , yields to the steady pull of the cable , finding themselves attached to the mighty power of God by the choice of your will , must inevitably come into captivity , and give in their allegiance to Him ; and you will verify the truth of the saying that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of the doctrine . " * ( John 7:17 ) <p> The will is like a wise mother in a nursery ; the feelings are like a set of clamoring , crying children . The mother decides upon a certain course of action , which she believes to be right and best . The children clamor against it , and declare it shall not be . But the mother , knowing that she is mistress and not they , pursues her course calmly , unmoved by their clamors , and takes no notice of them except in trying to soothe and quiet them . The result is that the children are sooner or later compelled to yield , and fall in with the decision of the mother . Thus order and harmony are preserved . But if that mother should for a moment let in the thought that the children were the mistresses instead of herself , confusion would reign unchecked . Such instances have been known in family life ! And in how many souls at this very moment is there nothing but confusion , simply because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Remember , then , that the real thing in your experience is what your will decides , and not the verdict of your emotions ; and that you are far more in danger of hypocrisy and untruth in yielding to the assertions of your feelings , than in holding fast to the decision of your will . So that , if your will is on Gods side , you are no hypocrite at this moment in claiming as your own the blessed reality of belonging altogether to Him , even though your emotions may all declare the contrary . <p> I am convinced that , throughout the Bible , the expressions concerning the " heart " do not mean the emotions , that which we now understand by the word " heart " ; but they mean the will , the personality of the man , the mans own central self ; and that the object of Gods dealings with man is , that this " I " may be yielded up to Him , and this central life abandoned to His entire control . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man himself . <p> Have you given Him yourself , dear reader ? Have you abandoned your will to His working ? Do you consent to surrender the very center of your being into His hands ? Then , let the outposts of your nature clamor as they may , it is your right to say , even , and gave himself for me. " * ( Galatians 2:20 ) <p> After this chapter had been enclosed to the printer , the following remarkable practical illustration of its teaching was presented by Pasteur T. Monod , of Paris . It is the experience of a Presbyterian minister , which this Pasteur had carefully kept for many years . <p> NEWBURGH , Sept. 26 , 1842 . <p> Dear Brother , <p> I take a few moments of that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short epistle to you , His servant . It is sweet to feel we are wholly the Lords , that He has received us and called us His . This is religiona relinquishment of the principle of self-ownership , and the adoption in full of the abiding sentiment , " I am not my own , I am bought with a price " 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 . Since I last saw you , I have been pressing forward , and yet there has been nothing remarkable in my experience of which I can speak ; indeed I do not know that it is best to look for remarkable things ; but strive to be holy , as God is holy , pressing right on toward the mark of the prize . <p> I do not feel myself qualified to instruct you ; I can only tell you the way in which I was led . The Lord deals differently with different souls , and we ought not to attempt to copy the experience of others , yet there are certain things which must be attended to by everyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a personal consecration of all to God , a covenant made with God , that we will be wholly and forever His . This I made intellectually without any change in my feeling , with a heart full of hardness and darkness , unbelief and sin and insensibility . <p> I covenanted to be the Lords , and laid all upon the altar , a living sacrifice , to the best of my ability . And after I rose from my knees , I was conscious of no change in my feeling . I was painfully conscious that there was no change . But yet I was sure that I did , with all the sincerity and honesty of purpose of which I was capable , make an entire and eternal consecration of myself to God . I did not then consider the work done by any means , but I engaged to abide in a state of entire devotion to God , a living perpetual sacrifice . And now came the effort to do this . <p> I knew that I must believe that God did accept me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was conscious I did not believe this , and yet I desired to do so . I read with much prayer John 's First Epistle , and endeavored to assure my heart of Gods love to me as an individual . I was sensible that my heart was full of evil . I seemed to have no power to overcome pride , or to repel evil thoughts , which I abhorred . But Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil , and it was clear that the sin in my heart was the work of the devil . I was enabled , therefore , to believe that God was working in me , to will and to do , while I was working out my own salvation with fear and trembling . <p> I was convinced of unbelief , that it was voluntary and criminal . I clearly saw that unbelief was an awful sin , it made the faithful God a liar . The Lord brought before me my besetting sins which had dominion over me , especially preaching myself instead of Christ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make myself of no reputation , and to seek the honor which cometh from God only . Satan struggled hard to beat me back from the Rock of Ages but thanks to God I finally hit upon the method of living by the moment , and then I found rest . <p> I trusted in the blood of Jesus already shed , as a sufficient atonement for all my past sins , and the future I committed wholly to the Lord , agreeing to do His will under all circumstances as He should make it known , and I saw that all I had to do was to look to Jesus for a present supply of grace , and to trust Him to cleanse my heart and keep me from sin at the present moment . <p> I felt shut up to a momentary dependence upon the grace of Christ . I would not permit the adversary to trouble me about the past or future , for I each moment looked for the supply for that moment . I agreed that I would be a child of Abraham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not by inward feelings and emotions : I would seek to be a Bible Christian . Since that time the Lord has given me a steady victory over sins which before enslaved me . I delight in the Lord , and in His Word . I delight in my work as a minister : my fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ . I am a babe in Christ ; I know my progress has been small compared with that made by many . My feelings vary , but when I have feelings , I praise God , and I trust in His word ; and when I am empty and my feelings are gone , I do the same . I have covenanted to walk by faith and not by feelings . <p> The Lord , I think , is beginning to revive His work among my people . " Praise the Lord . " May the Lord fill you with all His fulness and give you all the mind of Christ . Oh , be faithful ! Walk before God and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of season 2 Timothy 4:2 . The Lord loves you . He works with you . Rest your soul fully upon that promise , " Lo , I am with you always , even unto the end of the world . " * ( Matthew 28:20 ) <p> Your fellow soldier , William Hill <p> There may be some who will object to this teaching , that it ignores the work of the blessed Holy Spirit . But I must refer such to the introductory chapter of this book , in which I have fully explained myself . I am not writing upon that side of the subject ; I am considering mans part in the matter , and not the part of the Spirit . I realize intensely that all a man can do or try to do would be utterly useless , if the Holy Spirit did not work in that man continually . And it is only because I believe in the Spirit as a mighty power , ever present and always ready to do His work , that I can write as I do @ @ , and whither it goeth , the operations of the Spirit are beyond our control , and also beyond our comprehension . <p> The results we know , and the steps on our part which lead to those results , but we know nothing more . And yet , like a workman in a great manufactory , who does not question the commands of his employer , and is not afraid to undertake apparent impossibilities , because he knows there is a mighty unseen power , called steam , behind his machinery , which can accomplish it all , so we dare to urge upon men that they shall simply and courageously set themselves to do that which they are commanded to do , because we know that the mighty Spirit will never fail to supply at each moment the necessary power for that moments act . And we boldly claim that we who thus write can say from our very hearts , as earnestly and as solemnly as any other Christians , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God in Everything ? <p> One of the greatest obstacles to living unwaveringly this life of entire surrender is the difficulty of seeing God in everything . People say , " I can easily submit to things which come from God ; but I can not submit to man , and most of my trials and crosses come through human instrumentality . " Or they say , " It is all well enough to talk of trusting ; but when I commit a matter to God , man is sure to come in and disarrange it all ; and while I have no difficulty in trusting God , I do see serious difficulties in the way of trusting men . " <p> This is no imaginary trouble , but it is of vital importance , and if it can not be met , does really make the life of faith an impossible and visionary theory . For nearly everything in life comes to us through human instrumentalities , and most of our trials are the result of somebodys failure , or ignorance , or carelessness , or sin . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet unless He is the agent in the matter , how can we say to Him about it , " Thy will be done " * ( Luke 11:2 ) ? <p> Besides , what good is there in trusting our affairs to God , if , after all , man is to be allowed to come in and disarrange them ; and how is it possible to live by faith , if human agencies , in whom it would be wrong and foolish to trust , are to have a predominant influence in moulding our lives ? <p> Moreover , things in which we can see Gods hand always have a sweetness in them which consoles while it wounds . But the trials inflicted by man are full of bitterness . <p> What is needed , then , is to see God in everything , and to receive everything directly from His hands , with no intervention of second causes . And it is just to this that we must be brought , before we can know an abiding experience of entire abandonment and perfect trust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and our trust must be in Him , not in any arm of flesh , or we shall fail at the first trial . <p> The question here confronts us at once , " But is God in everything , and have we any warrant from the Scripture for receiving everything from His hands , without regarding the second causes which may have been instrumental in bringing it about ? " I answer to this , unhesitatingly , Yes . To the children of God everything comes directly from their Fathers hand , no matter who or what may have been the apparent agents . There are no " second causes " for them . <p> The whole teaching of the Bible asserts and implies this . Not a sparrow falls to the ground without our Father ( Matthew 10:29 ) . The very hairs of our head are all numbered ( Matthew 10:30 ; Luke 12:7 ) . We are not to be careful about anything ( Philippians 4:6 ) , because our Father cares for us . We are not to avenge ourselves , because our Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are not to fear , for the Lord is on our side ( Psalm 118:6 ) . No one can be against us , because He is for us ( Romans 8:31 ) . We shall not want , for He is our Shepherd ( Psalm 23:1 ) . When we pass through the rivers they shall not overflow us , and when we walk through the fire we shall not be burned , because He will be with us ( Isaiah 43:2 ) . He shuts the mouths of lions , that they can not hurt us ( Daniel 6:22 ) . " He delivereth and rescueth. " * ( Daniel 6:27 ) " He changeth the times and the seasons : he removeth kings , and setteth up kings . " * ( Daniel 2:21 ) A mans heart is in His hand , and , " as the rivers of water : he turneth it whithersoever he will . " * ( Proverbs 21:1 ) He ruleth over all the kingdoms of the heathen ; and in His hand there is power and might , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 Chronicles 20:6 ) Him . He ruleth the raging of the sea ; when the waves thereof arise , He stilleth them ( Psalm 89:9 ) . He " bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought : he maketh the devices of the people of none effect . " * ( Psalm 33:10 ) Whatsoever the Lord pleaseth , that does He in heaven , and in earth , in the seas , and all deep places ( Psalm 135:6 ) . <p> " If thou seest the oppression of the poor , and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province , marvel not at the matter : for he that is higher than the highest regardeth ; and there be higher than they . " * ( Ecclesiastes 5:8 ) <p> " Lo , these are parts of his ways : but how little a portion is heard of him ? but the thunder of his power who can understand ? " * ( searching of his understanding . " * ( Isaiah 40:28 ) <p> And this " God is our refuge and strength , a very midst of the sea ; Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled , though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof . " * not come nigh thee . Because thou hast made the LORD , which is my refuge , even the most High , thy habitation ; There shall no evil befall thee , neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling . For he shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee in all thy ways . " * ( Psalm 91:1-11 ) <p> To my own mind , these Scriptures , and many others like them , settle forever the question as to the power of second causes in the life of the children of God . They are all under the control of our Father , and nothing can touch us except with His knowledge and by His permission . It may be the sin of man that originates the action , and therefore the thing itself can not be said to be the will of God but by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us , and must be accepted as directly from His hands . No man or company of men , no power in earth or heaven , can touch that soul which is abiding in Christ , without first passing through Him , and receiving the seal of His permission . If God be for us , it matters not who may be against us ; nothing can disturb or harm us , except He shall see that it is best for us , and shall stand aside to let it pass . <p> An earthly parents care for his helpless child is a feeble illustration of this . If the child is in its fathers arms , nothing can touch it without that fathers consent , unless he is too weak to prevent it . And even if this should be the case , he suffers the harm first in his own person , before he allows it to reach his child . And if an earthly parent would thus care for his little helpless one , how much more will our Heavenly Father , whose love is infinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baffled ! I am afraid there are some , even of Gods own children , who scarcely think that He is equal to themselves in tenderness , and love , and thoughtful care ; and who in their secret thoughts , charge Him with a neglect and indifference of which they would feel themselves incapable . The truth really is , that His care is infinitely superior to any possibilities of human care ; and that He who counts the very hairs of our head , and suffers not a sparrow to fall without Him , takes note of the minutest matters that can affect the lives of His children , and regulates them all according to His own sweet will , let their origin be what they may . <p> The instances of this are numberless . Take Joseph . What could have seemed more apparently , on the face of it , to be the result of sin , and utterly contrary to the will of God , than his being sold into slavery ? And yet Joseph , in speaking of it , said , " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God meant it unto good . " * ( Genesis 50:20 ) " Now therefore be not grieved , nor angry with yourselves , that ye sold me hither : for God did send me before you to preserve life . " * ( Genesis 45:5 ) To the eye of sense it was surely Josephs wicked brethren who had sent him into Egypt ; and yet Joseph , looking at it with the eye of faith , could say , " God sent me . " It had been undoubtedly a grievous sin in his brethren , but , by the time it had reached Joseph , it had become Gods will for him , and was in truth , though at first it did not look so , the greatest blessing of his whole life . And thus we see how the Lord can make even the wrath of man to praise Him , and how all things , even the sins of others , shall work together for good to them that love Him . <p> I learned this lesson practically and experimentally long years before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prayer-meeting held for the promotion of scriptural holiness , when a strange lady rose to speak , and I looked at her , wondering who she could be , little thinking she was to bring a message to my soul which would teach me such a grand lesson . She said she had had great difficulty in living the life of faith , on account of the second causes that seemed to her to control nearly everything that concerned her . Her perplexity became so great , that at last she began to ask God to teach her the truth about it , whether He really was in everything or not . After praying this for a few days , she had what she described as a vision . She thought she was in a perfectly dark place , and that there advanced towards her from a distance a body of light , which gradually surrounded and enveloped her and everything around her . As it approached , a voice seemed to say , " This is the presence of God ; this is the presence of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and awful things in life seemed to pass before herfighting armies , wicked men , raging beasts , storms and pestilences , sin and suffering of every kind . <p> She shrank back at first in terror , but she soon saw that the presence of God so surrounded and enveloped each one of these , that not a lion could reach out its paw , nor a bullet fly through the air , except as His presence moved out of the way to permit it . And she saw that , let there be ever so thin a sheet , as it were , of this glorious presence between herself and the most terrible violence , not a hair of her head could be ruffled , nor anything touch her , unless the presence divided to let the evil through . Then all the small and annoying things of life passed before her , and equally she saw that these all were so enveloped in this presence of God that not a cross look , not a harsh word , nor petty trial of any kind , could reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them through . <p> Her difficulty vanished . Her question was answered forever . God was in everything ; and to her henceforth there were no second causes . She saw that her life came to her , day by day and hour by hour , directly from His hand , let the agencies which should seem to control it be what they might . And never again had she found any difficulty in an abiding consent to His will and an unwavering trust in His care . <p> If we look at the seen things , we shall not be able to understand the secret of this . But the children of God are seen are eternal . " * ( 2 Corinthians 4:18 ) Could we but see with our bodily eyes His unseen forces surrounding us on every side , we would walk through this world in an impregnable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him , and delivereth them . " * ( Psalm 34:7 ) <p> We have a striking illustration of this in the history of Elisha . The king of Syria was warring against Israel , but his evil designs were continually frustrated by the prophet ; and at last he sent his army to the prophets own city for the express purpose of taking him captive . We read , " Sent he thither horses , and chariots , and a great host : and they came by night , and compassed the city about . " * ( 2 Kings 6:14 ) This was the seen thing . And the servant of the prophet , whose eyes had not yet been opened to see the unseen things , was alarmed . And we read , " And when the servant of the man of God was risen early , and gone forth , behold , an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots . And his servant said unto him , Alas , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 Kings 6:15 ) But his master could see the unseen things , and he replied , " Fear not ; for they that be with us are more than they that be chariots of fire round about Elisha. " * ( 2 Kings 6:16-7 ) <p> The presence of God is the fortress of His people . Nothing can withstand it . At His presence the wicked perish ; the earth trembles ; the hills melt like wax ; the cities are broken down ; " the heavens also dropped at the presence of God : even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God . " * ( Psalm 68:8 ) And in the secret of this presence He has promised to hide His people from the pride of man , and from the strife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He says , " and I will give thee rest . " * ( Exodus 33:14 ) <p> I wish it were only possible to make every Christian see this truth as plainly as I see it ; for I am convinced it is the only clue to a completely restful life . Nothing else will enable a soul to live only in the present moment , as we are commanded to do , and to take no thought for the morrow . Nothing else will take all the risks and " supposes " out of a Christians heart , and enable him to say , " Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life . " * ( Psalm 23:6 ) Abiding in Gods presence , we run no risks ; and such a soul can triumphantly say <p> " I know not what it is to doubt , My heart is alway gay ; I run no risks , for , come what will , God alway has His way . " <p> I once heard of a colored woman who earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joyous , triumphant Christian . " Ah ! Nancy , " said a gloomy Christian lady to her one day , who almost disapproved of her constant cheerfulness , and yet envied it " ah ! Nancy , it is all well enough to be happy now ; but I should think the thoughts of your future would sober you . Only suppose , for instance , that you should have a spell of sickness and be unable to work ; or suppose your present employers should move away , and no one else should give you anything to do ; or suppose " <p> " Stop ! " cried Nancy , " I never supposes . De Lord is my shepherd , and I knows I shall not want . And , honey , " she added to her gloomy friend , " its all dem supposes as is makin you so misable . Youd better give dem all up , and just trust de Lord . " <p> There is one text that will take all the " suppose " out of a believers life , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith ; it is in Hebrews 3:5-6 : " Be content , therefore , with such things as ye have ; for He hath said I will never leave thee , nor forsake thee " ; so that we may boldly say , " The Lord is my helper , and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. " * ( Hebrews 13:6 ) What if dangers of all sorts shall threaten you from every side , and the malice or foolishness or ignorance of men shall combine to do you harm ? You may face every possible contingency with these triumphant words , " The Lord is my helper , and I will not fear what man shall do unto me . " If the Lord is your helper , how can you fear what man may do unto you ? There is no man in this world , nor company of men , that can touch you , unless your God , in whom you trust , shall please to let them . " He will not suffer thy foot to be moved : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep . The LORD is thy keeper : the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand . The sun shall not smite thee by day , nor the moon by night . The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil : he shall preserve thy soul . The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth , and even for evermore . " * ( Psalm 121:3-8 ) <p> Nothing else but this seeing God in everything will make us loving and patient with those who annoy and trouble us . They will be to us then only the instruments for accomplishing His tender and wise purposes towards us , and we shall even find ourselves at last inwardly thanking them for the blessings they bring us . <p> Nothing else will completely put an end to all murmuring or rebelling thoughts . Christians often feel a liberty to murmur against man , when they would not dare to murmur against God . But this way of receiving things would make it impossible ever to murmur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be because that trial is the sweetest and best thing that could happen to us , and we must accept it with thanks from His dear hand . The trial itself may be hard to flesh and blood , and I do not mean that we can like or enjoy the suffering of it . But we can and must love the will of God in the trial , for His will is always sweet , whether it be in joy or in sorrow . <p> Our trials may be our chariots . We long for some victory over sin and self , and we ask God to grant it to us . His answer comes in the form of a trial which He means shall be the chariot to bear us to the longed-for triumph . We may either let it roll over us and crush us as a Juggernaut car , or we may mount into it and ride triumphantly onward . Josephs chariots , which bore him on to the place of his exaltation , were the trials of being sold into slavery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more insignificant things than these ; they may be nothing but irritating people or uncomfortable circumstances . But whatever they are , God means them to be our cars of triumph , which shall bear us onward to the victories we have prayed for . If we are impatient in our dispositions and long to be made patient , our chariot will probably be a trying person to live in the house with us , whose ways or words will rasp our very souls . If we accept the trial as from God , and bow our necks to the yoke , we shall find it just the discipline that will most effectually produce in us the very grace of patience for which we have asked . <p> God does not order the wrong thing , but He uses it for our blessing ; just as He used the cruelty of Josephs wicked brethren , and the false accusations of Potiphars wife . In short , this way of seeing our Father in everything makes life one long thanksgiving , and gives a rest of heart , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unspeakable . Someone says , " Gods will on earth is always joy , always tranquillity . " And since He must have His own way concerning His children , into what wonderful green pastures of inward rest , and beside what blessedly still waters of inward refreshment , is the soul led that learns this secret . <p> If the will of God is our will , and if He always has His way , then we always have our way also , and we reign in a perpetual kingdom . He who sides with God can not fail to win in every encounter ; and whether the result shall be joy or sorrow , failure or success , death or life , we may , under all circumstances , join in the apostles shout of victory , " Thanks be unto God , which always causeth us to triumph in Christ " * ( 2 Corinthians 2:14 ) ! <h> Growth <p> When the believer has been brought to the point of entire surrender and perfect trust , and finds himself dwelling and walking in a life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Is this the end ? " I answer emphatically , " No , it is only the beginning . " <p> And yet this is so little understood , that one of the greatest objections made against the advocates of this life of faith , is , that they do not believe in growth in grace . They are supposed to teach that the soul arrives at a state of perfection beyond which there is no advance , and that all the exhortations in the Scripture which point towards growth and development are rendered void by this teaching . <p> As exactly the opposite of this is true , I have thought it important next to consider this subject carefully , that I may , if possible , fully answer such objections , and may also show what is the scriptural place to grow in , and how the soul is to grow . <p> The text which is most frequently quoted is 2 Peter 3:18 , " But grow in grace , and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . " Now this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us , and what also we believe He has made it possible for us to experience . We accept , in their very fullest meaning , all the commands and promises concerning our being no more children , and our growing up into Christ in all things , until we come unto a perfect man , unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ . We rejoice that we need not continue always to be babes , needing milk ; but that we may , by reason of use and development become such as have need of strong meat , skilful in the word of righteousness , and able to discern both good and evil . And none would grieve more than we at the thought of any finality in the Christian life beyond which there could be no advance . <p> But then we believe in a growing that does really produce maturity , and in a development that , as a fact , does bring forth ripe fruit . We expect to reach the aim set before us , and if we do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our growing . No parent would be satisfied with the growth of his child , if , day after day , and year after year , it remained the same helpless babe it was in the first months of its life ; and no farmer would feel comfortable under such growing of his grain as should stop short at the blade , and never produce the ear , nor the full corn in the ear . Growth , to be real , must be progressive , and the days and weeks and months must see a development and increase of maturity in the thing growing . But is this the case with a large part of that which is called growth in grace ? Does not the very Christian who is the most strenuous in his longings and in his efforts after it , too often find that at the end of the year he is not as far on in his Christian experience as at the beginning , and that his zeal , and his devotedness , and his separation from the world are not as whole-souled or complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was once urging upon a company of Christians the privileges and rest of an immediate and definite step into the land of promise , when a lady of great intelligence interrupted me , with what she evidently felt to be a complete rebuttal of all I had been saying , exclaiming , " Ah ! but , my dear friend , I believe in growing in grace . " <p> " How long have you been growing ? " I asked . <p> " About twenty-five years , " was her answer . <p> " And how much more unworldly and devoted to the Lord are you now than when you began your Christian life ? " I continued . <p> " Alas ! " was the answer , " I fear I am not nearly so much so " ; and with this answer her eyes were opened to see that at all events her way of growing had not been successful , but quite the reverse . <p> The trouble with her , and every other such case , is simply this , they are trying to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a rosebush which the gardener should plant in the hard , stony path , with a view to its growing into the flower-bed , and which would of course dwindle and wither in consequence , instead of flourishing and maturing . The children of Israel wandering in the wilderness are a perfect picture of this sort of growing . They were travelling about for forty years , taking many weary steps , and finding but little rest from their wanderings , and yet , at the end of it all , were no nearer the promised land than they were at the beginning . When they started on their wanderings at Kadesh Barnea , they were at the borders of the land , and a few steps would have taken them into it . <p> When they ended their wanderings in the plains of Moab , they were also at its borders ; only with this great difference , that now there was a river to cross , which at first there would not have been . All their wanderings and fightings in the wilderness had not put them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order to get possession of this land it was necessary first to be in it ; and in order to grow in grace , it is necessary first to be planted in grace . But when once in the land , their conquest was very rapid ; and when once planted in grace , the growth of the soul in one month will exceed that of years in any other soil . For grace is a most fruitful soil , and the plants that grow therein are plants of a marvellous growth . They are tended by a Divine Husbandman , and are warmed by the Sun of Righteousness , and watered by the dew from Heaven . Surely it is no wonder that they bring forth fruit , " some an hundredfold , some sixtyfold , some thirtyfold. " * ( Matthew 13:8 ) <p> But , it will be asked , what is meant by growing in grace ? It is difficult to answer this question because so few people have any conception of what the grace of God really is . To say that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its meaning . It is the wondrous , boundless love of God , poured out upon us without stint or measure , not according to our deserving , but according to His infinite heart of love , which passeth knowledge , so unfathomable are its heights and depths . I sometimes think we give a totally different meaning to the word " love " when it is associated with God , from that we so well understand in its human application . But if ever human love was tender and self-sacrificing and devoted ; if ever it could bear and forbear ; if ever it could suffer gladly for its loved ones ; if ever it was willing to pour itself out in a lavish abandonment for the comfort or pleasure of its objectsthen infinitely more is Divine love tender and self-sacrificing and devoted , and glad to bear and forbear , and to suffer , and to lavish its best of gifts and blessings upon the objects of its love . Put together all the tenderest love you know of , dear reader , the deepest you have ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out upon you , and heap upon it all the love of all the loving human hearts in the world , and then multiply it by infinity , and you will begin perhaps to have some faint glimpses of what the love of God in Christ Jesus is . And this is grace . And to be planted in grace is to live in the very heart of this love , to be enveloped by it , to be steeped in it , to revel in it , to know nothing else but love only and love always , to grow day by day in the knowledge of it , and in faith in it , to intrust everything to its care , and to have no shadow of a doubt but that it will surely order all things well . <p> To grow in grace is opposed to all self-dependence , to all self-effort , to all legality of every kind . It is to put our growing , as well as everything else , into the hands of the Lord , and leave it with Him . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with His skill and wisdom , that not a question will cross our minds as to His modes of treatment or His plan of cultivation . It is to grow as the lilies grow , or as the babes grow , without a care and without anxiety ; to grow by the power of an inward life principle that can not help but grow ; to grow because we live and therefore must grow ; to grow because He who has planted us has planted a growing thing , and has made us to grow . <p> Surely this is what our one of these . " * ( Matthew 6:28-29 ) Or , when He says again , " Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature ? " * ( Matthew 6:27 ) There is no effort in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not toil nor spin , they do not stretch nor strain , they do not make any effort of any kind to grow ; they are not conscious even that they are growing ; but by an inward life principle , and through the nurturing care of Gods providence , and the fostering of caretaker or gardener , by the heat of the sun and the falling of the rain , they grow and grow . <p> And the result is sure . Even Solomon , our Lord says , in all his glory , was not arrayed like one of these . Solomons array cost much toiling and spinning , and gold and silver in abundance , but the lilys array costs none of these . And though we may toil and spin to make for ourselves beautiful spiritual garments , and may strain and stretch in our efforts after spiritual growth , we shall accomplish nothing ; for no man by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature ; and no array of ours can ever equal the beautiful dress with which the great Husbandman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and under His fostering care . <p> If I could but make each one of my readers realize how utterly helpless we are in this matter of growing , I am convinced a large part of the strain would be taken out of many lives at once . Imagine a child possessed of the monomania that he would not grow unless he made some personal effort after it , and who should insist upon a combination of rope and pulleys whereby to stretch himself up to the desired height . He might , it is true , spend his days and years in a weary strain , but after all there would be no change in the inexorable fact , " No man by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature " ; and his years of labor would be only wasted , if they did not really hinder the longed-for end . <p> Imagine a lily trying to clothe itself in beautiful colors and graceful lines , stretching its leaves and stems to make them grow , and seeking to manage the clouds and the sunshine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet in these two pictures we have , I conceive , only too true a picture of what many Christians are trying to do ; who , knowing they ought to grow , and feeling within them an instinct that longs for growth , yet think to accomplish it by toiling , and spinning , and stretching , and straining , and pass their lives in such a round of self-effort as is a weariness to contemplate . <p> Grow , dear friends ; but grow , I beseech you , in Gods way , which is the only effectual way . See to it that you are planted in grace , and then let the Divine Husbandman cultivate you in His own way and by His own means . Put yourselves out in the sunshine of His presence , and let the dew of heaven come down upon you , and see what will come of it . Leaves and flowers and fruit must surely come in their season , for your Husbandman is a skilful one , and He never fails in His harvesting . Only see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sun of Righteousness or the falling of the dew from Heaven . A very thin covering may serve to keep off the heat or the moisture , and the plant may wither even in their midst ; and the slightest barrier between your soul and Christ may cause you to dwindle and fade as a plant in a cellar or under a bushel . Keep the sky clear . Open wide every avenue of your being to receive the blessed influences our Divine Husbandman may bring to bear upon you . Bask in the sunshine of His love . Drink in of the waters of His goodness . Keep your face up-turned to Him . Look , and your soul shall live . <p> You need make no efforts to grow ; but let your efforts instead be all concentrated on this , that you abide in the Vine . The Husbandman who has the care of the vine , will care for its branches also , and will so prune and purge and water and tend them that they will grow and bring forth fruit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they shall find themselves arrayed in apparel so glorious that that of Solomon will be as nothing to it . <p> What if you seem to yourselves to be planted at this moment in a desert soil where nothing can grow ! Put yourself absolutely into the hands of the great Husbandman , and He will at once make that desert blossom as the rose , and will cause springs and fountains of water to start up out of its sandy wastes ; for the promise is sure , that the man who cease from yielding fruit . " * ( Jeremiah 17:8 ) It is the great prerogative of our Divine Husbandman that He is able to turn any soil , whatever it may be like , into the soil of grace , the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not need to transplant us into a different field , but right where we are , with just the circumstances that surround us , He makes His sun to shine and His dew to fall upon us , and transforms the very things that were before our greatest hindrances into the chiefest and most blessed means of our growth . I care not what the circumstances may be , His wonder-working power can accomplish this . And we must trust Him with it all . Surely He is a Husbandman we can trust . And if He sends storms , or winds , or rains , or sunshine , all must be accepted at His hands with the most unwavering confidence that He who has undertaken to cultivate us , and to bring us to maturity , knows the very best way of accomplishing His end , and regulates the elements , which are all at His disposal , expressly with a view to our most rapid growth . <p> Let me entreat of you , then , to give up all your efforts after growing , and simply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose care it is , and who alone is able to manage it . No difficulties in your case can baffle Him . No dwarfing of your growth in years that are past , no apparent dryness of your inward springs of life , no crookedness or deformity in any of your past development , can in the least mar the perfect work that He will accomplish , if you will only put yourselves absolutely into His hands , and let Him have His own way with you . His own gracious promise to His backsliding children assures you of this . " I will heal their backslidings , " He says : " I will love them freely : for mine anger is turned away from him . I will be as the dew unto Israel : he shall grow as the lily , and cast forth his roots as Lebanon . His branches shall spread , and his beauty shall be as the olive tree , and his smell as Lebanon . They that dwell under his shadow shall return ; they shall revive as the corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be as the wine of Lebanon . " * ( Hosea 14:4-7 ) And again He says , " Be not afraid , ye beasts of the field : for the pastures of the wilderness do spring , for the tree beareth her fruit , the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength . Be glad then , ye children of Zion , and rejoice in the LORD in the first month . And the floors shall be full of wheat , and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil . And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten , the cankerworm , and the caterpiller , and the palmerworm , my great army which I sent among you . And ye shall eat in plenty , and be satisfied , and praise the name of the LORD your God , that hath dealt wondrously with you : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Joel 2:22-26 ) <p> Oh ! that you could but know just what your Lord meant when He said , " Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they toil not , neither do they spin . " * ( Matthew 6:28 ) Surely these words give us a picture of a life and of a growth far different from the ordinary life and growth of Christians ; a life of rest , and a growth without effort ; and yet a life and a growth crowned with glorious results . And to every soul that will thus become a lily in the garden of the Lord , and will grow as the lilies grow , the same glorious array will be surely given as is given them ; and they will know the fulfilment of that wonderful mystical passage concerning their Beloved , that " He feedeth among the lilies . " * ( Song 2:16 ; 6:3 ) <p> This is the sort of growth in grace in which we who have entered into the life of full trust believe : a growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower and fruit , and becomes a tree planted by the rivers of water , that bringeth forth his fruit in his season ; whose leaf also does not wither , and who prospers in whatsoever he doeth ( Psalm 1:3 ) . And we rejoice to know that there are growing up now in the Lords heritage many such plants , who , as the lilies behold the face of the sun and grow thereby , are , by " beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord , being changed into the same image from glory to glory , even as by the Spirit of the Lord . " * ( 2 Corinthians 3:18 ) <p> Should you ask such , how it is that they grow so rapidly and with such success , their answer would be that they are not concerned about their growing , and are hardly conscious that they do grow ; that their Lord has told them to abide in Him , and has promised that if they do thus abide , they shall certainly bring forth much fruit ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is their part , and leave the cultivating and the growing and the training and pruning to their good Husbandman , who alone is able to manage these things or bring them about . You will find that such souls are not engaged in watching self , but in looking unto Jesus . They do not toil nor spin for their spiritual garments , but leave themselves in the hands of the Lord to be arrayed as it may please Him . Self-effort and self-dependence are at an end with them . Their interest in self is gone , transferred over into the hands of another . Self has become really nothing , and Christ alone is all in all to such as these . And the blessed result is , that not even Solomon , in all his glory , was arrayed like these shall be . <p> Let us look at this subject practically . We all know that growing is not a thing of effort , but is the result of an inward life , a principle of growth . All the stretching and pulling in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a live oak grows without stretching . It is plain , therefore , that the essential thing is to get within you the growing life , and then you can not help but grow . And this life is the life hid with Christ in God ( Colossians 3:3 ) , the wonderful divine life of an indwelling Holy Ghost . Be filled with this , dear believer , and , whether you are conscious of it or not , you must grow , you can not help growing . Do not trouble about your growing , but see to it that you have the growing life . Abide in the Vine ( John 15:4 ) . Let the life from Him flow through all your spiritual veins . Interpose no barrier to His mighty , life-giving power , working in you all the good pleasure of His will . Yield yourself up utterly to His sweet control . Put your growing into His hands , as completely as you have put all your other affairs . Suffer Him to manage it as He will . Do not concern yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him absolutely , and always . Accept each moments dispensation as it comes to you , from His dear hands , as being the needed sunshine or dew for that moments growth . Say a continual " Yes " to your Fathers will . <p> Heretofore you have perhaps tried , as so many do , to be both the lily and the gardener , both the vineyard and the husbandman . You have taken upon your shoulders the burdens and responsibilities that belong only to the Divine Husbandman , and which He alone is able to bear . Henceforth consent to take your rightful place and to be only what you really are . Say to yourself , " If I am the garden only , and not the gardener , if I am the vine only , and not the husbandman , it is surely essential to my right growth and well-being that I should keep the place and act the part of the garden , and should not usurp the gardeners place , nor try to act the gardeners part . " <p> Do not seek then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your borders ; do not plant your own seeds , nor dig about , nor prune , nor watch over your own vines . Be content with what the Divine Husbandman arranges for you , and with the care He gives . Let Him choose the sort of plants and fruits He sees best to cultivate , and grow a potato as gladly as a rose , if such be His will , and homely , everyday virtues as willingly as exalted fervors . Be satisfied with the seasons He sends , with the sunshine and rain He gives , with the rapidity or slowness of your growth , in short , with all His dealings and processes , no matter how little we may comprehend them . <p> There is infinite repose in this . As the violet rests in its little nook , receiving contentedly its daily portion satisfied to let rains fall , and suns rise , and the earth to whirl , without one anxious pang , so must we repose in the present as God gives it to us , accepting contentedly our daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be whirling around us , in His great creative and redemptive plan . <p> The wind that blows can never kill The tree God plants ; It bloweth east , it bloweth west , The tender leaves have little rest , But any wind that blows is best.The tree God plantsStrikes deeper root , grows higher still , Spreads wider boughs , for Gods good-willMeets all its wants . <p> There is no frost hath power to blightThe tree God shields ; The roots are warm beneath soft snows , And when spring comes it surely knows , And every bud to blossom grows.The tree God shieldsGrows on apace by day and night , Till , sweet to taste and fair to sight , Its fruit it yields . <p> There is no storm hath power to blastThe tree God knows ; No thunder-bolt , nor beating rain , Nor lightning flash , nor hurricane ; When they are spent it doth remain.The tree God knowsThrough every tempest standeth fast , And , from its first day to its last , Still fairer grows . <p> If in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow , And far and near all men will knowFor heavenly land He bids it blow.A seed God sows , And up it springs by day and night ; Through life , through death , it groweth right , Forever grows . <h> Service <p> There is , perhaps , no part of Christian experience where a greater change is known upon entering into the life hid with Christ in God , than in the matter of service . In all the lower forms of Christian life , service is apt to have more or less of bondage in it ; that is , it is one purely as a matter of duty , and often as a trial and a cross . Certain things , which at the first may have been a joy and delight , become weary tasks , performed faithfully , perhaps , but with much secret disinclination , and many confessed or unconfessed wishes that they need not be done at all , or at least that they need not be done so often . The soul finds itself saying , instead of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of duty . The yoke , which was at first easy , begins to gall , and the burden feels heavy instead of light . <p> One dear Christian expressed it once to me in this way . " When I was first converted , " she said , " I was so full of joy and love that I was only too glad and thankful to be allowed to do anything for my Lord , and I eagerly entered every open door . But after a while , as my early joy faded away , and my love burned less fervently , I began to wish I had not been quite so eager ; for I found myself involved in lines of service which were gradually becoming very distasteful and burdensome to me . I could not very well give them up , since I had begun them , without exciting great remark , and yet I longed to do so increasingly . I was expected to visit the sick , and pray beside their beds . I was expected to attend prayer-meetings , and speak at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort in Christian work , and the sense of these expectations bowed me down continually . At last it became so unspeakably burdensome to me to live the sort of Christian life I had entered upon , and was expected by all around me to live , that I felt as if any kind of manual labor would have been easier , and I would have preferred , infinitely , scrubbing all day on my hands and knees , to being compelled to go through the treadmill of my daily Christian work . I envied , " she said , " the servants in the kitchen , and the women at the wash-tubs . " <p> This may seem to some like a strong statement : but does it not present a vivid picture of some of your own experiences , dear Christian ? Have you never gone to your work as a slave to his daily task , knowing it to be your duty , and that therefore you must do it , but rebounding like an india-rubber ball back into your real interests and pleasures the moment your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the wrong way to feel , and have been ashamed of it from the bottom of your heart , but still you have seen no way to help it . You have not loved your work , and , could you have done so with an easy conscience , you would have been glad to have given it up altogether . <p> Or , if this does not describe your case , perhaps another picture will . You do love your work in the abstract ; but , in the doing of it , you find so many cares and responsibilities connected with it , so many misgivings and doubts as to your own capacity or fitness , that it becomes a very heavy burden , and you go to it bowed down and weary , before the labor has even begun . Then also you are continually distressing yourself about the results of your work , and greatly troubled if they are not just what you would like , and this of itself is a constant burden . <p> Now from all these forms of bondage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of faith . In the first place , service of any sort becomes delightful to it , because , having surrendered its will into the keeping of the Lord , He works in it to will and to do of His good pleasure , and the soul finds itself really wanting to do the things God wants it to do . It is always very pleasant to do the things we want to do , let them be ever so difficult of accomplishment , or involve ever so much of bodily weariness . If a mans will is really set on a thing , he regards with a sublime indifference the obstacles that lie in the way of his reaching it , and laughs to himself at the idea of any opposition or difficulties hindering him . How many men have gone gladly and thankfully to the ends of the world in search of worldly fortunes , or to fulfil worldly ambitions , and have scorned the thoughts of any cross connected with it ! How many mothers have congratulated themselves and rejoiced over the honor done their sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their countrys service , although it has involved perhaps years of separation , and a life of hardship for their dear ones ? And yet these same men and these very mothers would have felt and said that they were taking up crosses too heavy almost to be borne , had the service of Christ required the same sacrifice of home , and friends , and worldly ease . It is altogether the way we look at things , whether we think they are crosses or not . And I am ashamed to think that any Christian should ever put on a long face and she 'd tears over doing a thing for Christ , which a worldly man would be only too glad to do for money . <p> What we need in the Christian life is to get believers to want to do Gods will , as much as other people want to do their own will . And this is the idea of the Gospel . It is what God intended for us ; and it is what He has promised . In describing the new covenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the old covenant made on Sinai , that is , a law given from the outside , controlling a man by force , but it shall be a law written within constraining a man by love . " I will put my laws , " He says , " in their mind , and write them in their hearts . " This can mean nothing but that we shall love His law , for anything written on our hearts we must love . And putting it into our minds is surely the same as God working in us " to will and to do of his good pleasure , " * ( Philippians 2:13 ) and means that we shall will what God wills , and shall obey His sweet commands , not because it is our duty to do so , but because we ourselves want to do what He wants us to do . Nothing could possibly be conceived more effectual than this . How often have we thought when dealing with our children , " Oh , if I could only get inside of them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how easy it would be to manage them then ! " And how often practically in experience we have found that , to deal with cross-grained people , we must carefully avoid suggesting our wishes to them , but must in some way induce them to suggest them themselves , sure that then there will be no opposition to contend with . And we , who are by nature a stiff-necked people , always rebel more or less against a law from outside of us , while we joyfully embrace the same law springing up within . <p> Gods plan for us therefore is to get possession of the inside of a man , to take the control and management of his will , and to work it for him ; and then obedience is easy and a delight , and service becomes perfect freedom , until the Christian is forced to exclaim , " This happy service ! Who could dream earth had such liberty ? " <p> What you need to do then , dear Christian , if you are in bondage , is to put your will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Him the entire control of it . Say , " Yes , Lord , yes ! " to everything ; and trust Him so to work in you to will , as to bring your whole wishes and affections into conformity with His own sweet and lovable and most lovely will . I have seen this done over and over , in cases where it looked beforehand an utterly impossible thing . In one case , where a lady had been for years rebelling fearfully against a thing which she knew was right , but which she hated , I saw her , out of the depths of despair and without any feeling , give her will in that matter up into the hands of her Lord , and begin to say to Him , " Thy will be done ; thy will be done ! " And in one short hour that very thing began to look sweet and precious to her . It is wonderful what miracles God works in wills that are utterly surrendered to Him . He turns hard things into easy , and bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy things in the place of the hard , but He actually changes the hard thing into an easy one . And this is salvation . It is grand . Do try it , you who are going about your daily Christian living as to a hard and weary task , and see if your divine Master will not transform the very life you live now as a bondage , into the most delicious liberty ! <p> Or again , if you do love His will in the abstract , but find the doing of it hard and burdensome , from this also there is deliverance in the wonderful life of faith . For in this life no burdens are carried , nor anxieties felt . The Lord is our burden-bearer , and upon Him we must lay off every care . He says , in effect , " Be careful for nothing , but just make your requests known to Me , and I will attend to them all . Be careful for nothing , " He says , " not even your service . " Above all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves to be so utterly helpless in this , that even if we were careful , it would not amount to anything . What have we to do with thinking whether we are fit or not ! The Master-Workman surely has a right to use any tool He pleases for His own work , and it is plainly not the business of the tool to decide whether it is the right one to be used or not . He knows ; and if He chooses to use us , of course we must be fit . And in truth , if we only knew it , our chiefest fitness is in our utter helplessness . His strength can only be made perfect in our weakness . I can give you a convincing illustration of this . <p> I was once visiting an idiot asylum and looking at the children going through dumb-bell exercises . Now we all know that it is a very difficult thing for idiots to manage their movements . They have strength enough , generally , but no skill to use this strength , and as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercises this deficiency was very apparent . They made all sorts of awkward movements . Now and then , by a happy chance , they would make a movement in harmony with the music and the teachers directions , but for the most part all was out of harmony . One little girl , however , I noticed , who made perfect movements . Not a jar nor a break disturbed the harmony of her exercises . And the reason was , not that she had more strength than the others , but that she had no strength at all . She could not so much as close her hands over the dumb-bells , nor lift her arms , and the master had to stand behind her and do it all . She yielded up her members as instruments to him , and his strength was made perfect in her weakness . He knew how to go through those exercises , for he himself had planned them , and therefore when he did it , it was done right . She did nothing but yield herself up utterly into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was her part , the responsibility was all his . It was not her skill that was needed to make harmonious movements , but only his . The question was not of her capacity , but of his . Her utter weakness was her greatest strength . And if this is a picture of our Christian life , it is no wonder that may rest upon me. " * ( 2 Corinthians 12:9 ) Who would not glory in being so utterly weak and helpless , that the Lord Jesus Christ should find no hindrance to the perfect working of His mighty power through us and in us ? <p> Then , too , if the work is His , the responsibility is His , and we have no room left for worrying about it . Everything in reference to it is known to Him , and He can manage it all . Why not leave it all with Him then , and consent to be treated like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the most effectual workers I know are those who do not feel the least care or anxiety about their work , but who commit it all to their dear Master , and , asking Him to guide them moment by moment in reference to it , trust Him implicitly for each moments needed supplies of wisdom and of strength . To see such , you would almost think perhaps that they were too free from care , where such mighty interests are at stake . But when you have learned Gods secret of trusting , and see the beauty and the power of that life which is yielded up to His working , you will cease to condemn , and will begin to wonder how any of Gods workers can dare to carry burdens , or assume responsibilities which He alone is able to bear . <p> There are one or two other bonds of service from which this life of trust delivers us . We find out that we are not responsible for all the work in the world . The commands cease to be general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map out a general course of action for us and leave us to get along through it by our own wisdom and skill as best we may , but He leads us step by step , giving us each hour the special guidance needed for that hour . His blessed Spirit dwelling in us , brings to our remembrance at the time the necessary command ; so that we do not need to take any thought ahead but simply to take each step as it is made known to us , following our Lord whithersoever He leads us . " The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD " * ( Psalm 37:23 ) ; not his way only , but each separate step in that way . Many Christians make the mistake of expecting to receive Gods commands all in a lump , as it were . They think because He tells them to give a tract to one person in a railway train , for instance , that He means them always to give tracts to everybody , and they burden themselves with an impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , because the Lord had sent her to speak a message to one soul whom she met in a walk , took it as a general command for always , and thought she must speak to everyone she met about their souls . This was , of course , impossible , and as a consequence she was soon in hopeless bondage about it . She became absolutely afraid to go outside of her own door , and lived in perpetual condemnation . At last she disclosed her distress to a friend who was instructed in the ways of God with His servants , and this friend told her she was making a great mistake ; that the Lord had His own especial work for each especial workman , and that the servants in a well-regulated household might as well each one take it upon himself to try and do the work of all the rest , as for the Lords servants to think they were each one under obligation to do everything . He told her just to put herself under the Lords personal guidance as to her work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular person to whom He would have her speak , assuring her that He never puts forth His own sheep without going before them , and making a way for them Himself . She followed this advice , and laid the burden of her work on the Lord , and the result was a happy pathway of daily guidance , in which she was led into much blessed work for her Master , but was able to do it all without a care or a burden , because He led her out and prepared the way before her . <p> Putting ourselves into Gods hands in this way , seems to me just like making the junction between the machinery and the steam engine . The power is not in the machinery , but in the steam ; disconnected from the engine , the machinery is perfectly useless ; but let the connection be made , and the machinery goes easily and without effort , because of the mighty power there is behind it . Thus the Christian life becomes an easy , natural life when it is the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strain , because their wills are not fully in harmony with the will of God , the connection is not perfectly made at every point , and it requires an effort to move the machinery . But when once the connection is fully made , and the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus can work in us with all its mighty power , we are then indeed made free from the law of sin and death , and shall know the glorious liberty of the children of God . We shall lead frictionless lives . <p> Another form of bondage as to service , from which the life of faith delivers the soul , is in reference to the after-reflections which always follow any Christian work . These self-reflections are of two sorts . Either the soul congratulates itself upon its success , and is lifted up ; or it is distressed over its failure , and is utterly cast down . One of these is sure to come , and of the two I think the first is the more to be dreaded , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in the life of trust , neither will trouble us ; for , having committed ourselves and our work to the Lord , we will be satisfied to leave it to Him , and will not think about ourselves in the matter at all . <p> Years ago I came across this sentence in an old book : " Never indulge , at the close of an action , in any self-reflective acts of any kind , whether of self-congratulation or of self-despair . Forget the things that are behind , the moment they are past , leaving them with God . " It has been of unspeakable value to me . When the temptation comes , as it always does , to indulge in these reflections , either of one sort or the other , I turn from them at once , and positively refuse to think about my work at all , leaving it with the Lord to overrule the mistakes , and to , bless it as He chooses . <p> To sum it all up then , what is needed for happy and effectual service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and leave it there . Do not take it to Him in prayer , saying , " Lord , guide me ; Lord , give me wisdom ; Lord , arrange for me , " and then arise from your knees , and take the burden all back , and try to guide and arrange for yourself . Leave it with the Lord , and remember that what you trust to Him , you must not worry over nor feel anxious about . Trust and worry can not go together . If your work is a burden , it is because you are not trusting it to Him . But if you do trust it to Him , you will surely find that the yoke He puts upon you is easy , and the burden He gives you to carry is light , and even in the midst of a life of ceaseless activity you shall find rest to your soul . <p> But some may say that this teaching would make us into mere puppets . I answer , " No , it would simply make us into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that he shall plan , or arrange , or decide , or supply the necessary material , but simply and only that he shall obey . It is for the Master to do all the rest . The servant is not responsible , either , for results . The Master alone knows what results He wished to have produced , and therefore He alone can judge of them . Intelligent service will , of course , include some degree of intelligent sympathy with the thoughts and plans of the Master , but after all there can not be a full comprehension , and the responsibility can not be transferred from the Masters shoulders to the servants . And in our case , where our outlook is so limited and our ignorance so great , we can do very little more than be in harmony with the will of our Divine Master , without expecting to comprehend it very fully , and we must leave all the results with Him . What looks to us like failure on the seen side , is often , on the unseen side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lament and worry , we shall often be doing the foolish and useless thing of weeping where we ought to be singing and rejoicing . <p> Far better is it to refuse utterly to indulge in any self-reflective acts at all ; to refuse , in fact , to think about self in any way , whether for good or evil . We are not our own property , nor our own business . We belong to God , and are His instruments and His business ; and since He always attends to His own business , He will of course attend to us . <p> I heard once of a slave who was on board a vessel in a violent storm , and who was whistling contentedly while everyone else was in an agony of terror . At last someone asked him if he was not afraid he would be drowned . He replied with a broad grin , " Well , missus , spose I is . I do n't  blong to myself , and it will only be massas loss any how . " <p> Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexities and sufferings in service . And with a band of servants thus abandoned to our Masters use and to His care , what might He not accomplish ? Truly one such would " chase a thousand , and two put ten thousand to flight " * ( Deuteronomy 32:30 ) ; and nothing would be impossible to them . For it is nothing with the Lord " to help , whether with many , or with them that have no power . " * ( 2 Chronicles 14:11 ) <p> May God raise up such an army speedily ! <p> And may you , my dear reader enroll your name in this army today and , yielding yourself unto God as one who is alive from the dead , may everyone of your members be also yielded unto Him as instruments of righteousness , to be used by Him as He pleases . <h> Difficulties Concerning Guidance <p> You have now begun , dear reader , the life of faith . You have given yourself to the Lord to be His wholly and altogether , and He has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vessel unto His honor . Your one most earnest desire is to be very pliable in His hands , and to follow Him whithersoever He may lead you , and you are trusting Him to work in you to will and to do of His good pleasure . But you find a great difficulty here . You have not learned yet to know the voice of the Good Shepherd , and are therefore in great doubt and perplexity as to what really is His will concerning you . <p> Perhaps there are certain paths into which God seems to be calling you , of which your friends utterly disapprove . And these friends , it may be , are older than yourself in the Christian life , and seem to you also to be much further advanced . You can scarcely bear to differ from them or distress them ; and you feel also very diffident of yielding to any seeming impressions of duty of which they do not approve . And yet you can not get rid of these impressions , and you are plunged into great doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these difficulties , to the fully surrendered soul . I would repeat , fully surrendered , because if there is any reserve of will upon any point , it becomes almost impossible to find out the mind of God in reference to that point ; and therefore the first thing is to be sure that you really do purpose to obey the Lord in every respect . If however this is the case , and your soul only needs to know the will of God in order to consent to it , then you surely can not doubt His willingness to make His will known , and to guide you in the right paths . There are many very clear promises in reference to this . Take , for instance , John 10:3-4 : " He calleth his own sheep by name , be given him . " With such passages as these , and many more like them , we must believe that Divine guidance is promised to us , and our faith must confidently look for and expect it . This is essential ; for in James 1:6-7 , thing of the Lord . " <p> Settle this point then first of all , that Divine guidance has been promised , and that you are sure to have it , if you ask for it ; and let no suggestion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must remember that our God has all knowledge and all wisdom , and that therefore it is very possible He may guide you into paths wherein He knows great blessings are awaiting you , but which to the short-sighted human eyes around you seem sure to result in confusion and loss . You must recognize the fact that Gods thoughts are not as mans thoughts , nor His ways as mans ways ; and that He who knows the end of things from the beginning , alone can judge of what the results of any course of action may be . You must therefore realize that His very love for you may perhaps lead you to run counter to the loving wishes of even your dearest friends . You must learn from Luke 14:26-33 , and similar passages , that in order , not to be saved only , but to be a disciple or follower of your Lord , you may perhaps be called upon to forsake all that you have , and to turn your backs on even father or mother , or brother or sister , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life also . Unless the possibility of this is clearly recognized , the soul would be very likely to get into difficulty , because it often happens that the child of God who enters upon this life of obedience is sooner or later led into paths which meet with the disapproval of those he best loves ; and unless he is prepared for this , and can trust the Lord through it all , he will scarcely know what to do . <p> All this , it will of course be understood , is perfectly in harmony with those duties of honor and love which we owe to one another in the various relations of life . The nearer we are to Christ , the more shall we be enabled to exemplify the meekness and gentleness of our Lord , and the more tender will be our consideration for those who are our natural guardians and counsellors . The Masters guidance will always manifest itself by the Masters Spirit , and where , in obedience to Him , we are led to act contrary to the advice or wishes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive , by the love and patience which will mark our conduct . <p> But this point having been settled , we come now to the question as to how Gods guidance is to come to us , and how we shall be able to know His voice . <p> There are four especial ways in which God speaks : by the voice of Scripture , the voice of the inward impressions of the Holy Spirit , the voice of our own higher judgment , and the voice of providential circumstances . <p> Where these four harmonize , it is safe to say that God speaks . For I lay it down as a foundation principle , which no one can gainsay , that of course His voice will always be in harmony with itself , no matter in how many different ways He may speak . The voices may be many , the message can be but one . If God tells me in one voice to do or to leave undone anything , He can not possibly tell me the opposite in another voice . If there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the same . Therefore , my rule for distinguishing the voice of God would be to bring it to the test of this harmony . <p> If I have an impression , therefore , I must see if it is in accordance with Scripture , and whether it commends itself to my own higher judgment , and also whether , as we Quakers say , the " way opens " for its carrying out . If either one of these tests fail , it is not safe to proceed ; but I must wait in quiet trust until the Lord shows me the point of harmony , which He surely will , sooner or later , if it is His voice that has spoken . <p> For we must not overlook the fact that there are other voices that speak to the soul . There is the loud and clamoring voice of self , that is always seeking to be heard . And there are the voices , too , of evil and deceiving spirits , who lie in wait to entrap every traveller entering these higher regions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that we are seated in " heavenly places in Christ , " * ( Ephesians 2:6 ) we are also told that we shall have to fight there with spiritual enemies ( Ephesians 6:12 ) . These spiritual enemies , whoever or whatever they may be , must necessarily communicate with us by means of our spiritual faculties , and their voices , therefore , will be , as the voice of God is , an inward impression made upon our spirits . <p> Therefore , just as the Holy Spirit may tell us , by impressions , what is the will of God concerning us , so also will these spiritual enemies tell us , by impressions , what is their will concerning us , though not of course giving it their name . It is very plain , therefore , that we must have some test or standard by which to try these inward impressions , in order that we may know whose voice it is that is speaking . And that test will always be the harmony to which I have referred . Sometimes , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honest Christians have ignored and even violated the teachings of Scripture , have disregarded the plain pointings of Providence , and have outraged their own higher judgment . God , who sees the sincerity of their hearts , can and does pity and forgive , but the consequences as to this life are often very sad . <p> Our first test , therefore , of the Divine authority of any voice which may seem to speak to us , must be its harmony in moral character with the mind and will of God , as revealed to us in the Gospel of Christ . Whatever is contrary to this , can not be Divine , because God can not contradict Himself . <p> Until we have found and obeyed Gods will in reference to any subject , as it is revealed in the Bible , we can not expect a separate direct personal revelation . A great many fatal mistakes are made in this matter of guidance , by the overlooking of this simple rule . Where our Father has written out for us plain directions about anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation to us concerning it . No man , for instance , needs or could expect any direct revelation to tell him not to steal , because God has already in the Scriptures plainly declared His will about it . This seems such an obvious thing that I would not speak of it , but that I have frequently met with Christians who have altogether overlooked it , and have gone off into fanaticism as the result . For the Scriptures are far more explicit even about details than most people think . And there are not many important affairs in life for which a clear direction may not be found in Gods book . <p> I only give these as examples to show how very full and practical the Bible guidance is . If , therefore , you find yourself in perplexity , first of all search and see whether the Bible speaks on the point in question , asking God to make plain to you by the power of His Spirit , through the Scripture , what is His mind . And whatever shall seem to you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When we read and meditate upon this record of Gods mind and will , with our understandings thus illuminated by the inspiring Spirit , our obedience will be as truly an obedience to a present , living word , as though it were afresh spoken to us today by our Lord from Heaven . The Bible is not only an ancient message from God sent to us many ages ago , but it is a present message sent to us now each time we read it . " The words that I speak unto you , they are spirit , and they are life , " * ( John 6:63 ) and obedience to these words now is a living obedience to a present and personal command . <p> But it is essential in this connection to remember that the Bible is a book of principles , and not a book of disjointed aphorisms . Isolated texts may often be made to sanction things , to which the principles of Scripture are totally opposed . I heard not long ago of a Christian woman in a Western meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk by faith , not by sight , " * ( 2 Corinthians 5:7 ) brought very vividly before her mind , felt a strong impression that it was a command to be literally obeyed in the outward ; and , blindfolding her eyes , insisted on walking up and down the aisle of the meeting-house , as an illustration of the walk of faith . She very soon stumbled and fell against the stove , burning herself seriously , and then wondered at the mysterious dispensation . The principles of Scripture , and her own sanctified common-sense , if applied to this case , would have saved her from the delusion . <p> The second test , therefore , to which our impressions must be brought , is that of our own higher judgment , or common-sense . <p> It is as true now as in the days when Solomon wrote , that " a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels " * ( Proverbs 1:5 ) ; and his exhortation still continues binding upon us : " Wisdom is the principal thing ; therefore get wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * ( Proverbs 4:7 ) <p> As far as I can see , the Scriptures everywhere make it an essential thing for the children of God to use all the faculties which have been given them , in their journey through this world . They are to use their outward faculties for their outward walk , and their inward faculties for their inward walk . And they might as well expect to be " kept " from dashing their feet against a stone in the outward , if they walk blindfold , as to be " kept " from spiritual stumbling , if they put aside their judgment and common-sense in their interior life . <p> I asked a Christian of " sound mind " lately how she distinguished between the voice of false spirits and the guidance of the Holy Spirit , and she replied promptly , " I rap them over the head , and see if they have any common-sense . " <p> Some , however , may say here , " But I thought we were not to depend on our human understanding in Divine things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to depend on our unenlightened human understanding , but upon our human judgment and common-sense , enlightened by the Spirit of God . That is , God will speak to us through the faculties He has Himself given us , and not independently of them . That is , just as we are to use our eyes when we walk , no matter how full of faith we may be , so also we are to use our mental faculties in our inward life . <p> The third and last test to which our impressions must be brought is that of providential circumstances . If a " leading " is of God , a way will always open for it . Our Lord assures us of this they know his voice . " * ( John 10:4 ) Notice here the expression " goeth before , " and " follow . " He goes before to open a way , and we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never a sign of a Divine leading when the Christian insists on opening his own way , and riding rough-shod over all opposing things . If the Lord " goes before " us , He will open all doors for us , and we shall not need ourselves to hammer them down . <p> The fourth point I would make is this : that , just as our impressions must be tested , as I have shown , by the other three voices , so must these other voices be tested by our inward impressions ; and if we feel a " stop in our minds " about anything , we must wait until that is removed before acting . A Christian who had advanced with unusual rapidity in the Divine life , gave me as her secret this simple receipt : " I always mind the checks . " We must not ignore the voice of our inward impressions , nor ride rough-shod over them , any more than we must the other three voices of which I have spoken . <p> These four voices , then , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i.e. , the voice of our impressions , the voice of Scripture , the voice of our own sanctified judgment , and the voice of providential circumstances ; and where these four do not all agree at first , we must wait until they do . <p> A divine sense of " oughtness , " derived from the harmony of all Gods various voices , is the only safe foundation for any action . <p> And now I have guarded the points of danger , do permit me to let myself out for a little to the blessedness and joy of this direct communication of Gods will to us . It seems to me to be the grandest of privileges . In the first place , that God should love me enough to care about the details of my life is perfectly wonderful . And then that He should be willing to tell me all about it , and to let me know just now to live and walk so as to perfectly please Him , seems almost too good to be true . We never care about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a matter of indifference to us with the majority of people we meet , as to what they do or how they spend their time ; but as soon as we begin to love any one , we begin at once to care . That God cares , therefore , is just a precious proof of His love ; and it is most blessed to have Him speak to us about everything in our lives , about our duties , about our pleasures , about our friendships , about our occupations , about all that we do , or think , or say . You must know this in your own experience , dear reader , if you would come into the full joy and privilege of this life hid with Christ in God , for it is one of it most precious gifts ! <p> Gods promise is , that He will work in us to will as well as to do of His good pleasure . This , of course , means that He will take possession of our will , and work it for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so much commands from the outside , as desires springing up within . They will originate in our will ; we shall feel as though we wanted to do so and so , not as though we must . And this makes it a service of perfect liberty ; for it is always easy to do what we desire to do , let the accompanying circumstances be as difficult as they may . Every mother knows that she could secure perfect and easy obedience in her child , if she could only get into that childs will and work it for him , making him want himself to do the things she willed he should . And this is what our Father does for His children in the new dispensation ; He writes His laws on our hearts and on our minds , and we love them , and are drawn to our obedience by our affections and judgment , not driven by our fears . <p> The way in which the Holy Spirit , therefore , usually works in His direct guidance is to impress upon the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . <p> The soul when engaged , perhaps , in prayer , feels a sudden suggestion made to its inmost consciousness in reference to a certain point of duty . " I would like to do this or the other , " it thinks , " I wish I could . " Or perhaps the suggestion may come as question , " I wonder whether I had not better do so and so ? " Or it may be only at first in the way of a conviction that such is the right and best thing to be done . <p> At once the matter should be committed to the Lord , with an instant consent of the will to obey Him ; and if the suggestion is in accordance with the Scriptures , and a sanctified judgment , and with Providential circumstances , an immediate obedience is the safest and easiest course . At the moment when the Spirit speaks , it is always easy to obey ; if the soul hesitates and begins to reason , it becomes more and more difficult continually . As a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fully surrendered heart ; for God is faithful in His dealings with us , and will cause His voice to be heard before any other voices . Such convictions , therefore , should never be met by reasoning . Prayer and trust are the only safe attitudes of the soul ; and even these should be but momentary , as it were , lest the time for action should pass and the blessing be missed . <p> If , however , the suggestion does not seem quite clear enough to act upon , and doubt and perplexity ensue , especially if it is something about which ones friends hold a different opinion , then we shall need to wait for further light . The Scripture rule is , " whatsoever is not of faith is sin " * ( Romans 14:23 ) ; which means plainly that we must never act in doubt . A clear conviction of right is the only safe guide . But we must wait in faith , and in an attitude of entire surrender , saying , " Yes , " continually to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe the lack of a will thus surrendered lies at the root of many of our difficulties ; and next to this lies the want of faith in any real Divine guidance . Gods children are amazingly skeptical here . They read the promises and they feel the need , but somehow they can not seem to believe the guidance will be given to them ; as if God should want us to obey His voice , but did not know how to make us hear and understand Him . It is , therefore , very possible for God to speak , but for the soul not to hear , because it does not believe He is speaking . No earthly parent or master could possibly guide his children or servants , if they should refuse to believe he was speaking , and should not accept his voice as being really the expression of his will . <p> God , who at sundry times and in manners many , Spake to the fathers and is speaking still , Eager to see if ever or if anySouls will obey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives our Father is seeking to reveal Himself to us . " I that speak unto thee am He John 4:26 . I that speak in thy heart , I that speak in thy outward circumstances , I that speak in thy losses , I that speak in thy gains , I that speak in thy sorrows or in thy joys , I that speak everywhere and in everything , am He . " <p> We must , therefore , have perfect confidence that the Lords voice is speaking to us to teach and lead us , and that He will give us the wisdom needed for our right guidance ; and when we have asked for light , we must accept our strongest conviction of " oughtness " as being the guidance we have sought . <p> A few rules will help us here . <p> I. We must believe that God will guide us . <p> II . We must surrender our own will to His guidance . <p> III . We must hearken for the Divine voice . <p> IV . We must wait for the divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance , we must obey without question . <p> God only is the creatures home ; Though rough and strait the road , Yet nothing less can satisfyThe love that longs for God . <h> Concerning Temptation <p> Certain very great mistakes are made concerning this matter of temptation , in the practical working out of this life of faith . <p> First of all , people seem to expect that , after the soul has entered into its rest in God , temptations will cease ; and to think that the promised deliverance is not only to be from yielding to temptation , but even also from being tempted . Consequently , when they find the Canaanite still in the land , and see the cities great and walled up to Heaven , they are utterly discouraged , and think they must have gone wrong in some way , and that this can not be the true land after all . <p> Then , next they make the mistake of looking upon temptation as sin , and of blaming themselves for what in reality is the fault of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and discouragement , if continued in , always ends at last in actual sin . The enemy makes an easy prey of a discouraged soul ; so that we fall often from the very fear of having fallen . <p> To meet the first of these difficulties it is only necessary to refer to the Scripture declarations , that the Christian life is to be throughout a warfare ; and that , especially when seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus , we are to wrestle against spiritual enemies there , whose power and skill to tempt us must doubtless be far superior to any we have ever heretofore encountered . As a fact , temptations generally increase in strength tenfold after we have entered into the interior life , rather than decrease ; and no amount or sort of them must ever for a moment lead us to suppose we have not really found the true abiding place . Strong temptations are generally a sign of great grace , rather than of little grace . When the children of Israel had first left Egypt , the Lord did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although that was the nearest way ; for God said , " Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war , and they return to Egypt . " * ( Exodus 13:17 ) But afterwards , when they learned better how to trust Him , He permitted their enemies to attack them . Then also in their wilderness journey they met with but few enemies and fought but few battles , compared to those in the land , where they found seven great nations and thirty-one kings to be conquered , besides walled cities to be taken , and giants to be overcome . <p> They could not have fought with the Canaanites , or the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , until they had gone into the land where these enemies were . And the very power of your temptations , dear Christian , therefore , may perhaps be one of the strongest proofs that you really are in the land you have been seeking to enter , because they are temptations peculiar to that land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to question the fact of your having entered the promised " heavenly places . " <p> The second mistake is not quite so easy to deal with . It seems hardly worth while to say that temptation is not sin , and yet most of the distress about it arises from not understanding this fact . The very suggestion of wrong seems to bring pollution with it , and the evil agency not being recognized , the poor , tempted soul begins to feel as if it must be very bad indeed , and very far off from God to have had such thoughts and suggestions . It is as though a burglar should break into a mans house to steal , and , when the master of the house began to resist him and to drive him out , should turn round and accuse the owner of being himself the thief . It is the enemys grand ruse for entrapping us . He comes and whispers suggestions of evil to us , doubts , blasphemies , jealousies , envyings , and pride ; and then turns round and says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of such things ! It is very plain that you are not trusting the Lord ; for if you were , it would have been impossible for these things to have entered your heart . " This reasoning sounds so very plausible that the soul often accepts it as true , and at once comes under condemnation , and is filled with discouragement ; then it is easy for it to be led on into actual sin . One of the most fatal things in the life of faith is discouragement . One of the most helpful is cheerfulness . A very wise man once said that in overcoming temptations , cheerfulness was the first thing , cheerfulness the second , and cheerfulness the third . We must expect to conquer . That is why the Lord said so often to Joshua , " Be strong and of a good courage " * ( Joshua 1:6,9,18 ) ; " Be not afraid , neither be thou dismayed " * ( Joshua 1:9 ) ; " Only be thou strong and very courageous . " * ( Joshua 1:7 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid . " * ( John 14:27 ) The power of temptation is in the fainting of our own hearts . The enemy knows this well , and always begins his assaults by discouraging us , if it can in any way be accomplished . <p> Sometimes this discouragement arises from what we think is a righteous grief and disgust at ourselves that such things could be any temptation to us ; but which is really a mortification arising from the fact that we have been indulging in a secret self-congratulation that our tastes were too pure , or our separation from the world was too complete for such things to tempt us . We have expected something from ourselves , and have been sorely disappointed not to find that something there , and are discouraged in consequence . This mortification and discouragement are really a far worse condition than the temptation itself , though they present an appearance of true humility , for they are nothing but the results of wounded self-love . True humility can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it never expected anything from itself , and knows that its only hope and expectation must be in God . Therefore , instead of discouraging the soul from trusting , it drives it to a deeper and more utter trust . But the counterfeit humility which springs from self , plunges the soul into the depths of a faithless discouragement , and drives it into the very sin at which it is so distressed . <p> I remember once hearing an allegory that illustrated this to me wonderfully . Satan called together a council of his servants to consult how they might make a good man sin . One evil spirit started up and said , " I will make him sin . " <p> " How will you do it ? " asked Satan . <p> " I will set before him the pleasures of sin , " was the reply ; " I will tell him of its delights and the rich rewards it brings . " <p> " Ah , " said Satan , " that will not do ; he has tried , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another spirit started up and said , " I will make him sin . " <p> " What will you do ? " asked Satan . <p> " I will tell him of the pains and sorrows of virtue . I will show him that virtue has no delights , and brings no rewards . " <p> " Ah , no ! " exclaimed Satan , " that will not do at all ; for he has tried it , and knows that wisdoms ways are ways of pleasantness , and all her paths are peace.* ( Proverbs 3:17 ) " <p> " Well , " said another imp , starting up , " I will undertake to make him sin . " <p> " And what will you do ? " asked Satan , again . " I will discourage his soul , " was the short reply . <p> An old writer says , " All discouragement is from the devil " ; and I wish every Christian would just take this as a pocket-piece , and never forget it . We must fly from discouragement as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we fail to recognize the true agency in temptation . For if the temptations are our own fault , we can not help being discouraged . But they are not . The Bible says , " Blessed is the man that endureth temptation " * ( James 1:12 ) ; and we are exhorted to " count it all joy when we fall into divers temptations. " * ( James 1:2 ) Temptation , therefore , can not be sin ; and the truth is , it is no more a sin to hear these whispers and suggestions of evil in our souls , than it is for us to hear the swearing or wicked talk of bad men as we pass along the street . The sin only comes in either case by our stopping and joining in with them . If , when the wicked suggestions come , we turn from them at once , as we would from wicked talk , and pay no more attention to them , we do not sin . But if we carry them on in our minds , and roll them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-consent of our will to them as true , then we sin . We may be enticed by evil a thousand times a day without sin , and we can not help these enticings . But if the enemy can succeed in making us think that his enticings are our sin , he has accomplished half the battle , and can hardly fail to gain a complete victory . <p> A dear lady once came to me under great darkness , simply from not understanding this . She had been living very happily in the life of faith for some time , and had been so free from temptation as almost to begin to think she would never be tempted any more . But suddenly a very peculiar form of temptation had assailed her , which had horrified her . She found that the moment she began to pray , dreadful thoughts of all kinds would rush into her mind . She had lived a very sheltered , innocent life , and these thoughts seemed so awful to her , that she felt she must be one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She began by thinking she could not possibly have entered into the rest of faith , and ended by concluding that she had never even been born again . Her soul was in an agony of distress . I told her that these dreadful thoughts were altogether the suggestions of the enemy , who came to her the moment she kneeled in prayer , and poured them into her mind , and that she herself was not to blame for them at all ; that she could not help them any more than she could help hearing if a wicked man should pour out his blasphemies in her presence . And I urged her to recognize and treat them as from the enemy ; not to blame herself or be discouraged , but to turn at once to Jesus and commit them to Him . I showed her how great an advantage the enemy had gained by making her think these thoughts were originated by herself , and plunging her into condemnation and discouragement on account of them . And I assured her she would find a speedy victory if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignoring their presence , would simply turn her back on them and look to the Lord . <p> She grasped the truth , and the next time these thoughts came she said to the enemy , " I have found you out now . It is you who are suggesting these dreadful thoughts to me , and I hate them , and will have nothing to do with them . The Lord is my Savior ; I take them to Him , and settle them in His presence . " Immediately the baffled enemy , finding himself discovered , fled in confusion , and her soul was perfectly delivered . <p> Another thing also . The enemy knows that if a Christian recognizes a suggestion of evil as coming from him , he will recoil from it far more quickly than if it seems to be the suggestion of his own mind . If Satan prefaced each temptation with the words , " I am Satan , your relentless enemy ; I have come to make you sin , " I suppose we would hardly feel any desire at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in order to make his baits attractive . And our victory will be far more easily gained if we are not ignorant of his devices , but recognize him at his very first approach . <p> We also make another great mistake about temptations in thinking that all time spent in combating them is lost . Hours pass , and we seem to have made no progress , because we have been so beset with temptations . But it often happens that we have been serving God far more truly during these hours , than in our times of comparative freedom from temptation . Temptation is really more the devils wrath against God , than against us . He can not touch our Savior , but he can wound our Savior by conquering us , and our ruin is important to him only as it accomplishes this . We are , therefore , really fighting our Lords battles when we are fighting temptation , and hours are often worth days to us under these circumstances . We read , " Blessed is the man that endureth temptation , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and its frequent recurrence . Nothing so cultivates the grace of patience as the endurance of temptation , and nothing so drives the soul to an utter dependence upon the Lord Jesus as its continuance . And finally , nothing brings more praise and honor and glory to our dearest Lord Himself , than the trial of our faith which comes through manifold temptations . We are told that it is more precious than gold , though it be tried with fire , and that we , who patiently endure the trial , shall receive for our reward " the crown of life , which the Lord hath promised to them that love him . " * ( James 1:12 ) <p> We can not wonder , therefore , any longer at the exhortation with which the Holy Ghost opens , wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is plainly to be the blessed instrument used by God to complete our perfection , and thus the enemys own weapons are turned against himself , and we see how it is that all things , even temptations , can work together for good to them that love God ( Romans 8:28 ) . <p> As to the way of victory over temptations , it seems hardly necessary to say to those whom I am at this time especially addressing , that it is to be by faith . For this is , of course , the foundation upon which the whole interior life rests . Our one great motto is throughout , " We are nothing , Christ is all . " And always and everywhere we have started out to stand , and walk , and overcome , and live by faith . We have discovered our own utter helplessness , and know that we can not do anything for ourselves . Our only way , therefore , is to hand the temptation over to our Lord , and trust Him to conquer it for us . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it there . It must be as real a committing of ourselves to Him for victory , as it was at first a committing of ourselves to Him for salvation . He must do all for us in the one case , as completely as in the other . It was faith only then , and it must be faith only now . <p> And the victories which the Lord works in conquering the temptations of those who thus trust Him are nothing short of miracles , as thousands can testify . <p> But into this part of the subject I can not go at present , as my object has been rather to present temptation in its true light , than to develop the way of victory over it . I want to deliver conscientious , faithful souls from the bondage into which they are sure to be brought , if they fail to understand the true nature and use of temptation , and confound it with sin . I want that they should not be ignorant of the fact that temptations are , after all , an invaluable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be their original source , they are used by God to work out in us many blessed graces of character which would otherwise be lacking . Wherever temptation is , there is God also , superintending and controlling its power . " Where wert thou , Lord , while I was being tempted ? " cried the saint of the desert . " Close beside thee , my son , all the while , " was the tender reply . <p> Temptations try us ; and we are worth nothing if we are not tried . They develop our spiritual strength and courage and knowledge ; and our development is the one thing God cries for . How shallow would all our spirituality be if it them that love him . " * ( James 1:12 ) This " crown of life " will be worth all that it has cost of trial and endurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be attained . <p> An invalid lady procured once the cocoon of a very beautiful butterfly with unusually magnificent wings , hoping to have the pleasure of seeing it emerge from its cocoon in her sick-chamber . She watched it eagerly as spring drew on , and finally was delighted to see the butterfly beginning to emerge . But it seemed to have great difficulty . It pushed , and strained , and struggled , and seemed to make so little headway , that she concluded it must need some help , and with a pair of delicate scissors she finally clipped the tight cord that seemed to bind in the opening of the cocoon . Immediately the cocoon opened wide , and the butterfly escaped without any further struggle . She congratulated herself on the success of her experiment , but found in a moment that something was the matter with the butterfly . It was all out of the cocoon it is true , but its great wings were lifeless and colorless , and dragged after it as a useless burden . For a few days it lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having once lifted its powerless wings . The lady was sorely disappointed and could not understand it . But when she related the circumstance to a naturalist , he told her that it had all been her own fault . That it required just that pushing and struggling to send the life fluid into the veins of the wings , and that her mistaken kindness in shortening the struggle , had left the wings lifeless and colorless . <p> Just so do our spiritual wings need the struggle and effort of our conflict with temptation and trial ; and to grant us an escape from it would be to weaken the power of our soul to " mount up with wings as eagles , " * ( Isaiah 40:31 ) and would deprive us of the " crown of life " which is promised to those who endure . <h> Failures <p> The very title of this chapter may perhaps startle some . " Failures , " they will say ; " we thought there were no failures in this life of faith ! " <p> To this I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be ; but , as a fact , there sometimes are . And we have got to deal with facts , and not with theories . No teacher of this interior life ever says that it becomes impossible to sin ; they only insist that sin ceases to be a necessity , and that a possibility of uniform victory is opened before us . And there are very few who do not confess that , as to their own actual experience , they have at times been overcome by momentary temptation . <p> Of course , in speaking of sin here , I mean conscious , known sin . I do not touch on the subject of sins of ignorance , or what is called the inevitable sin of our nature , which are all covered by the atonement , and do not disturb our fellowship with God . I have no desire nor ability to treat of the doctrines concerning sin ; these I will leave with the theologians to discuss and settle , while I speak only of the believers experience in the matter . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall say , I have reference simply to that which comes within the range of our consciousness . <p> Misunderstanding , then , on this point of known or conscious sin , opens the way for great dangers in the higher Christian life . When a believer , who has , as he trusts , entered upon the highway of holiness , finds himself surprised into sin , he is tempted either to be utterly discouraged , and to give everything up as lost ; or else , in order to preserve the doctrine untouched , he feels it necessary to cover his sin up , calling it infirmity , and refusing to be honest and above-board about it . Either of these courses is equally fatal to any real growth and progress in the life of holiness . The only way is to face the sad fact at once , call the thing by its right name , and discover , if possible , the reason and the remedy . This life of union with God requires the utmost honesty with Him and with ourselves . The communion which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be lost by any dishonest dealing with it . A sudden failure is no reason for being discouraged and giving up all as lost . Neither is the integrity of our doctrine touched by it . We are not preaching a state , but a walk . The highway of holiness is not a place , but a way . Sanctification is not a thing to be picked up at a certain stage of our experience , and forever after possessed , but it is a life to be lived day by day , and hour by hour . We may for a moment turn aside from a path , but the path is not obliterated by our wandering , and can be instantly regained . And in this life and walk of faith , there may be momentary failures , which , although very sad and greatly to be deplored , need not , if rightly met , disturb the attitude of the soul as to entire consecration and perfect trust , nor interrupt , for more than the passing moment , its happy communion with its Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . Our sin is no reason for ceasing to trust , but only an unanswerable argument why we must trust more fully than ever . From whatever cause we have been betrayed into failure , it is very certain that there is no remedy to be found for it in discouragement . As well might a child who is learning to walk , lie down in despair when he has fallen , and refuse to take another step ; as a believer , who is seeking to learn how to live and walk by faith , give up in despair because of having fallen into sin . The only way in both cases is to get right up and try again . When the children of Israel had met with that disastrous defeat , soon after their entrance into the land , before the little city of Ai , they were all so utterly discouraged that we read : <p> " Wherefore the hearts of the people melted , and became as water . And Joshua rent his clothes , and fell to the earth upon his face before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the elders of Israel , and put dust upon their heads . And Joshua said , Alas , O LORD God , wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us ? would to God we had been content , and dwelt on the other side Jordan ! O LORD , what shall I say , when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies ! For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it , and shall environ us round , and cut off our name from the earth : and what wilt thou do unto thy great name ? " * ( Joshua 7:5-9 ) <p> What a wail of despair this was ! And how exactly it is repeated by many a child of God in the present day , whose heart , because of a defeat , melts and becomes as water , and who cries out , " Would to God we had been content and dwelt on the other side Jordan ! " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its enemies . No doubt Joshua thought then , as we are apt to think now , that discouragement and despair were the only proper and safe condition after such a failure . But God thought otherwise . " And the LORD said unto Joshua , Get thee up ; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face ? " * ( Joshua 7:10 ) <p> The proper thing to do was not to abandon themselves thus to utter discouragement , humble as it might look , but at once to face the evil and get rid of it , and afresh and immediately to " sanctify themselves . " " Up , sanctify the people , " * ( Joshua 7:13 ) is always Gods command . " Lie down and be discouraged , " is always the enemys temptation . Our feeling is that it is presumptuous , and even almost impertinent , to go at once to the Lord , after having sinned against Him . It seems as if we ought to suffer the consequences our sin first for a little while , and endure the accusings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord can be willing at once to receive us back into loving fellowship with Himself . <p> A little girl once expressed the feeling to me , with a childs outspoken candor . She had asked whether the Lord Jesus always forgave us for our sins as soon as we asked Him , and I had said , " Yes , of course He does . " <p> " Just as soon ? " she repeated , doubtingly . <p> " Yes , " I replied , " the very minute we ask , He forgives us . " <p> " Well , " she said deliberately , " I can not believe that . I should think He would make us feel sorry for two or three days first . And then I should think He would make us ask Him a great many times , and in a very pretty way too , not just in common talk . And I believe that is the way He does , and you need not try to make me think He forgives me right at once , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what most Christians think , and , what is worse , what most Christians act on , making their discouragement and their very remorse separate them infinitely further off from God than their sin would have done . Yet it is so totally contrary to the way we like our children to act towards us , that I wonder how we ever could have conceived such an idea of God . How a mother grieves when a naughty child goes off alone in despairing remorse , and doubts her willingness to forgive ; and how , on the other hand , her whole heart goes out in welcoming love to the darling who runs to her at once and begs her forgiveness ! Surely our God knew this yearning love when He said to us , " Return , ye backsliding children , and I will heal your backslidings. " * ( Jeremiah 3:22 ) <p> The fact is , that the same moment which brings the consciousness of having sinned , ought to bring also the consciousness of being forgiven . This is especially essential to an unwavering walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God can be tolerated here for an instant . <p> We can only walk in this path by looking continually unto Jesus , moment by moment ; and if our eyes are taken off of Him to look upon our own sin and our own weakness , we shall leave the path at once . The believer , therefore , who has , as he trusts , entered upon this highway , if he finds himself overcome by sin , must flee with it instantly to the Lord . He must from all unrighteousness . " He must not hide his sin and seek to salve it over with excuses , or to push it out of his memory by the lapse of time . But he must do as the children of Israel did , rise up " early in the morning , " and " run " to the place where the evil thing is hidden , and take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord ( Joshua 7:16-23 ) . He must confess his sin . And then he must stone it with stones , and burn it with fire , and utterly put it away from him , and raise over it a great heap of stones , that it may be forever hidden from his sight . And he must believe , then and there , that God is , according to His word , faithful and just to forgive him his sin , and that He does do it ; and further , that He also cleanses him from all unrighteousness . He must claim an immediate forgiveness and an immediate cleansing by faith , and must go on trusting harder and more absolutely than ever . <p> As soon as Israels sin had been brought to light and put away , at once Gods word came again in a message of glorious encouragement , " Fear not , neither be thou dismayed I have given into thy hand the king of Ai , and his people , and his city , and his land . " * ( Joshua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we must abandon ourselves more completely to the Lord , that His mighty power may the more perfectly work in us all the good pleasure of His will . Moreover , we must forget our sin as soon as it is thus confessed and forgiven . We must not dwell on it , and examine it , and indulge in a luxury of distress and remorse . We must not put it on a pedestal , and then walk around it and view it on every side , and so magnify it into a mountain that hides our God from our eyes . We must follow the example of Paul , and " forgetting those things which are behind , and reaching forth unto those things which are before , " we must " press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus . " * ( Philippians 3:13-14 ) <p> I would like to bring up two contrastive illustrations of these things . One was an earnest Christian man , an active worker in the Church , who had been living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was suddenly overcome by a temptation to treat a brother unkindly . Not having supposed it possible that he could ever sin again , he was at once plunged into the deepest discouragement , and concluded he had been altogether mistaken , and had never entered into the life of full trust at all . Day by day his discouragement increased , until it became despair , and he concluded he had never even been born again , and gave himself up for lost . He spent three years of utter misery , going further and further away from God , and being gradually drawn off into one sin after another , until his life was a curse to himself and to all around him . His health failed under the terrible burden , and fears were entertained for his reason . <p> At the end of three years he met a Christian lady , who understood the truth about sin that I have been trying to explain . In a few moments conversation she found out his trouble , and at once said , " You sinned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do not want you to try and excuse it . But have you never confessed it to the Lord and asked Him to forgive you ? " <p> " Confessed it ! " he exclaimed , " why it seems to me I have done nothing but confess it , and entreat God to forgive me night and day for all these three dreadful years . " <p> " And you have never believed He did forgive you ? " asked the lady . <p> " No , " said the poor man , " how could I , for I never felt as if He did ? " <p> " But suppose He had said He forgave you , would not that have done as well as for you to feel it ? " <p> " Oh , yes , " replied the man , " if God said it , of course I would believe it . " <p> " Very well , He does say so , " was the ladys answer , and she turned to the verse we have taken above ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she continued , " you have been all these three years confessing and confessing your sin , and all the while Gods record has been declaring that He was faithful and just to forgive it and to cleanse you , and yet you have never once believed it . You have been making God a liar 1 John 5:10 all this while by refusing to believe His record . " <p> The poor man saw the whole thing , and was dumb with amazement and consternation ; and when the lady proposed they should kneel down , and that he should confess his past unbelief and sin , and should claim , then and there , a present forgiveness and a present cleansing , he obeyed like one in a maze . But the result was glorious . In a few moments the light broke in , and he burst out into praise at the wonderful deliverance . In three minutes his soul was enabled to traverse back by faith the whole long weary journey that he had been three years in making , and he found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulness of His salvation . <p> The other illustration was the case of a Christian lady who had been living in the land of promise about two weeks , and who had had a very bright and victorious experience . Suddenly , at the end of that time , she was overcome by a violent burst of anger . For a moment a flood of discouragement swept over her soul . The enemy said , " There , now , that shows it was all a mistake . Of course you have been deceived about the whole thing , and have never entered into the life of full trust at all . And now you may as well give up altogether , for you never can consecrate yourself any more entirely , nor trust any more fully , than you did this time ; so it is very plain this life of holiness is not for you ! " These thoughts flashed through her mind in a moment , but she was well taught in the ways of God , and she said at once , " Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible says that if we confess our sins , God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness , and I believe He will do it . " <p> She did not delay a moment , but while still boiling over with anger , she ran , she could not walk , into a room where she could be alone , and kneeling down beside the bed , she said , " Lord , I confess my sin . I have sinned , I am even at this very moment sinning . I hate it , but I can not get rid of it . I confess it with shame and confusion of face to Thee . And now I believe that , according to Thy word , Thou dost forgive and Thou dost cleanse . " She said it out loud , for the inward turmoil was too great for it to be said inside . As the words " Thou dost forgive and Thou dost cleanse " passed her lips , the deliverance came . The Lord said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great calm . A flood of light and joy burst on her soul , the enemy fled , and she was more than conqueror through Him that loved her . The whole thing , the sin and the recovery from it , had occupied not five minutes , and her feet trod on more firmly than ever in the blessed highway of holiness . Thus the valley of Achor ( Joshua 7:26 ) became to her a door of hope , and she sang afresh and with deeper meaning her song of deliverance , " I will sing unto the Lord , for He hath triumphed gloriously . " <p> The truth is , the only remedy , after all in every emergency , is to trust in the Lord . And if this is all we ought to do , and all we can do , is it not better to do it at once ? I have often been brought up short by the question , " Well , what can I do but trust ? " And I have realized at once the folly of seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , " I shall have to come to simple trusting in the end , and why not come to it at once now in the beginning ? " It is a life and walk of faith we have entered upon , and if we fail in it our only recovery must lie in an increase of faith , not in a lessening of it . <p> Let every failure , then , if any occur , drive you instantly to the Lord , with a more complete abandonment and a more perfect trust ; and you will find that , sad as they are , they will not take you out of the land of rest , nor permanently interrupt your sweet communion with Him . <p> And now , having shown the way of deliverance from failure , I want to say a little as to the causes of failure in this life of full salvation . The causes do not lie in the strength of the temptation nor in our own weakness , nor , above all , in any lack in the power or willingness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was positive , " There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life . " * ( Joshua 1:5 ) And the promise to us is to bear it . " * ( 1 Corinthians 10:13 ) <p> The men of Ai were " but few , " * ( Joshua 7:3 ) and yet the people who had conquered the mighty Jericho " fled before the men of Ai. " * ( Joshua 7:4 ) It was not the strength of their enemy , neither had God failed them . The cause of their defeat lay somewhere else , and the Lord Himself declares it , " Israel hath sinned , and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them : for they have even taken of the accursed thing , and have also stolen , and dissembled also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies , but turned their backs before their enemies . " * ( Joshua 7:11-12 ) It was a hidden evil that conquered them . Deep down under the earth , in an obscure tent in that vast army , was hidden something against which God had a controversy , and this little hidden thing made the whole army helpless before their enemies . " There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee , O Israel : thou canst not stand before thine enemies , until ye take away the accursed thing from among you . " * ( Joshua 7:13 ) <p> The teaching here is simply this , that anything allowed in the heart which is contrary to the will of God , let it seem ever so insignificant , or be ever so deeply hidden , will cause us to fall before our enemies . Any root of bitterness cherished towards another , any self-seeking and harsh judgments indulged in , any slackness in obeying the voice of the Lord , any doubtful habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cripple and paralyze our spiritual life . We may have hidden the evil in the most remote corner of our hearts , and may have covered it over from our sight , refusing even to recognize its existence , of which , however , we can not help being all the time secretly aware . We may steadily ignore it , and persist in declarations of consecration and full trust , we may be more earnest than ever in our religious duties , and have the eyes of our understanding opened more and more to the truth and the beauty of the life and walk of faith . We may seem to ourselves and to others to have reached an almost impregnable position of victory , and yet we may find ourselves suffering bitter defeats . We may wonder , and question , and despair , and pray ; nothing will do any good until the accursed thing is dug up from its hiding-place , brought out to the light , and laid before God . And the moment a believer who is walking in this interior life meets with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause not in the strength of that particular enemy , but in something behind , some hidden want of consecration lying at the very centre of his being . Just as a headache is not the disease itself , but only a symptom of a disease situated in some other part of the body , so the sin in such a Christian is only the symptom of an evil hidden probably in a very different part of his being . <p> Sometimes the evil may be hidden even in that , which at a cursory glance , would look like good . Beneath apparent zeal for the truth , may be hidden a judging spirit , or a subtle leaning to our own understanding . Beneath apparent Christian faithfulness , may be hidden an absence of Christian love . Beneath an apparently rightful care for our affairs , may be hidden a great want of trust in God . I believe our blessed Guide , the indwelling Holy Spirit , is always secretly discovering these things to us by continual little twinges and pangs of conscience , so that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disregard His gentle voice , and insist upon it to ourselves that all is right ; and thus the fatal evil will continue hidden in our midst causing defeat in most unexpected quarters . <p> A capital illustration of this occurred to me once in my housekeeping . I had moved into a new house and , in looking over it to see if it was all ready for occupancy , I noticed in the cellar a very clean-looking cider-cask headed up at both ends . I debated with myself whether I should have it taken out of the cellar and opened to see what was in it , but concluded , as it seemed empty and looked nice , to leave it undisturbed , especially as it would have been quite a piece of work to get it up the stairs . I did not feel quite easy , but reasoned away my scruples and left it . Every spring and fall , when house-cleaning time came on , I would remember that cask , with a little twinge of my housewifely conscience , feeling that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , while it remained unopened , for how did I know but under its fair exterior it contained some hidden evil . Still I managed to quiet my scruples on the subject , thinking always of the trouble it would involve to investigate it ; and for two or three years the innocent-looking cask stood quietly in my cellar . <p> Then , most unaccountably , moths began to fill my house . I used every possible precaution against them , and made every effort to eradicate them , but in vain . They increased rapidly and threatened to ruin everything I had . I suspected my carpets as being the cause , and subjected them to a thorough cleaning . I suspected my furniture , and had it newly upholstered . I suspected all sorts of impossible things . At last the thought of the cask flashed on me . At once I had it brought up out of the cellar and the head knocked in , and I think it is safe to say that thousands of moths poured out . The previous occupant of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bred moths , and this was the cause of all my trouble . <p> Now I believe that , in the same way , some innocent-looking habit or indulgence , some apparently unimportant and safe thing , about which we yet have now and then little twinges of conscience , something which is not brought out fairly into the light , and investigated under the searching eye of God , lies at the root of most of the failure in this higher life . All is not given up . Some secret corner is kept locked against the entrance of the Lord . And therefore we can not stand before our enemies , but find ourselves smitten down in their presence . <p> In order to prevent failure , or to discover its cause if we have failed , it is necessary that we should keep the way everlasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be something very deceptive in our sufferings over our failures . We may seem to ourselves to be wholly occupied with the glory of God , and yet in our inmost souls it may be self alone that occasions all our trouble . Our self-love is touched in a tender spot by the discovery that we are not so saintly as we thought we were ; and this chagrin is often a greater sin than the original fault itself . <p> The only safe way to treat our failures is neither to justify nor condemn ourselves on account of them , but to lay them quietly and in simplicity before the Lord , looking at them in peace and in the spirit of love . <p> All the old mystic writers tell us that our progress is aided far more by a simple , peaceful turning to God , than by all our chagrin and remorse over our lapses from Him . Only be faithful , they say , in turning quietly to Him alone , the moment you perceive what you have done , and His presence will deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at self plunges you deeper into the slough , for this very slough is , after all , nothing but self ; while the gentlest look towards God will calm and deliver your heart . <p> Finally , let us never forget for one moment , no matter how often we may fail , that the Lord Jesus , able , according to the declaration concerning Him , to deliver us out of the hands of our enemies , that we may " serve him without fear , In holiness and righteousness before him , all the days of our life . " * ( Luke 1:74-75 ) <p> Let us then pray , everyone of us , day and night , " Lord , keep us from sinning , and make us living witnesses of Thy mighty power to save to the uttermost " ; and let us never be satisfied until we are so pliable in His hands , and have learned so to trust Him , that He will be able to " Make you perfect in every good work to do his will , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Jesus Christ ; to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen . " * ( Hebrews 13:21 ) <h> Doubts <p> A great many Christians are slaves to the habit of doubting . No drunkard was ever more utterly bound by the chains of his fatal habit than they are by theirs . Every step of their whole Christian life is taken against the fearful odds of an army of doubts , that are forever lying in wait to assail them at each favorable moment . Their lives are made wretched , their usefulness is effectually hindered , and their communion with God is continually broken by their doubts . And although the entrance of the soul upon the life of faith , of which this book treats , does in many cases take it altogether out of the region where these doubts live and flourish ; yet even here it sometimes happens that the old tyrant will rise up and reassert his sway , and will cause the feet to stumble and the heart to fail , even when he can not succeed in utterly turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We all of us remember , doubtless , the childish fascination , and yet horror , of that story of Christians imprisonment in Doubting Castle by the wicked giant Despair , and our exultant sympathy in his escape through those massive gates and from that cruel tyrant . Little did we suspect then that we should ever find ourselves taken prisoner by the same giant , and imprisoned in the same castle . And yet I fear to every member of the Church of Christ there has been at least one such experience . Turn to the account again , if it is not fresh in your minds , and see if you do not see pictured there experiences of your own that have been very grievous to bear at the time , and very sorrowful to look back upon afterwards . <p> It seems strange that people , whose very name of Believers implies that their one chiefest characteristic is that they believe , should have to confess to such experiences . And yet it is such a universal habit that I feel if the majority of the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and descriptive name that could be given them would be that of Doubters . In fact , most Christians have settled down under their doubts , as to a sort of inevitable malady , from which they suffer acutely , but to which they must try to be resigned as a part of the necessary discipline of this earthly life . And they lament over their doubts as a man might lament over his rheumatism , making themselves out as an " interesting case " of especial and peculiar trial , which requires the tenderest sympathy and the utmost consideration . <p> And this is too often true of believers , who are earnestly longing to enter upon the life and walk of faith , and who have made perhaps many steps towards it . They have got rid , it may be , of the old doubts that once tormented them , as to whether their sins are really forgiven , and whether they shall , after all , get safe to Heaven ; but they have not got rid of doubting . They have simply shifted the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Yes , I believe my sins are forgiven , and I am a child of God through faith in Jesus Christ . I dare not doubt this any more . But then " And this " but then " includes an interminable array of doubts concerning every declaration and every promise our Father has made to His children . One after another they fight with them and refuse to believe them , until they can have some more reliable proof of their being true , than the simple word of their God . And then they wonder why they are permitted to walk in such darkness , and look upon themselves almost in the light of martyrs , and groan under the peculiar spiritual conflicts they are compelled to endure . <p> Spiritual conflicts ! Far better would they be named did we call them spiritual rebellions ! Our fight is to be a fight of faith , and the moment we doubt , our fight ceases and our rebellion begins . <p> I desire to put forth , if possible , one vigorous protest against this whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lament of a drunkard and unite with him in prayer for grace to endure the discipline of his fatal indulgence , as to give way for one instant to the weak complaints of these enslaved souls , and try to console them under their slavery . To one and to the other I would dare to do nothing else but proclaim the perfect deliverance the Lord Jesus Christ has in store or them , and beseech , entreat , command them , with all the force of my whole nature , to avail themselves of it and be free . Not for one moment would I listen to their despairing excuses . You ought to be free , you can be free , you must be free ! <p> Will you undertake to tell me that it is an inevitable necessity for God to be doubted by His children ? Is it an inevitable necessity for your children to doubt you ? Would you tolerate their doubts a single hour ? Would you pity your son and condole with him , and feel that he was an interesting case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Father , I can not believe your word , I can not trust your love " ? <p> I remember once seeing the indignation of a mother I knew , stirred to its very depths by a little doubting on the part of one of her children . She had brought two little girls to my house to leave them while she did some errands . One of them , with the happy confidence of childhood , abandoned herself to all the pleasures she could find in my nursery , and sang and played until her mothers return . The other one , with the wretched caution and mistrust of maturity , sat down alone in a corner to wonder whether her mother would remember to come back for her , and to fear she would be forgotten , and to imagine her mother would be glad of the chance to get rid of her anyhow , because she was such a naughty girl , and ended with working herself up into a perfect frenzy of despair . The look on that mothers face , when upon her return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , I shall not easily forget . Grief , wounded love , indignation , and pity , all strove together for mastery . But indignation gained the day , and I doubt if that little girl was ever so vigorously dealt with before . A hundred times in my life since has that scene come up before me with deepest teaching , and has compelled me , peremptorily , to refuse admittance to the doubts about my Heavenly Fathers love , and care , and remembrance of me , that have clamored at the door of my heart for entrance . <p> I am convinced that to many people doubting is a real luxury , and to deny themselves from indulging in it would be to exercise the hardest piece of self-denial they have ever known . It is a luxury that , like the indulgence in all other luxuries , brings very sorrowful results ; and , perhaps , looking at the sadness and misery it has brought into your own Christian experience , you may be tempted to say , " Alas ! This is no luxury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But pause for a moment . Try giving it up , and you will soon find out whether it is a luxury or not . Do not your doubts come trooping to your door as a company of sympathizing friends , who appreciate your hard case , and have come to condole with you ? And is it no luxury to sit down with them and entertain them , and listen to their arguments , and join in with their condolences ? Would it be no self-denial to turn resolutely from them , and refuse to hear a word they have to say ? If you do not know , try it and see . <p> Have you never tasted the luxury of indulging in hard thoughts against those who have , as you think , injured you ? Have you never known what a positive fascination it is to brood over their unkindnesses , and to pry into their malice , and to imagine all sorts of wrong and uncomfortable things about them ? It has made you wretched , of course , but it has been a fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And just like this is the luxury of doubting . Things have gone wrong with you in your experience . Dispensations have been mysterious , temptations have been peculiar , your case has seemed different from that of any ones around you . What more natural than to conclude that for some reason God has forsaken you , and does not love you , and is indifferent to your welfare ? And how irresistible is the conviction that you are too wicked for Him to care for , or too difficult for Him to manage . <p> You do not mean to blame Him , or accuse Him of injustice , for you feel that His indifference and rejection of you are fully deserved because of your unworthiness . And this very subterfuge leaves you at liberty to indulge in your doubts under the guise of a just and true appreciation of your own shortcomings . But all the while you are as really indulging in hard and wrong thoughts of your Lord as ever you did of a human enemy ; for He says He came not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sinfulness and unworthiness is your chiefest claim upon His love and His care . <p> As well might the poor little lamb that has wandered from the flock and got lost in the wilderness say , " The shepherd does not love me , nor care for me , nor remember me , because I am lost . He only loves and cares for the lambs that never wander . " As well might the i 'll man say , " The doctor will not come to see me , nor give me any medicines , because I am i 'll . He only cares for and visits well people . " Jesus says , " They that are whole need not a physician ; but they that are sick . " * ( Luke 5:31 ; Matthew 9:12 ; Mark 2:17 ) And until he find it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , which are different from what He says of Himself , are hard thoughts ; and to indulge in them is far worse than to indulge in hard thoughts of any earthly friend or foe . From the beginning to the end of your Christian life it is always sinful to indulge in doubts . Doubts are all from the devil , and are always untrue . And the only way to meet them is by a direct and emphatic denial . <p> And this brings me to the practical part of the whole subject , as to how to get deliverance from this fatal habit . My answer would be that the deliverance from this can be by no other means than the deliverance from any other sin . It is to be found in the Lord and in Him only . You must hand your doubting over to Him , as you have learned to hand your other temptations . You must do just what you do with your temper , or your pride . You must give it up to the Lord . I believe myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as you would urge a drunkard to do against drink , trusting in the Lord alone to keep you steadfast . <p> Like any other sin , the stronghold is in the will and the will to doubt must be surrendered exactly as you surrender the will to yield to any other temptation . God always takes possession of a surrendered will . And if we come to the point of saying that we will not doubt , and surrender this central fortress of our nature to Him , His blessed Spirit will begin at once to work in us all the good pleasure of His will , and we shall find ourselves kept from doubting by His mighty and overcoming power . <p> The trouble is that in this matter of doubting the soul does not always make a full surrender , but is apt to reserve to itself a little secret liberty to doubt , looking upon it as being sometimes a necessity . " I do not want to doubt any more , " we will say , or , " I hope I shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of saying , " I will not doubt again . " But no surrender is effectual until it reaches the point of saying , " I will not . " The liberty to doubt must be given up forever . And the soul must consent to a continuous life of inevitable trust . It is often necessary , I think , to make a definite transaction of this surrender of doubting , and to come to a point about it . I believe it is quite as necessary in the case of a doubter as in the case of a drunkard . It will not do to give it up by degrees . The total abstinence principle is the only effectual one here . <p> Then , the surrender once made , the soul must rest absolutely upon the Lord for deliverance in each time of temptation . It must lift up the shield of faith the moment the assault comes . It must hand the very first suggestion of doubt over to the Lord , and must tell the enemy to settle the matter with Him . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let it come ever so plausibly , or under whatever guise of humility , the soul must simply say , " I dare not doubt ; I must trust . The Lord is good , and He does love me . Jesus saves me ; He saves me now . " Those three little words , repeated over and over " Jesus saves me , Jesus saves me , " will put to flight the greatest army of doubts that ever assaulted any soul . I have tried it times without number , and have never known it to fail . Do not stop to argue the matter out with your doubts , nor try to prove that they are wrong . Pay no attention to them whatever ; treat them with the utmost contempt . Shut your door in their faces , and emphatically deny every word they say to you . Bring up some " It is written , " and hurl it after them . Look right at Jesus , and tell Him you trust Him , and you mean to trust Him . Let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you if you will not let them in . <p> I know it will look to you sometimes as though you were shutting the door against your best friends , and your heart will long after your doubts more than ever the Israelites longed after the flesh-pots of Egypt . But deny yourself ; take up your cross in this matter , and unmercifully refuse ever to listen to a single word . <p> This very day a perfect army of doubts stood awaiting my awaking , and clamored at my door for admittance . Nothing seemed real , nothing seemed true ; and least of all did it seem possible that Imiserable , wretchedcould be the object of the Lords love , or care , or notice . If I only had been at liberty to let these doubts in , and invite them to take seats and make themselves at home , what a luxury I should have felt it to be ! But years ago I made a pledge against doubting ; and I would as soon think of violating my pledge against intoxicating liquor as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt . I therefore lifted up my shield of faith the moment I was conscious of these suggestions , and handing the whole army over to my Lord to conquer , I began to say , over and over , " The Lord does love me . He is my present and my perfect Savior ; Jesus saves me , Jesus saves me now ! " The victory was complete . The enemy had come in like a flood , but the Lord lifted up a standard against him , and he was routed and put to flight ; and my soul is singing the song of Moses and the children of Israel , saying , " I will sing unto the LORD , for he hath triumphed gloriously : the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea . The LORD is my strength and song , and he is become my salvation : he is my God , and I will prepare him an habitation ; my fathers God , and I will exalt him . " * ( Exodus 15:1-2 ) <p> It will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see clearly that doubting is sin . It is certainly a direct disobedience to our Lord , who commands us , " Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid . " * ( John 14:27 ) And all through the Bible everywhere the commands to trust are imperative , and admit of no exceptions . Time and room would fail me to refer to one hundredth part of these , but no one can read the Psalms without being convinced that the man who trusts without a question , is the only man who pleases God and is accepted of Him . The " provocation " of Israel was that they did not trust ; " anger also came up against Israel ; Because they believed not in God , and trusted not in his salvation . " * ( Psalm 78:17-22 ) And in contrast , we read in Isaiah trusteth in thee . " * ( Isaiah 26:3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of a friend , and nothing , I am convinced , grieves the heart of God more than doubting from us . <p> One of my children , who is now with the Lord , said to me one evening as I was tucking her up in bed , " Well , mother , I have had my first doubt . " <p> " Oh , Ray , " I said , " what was it ? " <p> " Why , " she replied , " Satan came to me and told me not to believe the Bible , for it was not a word of it true . " <p> " And what did thee say to him ? " I asked . <p> " Oh , " she replied , triumphantly , " I just said to him , Satan , I will believe it . So there ! " <p> I was delighted with the childs spiritual intelligence in knowing so well how to meet doubts , and encouraged her with all my heart , explaining to her how all doubts and discouragements are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liar and must not be listened to for a moment . The next night , I had forgotten all about it , however , and was surprised and startled when she said , as I was tucking her in bed , " Well , mother , Satan has been at it again . " <p> " Oh , Ray , darling ! " I exclaimed in dismay , " what did he say this time ? " <p> " Well , " she replied , " he just told me that I was such a naughty little girl that Jesus could not love me , and I was foolish to think He did . " <p> " And what did thee say this time ? " I asked . <p> " Oh ! " she replied , " I just looked at him cross and said , Satan , shut thy mouth ! " And then she added , with a smile , " He cant make me unhappy one bit . " <p> A grander battle no soul ever fought than this little child had done , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , go and do likewise ; and a similar victory shall be thine . As you lay down this book take up your pen and write out your determination never to doubt again . Make it a real transaction between your soul and the Lord . Give up your liberty to doubt forever . Put your will in this matter over on the Lords side , and trust Him to keep you from falling . Tell him all about your utter weakness and your long-encouraged habits of doubt , and how helpless you are before your enemy , and commit the whole battle to Him . Tell Him you will not doubt again ; and then henceforward keep your face steadfastly looking unto Jesus , away from yourself and away from your doubts , holding fast the profession of your faith without wavering , because He is faithful who has promised . And as surely as you do thus hold the beginning of your confidence steadfast unto the end , just so surely shall you find yourself in this matter made more than conqueror , through Him who loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conversation <p> If all that has been said concerning the life hid with Christ in God be true , its results in the practical daily walk and conversation ought to be very marked , and the people who have entered into the enjoyment of it ought to be , in very truth , a " peculiar people , zealous of good works . " * ( Titus 2:14 ) <p> My son at college once wrote to a friend to this effect : that Christians are Gods witnesses necessarily , because the world will not read the Bible , but they will read our lives ; and that upon the report these give will very much depend their belief in the Divine nature of the religion we profess . As we all know , this is an age of facts , and inquiries are being increasingly turned from theories to realities . If our religion is to make any headway now , it must be proved to be more than a theory , and we must present , to the investigation of the critical minds of our age , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformed by the mighty power of God working in us all the good pleasure of His will . Give us " forms of life , " say the scientists , and we will be convinced . And when the Church is able to present to them in all its members , the form of a holy life , their last stronghold will be conquered . <p> I desire , therefore , before closing my book , to speak very solemnly of what I conceive to be the necessary fruits of a life of faith , such as I have been describing , and to press home to the hearts of everyone of my readers their responsibility to walk worthy of the high calling wherewith they have been called . <p> And I would speak to some of you , at least , as personal friends , for I feel sure we have not gone this far together through this book without there having grown in your hearts , as there has in mine , a tender personal interest and longing for one another , that we may in everything show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of darkness into His marvellous light . As a friend , then , to friends , I am sure I may speak very plainly , and will be pardoned if I go into some particulars of life and character which are vital to all true Christian development . <p> The standard of practical holy living has been so low among Christians that any good degree of real devotedness of life and walk is looked upon with surprise , and even often with disapprobation , by a large portion of the Church . And , for the most part , the professed followers of the Lord Jesus Christ are so little like Him in character or in action , that to an outside observer there would not seem to be much harmony between them . <p> But we , who have heard the call of our God to a life of entire consecration and perfect trust , must do differently from all this . We must come out from the world and be separate , and must not be conformed to it in our characters nor in our purposes . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our conversation must be in Heaven , and we must seek those things that are above , where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God . We must walk through the world as Christ walked . We must have the mind that was in Him . As pilgrims and strangers we must abstain from fleshly lusts that war against the soul . As good soldiers of Jesus Christ , we must disentangle ourselves from the affairs of this life as far as possible , that we may please Him who hath chosen us to be soldiers . We must abstain from all appearance of evil . We must be kind one to another , tenderhearted , forgiving one another , even as God , for Christs sake , hath forgiven us . We must not resent injuries or unkindness , but must return good for evil , and turn the other cheek to the hand that smites us . We must take always the lowest place among our fellowmen ; and seek not our own honor , but the honor of others . We must be gentle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own rights , but for the rights of others . All that we do must be done for the glory of God . And , to sum it all up , since He which hath called us is holy , so we must be holy in a manner of conversation ; " Because it is written , Be ye holy , for I am holy . " * ( 1 Peter 1:16 ) <p> Now , dear friends , this is all exceedingly practical and means , surely , a life very different from the lives of most professors around us . It means that we do really and absolutely turn our backs on self , and on selfs motives and selfs aims . It means that we are a peculiar people , not only in the eyes of God , but in the eyes of the world around us ; and that , wherever we go , it will be known from our Christlike lives and conversation that we are followers of the Lord Jesus Christ ; and are not of the world , even as He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our money is our own , but the Lords , to be used in His service . We shall not feel at liberty to use our energies exclusively in the pursuit of worldly means , but , seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness , shall have all needful things added unto us . We shall find ourselves forbidden to seek the highest places , or to strain after worldly advantages . We shall not be permitted to be conformed to the world in our ways of thinking or of living . We shall feel no desire to indulge in the worlds frivolous pursuits . We shall find our affections set upon heavenly things , rather than upon earthly things . Our days will be spent not in serving ourselves , but in serving our Lord ; and all our rightful duties will be more perfectly performed than ever , because whatever we do of God from the heart .

But unless we have the right standard of Christian life set before us , we shall be hindered by our ignorance from recognizing His voice ; and it is for this reason I desire to be very plain and definite in my statements . <p> I have noticed that wherever there has been a faithful following of the Lord in a consecrated soul , several things have inevitably followed , sooner or later . <p> Meekness and quietness of spirit become in time the characteristics of the daily life ; a submissive acceptance of the will of God , as it comes in the hourly events of each day ; pliability in the hands of God to do or to suffer all the good pleasure of His will ; sweetness under provocation ; calmness in the midst of turmoil and bustle ; yieldingness to the wishes of others , and an insensibility to slights and affronts , absence of worry or anxiety ; deliverance from care and fear : all these , and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward development of that inward life which is hid with Christ in God . Then as to the habits of life : we always see such Christians sooner or later giving themselves up to some work for God and their fellowmen , willing to spend and be spent in the Masters service . They become indifferent to outward show in the furniture of their houses and the style of their living , and make all personal adornment secondary to the things of God . The voice is dedicated to God , to talk and sing for Him . The purse is placed at His disposal . The pen is dedicated to write for Him , the lips to speak for Him , the hands and the feet to do His bidding . Year after year such Christians are seen to grow more unworldly , more heavenly-minded , more transformed , more like Christ , until even their very faces express so much of the beautiful inward Divine life , that all who look at them can not but take knowledge of them that they live with God , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each one of you have come at least some Divine intimations or foreshadowings of the life I here describe .

Has not your soul been plunged into inward trouble and doubt about certain dispositions and ways , in which you have been formerly accustomed to indulge ? Have you not begun to feel uneasy with some of your habits of life , and to wish that you could do differently in these respects ? Have not paths of devotedness and of service begun to open out before you , with the longing thought , " Oh , that I could walk in them " ? <p> All these longings and doubts , and this inward distress , are the voice of the Good Shepherd in your heart seeking to call you out of all that is contrary to His will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn away from His gentle pleadings . You little know the secret paths into which He means to lead you by these very steps , nor the wonderful stores of blessedness that lie at their end , or you would spring forward with an eager joy to yield to everyone of His requirements . The heights of Christian perfection can only be reached by faithfully following the Guide who is to lead you there , and He reveals your way to you one step at a time in the teachings and providences of your daily lives , asking only on your part that you yield yourselves up to His guidance . If , then , in anything you are convinced of sin , be sure that it is the voice of your Lord , and surrender it at once to His bidding , rejoicing with a great joy that He has begun thus to lead and guide you .

Out of the midst of her darkness , she consecrated herself to the Lord , surrendering her will up altogether to Him , that He might work in her to will and to do of His own good pleasure ( Philippians 2:13 ) . Immediately He began to speak to her by His Spirit in her heart , suggesting to her some little acts of service for Him , and calling her out of all un-Christlike dispositions and ways . She recognized His voice , and yielded to Him each thing He asked for , following Him whithersoever He might lead her , with no fear but the one fear of disobeying Him . He led her rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to His will , and making her life such a testimony to those around her , that even some who had begun by opposing and disbelieving , were forced to acknowledge that it was of God , and were won to a similar surrender . And , finally , after three short months of this faithful following , it came to pass , so swiftly had she gone , that her Lord was able to reveal to her wondering soul some of the deepest secrets of His love , and to fulfil to her the marvellous promise of Acts 1:5 , baptizing her with the Holy Ghost . Think you she has ever regretted her wholehearted following of Him ? Or that aught but thankfulness and joy can ever fill her soul when she reviews the steps by which her feet had been led to this place of wondrous blessedness , even though some of them may have seemed at the time hard to take ? Ah ! dear soul , if thou wouldst know a like blessing , abandon thyself , like her , to the guidance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He may call . <p> " The perfect way is hard to flesh , It is not hard to love ; If thou wert sick for want of God , How swiftly wouldst thou move . " <p> Surely thou canst trust Him ! And if some things may be called for which look to thee of but little moment , and not worthy thy Lords attention , remember that He sees not as man seeth , and that things small to thee may be in His eyes the key and the clue to the deepest springs of thy being . In order to mould thee into entire conformity to His will , He must have thee pliable in his hands , and this pliability is more quickly reached by yielding in the little things than even by the greater . Thy one great desire is to follow Him fully ; canst thou not say then a continual " Yes , Lord ! " to all His sweet commands , whether small or great , and trust Him to lead thee by the shortest road to thy fullest blessedness ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than this , is what thy consecration meant , whether thou knew it or not . It meant inevitable obedience . It meant that the will of thy God was henceforth to be thy will under all circumstances and at all times . It meant that from that moment thou surrendered thy liberty of choice , and gave thyself up utterly into the control of thy Lord . It meant an hourly following of Him whithersoever He might lead thee , without any dream of turning back . <p> And now I appeal to thee to make good thy word . Let everything else go , that thou mayest live out , in a practical daily walk and conversation , the Divine life thou hast dwelling within thee . Thou art united to thy Lord by a wondrous tie ; walk , then , as He walked , and show to the unbelieving world the blessed reality of His mighty power to save , by letting Him save thee to the very uttermost . Thou needst not fear to consent to this , for He is thy Savior ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not asking thee , in thy poor weakness , to do it thyself ; He only asks thee to yield thyself to Him , that He may work in thee to will and to do by His own mighty power . Thy part is to yield thyself , His part is to work ; and never , never will He give thee any command which is not accompanied by ample power to obey it . Take no thought for the morrow in this matter ; but abandon thyself with a generous trust to thy loving Lord , who has promised never to call His own sheep out into any path , without Himself going before them to make the way easy and safe . Take each onward step as He makes it plain to thee . Bring all thy life in each of its details to Him to regulate and guide . Follow gladly and quickly the sweet suggestions of His Spirit in thy soul . And day by day thou wilt find Him bringing thee more and more into conformity with His will in all things ; moulding thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , into a vessel unto His honor , sanctified and meet for His use , and fitted to every good work . So shall be given to thee the sweet joy of being an epistle of Christ known and read of all men ; and thy light shall shine so brightly that men seeing , not thee , but thy good works , shall glorify , not thee , but thy Father which is in Heaven . <p> We are predestined to be " conformed to the image " * ( Romans 8:29 ) of Gods Son . This means , of course , not a likeness of bodily presence , but a likeness of character and nature . It means a similarity of thought , of feeling , of desire , of loves , of hates . It means , that we are to think and act , according to our measure , as Christ would have thought and acted under our circumstances . <p> A little girl was once questioned what it meant to be a Christian . She replied , " It means to be just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl and lived in my house . " <p> The secret of Christs life was the pouring out of Himself for others ; and if we are like Him , this will be the secret of our lives also . He saved others , but Himself He could not save . He " pleased not Himself , " * ( Romans 15:3 ) and therefore we are " not to please ourselves , " * ( Romans 15:1 ) but rather our neighbor , when it is for his good . <p> A thoughtful Hindu , who visited England and America lately to examine into Christianity , said , as the result of his observations , " What Christians need is a little more of Christs Christianity , and a little less of mans . " <p> Mans Christianity teaches sacrifice to save ourselves ; Christs Christianity teaches sacrifice to save others . Mans Christianity produces the fruitless selfishness of too much of our religion . Christs Christianity produces the blessed unselfishness of lives that are poured out for others , as was His . <p> In short , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been teaching us , is simply this , that we are to be Christlike Christians . And all our experiences amount to nothing if they do not is in heaven . " * ( Matthew 7:21 ) <h> The Joy of Obedience <p> I remember reading once somewhere this sentence , " Perfect obedience would be perfect happiness , if only we had perfect confidence in the power we were obeying . " I remember being struck with the saying , as the revelation of a possible , although hitherto undreamed-of way of happiness ; and often afterwards , through all the lawlessness and wilfulness of my life , did that saying recur to me as the vision of a rest , and yet of a possible development , that would soothe and at the same time satisfy all my yearnings . Need I say that this rest has been revealed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reality ; and that I have seen in the Lord Jesus , the Master to whom we may all yield up our implicit obedience , and , taking His yoke upon us , may find our perfect rest ? <p> You little know , dear hesitating soul , of the joy you are missing . The Master has revealed Himself to you , and is calling for your complete surrender , and you shrink and hesitate . A measure of surrender you are willing to make , and think indeed it is fit and proper you should . But an utter abandonment , without any reserves , seems to you too much to be asked for . You are afraid of it . It involves too much , you think , and is too great a task . To be measurably obedient you desire ; to be perfectly obedient appalls you . <p> And then , too , you see other souls who seem able to walk with easy consciences , in a far wider path than that which appears to be marked out for you , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and perhaps hard to you , that you must do what they need not , and must leave undone what they have liberty to do . <p> Ah ! dear Christian , this very difference between you is your privilege , though you do not yet know it manifest myself to him . " * ( John 14:21 ) You have His commandments ; those you envy have them not . You know the mind of your Lord about many things , in which , as yet , they are walking in darkness . Is not this a privilege ? Is it a cause for regret that your soul is brought into such near and intimate relations with your Master , that He is able to tell you things which those who are further off may not know ? Do you not realize what a tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many relations in life which require from the different parties only very moderate degrees of devotion . We may have really pleasant friendships with one another , and yet spend a large part of our lives in separate interests , and widely differing pursuits . When together , we may greatly enjoy one anothers society , and find many congenial points ; but separation is not any especial distress to us , and other and more intimate friendships do not interfere . There is not enough love between us , to give us either the right or the desire to enter into and share one anothers most private affairs . A certain degree of reserve and distance is the suitable thing , we feel . But there are other relations in life where all this is changed . The friendship becomes love . The two hearts give themselves to one another , to be no longer two but one . A union of souls takes place , which makes all that belongs to one the property of the other . Separate interests and separate paths in life are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , because of the nearness of the tie that binds . The reserve and distance suitable to mere friendship becomes fatal in love . Love gives all , and must have all in return . The wishes of one become binding obligations to the other , and the deepest desire of each heart is , that it may know every secret wish or longing of the other , in order that it may fly on the wings of the wind to gratify it . <p> Do such as these chafe under this yoke which love imposes ? Do they envy the cool , calm , reasonable friendships they see around them , and regret the nearness into which their souls are brought to their beloved one , because of the obligations it creates ? Do they not rather glory in these very obligations , and inwardly pity , with a tender yet exulting joy , the poor , far-off ones who dare not come so near ? Is not every fresh revelation of the mind of one another a fresh delight and privilege , and is any path found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah ! dear souls , if you have ever known this even for a few hours in any earthly relation ; if you have ever loved a fellow human being enough to find sacrifice and service on their behalf a joy ; if a whole-souled abandonment of your will to the will of another has ever gleamed across you as a blessed and longed-for privilege , or as a sweet and precious reality , then , by all the tender longing love of your heavenly Master , would I entreat you to let it be so towards God ! <p> He loves you with more than the love of friendship . As a bridegroom rejoices over his bride , so does He rejoice over you , and nothing but a full surrender will satisfy Him . He has given you all , and He asks for all in return . The slightest reserve will grieve Him to the heart . He spared not Himself , and how can you spare yourself ? For your sake He poured out in a lavish abandonment all that He had , and for His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stint or measure . <p> Oh , be generous in your self-surrender ! Meet His measureless devotion for you , with a measureless devotion to Him . Be glad and eager to throw yourself headlong into His dear arms , and to hand over the reins of government to Him . Whatever there is of you , let Him have it all . Give up forever everything that is separate from Him . Consent to resign from this time forward all liberty of choice ; and glory in the blessed nearness of union which makes this enthusiasm of devotedness not only possible but necessary . Have you never longed to lavish your love and attentions upon someone far off from you in position or circumstances , with whom you were not intimate enough for any closer approach ? Have you not felt a capacity for self-surrender and devotedness , that has seemed to burn within you like a fire , and yet had no object upon which it dared to lavish itself ? Have not your hands been full of alabaster boxes of ointment , very precious , which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ? If , then , you are hearing the sweet voice of your Lord calling you into a place of nearness to Himself , which will require a separation from all else , and which will make this enthusiasm of devotedness not only possible , but necessary , will you shrink or hesitate ? Will you think it hard that He reveals to you more of His mind than He does to others , and that He will not allow you to be happy in anything which separates you from Himself ? Do you want to go where He can not go with you , or to have pursuits which He can not share ? <p> No ! no , a thousand times , no ! You will spring out to meet His dear will with an eager joy . Even His slightest wish will become a binding law to you , which it would fairly break your heart to disobey . You will glory in the very narrowness of the path He marks out for you , and will pity with an infinite pity the poor , far-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love will be to you its sweetest privileges ; and the right you have acquired to lavish the uttermost abandonment of all that you have upon your Lord , will seem to lift you into a region of unspeakable glory . The perfect happiness of perfect obedience will dawn upon your soul , and you will begin to know something of what Jesus meant when He said , " I delight to do thy will , O my God . " * ( Psalm 40:8 ) <p> And do you think the joy in this will be all on your side ? Has the Lord no joy in those who have thus surrendered themselves to Him , and who love to obey Him ? Ah , my friends , we are not fit to speak of this but surely the Scriptures reveal to us glimpses of the delight , the satisfaction , the joy our Lord has in us , that ravish the soul with their marvellous suggestions of blessedness . That we should need Him , is easy to comprehend ; that He should need us , seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a matter of course ; but that His desire should be towards us , passes the bounds of human belief . And yet , over and over He says it , and what can we do but believe Him ? He has made our hearts capable of this supreme , overmastering affection , and has offered Himself as the object of it . It is infinitely precious to Him , and manifest myself to him . " * ( John 14:21 ) Continually at every heart He is knocking , and asking to be taken in as the supreme object of love . " Wilt thou have Me , " He says to the believer , " to be thy Beloved ? Wilt thou follow Me into suffering and loneliness , and endure hardness for My sake , and ask for no reward but My smile of approval , and My word of praise ? Wilt thou throw thyself with an utter abandonment into My will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thyself and all that thou art ? Wilt thou be content with pleasing Me and Me only ? May I have My way with thee in all things ? Wilt thou come into so close a union with Me as to make a separation from the world necessary ? Wilt thou accept Me for thy only Lord , and leave all others , to cleave only unto Me ? " <p> In a thousand ways He makes this offer of oneness with Himself to every believer . But all do not say " Yes , " to Him . Other loves and other interests seem to them too precious to be cast aside . They do not miss of Heaven because of this . But they miss an unspeakable joy . <p> You , however , are not one of these . From the very first your soul has cried out eagerly and gladly to all His offers , " Yes , Lord ; yes ! " You are more than ready to pour out upon Him all your richest treasures of love and devotedness . You have brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distress the more prudent and moderate Christians around you . Your love makes necessary a separation from the world , which a lower love can not even conceive of . Sacrifices and services are possible and sweet to you , which could not come into the grasp of a more half-hearted devotedness . The life upon which you have entered gives you the right to a lavish outpouring of your all upon your beloved One . Services , of which more distant souls know nothing , become now your sweetest privilege . Your Lord claims from you , because of your union with Him , far more than He claims of them . What to them is lawful , love has made unlawful for you . To you He can make known His secrets , and to you He looks for an instant response to every requirement of His love . <p> Oh , it is wonderful ! the glorious , unspeakable privilege upon which you have entered ! How little it will matter to you if men shall hate you , or shall separate you from their company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as evil for His dear sake ! You may well " Rejoice in that day and leap for joy " * ( Luke 6:23 ) ; for behold your reward is great in Heaven , and if you are a partaker of His suffering , you shall be also of His glory . <p> In you He is seeing of the travail of His soul , and is satisfied . Your love and devotedness are His precious reward for all He has done for you . It is unspeakably sweet to Him . Do not be afraid then to let yourself go in a heart-whole devotedness to your Lord , that can brook no reserves . Others may not approve , but He will , and that is enough . Do not stint or measure your obedience or your service . Let your heart and your hand be as free to serve Him , as His heart and His hand were to serve you . Let Him have all there is of you , body , soul , and spirit , time , talents , voice , everything . Lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Say to Him each day , " Lord , how shall I regulate this day so as to please Thee ? Where shall I go ? what shall I do ? whom shall I visit ? what shall I say ? " Give your intellect up into His control and say , " Lord , tell me how to think so as to please Thee ? " Give Him your reading , your pursuits , your friendships , and say , " Lord , give me the insight to judge concerning all these things with Thy wisdom . " Do not let there be a day nor an hour in which you are not intelligently doing His will , and following Him wholly . And this personal service to Him will give a halo to your life , and gild the most monotonous existence with a heavenly glow . <p> Have you ever grieved that the romance of youth is so soon lost in the hard realities of the world ? Bring God thus into your life and into all its details , and a far grander enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ever know , and nothing will seem hard or stern again . The meanest life will be glorified by this . Often , as I have watched a poor woman at her wash-tub , and have thought of all the disheartening accessories of such a life , and have been tempted to wonder why such lives need to be , there has come over me , with a thrill of joy , the recollection of this possible glorification of it , and I have said to myself , " Even this life , lived in Christ , and with Christ , following Him whithersoever He may lead , would be filled with an enthusiasm that would make every hour of it glorious . " And I have gone on my way comforted to know that Gods most wondrous blessings thus lie in the way of the poorest and the meanest lives . " For , " says our Lord Himself , " whosoever " whether they be rich or poor , old or young @ @ @ @ . " * ( Mark 3:35 ) <p> Pause a moment over these simple yet amazing words . His brother , and sister , and mother ! What would we not have given to have been one of these ! Oh , let me entreat of you , beloved Christian , to come , taste and see for yourself how good the Lord is , and what wonderful things He has in store for those who " keep his commandments , and do those things that are pleasing in his sight . " * ( 1 John 3:22 ) <p> " And it shall come to pass , if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day , that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth : And all these blessings shall come on thee , and overtake thee , if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God . Blessed shalt thou be in the city , and blessed @ @ @ the fruit of thy cattle , the increase of thy kine , and the flocks of thy sheep . Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store . Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in , and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out . The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face : they shall come out against thee one way , and flee before thee seven ways . The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses , and in all that thou settest thine hand unto ; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee . The LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself , as he hath sworn unto thee , if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God , and walk in his ways .

The LORD and thou shalt not be beneath ; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God , which I command thee this day , to observe and to do them . " * ( Deuteronomy 28:1-13 ) <p> For the Israelites this was outward and temporal , for us it is inward and spiritual ; and , as such , infinitely more glorious . May our surrendered wills leap out to embrace it in all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God with the soul of the believer are in order to bring him into oneness with Himself , that the prayer of our , as thou hast loved me. " * ( John 17:21,23 ) <p> This soul-union was the glorious purpose in the heart of God for His people before the foundation of the world . It was the mystery hid from ages and generations . It was accomplished in the incarnation of Christ . It has been made known by the Scriptures . And it is realized as an actual experience by many of Gods dear children . <p> But not by all . It is true of all , and God has not hidden it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too dim and their hearts too unbelieving , and they fail to grasp it . And it is for the very purpose of bringing them into the personal and actual realization of this , that the Lord is stirring up believers everywhere at the present time to abandon themselves to Him , that He may work in them all the good pleasure of His will . <p> All the previous steps in the Christian life lead up to this . The Lord has made us for it ; and until we have intelligently apprehended it , and have voluntarily consented to embrace it , the travail of His soul for us is not satisfied , nor have our hearts found their destined and final rest . <p> The usual course of Christian experience is pictured in the history of the disciples . First they were awakened to see their condition and their need , and they came to Christ and gave in their allegiance to Him . Then they followed Him , worked for Him , believed in Him ; and yet , how unlike Him ! seeking to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cross ; misunderstanding His mission and His words ; forsaking their Lord in time of danger ; but still sent out to preach , recognized by Him as His disciples , possessing power to work for Him . They knew Christ only " after the flesh , " as outside of them , their Lord and Master , but not yet their Life . <p> Then came Pentecost , and these disciples came to know Him as inwardly revealed ; as one with them in actual union , their very indwelling Life . Henceforth He was to them Christ within , working in them to will and to do of His good pleasure ; delivering them by the law of the Spirit of His life from the bondage to the law of sin and death , under which they had been held . No longer was it between themselves and Him , a war of wills and a clashing of interest . One will alone animated them , and that was His will . One interest alone was dear to them , and that was His . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize this picture , though perhaps as yet the final stage of it has not been fully reached . You may have left much to follow Christ , dear reader ; you may have believed on him , and worked for Him , and loved Him , and yet may not be like Him . Allegiance you know , and confidence you know , but not yet union . There are two wills , two interests , two lives . You have not yet lost your own life that you may live only in His . Once it was " I and not Christ " ; then it was " I and Christ " ; perhaps now it is even " Christ and I. " But has it come yet to be " Christ only , and not I at all " ? <p> Perhaps you do not understand what this oneness means . Some people think it consists in a great emotion or a wonderful feeling of oneness , and they turn inward to examine their emotions , thinking to decide by the state of these , what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere is the mistake of trusting to feelings greater than here . <p> Oneness with Christ must , in the very nature of things , consists in a Christ-like life and character . It is not what we feel , but what we are that settles the question . No matter how exalted or intense our emotions on the subject may be , if there is not a likeness of character with Christ , a unity of aim and purpose , a similarity of thought and of action , there can be no real oneness . <p> This is plain common-sense , and it is Scriptural as well . <p> We speak of two people being one , and we mean that their purposes , and actions , and thoughts , and desires are alike . A friend may pour out upon us enthusiastic expressions of love , and unity and oneness , but if that friends aims , and actions , and ways of looking at things are exactly opposite to ours , we can not feel there is any real oneness between us , notwithstanding all our affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must have the same likes and dislikes , the same joys and sorrows , the same hopes and fears . As someone says , " We must look through one anothers eyes , and think with one anothers brains . " This is , as I said above , only plain commonsense . <p> And oneness with Christ can be judged by no other rule . It is out of the question to be one with Him in any other way than in the way of nature , and character , and life . Unless we are Christ-like in our thoughts and our ways , we are not one with Him , no matter how we feel . <p> I have seen Christians , with hardly one Christ-like attribute in their whole characters , who yet were so emotional and had such ecstatic feelings of love for Christ , as to think themselves justified in claiming the closest oneness with Him . I scarcely know a sadder sight . Surely our Lord meant to reach is in heaven . " * ( Matthew 7:21 ) He was not making here any arbitrary statement of Gods will , but a simple announcement of the nature of things . Of course it must be so . It is like saying , " No man can enter the ranks of astronomers who is not an astronomer . " Emotions will not make a man an astronomer , but life and action . He must be one , not merely feel that he is one . <p> There is no escape from this inexorable nature of things , and especially here . Unless we are one with Christ as to character and life and action , we can not be one with Him in any other way , for there is no other way . We must be " partakers of His nature " * ( 2 Peter 1:4 ) or we can not be partakers of His life , for His life and His nature are one . <p> But emotional souls do not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united to Him , that they think it must be real ; and overlooking the absolute necessity of Christ-likeness of character and walk , they are building their hopes and their confidence on their delightful emotions and exalted feelings , and think they must be one with Him , or they could not have such rich and holy experiences . <p> Now it is a psychological fact that these or similar emotions can be produced by other causes than a purely divine influence , and that they are largely dependent upon temperament and physical conditions . It is most dangerous , therefore , to make them a test of our spiritual union with Christ . It may result in just such a grievous self-deception as our Lord warns against in Luke 6:46-49 , " And why call ye me , Lord , Lord , and do not the things which I say ? " Our soul delights perhaps in calling Him , " Lord , Lord , " but are we doing the things which He said ? for this , He tells us , is the important point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our feelings , we are saying in meetings , or among our friends , or even in our own heart before the Lord , that we are abiding in Him , let us take home to ourselves in solemn consideration these words of the Holy Ghost , " He that saith he abideth in him ought himself so to walk , even as he walked . " * ( 1 John 2:6 ) <p> Unless we are thus walking , we can not possibly be abiding in Him , no matter how much we may feel as if we were . <p> If you are really one with Christ you will be sweet to those who are cross to you ; you will bear everything and make no complaints ; when you are reviled you will not revile again ; you will consent to be trampled on , as Christ was , and feel nothing but love in return ; you will seek the honor of others rather than your own ; you will take the lowest place , and be the servant of all , as Christ was ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to them that despitefully use you ; you will , in short , live a Christ-like life , and manifest outwardly as well as feel inwardly a Christ-like spirit , and will walk among men as He walked among them . This , dear friends , is what it is to be one with Christ . And if all this is not your life according to your measure , then you are not one with Him , no matter how ecstatic or exalted your feelings may be . <p> To be one with Christ is too wonderful and solemn and mighty an experience to be reached by any overflow or exaltation of mere feeling . He was holy , and those who are one with Him will be holy also . There is no escape from this simple and obvious fact . <p> When our Lord tried to make us understand His oneness with God , He expressed it in such words as these , " I do always those things that please him . " * ( John 8:29 ) " Whatsoever He saith unto me that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Himself , but what He seeth the Father do : for what things soever He doeth , these also doeth the Son likewise . " * the Father which hath sent me. " * ( John 5:30 ) " If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not . But if I do , though ye believe not me , believe the works : that ye may know , and believe , that the Father is in me , and I in him . " * ( John 10:37-38 ) <p> The test of oneness then , was the doing of the same works , and it is the test of oneness now . And if our Lord could say of Himself that if He did not the works of his Father , He did not ask to be believed , no matter what professions or claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less . <p> It is forever true in the nature of things that " A good tree can not bring forth evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit . " * ( Matthew 7:18 ) It is not that they will not , but they can not . And a soul that is one with Christ will just as surely bring forth a Christ-like life , as a grapevine will bring forth grapes and not thistles . <p> Not that I would be understood to object to emotions . On the contrary , I believe they are very precious gifts , when they are from God , and are to be greatly rejoiced in . But what I do object to is the making them a test or proof of spiritual states , either in ourselves or others , and depending on them as the foundation of our faith . Let them come or let them go , just as God pleases , and make no account of them either way . But always see to it that the really vital marks of oneness with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and walk , are ours , and all we are in him . " * ( 1 John 2:4-5 ) <p> It may be , my dear reader , that the grief of your life has been the fact that you have so few good feelings . You try your hardest to get up the feelings which you hear others talking about , but they will not come . You pray for them fervently , and are often tempted to upbraid God because He does not grant them to you . And you are filled with an almost unbearable anguish because you think your want of emotion is a sign that there is not any interior union of your soul with Christ . You judge altogether by your feelings , and think there is no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to let your feelings go , and pay no regard to them whatever . They really have nothing to do with the matter . They are not the indicators of your spiritual state , but are merely the indicators of your temperament , or of your present physical condition . People in very low states of grace are often the subjects of very powerful emotional experiences . We all know this from the scenes we have heard of or witnessed at camp-meetings and revivals . I myself had a colored servant once who would become unconscious under the power of her wonderful experiences , whenever there was a revival meeting at their church , who yet had hardly a token of any spiritual life about her at other times , and who was , in fact , not even moral . Now surely , if the Bible teaches nothing else , it does teach this , that a Christ-like life and walk must accompany any experience which is really born of His Spirit . It could not be otherwise in the very nature of things . But I fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their conceptions , as to have exalted their experiences at the expense of their walk , and have come to care far more about their emotions than about their character . <p> A certain colored congregation in one of the Southern states was a plague to the whole neighborhood by their open disregard of even the ordinary rules of morality ; stealing , and lying , and cheating , without apparently a single prick of conscience on the subject . And yet their nightly meetings were times of the greatest emotion and " power . " Someone finally spoke to the preacher about it , and begged him to preach a sermon on morality , which would lead his people to see their sins . " Ah , missus , " he replied , " I knows deys bad , but den it always brings a coldness like over de meetings when I preaches about dem things . " <p> You are helpless as to your emotions , but character you can have if you will . You can be so filled with Christ as to be Christ-like , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him in the only vital and essential way , even though your feelings may tell you that it is an impossibility . <p> Having thus settled what oneness with Christ really is , the next point for us to consider is how to reach it for ourselves . <p> We must first of all find out what are the facts in the case , and what is our own relation to these facts . <p> If you read such dwelleth in you ? " and then look at the opening of the chapter to see to whom these wonderful words are spoken , even to " babes in Christ , " who were " yet carnal , " * ( 1 Corinthians 3:1-3 ) and walked according to man , you will see that this soul-union of which I speak , this unspeakably glorious mystery of an indwelling God is the possession of even the weakest and most failing believer in Christ . So that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only to realize that which you already have . Of every believer in the Lord Jesus it is absolutely true , that his body is the temple of the Holy Ghost , which is in him , which he has of God ( 1 Corinthians 6:19 ) . <p> It seems to me just in this way ; as though Christ were living in a house , shut up in a far-off closet , unknown and unnoticed by the dwellers in the house , longing to make Himself known to them and be one with them in all their daily lives , and share in all their interests , but unwilling to force Himself upon their notice ; as nothing but a voluntary companionship could meet or satisfy the needs of His love . The days pass by over that favored household , and they remain in ignorance of their marvellous privilege . They come and go about all their daily affairs with no thought of their wonderful Guest . Their plans are laid without reference to Him . His wisdom to guide , and His strength to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weeks are spent in sadness , which might have been full of the sweetness of His presence . <p> But suddenly the announcement is made , " The Lord is in the house ! " <p> How will its owner receive the intelligence ? Will he call out an eager thanksgiving , and throw wide open every door for the entrance of his glorious Guest ? Or will he shrink and hesitate , afraid of His presence and seek to reserve some private corner for a refuge from His all-seeing eye ? <p> Dear friend , I make the glad announcement to thee that the Lord is in thy heart . Since the day of thy conversion He has been dwelling there , but thou hast lived on in ignorance of it . Every moment during all that time might have been passed in the sunshine of His sweet presence , and every step have been taken under His advice . But because thou knew it not , and hast never looked for Him there , thy life has been lonely and full of failure . But now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive it ? Art thou glad to have Him ? Wilt thou throw wide open every door to welcome Him in ? Wilt thou joyfully and thankfully give up the government of thy life into His hands ? Wilt thou consult Him about everything , and let Him decide each step for thee , and mark out every path ? Wilt thou invite Him to thy innermost chambers , and make Him the sharer in thy most hidden life ? Wilt thou say , " Yes ! " to all His longing for union with thee , and with a glad and eager abandonment , hand thyself and all that concerns thee over into His hands ? If thou wilt , then shall thy soul begin to know something of the joy of union with Christ . <p> And yet , after all , this is but a faint picture of the blessed reality . For , far more glorious than it would be to have Christ a dweller in the house or in the heart , is it to be brought into such a real and actual union with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , one interest , one life . Human words can not express such glory as this . And yet I want to express it . I want to make your souls so unutterably hungry to realize it , that day or night you can not rest without it . Do you understand the words , " one with Christ " ? Do you catch the slightest glimpse of their marvellous meaning ? Does not your whole soul begin to exult over such a wondrous destiny ? For it is a reality . It means to have no life but His life , to have no will but His will , to have no interests but His interests , to share His riches , to enter into His joys , to partake of His sorrows , to manifest His life , to have the same mind as He had , to think , and feel , and act , and walk as He did . Oh , who could have dreamed that such a destiny could have been ours ! <p> Wilt thou have it , dear soul ? Thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants thee as His companion and His friend , and a forced union would be incompatible with this . It must be voluntary on thy part . <p> The bride must say a willing " Yes , " to her bridegroom , or the joy of their union is utterly wanting . Canst thou say a willing " Yes , " to thy Lord ? <p> It is such a simple transaction , and yet so real ! The steps are but three . First , be convinced that the Scriptures teach this glorious indwelling of thy God ; then surrender thy whole being to Him to be possessed by Him ; and finally believe that He has taken possession , and is dwelling in thee . Begin to reckon thyself dead , and to reckon Christ as thy only life . Maintain this attitude but Christ liveth in me , " * ( Galations 2:20 ) over and over , day and night , until it becomes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by faith and in fact continually , and put on practically the life of Christ . Let this act become , by its constant repetition , the attitude of thy whole being . And as surely as thou dost this day by day , thou shalt find thyself continually bearing about in thy body the dying of the Lord Jesus , that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in thy mortal flesh ( 2 Corinthians 4:10 ) . Thou shalt learn to know what salvation means ; and shalt have opened out to thy astonished gaze secrets of the Lord , of which thou hast hitherto hardly dreamed . <p> How have I erred ! God is my homeAnd God Himself is here.Why have I looked so far for Him , Who is nowhere but near ? <p> Yet God is never so far offAs even to be near ; He is within , our spirit isThe home He holds most dear . <p> So all the while I thought myselfHomeless , forlorn , and weary ; Missing my joy , I walked the earth , Myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <h> A Lesson in the Interior Life <p> In many of our store windows at Christmastime there stands a most significant picture . It is a dreary , desolate winter scene . There is a dark , stormy , wintry sky , bare trees , and brown grass and dead weeds , with patches of snow over them . On a leafless tree at one side of the picture is an empty and snow-covered nest , and on a branch near sits a little bird . All is cold , and dark , and desolate enough to daunt any bird , and drive it to some fairer clime , but this bird is sitting there in an attitude of perfect contentment , and has its little head bravely lifted up towards the sky , while a winter song is evidently about to burst forth from its tiny throat . <p> This picture , which always stands on my shelf , has preached me many a sermon . And the text is always the same , and finds its expression in the two words that stand at the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Although the fig tree shall not blossom , neither shall fruit be in herd in the stalls : Yet I will rejoice in the LORD , I will joy in the God of my salvation . " * ( Habakkuk 3:17-18 ) <p> There come times in many lives , when , like this bird in the winter , the soul finds itself bereft of every comfort both outward and inward ; when all seems dark , and all seems wrong , even ; when everything in which we have trusted seems to fail us ; when the promises are apparently unfulfilled , and our prayers gain no response ; when there seems nothing left to rest on in earth or Heaven . And it is at such times as these that the brave little bird with its message is needed . " Although " all is wrong everywhere , " yet " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that is God ; the " God of our salvation , " who changes not , but is the same good , loving , tender God yesterday , today , and forever . We can joy in Him always , whether we have anything else to rejoice in or not . <p> By rejoicing in Him , however , I do not mean rejoicing in ourselves , although I fear most people think this is really what is meant . It is their feelings or their revelations or their experiences that constitute the groundwork of their joy , and if none of these are satisfactory , they see no possibility of joy at all . <p> But the lesson the Lord is trying to teach us all the time is the lesson of self-effacement . He commands us to look away from self and all selfs experiences , to crucify self and count it dead , to cease to be interested in self , and to know nothing and be interested in nothing but God . <p> The reason for this is that God has destined us for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has destined the caterpillar to become the butterfly , and therefore has appointed the caterpillar life to die , in order that the butterfly life may take its place , so He has appointed our self-life to die in order that the divine life may become ours instead . The caterpillar effaces itself in its grub form , that it may evolve or develop into its butterfly form . It dies that it may live . And just so must we . <p> Therefore , the one most essential thing in this stage of our existence must be the death to self and the resurrection to a life only in God . And it is for this reason that the lesson of joy in the Lord , and not in self , must be learned . Every advancing soul must come sooner or later to the place where it can trust God , the bare God , if I may be allowed the expression , simply and only because of what He is in Himself , and not because of His promises or His gifts . It must learn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Him when all else in Heaven and earth shall seem to fail . <p> The only way in which this place can be reached I believe , is by the soul being compelled to face in its own experience the loss of all things both inward and outward . I do not mean necessarily that all ones friends must die , or all ones money be lost : but I do mean that the soul shall find itself , from either inward or outward causes , desolate , and bereft , and empty of all consolation . It must come to the end of everything that is not God ; and must have nothing else left to rest on within or without . It must experience just what the prophet meant when he wrote that " Although . " <p> It must wade through the slough , and fall off of the precipice , and be swamped by the ocean , and at last find in the midst of them , and at the bottom of them , and behind them , the present , living , loving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will it understand the prophets exulting shout of triumph , and be able to join it : " Yet I will rejoice in the LORD , I will joy in the God of my salvation . " * ( Habakkuk 3:18 ) <p> And then , also , and not until then , will it know the full meaning of the verse that follows : " The LORD God is my strength , and he will make my feet like hinds feet , and he will make me to walk upon mine high places . " * ( Habakkuk 3:19 ) <p> The soul often walks on what seem high places , which are , however , largely self-evolved and emotional , and have but little of God in them ; and in moments of loss and failure and darkness , these high places become precipices of failure . But the high places to which the Lord brings the soul that rejoices only in Him , can be touched by no darkness or loss , for their very foundations are laid in the midst of an utter loss and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want an unwavering experience , therefore , we can find it only in the Lord , apart from all else ; apart from His gifts , apart from His blessings , apart from all that can change or be affected by the changing conditions of our earthly life . <p> The prayer which is answered today , may seem to be unanswered tomorrow ; the promises once so gloriously fulfilled , may cease to be a reality to us ; the spiritual blessing which was at one time such a joy , may be utterly lost ; and nothing of all we once trusted to and rested on may be left us , but the hungry and longing memory of it all . But when all else is gone , God is still left . Nothing changes Him . He is the same yesterday , today , and forever , and in Him is no variableness , neither shadow of turning . And the soul that finds its joy in Him alone , can suffer no wavering . <p> It is grand to trust in the promises , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The promises may be misunderstood or misapplied , and at the moment when we are leaning all our weight upon them , they may seem utterly to fail us . But no one ever trusted in the Promiser and was confounded . <p> The God who is behind His promises and is infinitely greater than His promises , can never fail us in any emergency , and the soul that is stayed on Him can not know anything but perfect peace . <p> The little child does not always understand its mothers promises , but it knows its mother , and its childlike trust is founded not on her word , but upon herself . And just so it is with those of us who have learned the lesson of this " Although " and " Yet . " There may not be a prayer answered or a promise fulfilled to our own consciousness , but what of that ? Behind the prayers and behind the promises , there is God , and He is enough . And to such a soul the simple words , " God is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the little , trusting child the simple fact of the mothers existence is the answer to all its need . The mother may not make one single promise , or detail any plan , but she is , and that is enough for the child . The child rejoices in the mother ; not in her promises , but in herself . And to the child , as to us , there is behind all that changes and can change , the one unchangeable joy of the mothers existence . While the mother lives , the child must be cared for , and the child knows this , instinctively if not intelligently , and rejoices in knowing it . And while God lives , His children must be cared for as well , and His children ought to know this , and rejoice in it as instinctively and far more intelligently than the child of human parents . For what else can God do , being what He is ? Neglect , indifference , forgetfulness , ignorance , are all impossible to Him . He knows everything , He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He loves us ; and what more could we ask ? Therefore , come what may , we will lift our faces to our God , like our brave little bird teacher , and , in the midst of our darkest " Althoughs , " will sing our glad and triumphant " Yet . " <p> All of Gods saints in all ages have done this . Job said , out of the depths of sorrow and trial which few can equal , " Though he slay me , yet will I trust in him . " * ( Job 13:15 ) <p> David could say in the moment of his keenest anguish , " Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , yet I will fear no evil : for thou art with me. " * ( Psalm 23:4 ) And again he could say , " God is our refuge and strength , a very midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled , though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof . God is in the midst of her ; she shall not be moved : God shall help her , and that right early . " * ( Psalm 46:1-5 ) <p> Paul could say in the midst seen are eternal . " * ( 2 Corinthians 4:8-18 ) <p> All this and more can the soul say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Spiritual joy is not a thing , not a lump of joy , so to speak , stored away in ones heart to be looked at and rejoiced over . Joy is only the gladness that comes from the possession of something good , or the knowledge of something pleasant . And the Christians joy is simply his gladness in knowing Christ , and in his possession of such a God and Savior . We do not on an earthly plane rejoice in our joy , but in the thing that causes our joy . And on the heavenly plane it is the same . We are to " rejoice in the LORD , and joy in the God of my salvation " * ( Habakkuk 3:18 ) ; and this joy no man nor devil can take from us , and no earthly sorrows can touch . <p> A writer on the interior life says , in effect , that our spiritual pathway is divided into three regions , very different from one another , and yet each one a necessary stage in the onward progress . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time full of sensible joys and delights , of fervent aspirations , of emotional experiences , and of many secret manifestations of God . Then comes a vast extent of wilderness , full of temptation , and trial , and conflict , of the loss of sensible manifestations , of dryness , and of inward and outward darkness and distress . And then , finally , if this desert period is faithfully traversed , there comes on the further side of it a region of mountain heights of uninterrupted union and communion with God , of superhuman detachment from everything earthly , of infinite contentment with the Divine will , and of marvellous transformation into the image of Christ . <p> Whether this order is true or not , I can not here discuss , but of one thing I am very sure , that to many souls who have tasted the joy of the " region of beginnings " here set forth , there has come afterwards a period of desert experience at which they have been sorely amazed and perplexed . And I can not but think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer to their trouble . They are being taught the lesson of detachment from all that is not God , in order that their souls may at last be brought into that interior union and oneness with Him which is set forth in the picture given of the third and last region of mountain heights of blessedness . <p> The souls pathway is always through death to life . The caterpillar can not in the nature of things become the butterfly in any other way than by dying to the one life in order to live in the other . And neither can we . Therefore , it may well be that this region of death and desolation must needs be passed through , if we would reach the calm mountain heights beyond . And if we know this , we can walk triumphantly through the darkest experience , sure that all is well , since God is God . <p> In the lives of many who read this paper there is , I feel sure , at least one of these desert " Althoughs , " and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the " Yet " there also ? Have you learned the prophets lesson ? Is God enough for you ? Can you sing and mean it , <p> And the song that he sings , as he sits on that bare and leafless tree , with the winter storm howling around him , must become your song also . <p> " Though the rain may fall and the wind be blowing , And cold and chill is the wintry blast ; Though the cloudy sky is still cloudier growing , And dead leaves tell that the summer has passed , Yet my face I hold to the stormy heaven , My heart as calm as a summer sea ; I am glad to receive what my God hath given , Whateer it be . <p> " When I feel the cold , I can say , He sends it , His wind blows blessing I surely know ; For I 've neer a want but that He attends it ; My heart beats warm , though the winds may blow ; The soft , sweet summer was warm and glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I trusted Him when the roses were blowingI trust Him now . <p> " Oh , small were my faith should it weakly falter , When now the roses have ceased to blow ; And frail were the trust that now should alter , To doubt His love when the storm clouds grow ; If I trust Him once I must trust Him everHis way is best , though I stand or fall ; Through wind or storm He will leave me never , For He sends all . " * <h> Kings and Their Kingdoms <h> How to Reign in the Interior Life <p> " And when he was demanded of the Pharisees , when the kingdom of God should come , he answered them and said , The kingdom of God cometh God is within you . " * ( Luke 17:20-21 ) <p> The expressions " kingdom of God " and " kingdom of Heaven " are used in Scripture concerning the divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or condition where God rules , and where His will is done . It is an interior kingdom , not an exterior one . Its thrones are not outward thrones of human pomp and glory , but inward thrones of dominion and supremacy over the things of time and sense . Its kings are not clothed in royal robes of purple and fine linen , but with the interior garments of purity and truth . And its reign is not in outward show , but in inward power . Neither is it in one place rather than another , nor in one form of things above another . It is not , lo here , nor lo there , not in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem ( John 4:21 ) , that we are to find Christ , and enter into His kingdom . It is not a matter of place at all , but one of condition . And in every place and under every name , and through every form , all who seek God and work righteousness shall find His kingdom within them . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of literalism we have too much imbibed the idea that a kingdom must necessarily be in a particular place and with outward observation ; and have therefore expected that the kingdom of heaven would mean for us an outward victory of heaven over earth in some particular place , or under some especial form ; and that to sit on a throne with Christ , would be to have an outward uplifting in power and glory before the face of all around us . <p> But as the inner sense of Scripture unfolds to us , we see that this would be but a poor and superficial fulfilling of the real meaning of these wonderful symbols . And the vision of their true significance grows and strengthens before the " eyes that see , " until at last we know that our Lords words were truer than ever we had dreamed before , that the " kingdom of God cometh hosts will perform this . " <p> This kingdom is to break in pieces and consume all other kingdoms by right of the law by which the inward always rules the outward . If there is peace within , no outward turmoil can affect the soul ; but outward peace can never quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphant indifference through a sea of external trouble ; while internal anguish can not find happiness in the most favorable surroundings . What a man is within himself , makes or unmakes his joy , and not what he possesses outside of himself . <p> Someone said to Diogenes , " The king has degraded you . " <p> " Yes " replied Diogenes , triumphantly , " but I am not degraded ! " <p> No act of kings or emperors can degrade a soul that retains its own dignity ; no tyrant can enslave a man who is inwardly free . <p> Therefore to have this divine kingdom set up within , means that all other powers to conquer or enslave are broken , and the soul reigns triumphant over them all . Men and devils may try to hold such a one in bondage , but they are powerless before the might of this interior kingdom . No longer will fashion , or conventionality , or the fear of man , or the love of ease , or any other of the many tyrants to which Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised to a throne in this inward kingdom . No sin or temptation can overcome , no sorrow can crush , no discouragement can hinder . Let a man or woman have been bound in ever so tyrannical chains of sinful habits , this kingdom will set them free . Circumstances make men kings in the outward life , but in this hidden life men become kings over circumstances . And the soul that has aforetime been the slave of a thousand outward things , finds itself here utterly independent of them , everyone . <p> For the King in this kingdom is One whom no circumstances can affect or baffle . He it is indeed who makes circumstances . And since the government is upon His shoulders , we can not doubt that He will order the kingdom with a judgment and justice that will leave nothing for any subject in His kingdom to desire . <p> In the expression " the government shall be upon his shoulder , " we have the whole secret of this wonderful kingdom . Upon His shoulder , not upon ours . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility belongs to Him , the protection rests upon Him , the planning , and providing , and controlling , and guiding , all are in His hands . No one can question as to His perfect fulfilment of every requirement of His kingship . Therefore those who are in His kingdom , are utterly delivered from any need to be anxious , or burdened , or perplexed , or troubled . And by this deliverance they become kings . The government is not upon their shoulders , and they have no business to interfere with it . Their King has assumed the whole responsibility , and if He can but see His subjects happy and prosperous , He is content Himself to bear all the weight and care of kingship . How often we speak of the responsibilities of earthly kings , and pity them for the burdens that kingship imposes . We recognize , even on an earthly plane , that to be a king means , or ought to mean , the bearing of the burdens of even the meanest of his subject . And even now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy for the new Czar , who has assumed the grievous burden of the mighty Russian Empire . <p> From this instinctive sense of every human heart as to the rightful duties and responsibilities of kingship , we may learn what it means to be in a kingdom over which God is King , and where He has himself declared all things shall be ordered with judgment and justice from henceforth and even forever . Surely no care or anxiety can ever enter here , if the heart but knows its kingdom and its King ! <p> In John 18:36 , our King tells us the tactics kingdom not from hence . " <p> Earthly kings and earthly kingdoms gain and keep their supremacy by outward conflict ; Gods kingdom conquers by inward power . Earthly kings subdue enemies ; God subdues enmity . His victories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not subjugate , but he conquers . Even we , on our earthly plane , know something of this principle , and do not value any victory over another which only reaches the body and has not subdued the heart . No true mother cares for an outward obedience merely ; nothing will satisfy her but the inward surrender . Unless the citadel of the heart is conquered , the conquest seems worthless . And with God how much more will this be the case , since looketh on the heart . " * ( 1 Samuel 16:7 ) We speak of " subduing hearts , " and we mean , not that they are overpowered or forced into an unwilling and compulsory surrender , but that they are conquered by being won , and are willingly yielded up to anothers control . And it is after this fashion and no other that God subdues . So that to read that " His kingdom ruleth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to His service in a glad and willing surrender . <p> For again I repeat , His reign must be inward before it can be outward . And in truth it is no reign at all , unless it is within . If we think of it a moment we shall see that this must be so in the very nature of things , and that it is impossible to conceive of God reigning in a kingdom where the subduing reaches no further than the outside actions of His subjects . His kingdom is not of this world , but is in a spiritual sphere , where its power is over the souls and not the bodies of men ; and therefore only when the soul is conquered , can it be set up . <p> Understood in this light , how full of love and blessing do all those declarations and prophecies become , which tell us that God is to subdue His enemies under His feet , and is to rule them in righteousness and power ! And how glorious with hope does the voice of that great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alleluia : for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth " * ( Revelation 19:6 ) ! <p> In confirmation of all this we have two passages descriptive the Holy Ghost . " * ( Romans 14:17 ) " For the kingdom of God is not in word , but in power . " * ( 1 Corinthians 4:20 ) <p> Not outward things , but inward . Not what a man eats and drinks , not where he lives , nor what is his nationality , nor the customs of his race , not even what he thinks nor what he says ; but what are the inward characteristics of his nature , and the inward power of his spiritual life . For these alone constitute this kingdom of God . Not what I do , but what I am , is to decide whether I belong to it or not . And only as inward righteousness , and inward peace , and inward joy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom be set up . Therefore no outward subjugation can accomplish results like these , but only the interior work of the all-subduing spirit of God . <p> I have been greatly instructed by the story of Ulysses , when he was sailing past the islands of the sirens . These sirens had the power of charming by their songs all who listened to them , and of inducing them to leap into the sea . To avert this danger , Ulysses filled the ears of his crew with wax , that they might not hear the fatal music , and bound himself to the mast with knotted cords ; and thus they passed the isle in safety . But when Orpheus was obliged to sail by the same island , he gained a better victory , for he himself made sweeter music than that of the sirens , and enchanted his crew with more alluring songs ; so that they passed the dangerous charmers not only with safety , but with disdain . Wax and knotted cords kept Ulysses and his crew from making the fatal leap ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the very source of temptation itself . And just so is it with the kingdom of which we speak . It needs no outward law to bind it , but reigns by right of its inward life . So that it is said of those who have entered it , " Against such there is no law . " * ( Galatians 5:23 ) <p> For it is a kingdom of kings . The song we shall one day sing , nay , that we ought to be singing even now and here in this life , declare this : " Unto him that loved us , and washed us from our sins and ever . Amen . " * ( Revelation 1:5-6 ) <p> We who have entered this kingdom , or , rather , in whom this kingdom is set up , sit upon the throne with our King and share His dominion . The world was His footstool , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and sense He reigned triumphant by the power of a life lived in a plane above them and superior to them , and so may we . We are all of us familiar with the expression that such or such a person " rises superior to his surroundings , " and we mean that there is in that soul a hidden power that controls its surroundings , instead of being controlled by them . Our King essentially rose superior to His surroundings ; and it is given to us who are reigning with Him to do the same . <p> But , just as He was not a king in outward appearance , but only in inward power , so shall we be . He reigned , not in this , that He had all the treasures and riches of the world at His command , but that He had none of them , and could do without them . And so shall our reigning be . We shall not have all men bowing down to us , and all things bending to our will ; but with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a royal triumph of soul through the midst of them . We shall suffer the loss of all things , and by that loss be set forever free from their power to bind . We shall hide ourselves in the impregnable fortress of the will of our King , and shall reign there in a perpetual kingdom . <p> All this is contrary to mans thought of kingship . The only idea the human heart can compass , is , that outward circumstances must bend and bow to the soul that is seated on a throne with Christ . Friends must approve , enemies must be silenced , obstacles must be overcome , affairs must prosper , or there can be no reigning . If man had had the ordering of Daniels business , or of that matter of the three Hebrew children in the burning fiery furnace , he would have said the only way of victory would be for the minds of the kings to have been so changed that Daniel should not have been cast into the den of lions , and the Hebrew children should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way was infinitely grander . He suffered Daniel to be cast among the lions , in order that he might reign triumphant over them when in their very midst , and He allowed Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego to be cast into the burning , fiery furnace , in order that they might walk through it without so much as the smell of fire upon them . He tells us , not that we shall walk in paths where there are no dragons and adders , but that we shall walk through the midst of dragons and adders , and them " shalt thou trample under feet . " * ( Psalm 91:13 ) <p> And how much more glorious a kingdom is this than any outward rule or control could be ! To be inwardly a king , while outwardly a slave , is one of the grandest heights of triumph of which our hearts can conceive . To be destitute , afflicted , tormented , to be stoned and torn asunder , and slain with the sword ; to wander in sheepskins and goatskins , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth ( Hebrews 11:37-38 ) , and yet to be through it all , kings in interior kingdoms of righteousness , peace and joy in the Holy Ghost , is surely a kingdom that none but God could give , and none but God-like souls receive . <p> A few such kings we have at some time or other seen or heard of in this world of ours , and all hearts have acknowledged their unconscious sway . One I read of among the brethren of the monastery of St. Cyr . Because of their piety , these brethren incurred the hatred of the monasteries around them , and the anger of their superiors , and were cast out as evil from their community . One of them was sent as prisoner to a monastery where his chief enemies dwelt , and was there subjected to the most cruel and degrading treatment . Although he was of gentle birth , and had been an abbot in the community he had left , he was compelled to do the most menial work , was forced to carry a noisome burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a placard on his bosom declaring him to be the vilest of the vile . But through it all the spirit of the saint reigned triumphant , and nothing disturbed his calm , or soured for a moment his Christ-like sweetness . For his persecutors he never had anything but words of kindness and smiles of love . And at last by the mighty power of the divine kingdom in which he lived , he subdued all hearts around him to himself , and became the trusted friend and adviser , and the beloved ruler over the very enemies who had once so delighted to persecute and revile him . " Blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth . " * ( Matthew 5:5 ) By his meekness he conquered and became king . <p> At one time a dangerous criminal was sent to the monastery for imprisonment . He was so violent that no bonds sufficed to bind him , and no strength could control him . At last he was taken to the cell of this brother from St. Cyr , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizing in that divine meekness a power to conquer that surpassed all the powers with which they were acquainted . The saint received the violent man as a beloved brother , and smiled upon him with heavenly kindness . But the criminal returned it with abuse and violence . He broke the monks furniture and destroyed his bed , he kicked him , and beat him , and tore his hair , and spat upon him . He exhausted himself in his violence against him . Through it all the monk made no resistance , and said no word but words of love ; and when at length the criminal , worn out with his fury , paused to take breath , the beaten and outraged man looked upon his persecutor with a smile of ineffable love and tender compassion , as though he would gather him to his bosom and comfort him for his misery . It was more than the criminal could bear . Hatred , and revenge , and anger he could repay in kind , but against love and meekness like this he had no weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feet of the saint and washed them with his tears , as he entreated forgiveness for his cruelty , and vowed a lifelong loyalty to his service . And from that moment all trouble with that criminal was over . He followed the saint about like a loving and faithful dog , eager to do or to be anything the other might desire . And when the time of his imprisonment was over , and the gates of his prison were opened for his release , he could not be induced to go , because he could not bear to leave the man who had saved him by love . <p> Of such a nature is kingship in this kingdom of heaven . <p> Each soul can make the application for itself , without need of comment from me . <p> In Matthew 5 through 7 , we have the King of this kingdom describing the characteristics of His kingdom and giving the laws for His subjects . " Blessed are the poor in spirit , " He says , " for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or great , or wise , or learned , but the poor in spirit , the meek , the merciful , the pure in heart , those who mourn , and those who hunger and thirst , those who are persecuted , and reviled , and spoken evil against , all such belong to this kingdom . Gentleness , yieldingness , meekness , charity , are the characteristics of these kings , and they reign in the power of them . <p> One Christian asked another , " How can I make people respect me ? " <p> " I would command their respect , " was the reply . <p> And this meant , not that he should stand up and say in tones of authority , " Now I command you all to respect me , " but that he should so act , and live , and be , that no one could help respecting him . Men sometimes win an outward show of respect and submission by an over-bearing tyranny , but he who would rule the heart of his subjects must try other methods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share His throne . He called them to Him exercise authority upon them . But so shall it not be among you : but whosoever will be great among you , shall be your minister : And whosoever of you will be the chiefest , shall ransom for many . " * ( Mark 10:42-45 ) <p> From the human standpoint , that man alone reigns who is able to exercise lordship over those around him . From the divine standpoint the soul that serves is the soul that reigns . Not he who demands most , receives this inward crowning , but he who gives up most . <p> What grander kingship can be conceived of than that which Christ sets forth in the sermon him have thy cloak also . And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile , go with him twain. " * ( Matthew 5:39-41 ) <p> Surely only a soul that is in harmony with God can mount such a throne of dominion as this ! <p> But this is our destiny . We are made for this purpose . We are born of a kingly race , and are heirs to this ineffable kingdom ; " heirs of God , and joint-heirs with Christ . " * ( Romans 8:17 ) <p> Would that we could realize this ; and could see in every act of service or surrender to which we might find ourselves called , an upward step in the pathway that leads us to our kingdom and our throne ! <p> I mean this in a very practical sense . I mean that the homely services of our daily lives , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if faithfully fulfilled , actual rounds in the ladder by which we are mounting to our thrones . I mean that if we are faithful over the " few things " of our earthly kingdom , we shall be made ruler over the " many things " of the heavenly kingdom ( Matthew 25:20-23 ) . <p> He that follows Christ in this ministry of service and of suffering , will reign with Him in the glory of supreme self-sacrifice , and will be the " chiefest " in His divine kingdom of love . Knowing this , who would hesitate to " turn the other cheek , " since by the turning a kingdom is to be won and a throne is to be gained ? <p> Joseph was a type of all this . In slavery and in prison he reigned a king , as truly as when seated on Pharaohs throne or riding in Pharaohs chariot ( Genesis 39:6,22-23 ) . He became the greatest by being the least , the chiefest by being servant of all . <p> Dear reader , art thou reigning after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Art thou the greatest in thy little world of home , or church , or social circle by being the least , and chiefest by being the servant of all ? If not , thy kingdom is not Christs kingdom , and thy throne is not one shared by Him . <p> To enter into the secrets of this interior kingdom and to partake of its heavenly power , is no notional victory , no fancied supremacy . It is a real and actual reigning , which will cause thee as a matter of fact to " rise superior " to the world and the things of it , and to walk through it independent of its smiles or frowns , dwelling in a region of heavenly peace and heavenly triumph which earth can neither give nor take away . " For the kingdom of God is not in word , but in power . " * ( 1 Corinthians 4:20 ) It is not a talk but a fact ; and those who are in it recognize their kingship and prove it by reigning . <p> But perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kingdom , if I am not already in ? " <p> Let our Lord the kingdom of heaven . Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven . " * ( Matthew 18:1-4 ) <p> It is a kingdom of childlike hearts , and only such can enter it . <p> To be a " little child " means simply to be one . I can not describe it better than this . We all have known little children in our lives , and have delighted ourselves in their simplicity and their trustfulness , their light-hearted carelessness , and their unquestioning obedience to those in authority over them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to have the most of this guileless , tender , trustful , self-forgetting , obedient is in heaven . " * ( Matthew 7:21 ) <p> It is not saying , but doing , that will avail us here . We must be a child , or we can not sit on the childs throne . And to be a child means to do the Fathers will , since the very essence of true childhood is the spirit of obedience united to the spirit of trust . <p> Become a little child , then , by laying aside all thy greatness , all thy self-assertion , all thy self-dependence , all thy wisdom , and all thy strength , and consenting to die to thy own self-life , be born again into the kingdom of God . The only way out of one life into another is by a death to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old story , therefore , reiterated so often and in so many different ways , of through death to life . Die , then , that you my live . Lose your own life that you may find Christs life . The caterpillar can only enter into the butterflys kingdom by dying to its caterpillar life , and emerging into the resurrection life of the butterfly ; and just so can we also only enter into the kingdom of God by the way of a death out of the kingdom of self , and an emergence into the resurrection life of Christ . Let everything go , then , that belongs to the natural ; all your own notions , and plans , and ways , and thoughts ; and accept in their stead Gods plans , and ways , and thoughts . Do this faithfully and do it persistently , and you shall come at last to sit on His throne , and to reign with Him in an interior kingdom which shall break in pieces and consume all other kingdoms , and shall stand for ever and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom can not be entered by pomp , and show , and greatness , and strength ; but by littleness , and helplessness , and childlikeness , and babyhood , and death . He that humbleth himself , and he only , shall be exalted here ; and to mount the throne with Christ requires that we shall first have followed Him in the suffering , and loss , and crucifixion . If we suffer with him , we shall also reign with Him ( 2 Timothy 2:12 ) . Not as an arbitrary reward for our suffering , but as the result that will follow in the very nature of things . Christs loss must necessarily bring Christs gain , Christs death must bring Christs resurrection , and to follow Him in the regeneration , will surely and inevitably bring the soul that follows to His crown and His throne . <p> In a volume of sermons for children I have found a vivid illustration of this royal kingdom : <p> A little fellow from one of the Refuges in England had risked his life to save one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medal by the hand of one of Englands earls . The little fellow was held forward by his comrades to receive it , for he was shy and nervous and tried to sidle away . <p> Look at the noble chairman ; he had driven down from his proper place in the House of Lords , where were gathered earls and dukes , and the men who had done well as lawyers , and judges , and statesmen , and warriors , and the Princes of the royal blood . Yet , all peer though he was , he was moved to the sincerest depths of his being as he murmured , " I have the honor , " and pinned the life-saving medal on the childs jacket . His heart was full . He paused to swallow down something that would rise in his throat before he could go on . <p> There is the " glory and honor " of successful statesmen , and warriors , and lawyers , but the glory of self-forgetful saving of life is a glory that excelleth , and that was the wondrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stream and shared a drowning boys risk , and that little hand , look at it there , steadying him by holding the table , had come out holding the saved . <p> Why has self-forgetfulness such mighty power ? How was it that a twelve-year-old boy could bow down an audience of grown men before him ? What gave to that brow , that its stubby crown of carroty hair , a glory and honor more than the lustre of gold and jewels ? Why was it that that small body in its little breeches and jacket , wiping its tears on the rough little sleeve , could grip thousands of hearts and hold them all , and make them for the time loyal members of his kingdom ? <p> Why was all this so ? <p> It was so because that little boy in his measure had been like Christ , in the self-forgetful spirit of sacrifice for others . He had a bit of the same beauty we are all made on purpose to worship ; the glory before which angels give a great shout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying with a loud voice , " Worthy is the Lamb that was slain " * ( Revelation 5:12 ) ! <p> The " Lamb that was slain " is the mightiest King the world has ever known , and all who partake of His spirit share in His kingdom . <p> And since this kingdom is not a place , but is character , those who have not the character can not by any possibility be in it . <p> We pray daily , " Thy kingdom come . " * ( Matthew 6:10 ) Do we know what we are praying for ? Do we comprehend the change it will make in us if it comes in us ? Are we willing to be so changed ? <p> What is the kingdom of God but the rule of God ? And what is the rule of God but the will of God ? Therefore when we pray , " Thy will be done in earth , as it is in heaven , " * ( Matthew 6:10 ) we have touched the secret of it all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sheer brute force ; but if they would conquer the civilization of that kingdom , they could only do so by submitting to its control . And just so is it with the kingdom of heaven . It yields its sceptre to none but those who render obedience in his throne . " * ( Revelation 3:21 ) <p> " He always reigns who sides with God , " says an old writer . And again , " He who perfectly accepts the will of God , dwells in a perpetual kingdom . " <p> Art thou a king over thy circumstances , or do thy circumstances reign over thee ? <p> Dost thou triumph over thy temptations , or do they triumph over thee ? <p> Canst thou sit on an inward throne in the midst of outward defeat and loss ? <p> Canst thou conquer by yielding , and become the greatest by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes " to all these questions , then thou art come into thy kingdom ; and whatever thy outward lot may be , or the estimation in which men may hold thee , thou art in very truth among the number of those concerning whom our Lord declares " the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven . " * ( Matthew 18:4 ) <h> The Chariots of God <p> " The chariots of God are twenty thousand , even thousands of angels : the Lord is among them , as in Sinai , in the holy place . " * ( Psalm 68:17 ) <p> Chariots are for conveyance and progress . Earthly chariots carry the bodies of those who ride in them over all intervening distances or obstacles to the place of their destination , and Gods chariots carry their souls . No words can express the glorious places to which that soul shall arrive who travels in the chariots of God . And our verse tells us they are " very many . " All around us on every side they wait for us ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Earths chariots are always visible , but Gods chariots are invisible . <p> " Therefore sent he thither horses , and chariots , and a great host : and they came by night , and compassed the city about . And when the servant of the man of God was risen early , and gone forth , behold , an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots . And his servant said unto him , Alas , my master ! how shall we do ? And he answered , Fear not : for they that be with us are more than they that be chariots of fire round about Elisha. " * ( 2 Kings 6:14-17 ) <p> The king of Syria came up against the man of God with horses and chariots that were visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen by none save the eye of faith . The servant of the prophet could only see the outward and visible , and he cried , as so many have done since , " Alas , my master ! how shall we do ? " But the prophet himself sat calmly within his house without fear , because his eyes were opened to see the invisible . And all that he asked for his servant was , " LORD , I pray thee , open his eyes , that he may see . " <p> This is the prayer we need to pray for ourselves and for one another , " Lord , open our eyes that we may see . " For the world all around us is full of Gods horses and chariots , waiting to carry us to places of glorious victory . <p> But they do not look like chariots . They look instead like enemies , sufferings , trials , defeats , misunderstandings , disappointments , unkindnesses . They look like Juggernaut cars of misery and wretchedness , that are only waiting to roll over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really are chariots of triumph in which we may ride to those very heights of victory for which our souls have been longing and praying . <p> " So the LORD alone did lead him , and there was no strange god with him . He made him ride on the high places of the earth , that he might eat the increase of the fields ; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock , and oil out of the flinty rock . " * ( Deuteronomy 32:12-13 ) <p> If we would " ride on the high places of the earth " we must get into the chariots that can take us there ; and only the " chariots of God " are equal to such lofty riding LORD hath spoken it . " * ( Isaiah 58:14 ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either a Juggernaut car to crush us , or a chariot in which to ride to heights of victory . It all depends upon how we take them ; whether we lie down under our trials and let them roll over and crush us , or whether we climb up into them as into a chariot , and make them carry us triumphantly onward a whirlwind into heaven . And Elisha saw it , and he cried , My father , my father , the chariot of Israel , rent them in two pieces . " * ( 2 Kings 2:11-12 ) <p> Whenever we mount into Gods chariots the same thing happens to us spiritually that happened to Elisha . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above us , as Elisha did , but into the heaven within us , which after all is almost a grander translation than his . We shall be carried up away from the low earthly groveling plane of life , where everything hurts and everything is unhappy , up into the " heavenly places in Christ Jesus , " where we shall ride in triumph over all below . <p> " And hath raised us up together , and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus . " * ( Ephesians 2:6 ) <p> These " heavenly places " are interior , not exterior , and the road that leads to them is interior also . But the chariot that carries the soul over this road is generally some outward loss , or trial or disappointment ; some chastening that does not indeed seem for the present to be joyous , but grievous ; but that nevertheless afterward yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness to them that are which are exercised thereby . " * ( Hebrews 12:5-11 ) <p> Look upon these chastenings , no matter how grievous they may be for the present , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high places " of spiritual achievement and uplifting , and you will find that they are after all " paved with love . " <p> " King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon . He made the pillars thereof of silver , the bottom thereof of gold , the covering of it of purple , the midst thereof being paved with love , for the daughters of Jerusalem . " * ( Song 3:9-10 ) <p> Your own individual chariot may look very unlovely . It maybe a cross-grained relative or friend ; it may be the result of human malice , or cruelty , or neglect ; but every chariot sent by God must necessarily be paved with love , since God is love , and Gods love is the sweetest , softest , tenderest thing to rest ones self upon that was ever found by any soul anywhere . It is His love indeed that sends the chariot . <p> " Was the LORD displeased against the rivers ? was thine anger against the rivers ? was thy wrath against the sea , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation ? Thou didst march through the land in indignation , thou didst thresh the heathen in anger . Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people , even for salvation with thine anointed ; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked , by discovering the foundation unto the neck . Selah. " * ( Habakkuk 3:8,12-13 ) <p> Here the prophet tells us that it was Gods displeasure against the obstacles which beset the path of His people that made Him come to their rescue , riding in His " chariots of salvation . " Everything becomes a " chariot of salvation " when God rides upon it . <p> The " clouds " that darken our skies and seem to shut out the shining of the sun of righteousness are , after all , if we only knew it , His chariots , into which we may mount with Him , and " ride prosperously " over all the darkness . <p> " And he rode upon a cherub , and did fly : yea , he did fly upon the wings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun , who rideth upon the heaven in thy help , and in his excellency on the sky . " * ( Deuteronomy 33:26 ) <p> A late writer has said that we can not , by even the most vigorous and toilsome efforts , sweep away the clouds , but we can climb so high above them as to reach the clear atmosphere overhead ; and he who rides with God rides upon the heavens far above all earth-born clouds . <p> " Sing unto God , ye kingdoms of the earth ; O sing praises unto the Lord ; Selah : To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens , which were of old ; lo , he doth send out his voice , and that a mighty voice . Ascribe ye strength unto God : his excellency is over Israel , and his strength is in the clouds .

She was an excellent girl in every other respect , and very valuable in the household , but her slowness was a constant source of irritation to her mistress , who was naturally quick , and who always chafed at slowness . The lady would consequently get out of temper with the girl twenty times a day , and twenty times a day would repent of her anger , and resolve to conquer it , but in vain . Her life was made miserable by the conflict . One day it occurred to her that she had for a long while been praying for patience , and that perhaps this slow servant was the very chariot the Lord had sent to carry her soul over into patience . She immediately accepted it as such , and from that time used the slowness of her servant as a chariot for her soul . And the result was a victory of patience that no slowness of anybody was ever after able to disturb . <p> Another instance : I knew a sister at one of our conventions who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of the crowd . She wanted to sleep , but they wanted to talk , and the first night she was greatly disturbed , and lay there fretting and fuming long after the others had hushed and she might have slept . But the next day she heard something about Gods chariots , and that night she accepted these talking sisters as her chariots to carry her over into sweetness and patience , and she lay there feeling peaceful and at rest . When , however , it grew very late , and she knew they all ought to be sleeping , she ventured to say slyly , " Sisters , I am lying here riding in a chariot , " and the effect was instantaneous in producing perfect quiet . Her chariot had carried her over to victory , not only inwardly , but at last outwardly as well . <p> If we would ride in Gods chariots , instead of in our own , we should find this to be the case continually . <p> " Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because they are many ; and in horsemen , because they are very strong ; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel , neither seek the LORD !

Now the Egyptians are men , and not God ; and their horses flesh , and not spirit . When the LORD shall stretch out his hand , both he that helpeth shall fall , and he that is holpen shall fall down , and they all shall fail together .

" * ( 2 Kings 19:23 ) <p> We try to reach the high places with the " multitude of our chariots . " We depend first on one thing , and then on another , to advance our spiritual condition and to gain our spiritual victories . We " go down to Egypt for help .

" * ( Haggai 2:22 ) <p> We lean too much upon a dear friend to help us onward in the spiritual life , and the Lord is obliged to separate us from that friend . We feel that all our spiritual prosperity depends on our continuance under the ministry of a favorite preacher , and we are mysteriously removed . We look upon our prayer-meeting or our Bible-class as the chief source of our spiritual strength , and we are shut up from attending it . And the " chariot of God , " which alone can carry us to the places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we have been depending , is to be found in the very deprivations we have so mourned over .

Or , in other words , do what the little child does when trouble comest , who finds its mother and hides in her arms . The real chariot after all that takes us through triumphantly is the carrying of God . <p> " And even to your old age I am he ; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you : I have made , and I will bear ; even I will carry , and will deliver you .

Take each thing that is wrong in your lives as Gods chariot for you . No matter who the builder of the wrong may be , whether men or devils , by the time it reaches your side it is Gods chariot for you , and is meant to carry you to a heavenly place of triumph . Shut out all the second causes , and find the Lord in it . Say , " Lord , open my eyes that I may see , not the visible enemy , but thy unseen chariots of deliverance .

Shut out every other thought but the one thought of submission to His will and of trust in His love . Make your trial thus your chariot , and you will find your soul " riding upon the heavens " with God in a way you never dreamed could be . <p> I have not a shadow of doubt that if all our eyes were opened today we would see our homes , and our places of business , and the streets we traverse , filled with the " chariots of God . " There is no need for any one of us to walk for lack of chariots . That cross inmate of your household , who has hitherto made life a burden to you , and who has been the Juggernaut car to crush your soul into the dust , may henceforth be a glorious chariot to carry you to the heights of heavenly patience and longsuffering .

We had spoken , of course , of the foundation cause in the absence of the power of the Holy Ghost , but we still felt that this could not account for it all , as we both of us knew many preachers really baptized with the Spirit , who yet seemed to have no fruit to their ministry . And then I suggested that one reason might be in the fact that so many ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a different tone and manner from the one they ordinarily use , and by this very manner remove religion so far from the range of ordinary life , as to fail of gaining any real hold on the hearts of the men and women whose whole lives are lived on the plane of ordinary and homely pleasures and duties . " Now , for instance , " I said , " if in thy preaching from the Friends gallery thee could use the same tone and manner as thy present one , how much more effectual and convincing thy preaching would be . " <p> " Oh , but I could not do that , " was the reply , " because the preachers gallery is so much more solemn a place than this . " <p> " But why is it more solemn ? " I asked . " Is it not the presence of God only that makes the gallery or the pulpit solemn , and have we not the presence of God equally here ? Is it not just as solemn to live in our everyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to do the one to His glory just as much as the other ? " And then I added , as the subject seemed to open out before me , " I verily believe a large part of the difficulty lies in the unscriptural and unnatural divorce that has been brought about between our so-called religious life and our so-called temporal life ; as if our religion were something apart from ourselves , a sort of outside garment that was to be put on and off according to our circumstances and purposes . On Sundays , for instance , and in church , our purpose is to seek God , and worship and serve Him , and therefore on Sundays we bring out our religious life and put it on in a suitably solemn manner , and live it with a strained gravity and decorum which deprives it of half its power . But on Mondays our purpose is to seek our own interests and serve them , and so we bring out our temporal life and put it on with a sense of relief , as from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and consequently with far more power . " <p> The thoughts thus started remained with me and gathered strength . Not long afterward I was present at a meeting where the leader opened with reading John 15 , and the words , " Without me ye can do nothing , " * ( John 15:5 ) struck me with amazement . Hundreds of times before I had read those words , and had thought that I understood them thoroughly . But now it seemed almost as though they must have been newly inserted in the Bible , so ablaze were they with wondrous meaning . <p> " There it is , " I said to myself , " Jesus himself said so , that apart from Him we have no real life of any kind , whether we call it temporal or spiritual , and that , therefore , all living or doing that is without Him is of such a nature that God , who sees into the realities of things , calls it nothing. " And then the question forced itself upon me as to whether any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if believing it theoretically , whether any one made it practical in their daily walk and life . And I saw , as in a flash almost , that the real secret of divine union lay quite as much in this practical aspect of it as in any interior revealings or experiences . For if I do nothing , literally nothing , apart from Christ , I am of course united to Him in a continual oneness that can not be questioned or gainsaid ; while if I live a large part of my daily life and perform a large part of my daily work apart from Him , I have no real union , no matter how exalted and delightful my emotions concerning it may be . <p> It is to consider this aspect of the subject , therefore , that the present paper is written . For I am very sure that the wide divorce made between things spiritual and things temporal , of which I have spoken , has done more than almost anything else to hinder a realized interior union with God , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life as to make it an almost unattainable thing to the ordinary mass of mankind . Moreover it has introduced an unnatural constraint and stiltedness into the experience of Christians that seems to shut them out from much of the free , happy , childlike ease that belongs of right to the children of God . <p> I feel , therefore , that it is of vital importance for us to understand the truth of this matter . <p> And the thought that makes it clearest to me is this , that the fact of our oneness with Christ contains the whole thing in a nutshell . If we are one with Him , then of course in the very nature of things we can do nothing without Him . For that which is one can not act as being two . And if I therefore do anything without Christ , then I am not one with Him in that thing , and , like a branch severed from the vine , I am withered and worthless . It is as if the branch should recognize its connection with and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fruit-bearing , and climbing , but should feel a capacity in itself to grow and climb over a certain fence or around the trunk of a certain tree , and should therefore sever its connection with the vine for this part of its living . Of course that which thus sought an independent life would wither and die in the very nature of things . And just so is it with us who are branches of Christ the true vine . No independent action , whether small or great , is possible to us without withering and death , any more than to the branch of the natural vine . <p> This will show us at once how fatal to the realized oneness with Christ , for which our souls hunger , is the divorce I have spoken of . We have all realized , more or less , that without Him we can not live our religious life , but when it comes to living our so-called temporal life , to keeping house or transacting business , or making calls , or darning stockings , or sweeping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is there that even theoretically thinks such things as these are to be done for Christ , and can only be rightly done as we abide in Him and do them in His strength ? <p> But if it is Christ working in the Christian who is to lead the prayer-meeting , then , since Christ and the Christian are one , it must be also Christ working in and through the Christian who is to keep the house and make the bargain ; and one duty is therefore in the very essence of things as religious as the other . It is the man that makes the action , not the action the man . And as much solemnity and sweetness will thus be brought into our everyday domestic and social affairs as into the so-called religious occasions of life , if we will only acknowledge God in all our ways ( Proverbs 3:6 ) , and do whatever we doeven if it be only eating and drinkingto His glory ( 1 Corinthians 10:31 ) . <p> If our religion is really our life , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must necessarily go into everything in which we live ; and no act , however human or natural it may be , can be taken out of its control and guidance . <p> If God is with us always , then He is just as much with us in our business times and our social times as in our religious times , and one moment is as solemn with His presence as another . <p> If it is a fact that in Him we " live , and move , and have our being , " * ( Acts 17:28 ) then it is also a fact , whether we know it or not , that without Him we can not do anything . And facts are stubborn things , thank God , and do not alter for all our feelings . <p> In Psalm 127:1-2 , we have a very striking illustration of this truth . eat the bread of sorrows : for so he giveth his beloved sleep . " The two things here spoken of as being done in vain , unless the Lord is in the doing of them , are purely secular things , so called ; simple business matters on the human plane of life . And whatever spiritual lesson they were intended to teach gains its impressiveness only from this , that these statements concerning Gods presence in temporal things were statements of patent and incontrovertible facts . <p> In truth the Bible is full of this fact , and the only wonder is how any believer in the Bible could have overlooked it . From the building of cities down to the numbering of the hairs of our head and the noting of a sparrows fall , throughout the whole range of homely daily living , God is declared to be present and to be the mainspring of it all . Whatever we do , even if it be such a purely physical thing as eating and drinking , we are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are exhorted to so live and so walk in the light in everything , as to have it made manifest of our works , temporal as well as spiritual , that " they are wrought in God . " * ( John 3:21 ) <p> There is unspeakable comfort in this for every loving Christian heart , in that it turns all of life into a sacrament , and makes the kitchen , or the workshop , or the nursery , or the parlor , as sweet and solemn a place of service to the Lord , and as real a means of union with Him , as the prayer-meeting , or the mission board , or the charitable visitation . <p> A dear young Christian mother and housekeeper came to me once with a sorely grieved heart , because of her engrossing temporal life . " There seems , " she said , " to be nothing spiritual about my life from one weeks end to the other . My large family of little children are so engrossing that day after day passes without my having a single moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary household duties , and I go to bed night after night sick at heart because I have felt separated from my Lord all day long , and have not been able to do anything for Him . " I told her of what I have written above , and assured her that all would be changed if she would only see and acknowledge God in all these homely duties , and would recognize her utter dependence upon Him for the doing of them . Her heart received the good news with gladness , and months afterward she told me that from that moment life had become a transformed and glorified thing , with the abiding presence of the Lord , and with the sweetness of continual service to Him . <p> Another Christian , a young lady in a fashionable family , came to me also in similar grief that in so much of her life she was separated from God and had no sense of His presence . I told her she ought never to do anything that could cause such a separation ; but she assured me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things she meant were none of them wrong things . " For instance , " she said , " it is plainly my duty to pay calls with my mother , and yet nothing seems to separate me so much from God as paying calls . " <p> " But how would it be , " I asked , " if you paid the calls as service to the Lord and for His glory ? " <p> " What ! " she exclaimed , " pay calls for God ! I never heard of such a thing . " <p> " But why not ? " I asked ; " if it is right to pay calls at all it ought to be done for God , for we are commanded whatsoever we do to do it for His glory , and if it is not right you ought not to do it . As a Christian , " I continued , " you must not do anything that you can not do for Him . " <p> " I see ! I see ! " she exclaimed , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look so different ! Nothing can separate me from Him that is not sin , but each act done to His glory , whatever it may be , will only draw me closer and make His presence more real . " <p> These two instances will illustrate my meaning . And I feel sure there are thousands of other burdened and weary lives that would be similarly transformed if these truths were but realized and acted on . <p> An old spiritual writer says something to this effect , that in order to become a saint it is not always necessary to change our works , but only to put an interior purpose towards God in them all ; that we must begin to do for His glory and in His strength that which before we did for self and in selfs capacity ; which means , after all , just what our Lord meant when He said , " Without me ye can do nothing . " * ( John 15:5 ) <p> There is another side of this truth also which is full of comfort , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is vain , " he says , " to rise up early , to sit up late , to eat the bread of sorrows . " * ( Psalm 127:2 ) Or , in other words , " What is the use of all this worry and strain ? For the work will after all amount to nothing unless God is in it , and if He is in it , what folly to fret or be burdened , since He of course , by the very fact of His presence , assumes the care and responsibility of it all . " <p> Ah , it is vain indeed , and I would that all Gods children knew it ! <p> We mothers at least ought to know it , for our own ways with our children would teach us something of it every day we live , if we had but the " eyes to see . " <p> How many mothers have risen early , and sat up , late , and eaten the bread of sorrows , just that they might give sleep to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been if , after all their pains , the children had refused to rest . I can appeal to some mother hearts , I am sure , as thoroughly understanding my meaning . Memories will arise of the flushed and rosy boy coming in at night , tired with his play or his work , with knees out and coat torn , and of the patient , loving toil to patch and mend it all , sitting up late and rising early , that the dearly loved cause of all the mischief might rest undisturbed in childhoods happy sleep . How " vain , " and worse than vain , would it have been for that loved and cared-for darling to have himself also sat up late , and risen early , and eaten the bread of sorrows , when all the while his mother was doing it for him just that he might not have it to do . <p> And if this is true of mothers , how much more true must it be of Him who made the mothers , and who came among us in bodily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and do our work , just that we might enter into his rest ( Hebrews 4:5 ) . <p> Beloved , have we entered into God did from his . " * ( Hebrews 4:10 ) That is , he has learned at last the lesson that without Christ or apart from Him he can do nothing , but that he can do all things through Christ strengthening him ( Philippians 4:13 ) ; and therefore he has laid aside all self-effort , and has abandoned himself to God that He may work in him both to will and to do of His good pleasure . This and this only is the rest that remaineth for the people of God . <p> Scientific men are seeking to resolve all forces in nature into one primal force . Unity of origin is the present cry of science . Light , heat , sound are all said to be the products of one force differently applied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scientists , can be resolved back to this . Whether they are right or wrong I can not say ; but the Bible reveals to us one grand primal force which is behind motion itself , and that is God-force . God is at the source of everything , God is the origin of everything , God is the explanation of everything . Without Him was not anything made that was made , and without Him is not anything done that is done . <p> Surely , then , it is not the announcement of any mystery , but the simple statement of a simple fact , when our Lord says , " Without me ye can do nothing , " * ( John 15:5 ) <p> Even of Himself He said , " I can of mine own self do nothing , " * ( John 5:30 ) and He meant that He and His Father were so one that any independent action was impossible . Surely it is the revelation of a glorious necessity existing between our souls and Christ that He should say we could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made us so one with Himself that independent action is as impossible with us as towards Him , as it was with Him as towards His Father . <p> Dear Christian , dost thou not catch a glimpse here of a region of wondrous glory ? <p> Let us believe , then , that without Him we can literally do nothing . We must believe it , for it is true . But let us recognize its truth , and act on it from this time forward . Let us make a hearty renunciation of all living apart from Christ , and let us begin from this moment to acknowledge Him in all our ways , and do everything , whatsoever we do , as service to Him and for His glory , depending upon Him alone for wisdom , and strength , and sweetness , and patience , and everything else that is necessary for the right accomplishing of all our living . <p> As I said before , it is not so much a change of acts that will be necessary , as a change of motive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children cared for , or the business transacted , perhaps , just the same as before as to the outward , but inwardly God will be acknowledged , and depended on , and served ; and there will be all the difference between a life lived at ease in the glory of His presence , and a life lived painfully and with effort apart from Him . There will result also from this bringing of God into our affairs a wonderful accession of divine wisdom in the conduct of them , and a far greater quickness and dispatch in their accomplishment , a surprising increase in the fertility of resource , an ease in apprehending the true nature and bearing of things , and an enlargement on every side that will amaze the hitherto cramped and cabined soul . <p> I mean this literally . I mean that the house will be kept more nicely and with greater ease , the children will be trained more swiftly , the stockings will be darned more swiftly , the guest will be entertained more comfortably , the servants will be managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all life will move with far more sweetness and harmony . For God will be in every moment of it , and where He is all must go well . <p> Moreover the soul itself , in this natural and simple way , will acquire such a holy habit of " abiding in Christ " that at last His presence will become the most real thing in life to our consciousness , and an habitual , silent , and secret conversation with Him will be carried on that will yield a continual joy . <p> Sometimes the child of God asks eagerly and hungrily , " What is the shortest and quickest way by which I can reach the highest degree of union and communion with God , possible to human beings in this life ? " No shorter or quicker way can be found than the one I have been declaring . By the homely path of everyday duties done thus in God and for God , the sublimest heights are reached . Not as a reward , however , but as an inevitable and natural result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave Him , where He is there shall we also be , and all that He is will be ours . <p> If , then , thou wouldst know , beloved reader , the interior divine union realized in thy soul , begin from this very day to put it outwardly in practice as I have suggested . Offer each moment of thy living and each act of thy doing to God , and say to Him continually , " Lord , I am doing this in Thee and for Thy glory . Thou art my strength , and my wisdom , and my all-sufficient supply for every need . I depend only upon Thee . " Refuse utterly to live for a single moment or to perform a single act apart from Him . Persist in this until it becomes the established habit of thy soul . And sooner or later thou shalt surely know the longings of thy soul satisfied in the abiding presence of Christ , thy indwelling Life . <h> " God with Us " <h> The One Hundred and Thirty-Ninth Psalm <p> Very few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew 1:23 , " They shall call his name Emmanuel , which being interpreted is , God with us . " In this short sentence is revealed to us the grandest fact the world can ever know ; that God , the Almighty God , the Creator of Heaven and earth , is not a far-off Deity , dwelling in a Heaven of unapproachable glory , but is living with us right here in this world , in the midst of our poor , ignorant , helpless lives , as close to us as we are to ourselves . This seems so incredible to the human heart that we are very slow to believe it ; but that the Bible teaches it as a fact , from cover to cover , can not be denied by any honest mind . In the very beginning of Genesis we read of " the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden " * ( Genesis 3:8 ) And from that time on He is revealed to us always as in the most familiar and daily intercourse with His people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make Him a sanctuary , " that I may dwell among them . " * ( Exodus 25:8 ) He is recorded as having " walked " with them in the wilderness , and as " taking up His abode " with them in the promised land . He taught them to rely on Him as an ever-present Friend and Helper , to consult Him about all their affairs , and to abandon the whole management of their lives to Him . And finally He came in Christ in bodily form and dwelt in the world as a man among men , making Himself bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh , taking upon Him our nature , and revealing to us , in the most tangible and real way possible , the grand , and blessed , and incomprehensible fact that He intended to be with us always , even unto the end of the world . <p> Whoever will believe this fact with all their hearts will find in it the solution of every difficulty of their lives . <p> I remember when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexity , the coming in of my father or mother on the scene would always bring me immediate relief . The moment I heard the voice of one of them saying , " Daughter , I am here , " that moment every burden dropped off and every anxiety was stilled . It was their simple presence that did it . They did not need to promise to relieve me , they did not need to tell me their plans of relief ; the simple fact of their presence was all the assurance I required that everything now would be set straight and all would go well for me , and my only interest after their arrival was simply to see how they would do it all . Perhaps they were exceptional parents , to have created such confidence in their childrens hearts . I think myself they were . But as our God is certainly an exceptional God , the application has absolute force , and His presence is literally all we need . It would be enough for us , even if we had not a single promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Bible He has stilled all questions and all fears by the simple announcement , " I will be with thee " ; and who can doubt that in these words He meant to assure us that all His wisdom , and love , and omnipotent power would therefore , of course , be engaged on our side ? Over and over again in my childhood have the magic words , " Oh , there is mother ! " brought me immediate relief and comfort ; and over and over again in my later years have almost the same words reverently spoken , " Oh , there is God ! " brought me a far more blessed deliverance . With Him present , what could I have to fear ? Since He has said , " I will never leave thee nor forsake thee , " surely I may boldly say , " The Lord is my helper , and I will not fear what man shall do unto me . " I remember to this day the inspiring sense of utter security that used to come to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was by . And surely with my Heavenly Father by , there can be no possible room for fear . <p> It is because of its practical help and comfort , therefore , that I desire to make this wonderful fact of " Emmanuel , God with us , " clear and definite , for I am very sure but few , even of Gods own children , really believe it . They may say they do , they may repeat a thousand times in the conventional , pious tone considered suitable to such a sentiment , " Oh , yes , we know that God is always present with us , but " And in this " but " the whole story is told . There are no " buts " in the vocabulary of the soul that accepts His presence as a literal fact . Such a soul is joyously triumphant over every suggestion of fear or of doubt . It has God , and that is enough for it . His presence is its certain security and supply , always , and for everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn with me for a while to the 139th Psalm , where we shall find a most blessed revelation of this truth . <p> The central thought of the Psalm is to be found in verses 7 to 13 : " Whither shall I go from thy spirit ? or whither shall I parts of the sea ; Even there shall thy hand lead me , and thy right hand shall hold me . If I say , Surely the darkness shall cover me ; even the night shall be light about me . Yea , the darkness hideth not from thee ; but the night shineth as the day : the darkness and the light are both alike to thee . For thou hast possessed my reins : thou hast covered me in my mothers womb . " <p> I can not conceive of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , wherever we may be or whatever we may do , than is contained in this passage . People talk about seeking to get into the presence of the Lord , but here we see that they can not get out of it ; that there is no place in the whole universe where He is not present ; neither heaven , nor hell , nor the uttermost parts of the sea ; and no darkness so great as to hide for one moment from Him . And the reason of this is , that He " has possessed our reins , " which means that He is not only with us , but within us , and consequently must accompany us wherever we ourselves go . <p> We must accept it as true , therefore , that the words of our Lord , " Lo , I am with you always , even unto the end of the world , " * ( Matthew 28:20 ) were the expression , not of a beautiful sentiment merely , but of an incontrovertible fact . He is with us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may be in such thick darkness as to be utterly unable to see Him , and may thinkprobably often have thoughtthat , therefore , He does not see us . But our Psalm assures us that the darkness hideth not from Him , and that , in fact , darkness and light are both alike to Him . We are as present to His view and as plainly seen when our own souls are in the depths of spiritual darkness , as when they are basking in the brightest light . The darkness may hide Him from us , but it does not hide us from Him . Neither does any apparent spiritual distance or wandering take us out of His presence ; not even if we go into the depths of sin in our wandering . In the uttermost parts of the sea , or wherever we may be , He is ever present to hold and to lead us . There is not a moment nor a place where we can be left without His care . <p> There are times in our lives when delirium makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tender nurses . A child in delirium will cry out in anguish for its mother , and will harrow her heart by its piteous lamentations and appeals , when all the while she is holding its fevered hand , and bathing its aching head , and caring for it with all the untold tenderness of a mothers love . The darkness of disease has hidden the mother from the child , but has not hidden the child from the mother . <p> And just so it is with our God and us . The darkness of our doubts or our fears , of our sorrows or our despair , or even of our sins , can not hide us from Him , although it may , and often does , hide Him from us . He has told us that the darkness and the light are both alike to Him ; and if our faith will only lay hold of this as a fact , we will be enabled to pass through the darkest seasons in quiet trust , sure that all the while , though we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and will never leave nor forsake us . <p> Whether , however , this abiding presence of our God will be a joy to us or a sorrow , will depend upon what we know about Him . If we think of Him as a stern tyrant , intent only on His own glory , we shall be afraid of His continual presence . If we think of Him as a tender , loving Father , intent only on our blessing and happiness , we shall be glad and thankful to have Him thus ever with us . For the presence and the care of love can never mean anything but good to the one beloved . <p> The Psalm we are considering shows us that the presence of our God is the presence of love , and that it brings us an infinitude of comfort and rest . He says , " O LORD , thou hast searched me , and known me . Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising , thou understandest my thought afar off . Thou compassest my path and my lying down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is not a word in my tongue , but , lo , O LORD , thou knowest it altogether . Thou hast beset me behind and before , and laid thine hand upon me. " * ( Psalm 139:1-5 ) <p> Our God knows us and understands us , and is acquainted with all our ways . No one else in all the world understands us . Our actions are misinterpreted , it may be , and our motives misjudged . Our natural characteristics are not taken into account , nor our inherited tendencies considered . No one makes allowances for our i 'll health ; no one realizes how much we have to contend with . But our Father knows it all . He understands us , and His judgment of us takes into account every element , conscious or unconscious , that goes to make up our character and to control our actions . Only an all-comprehending love can be just , and our God is just . No wonder Faber can say <p> " There is no place where earths sorrowsAre more felt than up in Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment given . " <p> Some of you have been afraid of His justice , perhaps , because you thought it would be against you . But do you not see now that it is all on your side , just as a mothers justice is , because " he knoweth our frame ; he remembereth that we are dust " * ( Psalm 103:14 ) ? No human judge can ever do this ; and to me this comprehension of God is one of my most blessed comforts . Often I do not understand myself ; all within looks confused and hopelessly tangled . But then I remember that He has searched me , and that He knows me and understands the thoughts which so perplex me , and that , therefore , I may just leave the whole miserable tangle to Him to unravel . And my soul sinks down at once , as on downy pillows , into a place of the most blissful rest . <p> Then further , because of this complete knowledge and understanding of our needs , what comfort it is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that He compasses our path , and takes note of our lying down . Just what a mother does for her foolish , careless , ignorant , but dearly loved little ones , this very thing does our God for us . When a mother is with her children she thinks of their comfort and well-being always before her own . They must have comfortable seats where no draught can reach them , no matter what amount of discomfort she may herself be compelled to endure . Their beds must be soft and their blankets warm , let hers be what they may . Their paths must be smooth and safe , even though she is obliged herself to walk in rough and dangerous ways . Her own comfort , as compared with that of her children , is of no account in a loving mothers eyes . And surely our God has not made the mothers in this world more capable of a self-sacrificing love than He is Himself . He must be better and greater on the line of love and self-sacrifice than any mother He ever made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knows our downsitting and our uprising , that He compasses our path and our lying down , we may be perfectly and blessedly sure that in even these little details of our lives we get the very best that His love , and wisdom , and power can compass . I mean this in a very literal sense . I mean that He cares for our literal seats and our literal beds , and sees that we , each one , have just that sort of a seat or that sort of a bed which is best for us and for our highest development . And just on this last point is where He is so much better than any mother can be . His love is a wise love , that sees the outcome of things , and cares more for our highest good than for that which is lower . So that , while a mothers weak love can not see beyond the childs present comfort , and can not bear to inflict or allow any discomfort , the strong , wise love of our God can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the future glory that is to result therefrom . <p> At home and abroad , therefore , let us commit the choosing of our seats , and of our beds , and of all the other little homely circumstances of our daily lives and surroundings , to the God who has thus assured us that He knows all about everyone of them . <p> For we are told in our Psalm that He " besets " our path . We have some of us known what it was to be " beset " by unwelcome and unpleasant people or things . But we never have thought , perhaps , that we were beset by God , that He loves us so that He can not leave us alone , and that no coldness nor rebuffs on our parts can drive Him away . Yet it is gloriously true ! And , moreover , He besets us " behind " as well as before . Just as a mother does . She goes after her children and picks up all they have dropped , and clears away all the rubbish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nursery with the blocks and playthings , and we go on with it all our lives long ; seeking continually to set straight that which our children have left crooked behind them ; often at the cost of much toil and trouble , but always with a love that makes the toil and trouble nothing in comparison to caring for the children we love . What good mother ever turned away the poor little tearful darling who came with a tangled knot for her unraveling , or refused to help the eager rosy boy to unwind his kite-strings ? Suppose it has been their own fault that the knots and tangles have come , still her love can sympathize with and pity the very faults themselves , and all the more does she seek to atone for them . <p> All this and more does our God do for us from our earliest infancy , long even before we know enough to be conscious of it , until the very end of our earthly lives . We have seen Him before us perhaps , but we have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a blessed fact that He is behind us all the time , longing to make crooked things straight , to untangle our tangled skeins , and to atone continually for the wrong we have done and the mistakes we have made . If any of us , therefore , have that in our past which has caused us anxiety or remorse , let us lift up our heads in a happy confidence from henceforth , that the God who is behind us will set it all straight somehow , if we will but commit it to Him , and can even make our very mistakes and misdoings work together for good . Ah ! it is a grand thing to be " beset " by God . <p> Then again what depths of comfort there are in none of them . " <p> One of the things which often troubles us more than we care to confess , is our dislike of the way we have been put together . Our mental or moral " make-up " does not suit us . We think if we had only been created with less of this or more of that , if we were less impulsive or more enthusiastic , if we had been made more like someone else whom we admire , that then our chances of success would have been far greater ; that we could have served God far more acceptably ; and could have been more satisfactory in every way to ourselves and to Him . And we are tempted sometimes to think that with our miserable make-up , it is hopeless to expect to please Him . <p> If we really realized that God Himself had made us , we should see the folly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if somehow He had not had much hand in the matter , but as if we had been put together in a haphazard sort of way , that had left our characters very much to chance . We believe in creation in the general , but not in the particular , when it comes to ourselves . But in this Psalm we see that God has presided over the creation of each one of us , superintending the smallest details ; even , to speak figuratively , writing down what each " member " was to be , when as yet there was none of them . Therefore we , just as we are naturally , with just the characteristics that inhere in us by birth , are precisely what God would have us to be , and were planned out by His own hand to do the especial work that He has prepared for our doing . I mean , of course , our natural characteristics , not the perversion of them by sin on our parts . <p> There is something very glorifying to the Creator in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and seeks , too , to express itself in as great a variety of forms and ways as possible . No true artist repeats himself , but each picture he paints , or statue he carves , is a new expression of his creative power . When we go to an exhibition of pictures , we should feel it a lowering of art if two were exactly alike ; and just so is it with us who are " Gods workmanship . " His creative power is expressed differently in each one of us . And in the individual " make-up " which sometimes so troubles us , there is a manifestation of this power different from every other , and without which the day of exhibition , when we are , each one , to be to the praise of His glory , would be incomplete . All He asks of us is that , as He has had the making of us , so He may also have the managing , since He alone understands us , and is , therefore , the only one who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine is the best one to manage it and repair it ; any one else who meddles with it is apt to spoil it . And when we think of the intricacy of our inward machinery and the continual failure of our own management of it , we may well be thankful to hand it all over to the One who created it , and to leave it in His hands . We may be sure He will then make the best out of us that can be made , and that we , even we , with our " peculiar temperaments , " and our apparently unfortunate characteristics , will be made vessels unto honor , sanctified and meet for the Masters use , and fitted to every good work ( 2 Timothy 2:21 ) . <p> I met once with a saying in an old Quaker writer which I have never forgotten : " Be content to be just what thy God has made thee . " It has helped me to understand the point upon which I am dwelling ; and I feel sure contentment with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our submission to God as contentment with any other of the circumstances of our daily life . If we did not each one of us exist just as we are by nature , then one expression of Gods creative power would be missing , and one part of His work would be left undone . And besides , to complain of ourselves is to complain of the One who has made us , and can not but grieve Him . Let us be content , then , and only see to it that we let the Divine Potter make out of us the very best He can , and use us according to His own good pleasure . <p> Verses 17 and 18 bring out another view of Gods continual presence with us , and that is , that He is always thinking about us , and that His thoughts are kind and loving thoughts , for the Psalmist calls them precious . " How precious also are thy thoughts unto me , O God ! how great is the sum of them ! If I should count them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I awake , I am still with thee . " <p> So many people are tempted to think that God is not paying any attention to them . They think that their interests and their affairs are altogether beneath His notice , and that they are too unworthy to hope for His attention . But they wrong Him grievously by such thoughts . A mother pays as much attention to her smallest infant as to her oldest children , and is as much interested in its little needs and pleasures as in theirs . I am not sure but she is more . Her thoughts dwell around the one who needs them most ; and He who made the mothers heart will not Himself be less attentive to the needs and pleasures of the meanest and most helpless of His creatures . He even hears the young lions when they cry , and not a sparrow can fall to the ground without Him ; therefore , we , who are of more value than many sparrows , need not be afraid of a moments neglect . <p> In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the part of the Creator ; and it is the glory of omnipotence that it can attend at once to the smallest details and to the grandest operations as well . <p> " For greatness which is infinite makes roomFor all things in its lap to lie ; We should be crushed by a magnificenceShort of infinity . " <p> I do not know why it is that we consider a man or woman weak who attends to large affairs to the neglect of little details , and then turn around and accuse our God of doing this very thing . But if any of my readers have hitherto been guilty of this folly , let it end now and here , and let each one from henceforth believe , without any questioning , that always and everywhere the " Lord thinketh upon me. " * ( Psalm 40:17 ) <p> The remainder of the Psalm develops the perfect accord of thought between the soul and God , where this life of simple faith has been entered upon .

" * ( Psalm 16:11 ) <p> An old woman , living in a rather desolate part of England , made considerable money by selling ale and beer to chance travelers who passed her lonely cottage . But her conscience troubled her about it . She wanted to be a Christian and to go to Heaven when she died , but she had an inward feeling that if she did become a Christian she would have to give up her profitable business , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so that between the two things she was brought into great conflict . <p> But one night , at the meeting she attended , a preacher from a distance told about the sweet and blessed fact of Gods continual presence with us , and of the joy this was sure to bring when it was known . Her soul was enraptured at the thought of such a possibility for her , and forgetting all about the beer , she began at once with a very simple faith to claim it as a blessed reality . Over and over again she exclaimed in her heart , as the preacher went on with his sermon , " Why , Lord Jesus , I did n't  know as Thee wast always with me ! Why , Lord , how good it is to know that I have got Thee all the time to live with me and take care of me ! Why , Lord , I shant never be lonely no more !

Never mind , Lord Jesus , old Betty wont never let Thee go again now , I knows I have got Thee ! " <p> As her faith thus laid hold of the fact of His presence she began to rejoice in it more and more , until finally , when she had reached her cottage door , her soul was full of delight . As she opened the door , the first object her eyes rested upon was a great pot of ale on the table ready for selling . At once it flashed into her mind , " The Lord will not like to have that ale in the house where He lives , " and her whole heart responded eagerly , " That ale shall go . " She knew the pot was heavy , and she kneeled beside it saying , " Lord , Thee hast come home with me , and Thee art going to live with me always in this cottage , and I know Thee do n't  like this ale . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Strength was given , and the ale was soon running down the lane . Then the old woman came back into her cottage , and kneeling down again thanked the Lord for the strength given , and added , " Now , Lord , if there is anything else in this cottage that Thee does not like , show it to me , and it shall be tipped out too . " <p> Is not this a perfect illustration of the close of our Psalm ? " Do not I hate them , O LORD , that hate thee ? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee ? I hate them with perfect hatred : I count the way everlasting .

Facts must always be the foundation of our experiences , or the experiences are worthless . It is not the feeling that causes the fact , but the fact that produces the feeling . And what every soul needs in this case first of all , is to be convinced beyond question , from Gods own words about it , that His continual presence with us is an unalterable fact . <p> Then , this point having been settled , the next thing to do is to make it real to ourselves by " practising His presence , " as an old writer expresses it , always and everywhere , and in everything . This means simply that you are to obey the Scripture command , and " In all thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by saying over each hour and moment , " The Lord is here , " and by doing everything you do , even if only eating and drinking , in His presence and glory of God .

It is not studied reasonings or elaborate meditations that will help you here .

" * ( 2 Thessalonians 2:10 ) <p> We must love the precious truth of God more than each other . Please note that I do not say instead of each other , but more than each other . That is , we must value the truth more than our relationship is not worthy of me. " * ( Matthew 10:37 ) They can not be on an equal footing , for it is necessary at times to choose between them . " Our dearest friend on earth must not be allowed to cause us to deviate one hairs breadth from trueness to God . " 1 <p> What we love most has a profound effect on our lives . We might well say that we are guided by what we value . The more we valuethe more we are willing to sacrifice . How vital it is to love each other through Jesus . <p> The enemy of our souls labors hard to cause the focus of our affections to shift . Instead of that crucial question , " How do I stand with God ? " he would have it , " How do I stand with my brethren ? " What a profound difference between these two attitudes ! One is actuated by the fear of God ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to closeness to the Lord as we walk before Him unto all pleasing ; the other attempts to draw us closer to a group of people . One magnifies God and His salvation , His truth ; the other exaggerates the importance of a certain circle of people and what they believe is right . The one is a spiritual outlook , born of love to God ; the other is carnal and arises from the flesh . <p> If we are caught in this snare , the devil gains quite an advantage over us . Spiritual difficulties are everywhere . Instead of the clear and definite guiding of the Spirit of God into all truth , obscurities and questions about people began to abound . Temptations to develop policy and to learn the arts of people skills ( politics ) beset the soul . <p> Two ministers were talking . The older said to the younger , " I used to be just like you but I have learned that it is necessary to lay aside my God-given convictions to please the people . " He paused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I had made a mistake . " And then he continued again , " But now I think it was just right . " <p> When I heard of this conversation from Brother Herschal Hargraves ( he was the younger minister ) , I was horrified . The attitude of this older minister was such a betrayal of Gods truth . Brother Hargraves felt the same way . All he could think , he told me , was how to get away from there . The spirit and nature of the attitude that finds it necessary to lay aside God-given convictions to please the people is the spirit and nature of apostasy . And it results in the evolution and formation of a sectthe formation of party spirits . <p> The unity of Gods people is brought about by one guide ( The Holy Spirit ) who leads unerringly to one truth . " The unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace . " * ( Ephesians 4:3 )

@@72205137 @905137/ <h> Consciousness of Gods Presence <p> Happy and blessed is the soul that is conscious of Gods sweet indwelling presence . Being conscious of Gods presence is what the Psalmist meant when he said , " O taste and see that the Lord is good . " * ( Psalm 8 ) " Tasting God " is an expression incomprehensible to the unregenerate . Those who have tasted Him comprehend the meaning of this expression better than they can tell it . When a bit of sugar is placed upon the tongue there is experienced a sweetness in the sense of taste . When the soul tastes of God there is experienced a sweetness in the spiritual being . The sweetness of Gods presence in the soul is as much more glorious than the sweetness of sugar to the taste , as spiritual and heavenly things are above literal and earthly things . God and His word are inseparable , or the word is God ; therefore , when the Psalmist says , " How sweet are thy words unto my taste ! yea , sweeter than honey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in reality tasting the sweetness of God . <p> The awakened soul thirsts for this sweetness of the divine presence . Nothing else can satisfy it . The wealth and pleasure of the world do not contain a sweetness sufficient to satisfy the heart of man . It is only God that can fill the hungry soul with goodness . The divine life sheds peace and light and rest in the soul . Man receives the divine presence into his spiritual being when he is quickened by the Spirit . In the Word of God it is termed " passing from death unto life , " * ( John 5:24 ; 1 John 3:14 ) and " being born again . " * ( 1 Peter 1:23 ) In sanctification , when a revolution is effected in the nature of man and he becomes a partaker of the divine nature , it is then he is conscious of the fullness of the divine presence and is at rest .

" * ( Proverbs 4:18 ) Oh , how many Christians would enjoy more of heavens glory in their souls , if by careful cultivation they would increase the sense of the divine presence ! Dear pilgrim , have you reached the land where is an " eternal weight of glory " * ( 2 Corinthians 4:17 ) or the regions of " joy unspeakable " * ( 1 Peter 1:8 ) ? <p> To cultivate or deepen the sense of the divine presence requires an almost constant effort . Right at this point is where perhaps more Christians have failed to do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently experience less joy and power than formerly . There are many things employed by Satan to weaken this consciousness of God . Looseness of thought , moments of idleness , or yieldings to self , serve to weaken the reverential feeling in our hearts toward Him . A little attention to the world , a little thought for the morrow , a little anxiety , a little too much talkingthese things destroy the consciousness of the divine presence in the soul , and rob us of spiritual power and rest . Living before God in prayer , holy and pure thoughts , the entertaining of right feelings toward God and man , acts of benevolence and self-sacrifice for the benefit of others , develop and fashion the soul more and more into the beauty of the divine life . <p> It is the privilege of the saint so to walk in the presence of God and live in holy communion with Him as to draw Gods glory and life into his own , and give him a feature very distinguishing for ordinary natural man .

And she had written back , promising to be there at the very minute . <p> When the great day came , the children were so excited they could hardly eat any breakfast . Mother wisely remembered that when she packed their lunch box . The last minute , they ran across the street to tell their playmates goodbye . When they came back , Daddy had brought the car to the front of the house and was carrying out the little trunk .

Joyce could not keep the tears back , as she threw her arms around her mothers neck ; but she brushed them away and smiled . " Joyce , dear , " Mother was saying , " I am expecting you to be my good , brave little daughter . Take care of Don . Remember to pray every dayand be sure to write to Mother . " <p> Joyce promised ; and then , almost before the children knew what was happening , they were aboard the train , the engine was puffing , the wheels were grinding on the rails , and they were speeding along through the green countryside . <p> Joyce was trying very hard to be brave , for Dons sake .

First there was a big flock of chickens ; then some calves in a meadow , running away from the train in a great fright . A flock of sheep with their little lambs frolicked on a green hillside ; and a frisky colt kicked up its heels and darted across the pasture as the train went by . <p> By and by , in her most grown-up way , Joyce looked at the watch on her wrist .

" Now , " she said briskly , " it is milking time . Run down the lane , children , and let the bars down for the cows to come through the lot ; and we will give them a good drink of water .

Grandpa went to help a neighbor with some work , and so the children were left alone . <p> They began to run races in the wide grassy space in front of the old farm house . But they made so much noise that soon Joyce said , " I 'm afraid we will wake Grandma , Don . Wed better be quiet . " <p> " Let 's go to the orchard , " said Don . " We can be as noisy as we like there , and she wont even hear us . " So away they scampered , to play in the shade of the old apple trees . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon she was awakened by a scream from the orchard . Hurrying out , she found Joyce dancing up and down , with her hand pressed tightly over one eye . Don stood watching her with round , frightened eyes . He could not imagine what had happened , to make his sister act like that . <p> But Grandma knew . Away back in the orchard , Grandpa had several hives of bees . Joyce had gone too near one of the hives ; and a bee had done the rest . <p> Grandma did not say much . Quietly she took the little girls hand and led her back to the house . Soon Joyce was lying on the couch , and Grandma was wringing cold water out of a cloth , and gently placing it on her eye . Before long the pain was gone ; but the eye began to swell , and soon she was not able to see out of it at all . <p> " Its all my fault that we went to the orchard , " said Don , looking sober . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was afraid we would wake Grandma . " <p> " Well , " laughed Grandma , " I guess it was mine , because I forgot to tell you about the bees .

" I wish there were no bees , Grandma , " said the little girl suddenly . <p> " Why , you like honey , do n't  you , dear ? " asked Grandma . <p> " Ye-es , I like honey ; but I do n't  like beesthey sting so ! " <p> " Bees are very interesting and hard-working little creatures , " said Grandma ; " and if they are let alone , they will not harm anyone . " <p> " I did n't  mean to bother them , " said Joyce , " but one stung me . " <p> " Thats so , " said Grandma ; " but they have certain rules , and you must have broken one of them . A bees sting is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against intrudersand the bee that stings you always dies . That 's the price she has to pay to do her duty . " <p> " Oh ! " said Joyce , " I 'm sorry I went too near . But please , Grandma , tell me some more about bees . " <p> " There are lots of things to learn about them , " said Grandma . " They live in queer little houses called hives . They have a queen ; and if she is stolen , or dies , they will not go on working without her . Only one queen can live in each house ; when a new queen is about to come out of her cell , the old queen gathers her followers and they swarm . <p> " The queen bee lays the eggs ; and when the eggs hatch , the hive is so full of bees that it can not hold them all . As soon as they find another queen , some of them must move out . <p> " When the bees are swarming , they always take good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limb of a tree ; and while they are there , they keep their queen covered , so no one can find her . They send out scouts to find a new home ; and as soon as it is found , they all move there . <p> " Sometimes Grandpa finds the queen , and puts her in the hive . Then she makes a sort of drumming noise , and the other bees follow her inside . " <p> " Was it the queen bee that stung me ? " asked Joyce . <p> " No , the queen never uses her sting except when in battle with another queen bee ; but the other bees take care of her , even if they must die for her sake . There are different kinds of bees in the hive . Drone bees can not sting ; and they will not workthey are lazy fellows . In the fall they are all killed , so that during the long winter months they can not eat the honey which the workers have gathered . <p> " Bees are busy all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and on cloudy days they make little wax cells in which to store the honey . " <p> " Thats why they say , busy as a bee , " said Joyce . " It means busy all the time. I did n't  know there was so much to learn about bees . " <p> " I have been thinking about another kind of bee , " said Grandma . <p> " Do they sting , like the bees in the orchard ? " asked Joyce , with a little shiver . <p> " Their stings are much sharper , " answered Grandma , " and the pain lasts much longer . There is a hive full of these bees , and they are always very busy . But it is bedtime now . Wait till tomorrow night , and perhaps I shall tell you about one of them . " <p> Ten minutes later Don fell asleep , wondering what the strange sort of bee was like , and hoping it would never sting him as the cross bee had stung Joyce . <p> " Grandpa says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has two bright grandchildren here on the farm , " answered Grandma , smiling . <p> " Does he mean that we can name him ? " asked Joyce . <p> " Yes , " replied Grandma , " he means just that . " <p> " Oh , Don , " cried Joyce , " what shall we call him ? " <p> " I think Bruno is a nice name , " said Don . <p> " So do I ; well call him Bruno , " agreed Joyce . <p> " I wonder if he would let me pet him , " said Don , gently touching the calf on his small white nose . <p> The little fellow tossed his head and wobbled over to the other side of his mother . The children laughed merrily ; and they were so interested in watching the little creature that Grandma had to leave them and go back to her work . <p> The hours passed by very quickly and very happilythere were so many new things to do ! Of course Joyce had to write a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bee , the new little calf , and many other interesting things . <p> Late in the afternoon the children remembered about the cows , and they thought they would pump the trough full of water ahead of time .

The cows had just finished drinking , when Don slipped in the mud and fell backward right into the trough . He kicked and splashed about , trying to get out ; and Joyce got a good drenching when she tried to help him . Grandpa had to come to the rescue and fish him out . Then they all had a good laugheven Don . The children could not watch the milking that night , because they had to go to the house and put on dry clothes . <p> Later in the evening , they reminded Grandma that she had promised to tell them a story . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> " It was to be a story about a bee , was n't it ? Well , this bee has a sharp sting , and it goes very deep .

" The boy and girl in my story were stung severely ; but it was all their own fault , as you shall see . <p> " Anna and her brother lived near a pond , and when the cold weather came it was great fun to skate on the ice . Oftentimes they would slide across it on their way to school . One morning , as their mother buttoned their coats , she said , Do n't  go across the ice this morning , children .

She saw him go down in the icy water ; and she ran to the road , screaming at the top of her voice . <p> " A man was passing by at that moment . He picked up a board and ran to the pond as fast as he could . And he reached it just in time to save little Willie . <p> " Dragging the lad up on to the bank , he called loudly for someone to come and help him . Two or three men came running ; and they worked over Willie , until at last he opened his blue eyes and asked faintly , Where am I ?

As Anna trudged off alone day after day , she seemed to hear again and again the buzzing of the bee about her earsBz-z-z-z ! You promised Mother ! <p> " I heard it so plainly , she would say to herself . It must have been my conscience . But I would n't listenand I almost lost my brother.

" <p> " We will , Grandma , we will ! " cried the children as they drifted off to the Land of Dreams . <h> Bee Honest <p> It seemed to Don that he had just fallen asleep when he heard Grandmas cheery voice calling , " Breakfast ! " He dressed as quickly as he could ; but when he got downstairs , all the others were waiting for him . <p> After breakfast Joyce dried the dishes for Grandma ; and then she helped with the sweeping and dusting .

Today , they decided to play house in the orchard ; so they got out some of the things that Mother had packed in the little trunk , to fix up their house . <p> But Don soon grew tired of that sort of play . " Let 's play hide-and-seek , " he said . <p> " All right , " answered Joyce . " Ill run and hide , while you count to one hundred . " <p> Away she ran , and Don began to count . Just as he said , " Ninety-five , " she ran to the chicken-house door . It was standing open , so she stepped inside . <p> Now there was something in the chicken-house that Joyce did not expect to find . One of Grandpas pigs was there , rooting around in the loose straw . <p> The pig was not looking for company ; and he was so frightened that he ran toward the door pell-mell .

What a sight she was ! And she was so frightened that it took Grandma quite a while to quiet her sobs . But a bath and a change of clothes made the little girl feel quite like herself again . <p> That evening when Grandma came up from the milking , she found the children on the porch waiting for another story . <p> " Very well , " said Grandma , " I shall tell you a story tonight about Bee Honest . <p> " Many years ago there lived three little boysJoe , Henry , and Charles .

They called him Mothers honest little darling ; and when they saw him coming , they yelled , Go home and hang on to your mothers apron string. <p> " Mother knew , by Charles sober face , that something had gone wrong . What is it , son ? she asked ; and Charles told her what had happened . She told him how glad she was that he would not do wrong ; and how proud his father would be of such a son . <p> " I shall never be ashamed of you , she said , as long as you are perfectly honest . Sometimes you will find it rather hard ; but just wait a few years , and you will see that it pays. <p> " Charles had been almost discouraged ; but Mothers words made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he saw the boys , his honest blue eyes looked straight into their faces , unashamed and unafraid . They dropped their eyes , and hurried away as quickly as they could . They did not bother Charles again ; for the principal had heard of their actions , and had punished them severely . <p> " When school was out , the boys began to think about doing something to earn a little money . Henry was passing the drug store one day when he noticed a sign in the windowBoy Wanted , Apply in Person. He went into the store at once , and asked for the job . <p> " The druggist took him to a little room back of the store . Here , he said , is a chest of nails and bolts . You may sort them. <p> " The boy worked for a while , and then he said to himself , What a queer job this is ! He went back into the store and said to the druggist , If that is all you have for me to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very well , said the druggist , that is all I have for you to do just now. He paid Henry for the work he had already done , and the boy went home . <p> " The druggist went back to the little room , and found bolts and nails scattered all over the floor . He put them back in the chest ; and then he hung his sign in the window again . <p> " The next day Joe passed by and saw the sign ; and he , too , went in and asked for the job . The druggist took him to the little room and showed him the chest of nails , and told him to sort them . <p> " When the boy had worked only a little while , he went back to the druggist and said , Those rusty old nails are no good . Why do n't  you let me throw them all away ? I do n't  like this kind of job , anyway. <p> " All right , said the druggist ; and he paid Joe for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he put the nails and bolts back in the chest , he said to himself , I am willing to pay more than this to find a really honest boy. <p> " Later Joe and Henry , sauntering down the street together , saw the same sign in the windowBoy Wanted . Apply in Person. <p> " Guess he does n't  want a boy very bad , said Joe . That 's no jobsorting those old rusty things . Did you find anything in the chest besides bolts and nails , Henry ? <p> " I 'm not telling everything I found , said Henry with a laugh . <p> " Joe looked up , puzzled and a little alarmed . Now I wonder he began , but broke off suddenly and started to talk about something else . <p> " A few days later Charles passed by the drug store and saw the sign in the window . He went in and told the druggist he would like to have the job . <p> " Are Joe and Henry friends of yours ? asked the druggist , looking at him sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . We used to be good friends ; but something happened between us that I do n't  like to tell ; and they would n't have anything to do with me afterward. <p> " I 'm glad to hear that , said the druggist . I rather think you 're the boy I want. <p> " For two or three hours Charles worked steadily , now and then whistling a snatch of tune . Then he went to the druggist and said , I have finished the job you gave me . What shall I do next ? <p> " The druggist went to the little room to see how Charles had done his work . The boy had found some boxes lying about ; and he had placed the bolts in one , the nails in another , and the screws in a third . <p> " And see what I found ! exclaimed Charles . It was lying under those old crooked bolts in the bottom of the chest. And he handed the druggist a five-dollar gold piece . <p> " The druggist took the money and said with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the chest just as you have them arranged in the boxes. <p> " After he had done that , Charles was sent on a few errands ; and then he was dismissed for the day . <p> " A few days later the druggist gave Charles a key and said , You may come early in the morning and open the store , and do the sweeping and dusting. <p> " At the end of the first week , when Charles received his pay envelope , he found the five-dollar gold piece along with the weeks wages . <p> " One morning , not long afterward , when Charles was sweeping the floor , he found a few pennies lying near the counter . He picked them up and laid them on the shelf , and told the druggist about them . Another day he found some pennies , a dime , and two nickels . These , too , he laid on the shelf , telling the druggist where he had found them . <p> " About a month later , when he was sweeping one morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How he did wish he might keep it for himself ! <p> " The druggist would never know it , whispered a tiny voice . <p> " But just at that instant , Bee Honest began to buzz around his ears . Do n't  forget what Mother told you , said the bee . She said she would never be ashamed of you , as long as you were perfectly honest. <p> " Charles turned the shiny dollar over and over in his hand . The bee kept on buzzingNever do anything that will make your mother ashamed of you . Be honest ! Be honest ! <p> " Yes , said Charles at last , I will. He laid the dollar up on the shelf ; and when the druggist came in , he told him about it . <p> " The druggist smiled and patted him on the shoulder . You are an honest boy , was all he said . And at the end of the week , Charles found the shiny dollar in his pay envelope , beside his usual wages . <p> " A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sums of money to take to the bank for him . I have found that I can trust you , my boy , he would say . <p> " Charles worked in the store all that summer ; and when school opened again , he helped the druggist mornings and evenings . His tired mother did not have to take in so many washings now ; for Charles always gave her his money at the end of the week . <p> " After he had finished school , the druggist gave him a steady job in the store , with good wages . <p> " Charles , said the druggist one day , do you remember the day you sorted bolts and nails for me ? <p> " Indeed I do , answered Charles . How glad I was to find work that day , so I could help my mother a little ! And I shall never forget how surprised I was when I found a five-dollar gold-piece at the bottom of the chest. <p> " I put it there on purpose , said the druggist . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You did ! exclaimed the astonished boy . <p> " Yes ; and when you brought it to me I was pretty sure that I had found an honest boy . But I wanted to be able to trust you with large sums of money , so I tested you still further . I left pennies and nickels and a dime on the floor ; and last of all , a dollar . When you picked them all up , and laid them on the shelf , and told me about themI knew then that I could safely trust you. <p> " I should like to ask you , said Charles suddenlywas there a gold-piece lying in the bottom of that chest when Joe and Henry sorted the nails , too ? <p> " Yes , said the druggist , each of them found a gold-piece there ; and each of them kept it for himself. <p> " So you lost ten dollars ! exclaimed Charles . <p> " Yes , lost ten dollars hunting for an honest boy . But it was worth itfor I found one at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story ? " asked Joyce , as Grandma paused . <p> " Not quite , " said Grandpa , who had been listening . " Tell them what happened to Henry and Joe . " <p> " Oh , yes ; I must not forget to tell you about them , " said Grandma . " Soon after Charles started working for the druggist , Henry was caught stealing some things from a department store . He was arrested ; but his father paid the fine , so he was allowed to go free . <p> " But his dishonest habits soon got him into trouble again . He broke into a house while the family was away , and stole some money . He was sent to a reformatory for boys ; and he had to stay there a long time . After that , he never could keep a job long ; for he was so dishonest that no one could depend on him . <p> " Joe did not get into so much trouble in his boyhood ; but after he became a man he forged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " How much better it would have been , " said Joyce thoughtfully , " if Henry and Joe had only listened to the bee in the first place . " <p> " Yes , indeed , " said Grandma , " I have often thought of that ; for I am sure the bee talked to them , as well as to Charles . " <p> " Maybe , " said little Don softly , " they did n't  have a Grandma to tell them how to be good . " <p> " Maybe not , " said Grandpa , smiling , as he rose to take the little fellow in to bed . <p> " Did n't  they ever change into good men ? " asked Joyce . <p> " I 'm afraid not , " answered Grandma . " That 's the saddest part of the whole story . They felt the sting of the bee as long as they lived . " <h> Bee Truthful <p> Every day Joyce and Don went out to meet the mailman ; and how glad they were this morning when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daddy were having a good time at the lake ; and there was a picture of Daddy smiling at them , as he held up a days catch of fish . <p> " What a string of fish ! " exclaimed Grandpa , when they showed it to him . " And what fine big ones they are ! " <p> " I wish , " said Don , " that we could go fishing , Grandpa . " <p> Grandpa whispered something in his ear ; and the little fellow began to dance about and clap his hands . <p> " What is it ? " asked Joyce excitedly . <p> " Only that were going fishing tomorrow , " said Grandpa . " Well start out bright and early in the morning , take our lunch , and spend the day at the river . " <p> Joyce and Grandma were busy all morning about the house ; and in the afternoon they baked cookies , and got the lunch as nearly ready as they could for the trip . Grandpa and Don went out to the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of worms ; and then Don found a larger can , and filled that , too . When Grandpa said they had enough , Don covered the worms with loose dirt and set the cans out in the shed . Then they got out the fishing tackle . <p> Late in the afternoon , Grandma called the children and asked them to catch a chicken for her , so she could get it ready for their picnic lunch . <p> The children asked if they might pick off the feathers . They had watched Grandma do it so many times , they thought it would be an easy job . But when they tried it , they found it was not so easy after all . They turned the chicken round and round , picking first in one place and then in another . It took them a long time to get all the feathers off . <p> Then Grandma cut up the chicken and put it in a crock , and took it to the spring house to keep it cool . " I will fry it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day passed by ! It was already time to do the evening chores . Grandma was trying to teach the brown and white calf to drink milk from a pail . Grandpa was busy in the barn , so she called the children to come and help her . <p> The calf was kept in a lot near the orchard . " I want you to drive him to the corner of the fence for me , " said Grandma . " Then I will try to coax him to drink the milk . " <p> But the little creature was not so easy to manage . As soon as they had driven him into the corner , he would back away ; and off he would go again , across the lot . <p> After this had happened several times , Don said , " Just wait , Grandma ; when we get him into the corner again , I will hold him there . " <p> So the next time , he grabbed the calf about the neck and jumped on his back . Instantly the calf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farther side , he turned again , and Don rolled off on the soft grass . <p> Just then , Grandpa came to the rescue . He drove the calf to the corner and held him there , while Grandma coaxed him to drink from the pail . <p> " We must go to bed early tonight , " said Grandpa as they started for the house . " We want to reach the river by the time the sun comes up . " <p> " But you 'll tell us a story first , wo n't you , Grandma ? " asked Don . <p> " Yes , " said Grandma , as she sank into her comfortable old rocking chair in the kitchen . <p> " About another bee ? " asked Joyce . " Which one ? " <p> " Bee Truthful , " answered Grandma . " Boys and girls who will not listen to him often come to griefas the boy did that I shall tell you about . <p> " Little Milton lived on a farm . His father had a number of mules , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young mules were very ill-tempered . Miltons father was very careful to keep the little pigs and calves out of their way , for fear the mules would paw them to death . <p> " When Milton was almost nine , a little baby brother came into his home . His name was Marion . Milton loved the baby dearly , and never grew tired of playing with him . <p> " Their father built a fence around the yard . They were careful to keep the gates of the fence closed , so little Marion could not wander away ; especially after the two ill-tempered mules were put out to pasture in the lot just back of the house . <p> " Late one afternoon , Milton was helping his father in the back lot . Daddy had to go and do something else , so he left the boy to finish the job . <p> " As soon as you have finished , said Daddy , you may go to the house . But be sure to latch the back yard gate. <p> " Daddy did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did you latch the gate when you came in this afternoon ? <p> " Milton knew he had forgotten , but he thought to himself , If I tell the truth , I shall have to go out and latch the gate now ; and I am afraid of the dark. <p> " Aloud , he said , Yes , Daddy , I did. <p> " Are you sure ? asked Daddy . <p> " Yes , said Milton again . <p> " The little boy suddenly heard a bee buzzing in his earsTell the truth , Milton ; tell the truth ! But he said to himself , It wont matter if the gate stands open all night ; I will latch it the first thing in the morning. And so he soon forgot all about it . <p> " The next morning , right after breakfast , Miltons mother sent him on an errand . Marion was still asleep . <p> " Wheres Marion ? asked Milton when he came back . <p> " He woke a little while ago , said Mother . After I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard to playits such a bright morning. <p> " Instantly Milton thought of the gate ; and he went to look for Marion . <p> " A moment later he heard his father cry out in alarm ; and looking toward the pasture where the two young mules were kept , he saw little Marion just inside the fence . <p> " Daddy ran toward the baby as fast as he could ; but he was just too late . One of the mules kicked Marion , and he fell over in a little heap . The mule , seeing Daddy coming , ran toward the other end of the pasture . <p> " Daddy picked up the limp little body and carried it to the house . The baby lay so still that at first they thought he was dead . <p> " Milton was terribly frightened , and he cried almost all day ; for he knew this dreadful thing had happened because he did not latch the back yard gateand because he had told Daddy a lie about it . <p> " Poor little Marion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was many , many months before he could sit up . And never again was he able to run about like other children . <p> " It was a long time before Mother and Daddy found out how the baby came to be in the pasture with the mules . But one day , after little Marion had been brought home , Milton told Daddy the whole , sad story . <p> " I 'm very sorry , said Daddy kindly , when he had finished . I wish you had told me the truth . I would n't have sent you out alone in the dark , son . I would have gone out and latched the gate myself. <p> " It was almost more than Milton could bear , to have his father talk to him so sadly and yet so kindly . The sting of the bee went deeper and deeper , as he watched his pale-faced little brother day after day . Always after that , he was careful to listen to the buzzing of little Bee Truthful . " <p> Two very sober children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-past eight . <h> Bee Kind <p> " Don , " said Grandma , shaking the little sleeper , " its time to wake up ! " <p> Don turned over , rubbed his eyes , and with a deep sigh , settled back to sleep . <p> " Here , here ! " cried Grandma , shaking him again . " Do you want us to leave you at home all alone ? Were going fishing today ! " <p> Instantly Don was wide awake . He bounced out of bed and began to dress as quickly as he could . In five minutes he was in the kitchen ; but Joyce was there ahead of him , helping Grandma to pack the lunch basket . <p> Don was so excited that Grandma could coax him to eat only a few bites of breakfast . He was the first one in the car , ready to start for the river . <p> The sun was just peeping over the hills , when they drove into a pretty , shady nook on the bank of the river . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandpa . They stopped under a tree whose great , spreading branches leaned far out over the water ; and soon they were untying the fishing poles and baiting their hooks . <p> " I 'll give a nickel to the one who catches the first fish , " said Grandpa . <p> Suddenly Dons cork began to bob up and down in the water . Joyce felt a strong pull on her line , too . Almost at the same instant each of them lifted a fish from the water . Grandpa took the little perch from Dons hook , and a catfish from Joyces ; and with his big , hearty laugh he gave them each a nickel . <p> The hours passed so quickly that before the children knew it , it was time for lunch . But when Grandma spread out the chicken and sandwiches and cookies and lemonade in the shade of the big tree , they found that they were as hungry as bears . <p> After lunch , Grandma lay down in the shade and tried to take a nap , while the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bite so well as they had done in the morning . <p> They had already caught a great many fish , so they decided to go home early . Grandpa had been stringing the fish one by one , as they had caught them ; and he had let the line hang down in the water . Now , when he lifted it out , the children were delighted to see how many fish they had caught . <p> " That is a longer string of fish than Daddy has in the picture ! " cried Don . <p> " We can not use so many fish ourselves , " said Grandpa . " We shall have to share with the neighbors . " <p> When they reached home , Don helped Grandpa to clean the fish . Grandpa skinned the catfish , and Don scraped the scales from the perch . When they had finished , Don had fish scales all over himeven in his hair . <p> But this trouble was all forgotten at supper time , when Grandma set a large platter of fish on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken . <p> In the evening , the children came to Grandma for their usual story . They sat down on the porch , with the soft summer dusk gathering about them . <p> " I shall tell you a story tonight , " began Grandma , " about a bee that every child should listen to and obey . Its name is Bee Kind . <p> " James and Richard lived near each other , and they were playmates . One day they were flying their kites in a vacant lot , when they saw a dirty little puppy . Richard began to stamp his feet and try to scare it ; but as he could not chase it away , he threw stones at the poor little thing . <p> " A stone struck the puppy on his head , and hurt him very badly ; for he began to turn round and round , whining and howling pitifully . Richard laughed , as if he thought it a great joke . <p> " You may call me what you please , said James , but I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe he s lost. <p> " With that , he lifted the little creature in his arms and carried him home . The puppys head was bleeding where Richard had struck him with the stone . James washed the blood away and gave the little dog something to eat , talking to him kindly and petting him all the while . <p> " When his father came home that evening , he told James that the puppy showed marks of being a very good dog ; and that if the owner never came , he might keep him for his own . <p> " James was delighted . He named the dog Rex , and at once began to teach him to do all sorts of tricks . Rex learned to walk on his hind feet , sit up straight and beg for something to eat , play dead dog , roll over , chase his tail , and run through a hoop . <p> " In a few months , Rex had grown to be quite a large dog . By this time , James had taught him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stick into the water and say , Go get it , Rex , the dog would bring it back in his mouth . <p> " All the boys in the neighborhood liked Rex ; and he liked them allexcept Richard . Whenever he came around , the dog would growl and show his teeth . <p> " Two years later , one warm Saturday afternoon in April , James called Rex and started for the pond . Oftentimes fishing parties visited this pond , so a number of small boats were tied among the willows fringing the shore . On this particular afternoon , Richard and his little brother Harry had also gone to the pond ; and Richard untied one of the boats to take a ride . Of course he had no right to use a boat that did not belong to him ; but he thought that no one would ever know . <p> " Just as James came around a clump of willows , he saw the little boat tip over ; and Richard and Harry fell in , at the deepest place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began to call for help as loudly as he could . Rex ran back and forth whining , looking first at James , then at the boys in the water . Suddenly a happy thought struck James . Pointing to the two boys , he said , Go get them , Rex ! Immediately the dog jumped into the water and began to swim toward the boys . He soon had Harrys collar between his teeth , and was swimming back to shore . <p> " James helped Harry to his feet ; and then , pointing to Richard , he said , Go get the other one ! <p> " Richard had gone down the second time when Rex reached him ; but as he came up to the surface of the water , the dog caught him and began to swim back . It was a hard task , as Richard was heavier than Harry ; but at last Rex brought him safely to shore . <p> " All this time James had been calling for help ; and now several men came running toward the pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he came back to consciousness . <p> " Who got me out of the water ? he asked , as soon as he could speak . <p> " Rex , answered James . <p> " Tears rolled down Richards face as he said brokenly , Just think ! I almost killed him when he was a little puppy ! I know one thingIll never do such a thing again. <p> " Everybody petted and praised Rex for what he had done . Richards father bought a beautiful new collar for him . But although the dog had saved Richards life , he never would have anything to do with him afterward . He could not forget how cruelly the boy had treated him in his puppyhood . " <p> " Daddy promised to get a puppy for me soon , " said Don . " I shall name him Rex , after the good dog in the story . " <p> " And I 'm quite sure , " said Grandma , " that you 'll always be as kind to him as James was to Rex . But I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . Hustle him off to bed , Grandpa , or you 'll have to carry him upstairs . " <p> Don said a sleepy good night ; and sure enough , five minutes later he was fast asleep . <h> Bee Polite <p> When the children came down to the kitchen in the morning , they found that Grandpa had eaten his breakfast , and had gone out to build a pigpen behind the barn . Don hurried out to help him ; and Joyce went to the spring house to do the churning for Grandma . <p> The little girl plunged the dasher into the thick cream , lifted it , and plunged it again , until her arms ached . At last the dasher began to look clean , and tiny particles of golden butter clung to it and she knew that the butter had " come . " Then she took the butter paddle and the bowl and cooled them in the spring , just as she had seen Grandma do . She lifted the butter from the churn with the paddle and began to work it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this many times , and it had looked very easy ; but she found it quite another thing , when she came to doing it herself . <p> After she had worked for some time , she had a solid roll of butter . She salted it , and worked it some more ; and then she called Grandma to come and see it . <p> " I could not have made better butter myself ! " said Grandma . <p> So Joyce had something new to write about , in her next letter to Mother . <p> After dinner the children went to the orchard to play . They found an ant hill ; and it was very interesting to watch the ants as they worked . <p> One ant was carrying a bread crumb several times larger than herself , and the children were watching eagerly . The old turkey gobbler came strutting toward them ; but they did not notice . Joyce was bending over , watching the industrious little ant , when suddenly the gobbler perched upon her back and began to beat her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was a comical sight that Grandma saw when she came to the door . There was Joyce , running toward the house , with the gobbler after her , and Don coming behind . <p> The gobbler was right at Joyces heels , when suddenly the little girl dodged behind a tree and began to go round and round it , keeping the tree between her and the gobbler . At last Don found a stick and chased him away . <p> When Grandma had comforted Joyce , she explained that it was the little girls red dress that the gobbler did n't  like . Joyce declared that she would never wear that dress again while she was on the farm . She never did ; and so the gobbler did not bother her any more . <p> At bedtime , the children were ready for their usual story . They clambered up on to the arms of the old rocker on the porch , while Grandpa sat down on the step . <p> " What do we hear about tonight ? " asked Grandpa . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Don does . " <p> " All boys are just alikebig and little , " said Grandma with a smile . " My story this time is about Bee Polite . " <p> " Oh , " said Don , " I know a little verse about politeness . I learned it at school : <p> " Politeness is to do and say The kindest thing in the kindest way . " <p> " Then politeness means kindness , does n't  it , Grandma ? " asked Joyce . <p> " Yesand more than that , " replied Grandma . " A polite person is never rude . The story is about two children who were stung by Bee Polite just oncebut they never forgot it . <p> " Daisy and Dan were twins . When they were babies , their mother took them from their home in the East to live in a far Western state . They could not remember their grandmother , who still lived back in the old home town . All they knew about her was what their mother had told them ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents . <p> " One day they received a letter from Grandma , saying that she was coming to spend a few weeks with them . They could hardly wait for Thursday to come when she was to arrive at the station . <p> " The train was due at six oclock in the evening , and Mother promised the twins that they might go to meet Grandma . After school she sent them to the store to buy some things for supper , and she gave them ten cents to buy candy . <p> " Now there were some children living in the neighborhood who were very rude . For this reason the twins were never allowed to play with them . But today , on their way to the store , they met these children , and all went on together . <p> " They crossed a vacant lot , where there was a pile of crushed rock . Near the rock pile , they met an elderly woman carrying a small satchel . She spoke kindly to them ; but one of the boys answered her very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lady turned to him and said , My boy , you need someone to teach you how to be a gentleman. <p> " Oh , do I ? said the boy roughly . And picking up a stone from the rock pile , he threw it at her . Another lad did the same , and still another . <p> " Now the twins had been taught to be politeespecially to old people . Just now little Bee Polite began to buzz about them . But when children are in bad company , it is always hard for them to hear the small voice of conscience . For a moment they stood and watched the boys throw rocks at the old lady ; and then they began to throw them , too . <p> " No matter how hard she tried , Daisy could not throw a stone straight . But Dan had a better aim , and he threw a rock which struck the old ladys hand . <p> " When the twins reached the store , there were several customers ahead of them ; so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when they came out of the store with their bundles . The rude boys had waited outside for them all that time ; and the twins gave them some of their candy . <p> " When Daisy and Dan reached home , they were much surprised to find a visitor there . It was the old lady whom they had treated so unkindly . Mother was crying , as she bathed the hand that had been hurt by Dans rock . <p> " Children , she said , this is your dear grandmother who has come to see you . She came on an earlier train than she expected ; and she inquired the way , and walked out from the station alone . Some rude children treated her very unkindly on the way . You will have to very good to her , to make up for it. <p> " Well , well , said Grandma kindly , is this Daisy and Dan ? I should never have taken them to be my grandchildren. <p> " The twins expected her to add , So you are the naughty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it ; and Daisy and Dan hurried out of the room as quickly as they could . <p> " So the good times the children had expected to have with their grandma were spoiled in the very beginning . After that , whenever they went into the room where she was , they felt very uncomfortable . <p> " I do n't  understand why the twins act so strangely , said Mother one day , as she and Grandma sat mending together . I am really ashamed of them . They had planned to do so many things to make you happy during your visit . But they seem to keep away from you all they can. <p> " Daisy , who was passing outside just under the window , heard every word distinctly . Her heart pounded like a hammer , and she held her breath , to hear what Grandma would say . <p> " Grandma went on mending , without saying a word . Dear Grandma ! She wo n't tell on us for throwing stones at her , said Daisy to herself . Then I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sob . <p> " An instant later , Mother was surprised to see the little girl dash into the room with tears running down her cheeks . She threw herself down by the chair and laid her head in her mothers lap . She was crying so hard that for a moment she could not speak . <p> " Then Daisy told the whole story . When she had finished , she threw her arms around Grandma . <p> " I 'm so sorry , dear Grandma ! she cried . <p> " Just then Grandma looked up and saw Dan standing there . He had come in so softly that no one had noticed . <p> " Grandma held out her hands to him ; and he burst into tears . It was my fault , lots more than Daisys , he sobbed . I threw a stone before she did ; and besides , it was my stone that hit your hand. <p> " Grandma talked to the twins for a long time , then , in her own quiet way . She told them that children who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that polite boys and girls usually grew up to be the best men and women . <p> " I know that such a thing will never happen again , she said , kissing them both ; so now it is all forgiven and forgotten. <p> " But the twins could not forget . Two or three weeks later , Grandma went home . She still wrote letters and sent presents , just as if nothing had ever happened . But for many yearslong after Daisy and Dan had grown upevery time they thought of their dear grandmother , they felt the sting of their rudeness and cruelty to her . " <p> Joyce winked the tears out of her eyes , as she threw her arms around her grandmas neck . " I could never treat you like that , dear Grandma ! " she cried . <h> Bee Gentle <p> In the morning , another letter came from Mother . " Daddy and I are getting lonesome for you , " she wrote . <p> " Were having a better time than Mother and Daddy are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to Grandpas , they would not have been so lonesome , would they , Joyce ? " <p> " I should say not ! " answered Joyce . " The days go by too fast for that ; and besides , something is always happening . If its nothing else , the old turkey gobbler chases me around the tree . " Don and Grandma laughed heartily and Joyce joined in . <p> Grandma had promised to make some cookies this morning ; so with Joyce on one side of her and Don on the other , she mixed up the dough and rolled it out on the large board . Then she got some cutters from the pantry , and cut out the cookies in all sorts of shapes . There were different kinds of animals : a bird for Joyce , and a queer little man for Don . His eyes , nose , and mouth were made out of raisins ; also the buttons on his vest . Then she put the cookies in the oven to bake . <p> When they were done and Grandma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its tail came off . And Dons man had grown so fat that he had burst one of the buttons off his vest . <p> A long time ago , when the childrens mother had been Grandmas little girl , she had lived on this very farm . In those far-off days she had planted a lilac bush and a cluster of prickly pear . Grandpa did not like the prickly pear , but he had let it grow all these years because his little girl had planted it . <p> " Isnt the grass nice and soft here ? " said Don . " It feels just like a velvet carpet . Watch me turn somersaults on it . " <p> With that , he began to turn somersaults , going in the direction of the prickly pear . Joyce called to him to be careful , but it was too late ; he came down right in the middle of the cactus plant . The long thorns pierced him like sharp needles ; and although he tried to be brave , he could not keep back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the thorns one by one , and it took Grandma quite a while to do that . And although Don turned many somersaults afterward , he was always careful to keep away from the prickly pear . <p> When story time came , Grandma , gently rocking back and forth , began : " I shall tell you tonight about a bee that it is very necessary to have in the home ; and it is also much needed by those who have anything to do with animals . Its name is Bee Gentle . Have you ever noticed how gentle Grandpa is with all his animals ? " <p> " Yes , I have noticed it , " said Joyce . " And the horses love him for it , too . Whenever he goes to the pasture , they trot up to him and begin to nose about his pockets . " <p> " He usually carries something in his pockets to give them , " said Grandma . " He has raised all his horses from little colts ; and he has always treated them kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make them obey ; but that is not so . <p> " Jake and Jenny were a brother and sister who loved each other dearly , but they were quite different in disposition . All the animals about the place were afraid of Jake , for he treated them roughly , and sometimes beat them . But they loved Jenny because she was gentle with them . The dog would follow her about , and the cat would curl up on her lap and purr itself to sleep . When she went to the pasture , the horses would trot up to her and rub their noses on her shoulder . She often gave them lumps of sugar , or other dainties that horses like . No matter how wild or shy they were with others , Jenny could always catch them easily . <p> " Of all the horses in her fathers pasture , Jenny loved best a beautiful swift-footed mare called Fanny . Sometimes she would ride about the country on Fannys back . But as gentle as the mare was with Jenny , she was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pasture . <p> " It would be much better , Jenny would often say to her brother , if you would not treat the animals so roughly . See how easily I can handle Fannyjust because I am always gentle with her. <p> " Oh , Jake would answer with a laugh , that is all right for a woman , Jenny ; but a man , you know , must show his authority. <p> " Very early one morning , Jakes father came into his room . Jake , he said , shaking the boy , wake up , son ! Mother was taken very i 'll in the night . Catch Fanny and go for the doctor as quickly as you can. <p> " The hired man was sleeping in the next room , and he heard what Jakes father said . He also got up and dressed , and hurried out to the pasture to help Jake catch the mare . <p> " The two were gone quite a while . At last they came back to the house , and Jake said , I ca n't catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen times . What shall I do ? <p> " Try again , said his father . I cant leave Mother long enough to go to the pasture ; and she must have help soon. <p> " Just then Jenny came in . I will catch Fanny for you , Father , she said , and hurried out to the pasture . <p> " Fanny , oh , Fanny ! she called ; and the beautiful creature turned her head and trotted toward her . But an instant later , to Jennys surprise , she galloped away across the field . Glancing behind her , Jenny saw Jake and the hired man coming up the lane . " <p> " She sees you coming , called Jenny ; that 's why she wo n't let me catch her . Go back to the house and wait ; I 'll bring her to you. " <p> " Jake and the man went back ; and Jenny went further into the pasture , calling , Fanny , oh , Fanny ! Instantly the mare turned and trotted toward her . She came close ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed her nose against the little girls shoulder . " <p> " Quickly she put the bridle on the mare , and led her through the lane to the barn . Then she harnessed her and hitched her to the buggy , and called to Jake . The boy hurried out , looking rather pale and worried ; and as he stepped into the buggy Jenny stroked the mares neck , saying gently , Now go along , dear Fanny , and do your best for Mother. " <p> " Fanny rubbed her nose against Jennys shoulder again , as if to say , I will , little mistress ; you may depend on me. Then as Jake lifted the reins , she trotted down the road at a rapid gait . " <p> " Jake found the doctor just sitting down to breakfast . When he heard the boys story , he did not stop to eat . He rode right back with Jake , and in a short time he was at the mothers bedside . She was indeed very i 'll . If I had been a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have done nothing for her at all. <p> " When Jake heard that , he went into the kitchen , sank down on a chair , and leaning his head on the table , he sobbed like a child . Jenny found him there a little later . <p> " She stood there beside him , gently stroking his hair . Jake , she said at last , very softly , do n't  cry any more , because God was very kind to us and did n't  let it happen . But just think what might have been , if I had n't  been able to catch Fanny this morning . Do n't  you think it would pay to always be kind to the animals ? <p> " Jake nodded ; he could not trust himself to speak . <p> " The sting of little Bee Gentle went very deep . Never again was Jake cruel to animals . He tried hard to make friends with Fanny ; but she would have nothing to do with him . She remembered how roughly he had treated her in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand that he never would do so again . " <p> " How glad Jenny must have been , " said Joyce , " that she had treated Fanny kindly ! Because Fanny brought the doctor , the doctor saved her mothers life . " <p> " And besides , " added Grandma softly , " people are always glad when they know they have done right . " <h> Bee Helpful <p> " What are you going to do with that rope ? " asked Don , as Grandpa came from the shed with a coil of rope on his arm . <p> " Come with me , and you will find out , " answered Grandpa . " And you may call Joyce , too , if you wish . " <p> Don ran to the house to get Joyce , and soon the two came back together . They followed Grandpa down the lane toward the pasture where he kept his pigs . The children kept asking him what he intended to do , but he would only answer , " Wait and see . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten little pigs . He opened the pasture gate and called to them , and they all came out into the lane , grunting and squealing . Then he coaxed them toward the pigpen that he had been building . He closed the gate , and , turning to the children , said , " Now if you watch me , you will see what I intend to do with the rope . " <p> When the children were both safe on the other side of the fence , Grandpa climbed into the pigpen and coiled the rope a number of times in his hands . Then he cast it from him , and it fell over one of the little pigs . He drew it in , and the pig was caught . Then he lifted him and placed him in the pen . How the little fellow squealed , and how hard the old hogs tried to get to him ! Some of the larger ones started toward the fence where Don and Joyce were perched on posts . Grandpa laughed to see how quickly the children scrambled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you see why I wanted the fence between you and those hogs , do n't  you ? If they could get to you , they might tear you in pieces ; for they want to take care of the little pigs . " <p> Grandpa coiled the rope again , caught another of the little pigs , and then another and another , until all ten of them were in in the pen . Then he opened the gate and turned the others back into the pasture . <p> Grandpa had caught the pigs so easilyonly once or twice had he had to try a second time . " I do n't  see how you could catch them when they were running away from you , " said Don . " I could n't catch them if they were standing still . " <p> " Perhaps not , " said Grandpa . " But I can catch you if you try to get away from me . Just try it . " <p> At that , Don began to run as fast as he could ; but he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , and he was lifted off his feet . <p> " What fun ! " shouted Joyce . " Now try it on me . " <p> Grandpa spent quite a while catching first one and then the other . Joyce was the hardest to catch , for after a few times she learned how to dodge the rope . <p> " Why did you put those little pigs in the pen ? " asked Don , following close at his heels . <p> " They are getting in the cornfield , " answered Grandpa , " and eating too much of my corn . " <p> " But cant you keep them out ? " asked Don . <p> " No , " said Grandpa ; " for when I mend one place in the fence , the little pigs are sure to find another place big enough to squeeze through . So the only way I can keep them out is to pen them up . Don , you may carry water for the little pigsand they will need plenty , too , because it is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began at once to fill the trough which Grandpa had placed in the pen . <p> That evening , Grandpa and Grandma and the children sat on the porch , listening to the chirp of the katydids and the call of the whippoorwills . <p> " Grandma , " said Don , " what kind of bee will you tell us about tonight ? " <p> " Bee Sleepy , and go to bed , " said Grandpa , with a wink at Grandma . <p> The children laughed . " No , " said Don , " I do n't  want to hear about that beenot yet . " <p> " All right , " said Grandma , " well have our story first ; but we must begin right away , because it is almost bedtime . The bee I am thinking about tonight comes often to us allespecially to little children . <p> " Once there was a boy named Alfred who was the only child in his home . He was very selfish ; and often he was determined to have his own way . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred lived in the country ; and during the Christmas holidays , he visited a friend of his who lived in the city . Then his friend in turn visited him during the summer vacation . <p> " As soon as his company came , Alfred thought it was quite too much for his mother to ask him to help her . He forgot how very ill she had been , and how frail she still was . Indeed , it was hard for him to think of anything but having a good time with his friend . <p> " The two boys had planned to spend a certain day at the creek , fishing . Of course they were eager to start as early as they could that morning . After they had gathered together everything that they needed for their trip , they went out to the kitchen and found Alfreds mother packing a lunch for them . <p> " Alfred , she said , I wish you would help me a little with the work before you go . I am afraid that I shall not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping long enough to wash the dishes and clean up the kitchen for me ? <p> " Alfred began to pout , but his mother continued , I really wish you were not going fishing today . Your father will be away all day ; and I would rather not be left alone , for I do not feel as well as usual . But I will not keep you , if you will wash the dishes before you go. <p> " Now , Mother , said Alfred angrily , why do you ask me to do that , when you know I want to get started early ? If I have to wait half the day , I do n't  care to go at all. <p> " Just then the bee began to buzz about Alfreds ears . Help your mother ! Help your mother ! it said . But Alfred did not pay any attention . Let the dishes go , he cried . I do n't  care whether they are ever washed or not. And picking up the lunch which his mother had packed so nicely for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even look back to say goodbye. <p> " The boys found fishing very good that day . They caught a fine string of trout , ate their lunch , and in the middle of the afternoon were ready to start for home . Alfred was much pleased with their catch , and on the way home he said over and over , Wont Mother be glad we went fishing today , when she sees our string of trout ? She is so fond of trout. But even while he was saying it , he could not forget the tired look on his mothers face , or the hurt look in her eyes when he had refused to wash the dishes for her . <p> " When the boys reached the house , it seemed strangely quiet . They found the dishes cleared away , and the kitchen neatly swept . Alfreds mother was lying on the couch , and she seemed to be resting very comfortably . <p> " See , Mother , said Alfred , is n't this a nice string of trout ? <p> " But Mother did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no answer . He touched her hand then , and found it icy cold . <p> " Then the awful truth dawned upon himhis mother was dead ! She had died while he was fishing ; but she had done the work that she had asked her boy to do . <p> " All his life , poor Alfred felt the sting of the bee that had buzzed about him on that summer morning . What hurt him most deeply was that he would never again have a chance to help his frail little mother who had done so much for him . " <p> " I 'm so glad , " said Joyce , " that I still have my mother , and that I can do things for her when she is tired . " <p> " Its a sad story , Grandma , " said little Don , " but I 'm glad you told it to us . I 'm going to remember it always . " <h> Bee Grateful <p> Another morning came to the farmanother day for the children to roam about the fields and enjoy themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant than having to play in their own yard in the city , these hot summer days ! <p> In that long-ago time when the childrens mother had lived on the farm , Grandpa had given her a pony of her own to ride to school in the village . Old Ned was still on the place . Grandpa was always ready to saddle and bridle him , whenever the children wished to go for a ride . <p> Today , as the children wandered to the back of the orchard , wishing for something to do , Ned stood on the other side of the fence and neighed at them . That gave Don an idea . <p> " Oh , Joyce ! " he cried , " let 's ride Ned around in the pasture . " <p> " Without a saddle ? " exclaimed Joyce . <p> " Of course , " answered Don in his most grown up tone . " Why not ? " <p> " All right , " said Joyce a little doubtfully . <p> They went out through the barn lot , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bars , they soon found themselves in the pasture . <p> Joyce led old Ned to the fence , holding to his mane . She climbed up on the fence , and then onto the horses back . Don quickly climbed on behind her . <p> In his younger days , Ned had been taught a number of tricks , which he still remembered . He would shake hands , and nod his head , and ride up the steps . And when a rider was on his back , if he gripped his knees in Neds sides , the old horse would gallop away as fast as he could . <p> Always , before this , the children had ridden with a saddle ; and so they had never had to hold fast with their knees . But today Joyce knew she would have to hold on tightly , so she pressed her knees hard against old Neds sides . Instantly he started to gallop across the pasture . He went up the lane , through the open gate into the barn lot , and on to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her might , gripping him tightly with her knees . Don bounced up and down behind her , with his arms about her waist . <p> When Ned reached the watering trough , he stopped . Suddenly he lowered his head , and both children slipped off into the trough . It was about half-full of water , and Joyce fell in face downward . Such sputtering , puffing , and blowing , as they scrambled out of the trough ! And there stood old Ned , looking at them as if to say , " How did you like your bath ? " <p> Grandpa came hurrying up to see if they were hurt . He told them that old Ned was only doing as he had been taught when he was a colt ; and that they could not expect him to do otherwise , if they rode him like that . <p> That evening , as twilight settled down , Grandpa and Grandma and the children sat on the porch and listened to the lonely call of a whippoorwill from the neighboring woods . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the Little Bear , too . " <p> " What is the Milky Way , Grandma ? " asked Joyce . <p> " When men look through telescopes they find millions of starsso close together and so far away that not one star can be seen by the naked eye . The Indians used to say it was the path which all Indians must travel after they died , to reach the Happy Hunting Grounds . " <p> " See how bright the stars are in the Dipper ! " exclaimed Don . <p> " When I was just a little girl , " said Grandma , " I learned a rhyme about the Milky Way : <p> " The Man in the Moon that sails through the sky Is known as a gay old skipper . But he made a mistake , When he tried to take A drink of milk from the dipper . <p> " He dipped it into the Milky Way , And was just prepared to drink it , When the Big Bear growled , And the Little Bear growled , And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The children liked the queer little rhyme , and said it over until they knew it by heart . <p> At last Grandpa said , " I guess its about time to turn in for tonight . " <p> " Oh , no , " said Don , " not till Grandma tells us our story . " <p> " All right , " said Grandma . " I shall tell you this time about a little bee called Bee Grateful . It has a very sharp sting , as you will see . <p> " Far away , under sunny Italian skies , there is an old , old town by the name of Atri . It is built on the side of a steep hill . <p> " A very long time ago , the king of Atri bought a great golden-toned bell and hung it in the tower at the market-place . Fastened to the bell , there was a long rope that reached almost to the ground . <p> " We shall call it the bell of justice , said the king . <p> " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to the marketplace and see the bell . It shone like gold in the bright sunlight . When the king came riding down the street , the people whispered to one another , Perhaps he will ring the bell. <p> " But he did not . Instead , he stopped at the foot of the tower and raised his hand . All the whispering and talking stopped ; for the people knew that the king was about to speak . <p> " My good people , he said , this bell belongs to you . No one must ever pull the rope unless he is in trouble . But if any one of youman , woman , or childis ever treated unjustly , you may come to the marketplace and ring the bell . The judges will come together and listen to your story ; and the one who has done wrong will be punished , whoever he may be . That is why this is called the bell of justice. <p> " Year after year passed by , and the great bell still hung in the tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell ; and in every case , the judges had been perfectly fair , and had punished the one who had done wrong . <p> " The rope had hung there so long in the sun and rain , and had been pulled by so many hands , that it was almost worn out . Some of the strands were untwisted ; and it had grown shorter and shorter , until only the tallest man or woman could reach it . <p> " We must have a new rope , said the judges at last . If a little child should be wronged , he could not reach high enough to ring the bell . That would never do. <p> " At once the people of Atri set about to look for a new rope ; but there was none to be found in all the town of Atri . They would have to send someone to a country across the mountains to get the rope . But that would take quite a while ; and what should they do , while they were waiting ? <p> " One man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came back with a grapevine . Then he tied the vine to the rope . <p> " There ! he said , the smallest child will be able to reach it now , and ring the bell ; for the vine , with its leaves and little tendrils , trailed on the ground . <p> " The judges were pleased . Yes , they said , that will do very well , until we can get a new rope from the country beyond the mountains. <p> " Near the village of Atri , higher up on the hillside , there lived an old soldier . When he was a young man , he had traveled in far-distant countries , and had fought in many wars . And he was so brave that his king had made him a knight . <p> " He had had one true and faithful friend all through those hard and dangerous years . It was his horse . Many a time the brave steed had saved his masters life . <p> " But now that the knight was an old man , he no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for only one thing : gold , gold , gold . He was a miser . <p> " One day , as he passed his barn , he looked in and saw his faithful horse standing in his stall . The poor creature looked almost starved . <p> " Why should I keep that lazy beast any longer ? said the miser to himself . His food costs more money than he is worth . I know what I will do . I will turn him out on the hillside , and let him find his own food . If he starves to deathwhy , he will be out of the way ! <p> " So the brave old horse was turned out to graze as best he could on the rocky hillside . He was sick and lame , and he grew thinner every day ; for all he could find was a tiny patch of grass or a thistle now and then . The village dogs barked at him and bit at his heels ; and naughty boys threw stones at him . <p> " One hot afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one was about the streets ; for the people were trying to keep as cool as they could in the shelter of their homes . As the horse went picking about trying to find a few blades of grass , suddenly he discovered the long grapevine trailing on the ground at the foot of the tower . The leaves were still green and tender , for it had been placed there only a short time before . <p> " The horse did not know that the bell would ring if he pulled the vine . He only knew that here was a juicy bit of dinner for him , and he was hungry . <p> " He nibbled at the end of the vine ; and suddenly , far up in the belfry , the huge bell began to swing back and forth . From its great throat , golden music floated down over the town of Atri . It seemed to be saying : <p> " LONG ... <p> " The judges put on their robes , and hurried out of their cool homes into the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wondered ? <p> " When they reached the market-place , no one was there ; but they saw the starving old horse , nibbling at the tender grapevine . <p> " Ho , ho ! cried one , it is the misers brave old steed . He rings the bell to plead for justice. <p> " And justice he shall have ! cried another . <p> " See how thin he is , said a lad with a kind heart . <p> " By this time , many people had gathered in the market-place . When they saw the old horse , a murmur of astonishment swept through the crowd . <p> " The misers steed ! cried one to another . He has waited long ; but he shall have justice today. <p> " I have seen the old horse wandering on the hillside day after day , in search of food , said an old man . <p> " And while the noble steed has no shelter , said his neighbor , his master sits at home , counting his gold. <p> " Bring his master to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they brought him . In silence he waited to hear what the judges would say . <p> " This brave steed of yours , they said , has served you faithfully for many a long year . He has saved your life in times of danger . He has helped you to hoard your bags of gold . Therefore , hear your sentence , O Miser ! Half of your gold shall be taken from you , and used to buy food and shelter for your faithful horse. <p> " The miser hung his head . It made him sad to lose his gold ; but the people laughed and shouted , as the old horse was led away to a comfortable stall and a dinner fit for the steed of a king . " <p> " Hooray ! " cried Don . " Good for the brave old horse ! Grandpa , I 'm so glad you are n't  a miser ! " He was thinking of old Ned , with his sleek , shining black coat . <p> " Bedtime ! " announced Grandma , as she led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childrenand happy dreams to you ! " <h> Bee Loving <p> When the children ran down to meet the mailman in the morning , he handed them another letter from Mother . She and Daddy were going home next Friday , she said ; and they must be there Saturday , to start school on the following Monday . <p> " Only three more nights to be here , " said Joyce , taking the letter in to Grandma . " I want to go home and see Mother and Daddy , but I wish I could stay on the farm , too . " <p> " And only three more stories about bees , " added Don . " We must remember them all , Joyce , so we can tell them to Mother . " <p> " What do you want to do today , children ? " asked Grandma . <p> " After our morning work is done , " said Joyce , with her most grown-up air , " we must finish weeding the flowerbed . " <p> " Grandma , " called Don a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we pulled the weeds yesterday . " <p> Grandma stood a moment thoughtfully looking down at the half-weeded bed of flowers . <p> " Children , " she said suddenly , " If you wanted a flower this morning , where would you pick itin the part of the bed that is full of weeds , or in that patch over there that you have weeded so nicely ? " <p> " I would pick my flower where there are n't  any weeds , " answered Don , wondering why she asked . " I would take that pretty , big red one right over there . " <p> " And so would I ! " declared Joyce , pulling up a stubborn weed . <p> " But why wouldnt you take this one ? " said Grandma , as she parted the weeds and showed another red beauty . <p> " Well , " answered Don , " I spose its just as pretty , but some way the weeds make it look ugly . " <p> " Thats just what I was thinking about , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this flower in the weeds . They had beautiful faces ; but they let the weeds of disobedience , selfishness , deceit , and pride grow all about them until you could not see their beauty for the ugly weeds . <p> " This garden makes me think of two cousins that I knew once . One was obedient , unselfish , and kind to everybody ; and although she did not have a beautiful face , she was loved by all who knew her . The other girl had a beautiful face ; but she had such an unlovely disposition that nobody cared for her , and so she was left very much to herself . Her beauty , like this lovely flower , was quite hidden by the ugly weeds growing up all around her . <p> " These weeds in the flowerbed were very small in the beginning ; but they grew and grew , until now they are taller than the flowers . And the weeds in Gods child-gardens are small at first , too . To begin with , there springs up the weed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not pulled up at once , soon it grows up into a big , ugly lie weed . Other weedsdisobedience , selfishness , and unkindnessspring up around it ; and soon the beautiful flower is hidden by the tall weeds . And when the Master of the Garden wants a lovely flower-child to do a kind deed for Him , He never thinks of choosing one that is surrounded by weeds . " <p> " What a nice story ! " exclaimed Joyce . " But it was n't about a bee , Grandma . " <p> " Yes , it was , " said Don " Do n't  Bee Weedy . " <p> " But there havent been any Do n't  Bees in the stories before , " said Joyce . " Besides , I would n't call that Do n't  Bee Weedy ; I 'd call it Bee Clean . " <p> " Thats a good name for it , " said Grandma . " I hope you 'll always keep your lives clean from the weeds that children so often allow to grow up around them . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set to work weeding the rest of the flowerbed . They were very careful not to pull up any of the flowers with the weeds . When they had finished , the flowerbed looked beautiful , cleared as it was of all weeds and grasses . <p> " I surely do n't  want any ugly weeds to grow in my garden , so I shall always listen to Bee Clean , " said Joyce softly , as she walked slowly toward the house . <p> " Will you make us a kite , Grandpa ? " asked Don after dinner . <p> " Yes , do ! " cried Joyce . " It will be such fun to fly it . " <p> " Well , " said Grandpa , " you children hunt around and find some sticks . Then ask Grandma for some paper and paste and string ; and bring them out to the woodshed , and I 'll try my hand at making a kite . " <p> After it was made , they had to let it lie in the sun for a while , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a soft breeze blowing , and Grandpa said the kite ought to fly . Don took the string and ran along with it for quite a distance . The wind lifted it a little ; but after it had darted back and forth , it fell on the ground . This happened several times , and at last Grandpa said , " Its too bad , children , but my kite wont fly . But I 'll see if I can make something else for you . " <p> Then Grandpa took some thin boards and whittled out darts . He took a short stick , and tied a string to it ; and then he fitted the string in a notch which he had cut in one end of the dart . He threw the dart up in the air , ever so high . It came down just a few yards from Don . The sharp end stuck fast ; and there it stood , upright in the ground . <p> Don was as much pleased with this as he would have been with a kite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darts into the air , to see whose would go the highest . <p> They had so much fun that the afternoon flew by very fast . It was nearly suppertime when Don gathered up the darts and took them to the house with him . He carefully put them away in the little trunk , saying , " I 'll show the boys how to throw darts when I get home . " <p> That evening , as they sat on the porch in the quiet twilight , they heard the faint tinkle of a cowbell in the distance . They talked a while , and then they sang some songs together . <p> " Its story time , is n't it ? " said Grandpa by and by . " And who is going to get stung tonight ? " he asked , winking at Joyce . <p> " I hope I do n't  , " she laughed , remembering the time the bee had stung her on the first day of her visit . <p> " No one shall be stung tonight , " said Grandma . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And because the little girl in my story listened to its buzz , it made honey for her all her life . Its name is Bee Loving ; and it can do things that nothing else in the world can do . You know , people can sometimes be loved into doing things that they could not be persuaded to do in any other way . <p> " Gene was a very little girl who had been left alone in the world . She had never seen her father ; and her mother had died when she was only two and a half . Some kind people had taken care of the little girl when her mother was i 'll ; and when she died , they tried to find her relatives , to ask what should be done with Gene . But they could not find any trace of them . <p> " When Gene was three , these kind people wanted to go away for a couple of weeks , and they asked a lady to take care of the child while they were gone . The lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little children . And so Gene came to stay in the big mansion where the lady , her husband , and grown-up daughter lived . <p> " The ladys husband did not like children very well , and it always annoyed him whenever little Gene came near him . She had a sunny disposition and a very sweet smile , and she tried to make friends with the man ; but he would not pay any attention to her . <p> " He always read his paper in the morning before he went to work , and in the evening after he came home . Little Gene would peep up at him under the paper , with her sweetest smile . He would lay the paper down , and walk away ; but soon he would come back and pick it up and begin to read again . And in a moment , there little Gene would be , peeping up at him again with her lovely smile . <p> " One day when Gene had been living in the home about a week , the man was reading his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . Suddenly he laid the paper aside and took her in his arms . He kissed her on her forehead , saying tenderly , It does n't  matter how hard a man tries to keep from loving you ; you just love your way right into his heart. <p> " Gene threw her small arms about his neck , and laid her curly head on his shoulder , saying in her pretty baby way , Gene wuvs oo , big man. <p> " That completely won his heart ; and when the two weeks had passed and Genes friends came after her , he did not want to give her up . So he decided to keep her and bring her up as if she had been his own little girl . This also pleased his wife and grown-up daughter very much , for they had loved little Gene from the beginning . <p> " Gene is grown now , but she still has the same sunny disposition and the same sweet smile , which make her beloved by all who know her . Nothing but love could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these years . And to this day , Bee Loving is still helping her to win her way through life . The greatest victories are always those that are won through love . " <h> Bee Content <p> " Listen to the mocking bird ! " exclaimed Joyce , early the next morning . " It sounds as if he would burst his throat . Sometimes his song is loud , and then again he whistles softly , like our canary . " <p> As they listened , the bird whistled shrilly , like the cardinal ; then he trilled like the canary , and chirped like the sparrow . He gave a call like the hen quails , and sang a song exactly like the song of the bluebird . Then he twittered like a number of smaller birds , sang the song of the robin , and came back to the whistle of the cardinal . <p> " Did you ever hear such a wonderful song ? " cried Joyce . " I could listen to him all day long . " <p> " I like to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandma ; " but during the night I do n't  enjoy it so much . Last spring the mocking birds built their nest in the same tree where that little fellow is singing now ; and such music , all night long , during the time when they were nesting ! It was beautiful , but it kept me awake many an hour when I should have been sleeping . Mocking birds usually build their nests near houses , to protect themselves from robbers . " <p> " Robbers ! What kind ? " exclaimed Don . <p> " Sometimes larger birds ; and sometimes cats , or snakes . You can always tell when a robber is about , by the fuss the old birds make . Last spring I heard a great commotion in that tree , and I went out to see what was the trouble . I looked about for quite a while before I discovered the nest ; and all the time , the birds were darting here and there and giving their sharp little cries of distress . When at last I found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I got the garden rake and pulled him loose from the limb ; and when he fell to the ground , I killed the cruel thief . " <p> Joyce stepped out into the yard , to get a better look at the little songster as he sat swinging at the top of the old apple tree . Just then he flew across the orchard and down to the creek , alighting among the willows along the bank . <p> That afternoon the children went to the creek , to see if there were any water lilies in bloom . As they neared the clump of willows , Don said , " Let 's be quiet , and see if we can find the mocking bird . " So they walked softly , and talked in whispers ; but they did not catch a glimpse of the lovely songster . Suddenly Don stopped and pointed to a big green frog sitting on a lily pad in the middle of the creek . <p> " Oh-h-h ! " exclaimed Joyce . Instantly there was a splash , and the frog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other frogs disappeared in the water . <p> The children hid behind the willows , and waited quietly for some time . Soon they saw a big green fellow swim toward the lily pad and climb up on it . Others began to swim about in the water , and a number of them came out along the bank . <p> Suddenly Joyce caught sight of something else , which made her forget the frogs . Just beyond the spot where the frog sat perched on a lily pad , there was a lovely water lily in bloom . <p> " Oh , Don , " she whispered , " do you think we can get it ? " <p> " I 'd rather have the frog than the lily , " answered Don . <p> " Yes , but you cant get him , you know , " said Joyce . " Will you help me to get to the lily ? " <p> Don nodded , and came out from behind the willows where he had been crouching . Instantly there was another splash , and Mr. Froggy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen anywhere . <p> To get the lily , the children had to cross the creek and then step out on an old log . The creek was so shallow that they knew there was no danger of drowning , even if they should fall into the water ; so Joyce steadied the log with her hands , while Don stood on it and reached for the lily . It took him some time to get it , for it had a tough stem which was very hard to break . But Joyce was so pleased when he handed her the beautiful lily , that he felt repaid for all his trouble . <p> About three oclock the children found some empty spools and went to the corner of the orchard , and sat down in the cool shade of the lilac bush . Soon they were blowing many-colored bubbles and flying them in the air . <p> Tabby , Grandmas pretty Maltese cat , lay curled up in the shade . One of Dons bubbles lit on her back , and then burst . By and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old cat jumped to her feet and began to sneeze . Then she sat down and washed her face with her paw , as if to say , " Thank you , I 'd rather wash my face without any soap . " <p> That evening , as they sat on the porch , Joyce said a little sadly , " It will not be long now before we shall hear the noisy street cars again , instead of the katydids and whippoorwills . Only one more night after this , and we shall be home . " <p> " Yes , " added Don , " only two more stories about the bees . " He clambered up on to the arm of Grandmas rocking chair , while Joyce sat down at her feet . <p> " Were ready for our story , Grandma , " said Don . <p> " All right , " answered Grandma . " I shall tell you this time about a little bee called Bee Content . Its buzz is often heard among children at play , when things happen that no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so they complain and make everyone about them miserable . <p> " Willie was a poor boy who lived on a farm . Although he had to work hard , helping his father , he always went about whistling or singing . His clothes were old and patched ; and he did not have things to play with , as other boys have . But he did not mind being poor , because he had parents who loved him dearly . <p> " One day when Willie was working in the field , he looked up and saw a great cloud of dust . A team was running away . The horses were hitched to a buggy ; and as they came rushing toward him , the thought flashed into Willies mind that he must try his best to stop them . A short distance down the road , there was a bridge . If the horses should run into the railing , he thought , they would tear the buggy to pieces , and perhaps hurt themselves. <p> " The boy leaped over the fence , and braced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed one by the bridle and held on tightly . This was a very brave thing to do ; for if he had missed catching hold , he might have been thrown under the horses hoofs and trampled to death . His weight swinging on the horses bridle soon stopped the team . <p> " Soon a man came running along the highway ; and when he learned what Willie had done , he said , You are a brave boy . What do I owe you for your trouble ? <p> " Willie smiled his friendly smile as he answered , I did not stop the horses for pay , sir . I thought of the railing on the bridge ; and I was afraid the horses would break the buggy , and hurt themselves. <p> " Noticing that Willies clothes were badly worn , the gentleman said , Will you not let me give you some money to buy clothes ? <p> " I have a better pair of shoes than theseand a better suit of clothes , for Sundays , answered Willie . And these clothes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need some new books for school this fall , said the gentleman . <p> " I have some books that were given to me , replied the lad ; and Mother glued in the loose leaves , so that I can use them very well , thank you. <p> " Wouldnt you like to have a ball and bat ? <p> " I made a ball from some old wool that Mother gave me , answered Willie ; and I whittled out a bat which answers the purpose very well. <p> " The gentleman laid his hand on Willies shoulder , saying kindly , My boy , I understand now why you have that smile ; for you have learned a secret which few people knowthe secret of contentment . I shall have to call you The Contented Boy. And with that , he drove away . <p> " A few days later , a large box came to the village , addressed to Willie . The express agent sent word out to the farm , and Willies father drove in to the village to get it . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card lying on top on which were written the words : To the Contented Boy , From a Grateful Friend and Debtor . He knew then that the box had come from the man whose team he had stopped a few days before . <p> " It contained a new suit of clothes , some shirts , overalls , stockings , a warm cap and mittens , and a new baseball and bat . When he lifted out the overcoat he felt in the pockets and discovered a five-dollar bill . <p> " How pleased Willie was ! As he went back to his work in the field , he whistled more cheerily than before . <p> " But that was not all . At Christmas time , a wonderful bicycle came from his new friend . You will believe me when I tell you that he was the happiest boy in the country . " <p> " Thats the best story you have told us yet , " said Don . " I think Willie was a brave boy . " <p> " And he deserved everything he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secret of being content with a very little . " <h> Bee Prayerful <p> Another morning came ; the morning of the last day Joyce and Don were to spend on the farm . They followed Grandma about the house , eager to do something to help . After the usual work was done , and they had taken turns at the churning , Grandma said she would make cookies to pack in their lunch basket the next day . <p> So she gathered together eggs , sugar , flour , milk , butter , baking powder , and spices . Quickly she made the dough and rolled it out on the board . The children stood close to her watching as she cut out the dough in different shapes . <p> She made quite an army of cookie men ; and after they were baked , she covered them with icing . She made their eyes out of cinnamon drops ; also the buttons down their vests . <p> " Are n't  they lovely ? " cried Joyce . " Put plenty of them in our lunch basket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take some home to Mother and Daddy . " <p> " Yes , " said Grandma , " and there will be enough for your little friends , too . " <p> In the afternoon the childrens trunk was brought out , and Grandma helped them to pack . There were so many things they wanted to take home with them , that this was quite a task . At the last moment , just as Grandma was ready to close the trunk , Don ran and got the kite that Grandpa had made . " Maybe Daddy will know how to make it fly , " he said . But there was no room for it in the trunk , so he had to take it back to the woodshed . <p> " I can put it away in a safe place , " he said . " It will be waiting for us when we come back next summer . " <p> That evening the children did all they could to help Grandpa with the chores . They gathered the eggs , pumped water , filled the wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are certainly fine little helpers , " said Grandpa when they had finished . <p> " When you get home , " added Grandma with a smile , " you must tell Mother and Daddy that we need you to help us on the farm . " <p> " We will , " promised the children with beaming faces . <p> When they had gathered on the porch for their last evening together , Joyce stole up to Grandmas chair and said softly , " Tonight you must tell us the very best bee story that you know . " <p> " It couldnt be better than the one about Bee Content , " said Don . <p> " I shall tell you about the bee that is perhaps the most important of all , " said Grandma thoughtfully . " It does wonderful things for those who listen to its buzz ; but those who refuse to listen are sure to be sorry afterward . It is called Bee Prayerful . " The children were eager to hear the story , so Grandma began at once : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of Maryland . When he was thirteen years old , he gave his heart to God and became a Christian . After that he would often go off alone and spend a few minutes talking to God . <p> " When he was fourteen , Willie began to work in the bank as an errand boy . The banker soon found that he was honest , and trusted him with large sums of money . One of his errands was to carry the payroll to a mill town several miles away . He made this trip every two weeks ; and he always set out in the afternoon , and returned the following morning . <p> " There were no automobiles in those days , and no good roads . William had to ride a pony , leaving the main highway and riding over a trail that had been blazed through the forest . <p> " As he started out one afternoon , his mother said to him , Son , I 'm afraid to have you carry so much money over that lonely trail. <p> " Oh , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad cheerfully , as he swung into the saddle . You know I have always made the trip safely before. <p> " Yes , replied the good woman , but I feel fearful today . I shall be praying for you while you are on your way. <p> " William waved to her , as he turned his pony about and started on his journey . He had placed the payroll in his saddle bags ; and as he looked at them he said to himself , How glad I am that my master trusts me with so much money. <p> " He whistled and sang , as he rode along ; but as he neared the lonely forest trail , a strange feeling of fear came over him . He reined in his pony and sat still for some time , wondering just what he ought to do . Then Bee Prayerful began to buzz about his ears . He had heard its little voice many times before , and he had learned always to listen and obey . He rode on to the spot where he must leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he slipped from the saddle and knelt down beside the bushes growing there . <p> " Dear God , he said aloud , I do n't  know why , but I feel very much afraid . Take care of me , as I ride through this lonely place . I believe You will , because You have written in Your Book , " I will never leave thee , nor forsake thee . " * ( Hebrews 13:5 ) <p> " And as William knelt there , alone with God , all feeling of fear melted away . He arose , mounted his pony , and rode on with a light heart . <p> " The mill men knew he was coming , for they could hear his cheerful whistle before his pony came into view . He gave the payroll to the foreman , spent the night in the little town , and the next forenoon returned safely to his home . <p> " His mother met him at the door . Son , she said , something peculiar happened to me yesterday while you were away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to tell me that I ought to stop my work and pray for you . I felt that you were in danger , and that I should ask God to keep you safe . So I laid my work aside , went into my room and knelt down , and stayed there until I was sure that you were quite safe. <p> " Then William told her how he had felt just before he reached the lonely forest trail , and how he had knelt down among the bushes and asked God to protect him . After that , they often talked about this strange happening , and wondered what it could mean . <p> " William worked in the bank for quite a long while , and then he went away to college . After he had graduated , he became a minister . Soon after this , God called away his good mother to her home in Heaven . <p> " One day William received a letter stamped with the postmark of a town in a distant state . I am very i 'll , said the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must see you , as I have something very important to tell you before I am called away to meet my God . Please come to me as quickly as possible. There was no name written at the end of the letter . It was signed , A friend. <p> " William turned the letter over and over in his hand . He knew no one in that faraway place , and for a time he was very much puzzled . Then he did as he had been in the habit of doing for many yearshe slipped away to spend a few moments alone with God . And a voice in his heart kept saying , Go ; someone is in need , and your work is to minister to every soul who asks for help. <p> " But whom shall I ask for , when I arrive ? asked William , still perplexed . And the voice answered , Only go ; God will take care of the rest. <p> " Hastily packing a few things in his traveling bag , William boarded a train and started for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of his journey , he stepped out upon the station platform . He was astonished when a gentleman came up to him and said courteously , Is this Reverend Sutherland ? <p> " Yes , replied the minister , I am he. <p> " I have been sent to meet you , sir , said the stranger . I have met every train during the past week . Will you come with me ? <p> " A few minutes later , he led the minister into a darkened room where a sick man lay . As they tiptoed into the room , he looked up eagerly , and his breath came fast . Holding out his hand , he asked in a feeble voice , Is this Reverend Sutherland ? <p> " It is , said the minister gently , clasping the thin white hand . Where have I met you before , my friendand what can I do for you now ? <p> " You have never met me before , said the sick man , and his voice sank to a whisper . I saw you only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have kept track of your whereabouts all these years . I have sent for you now , sir , becauseI am dying. <p> " The sick man sank back upon his pillows and rested a moment ; then , fixing his large eyes on the ministers face , he went on : <p> " Mr. Sutherland , one afternoon many years ago you were entrusted with a large sum of money to take to the foreman of a certain mill . In a wild and lonely spot , you slipped from your saddle and knelt down by some bushes and asked God to protect you . Do you remember it ? <p> " As if it had been yesterday , said the minister . But , my good friend , what do you know about it ? <p> " Far more than you know , said the sick man , sadly . I heard that prayer . I was crouching among the bushes nearby , with my rifle pointed at your heart . I had planned to kill you , take the money , and ride away on your pony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ; I did not know what it was , but I believed that God had sent it to protect you . I sat in those bushes , too weak to pull the trigger , and watched you ride awayperfectly helpless to do any harm to you . But it has haunted me ever sincethe thought of what I wanted to do , and what I should have done if God had not answered your prayer . I could not meet God without telling you all this . Can you forgive me ? <p> " Again William grasped the hand of the dying man , saying in a husky voice , My friend , as God has forgiven my sins , I freely forgive you . Ask now for Gods forgiveness , and be at peace. <p> " The minister stayed with the man for some time , talking and praying with him ; until at last the light shone in his dark soul , and God forgave his sins . <p> " He died soon after that , and William Sutherland was asked to preach his funeral sermon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he shall direct thy paths.* ( Proverbs 3:5-6 ) " <p> The children sat very still for some time , after Grandma had finished her story . " I think Bee Prayerful is the best of all , " said Joyce at last . " I shall remember that story as long as I live . " <p> " I hope you will , dear , " said Grandma . " No matter where you gono matter how busy you arealways listen to the gentle buzz of Bee Prayerful . " <p> " We will , Grandma , " said the children soberly . <p> " And now , " said Grandma , " it is bedtime for two little folks who will have to be up bright and early in the morning . You know the train leaves at eight oclock . " <p> " Good night , katydids and whippoorwills , " murmured Don a little drowsily . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> With that , two tired children crept upstairs and tumbled into bed ; and very soon they were in the Land of Dreams . <h> Home Again <p> The sunlight was streaming in at their bedroom windows , when Joyce and Don awoke the next morning . They dressed quickly , and ran down to watch Grandma pack their lunch for the trip home . At the breakfast table , they talked of all the nice times they had had during the past few weeks ; and they promised to persuade Mother and Daddy to come with them to the farm next summer . <p> When everything was ready , Grandpa lifted the little trunk to his shoulder and carried it out to the car ; and soon they were on their way . When they reached the station Grandpa bought the tickets , checked the little trunk , and gave the children a story book to read on the train . Dear Grandpa and Grandma ! They always knew just what to do to make the children happy . <p> As the train whistled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joyce threw her arms around Grandma and whispered , " Dear Grandma , I love you ! And I 've had such a happy time ! " <p> The train pulled up , and the conductor called , " All aboard ! " After Grandpa had helped them on to the train , and had gone back to the station platform , the children waved and threw kisses through the window . As the train moved away , they pressed their faces to the window and watched Grandpa and Grandma as long as they could . But they soon were left behind , the train moved faster , and the little village passed out of sight . Happy vacation days on the farm had come to an end . <p> For a few moments the children had to fight to keep back the tears . Then Joyce opened the book that Grandpa had given them , and soon their loneliness was forgotten . <p> There was a story about a little lame dog that came to a mans house one cold winter night and whined about the door . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it some food and a comfortable place to sleep . <p> The man liked the dog so well that he decided to keep it . One night , when everyone was asleep , the house caught fire ; and the dog awakened the man in time to save the whole family from burning to death . <p> There were stories about cows and horses ; and a long , long one about the interesting animals to be seen at the zoo . <p> One story was so funny that when Don read it , he burst out laughing ; and the other passengers looked at him and smiled . It was about a mischievous monkey at the zoo . One day a gentleman who wore a wig came by , carrying his hat in his hand . The monkey reached through the bars and caught hold of the wig , pulling it off his head . <p> When it was time for lunch , Joyce opened the basket that Grandma had packed for them . They spread out a napkin on the seat in front of them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most grown-up fashion . Grandma had tucked in several surprises ; and how good the cookie men tasted ! <p> In the middle of the afternoon they began to pass through the suburbs of the city , and soon familiar sights came into view . When the train backed into the station , there stood Mother and Daddy waiting for them . <p> " Oh , Mother , " cried Joyce with a bear hug , " I 've had a good time , but I 'm so glad to see you again ! " Don , big boy that he was , had jumped into Daddys arms . Soon the little trunk had been placed in the car , and they were driving toward home . <p> " What did you enjoy most of all , during your vacation ? " asked Mother , as they were eating supper that evening . <p> " Fishing , " replied Don quickly . <p> Joyce did not answer ; she sat quite still , with a far-away look in her eyes . <p> " And what did my little girl like best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Mother , " said Joyce , her eyes shining , " I was happy every minuteeven when the old turkey gobbler was chasing me around the tree . But what I liked best was to sit out on the porch in the evenings , and listen to the katydids and whippoorwills , and watch the stars come out one by one . And then it was so nice to sit close to Grandmas old rocking chair and listen to her stories about the Hive of Busy Bees . "

@@72205160 @905160/ you with meekness and fear . " * ( 1 Peter 3:15 ) <p> Let me state at the outset that we will not be abusive . But inasmuch as the writer has prayerfully and impartially weighed the matter , mingled with and preached occasionally for Pentecostal people in this and foreign countries for nearly thirty years , we ought to come to a conclusion and be ready to give a " reason " for either accepting or rejecting the movement in part or as a whole . <p> We do not for one moment deny that there is a gift of tongues , for the Word plainly states that there is . One might as well deny the other gifts of the Spirit as to deny this one . We who claim to be thoroughly Biblical must be careful lest , in denouncing error , we become harsh and grieve the Holy Spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denounce the entire Tongues movement as of the devil . I have found some of these people nearer heaven than some who oppose them . <p> Yes , I am a strong believer in speaking in tongues . In fact , we go further than most of those in the movement . For while they hold that only one class ( those who have received their Baptism ) speak in tongues , we hold that there are at least three classes : <p> ( 1 ) Those who have the genuine thing as they had at Pentecost ; where " multitudes " of " every nation " are " confounded " because they hear and understand in their " own tongue . " We would welcome such a manifestation . <p> ( 2 ) A second class speak in tongues , but are evidently like those in the church at Corinth " yet carnal , " * ( 1 Corinthians 3:3 ) They have some grace with more or less carnality . I have listened reverently while they uttered somethingno one knew what . But since there was no interpreter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor did unbelievers fall down on their faces and worship God ( 1 Corinthians 14:25 ) . Therefore , I fear it was a cheap imitation of the real gift . <p> ( 3 ) A third class are those who are entirely void of grace . They are those particularly bright stars who attract attention and have great gifts ; they are borne on in a gale and overwhelm by their eloquence . Like a meteor , they blaze and flare out with bold confidence and sometimes vehemence . Yet these same enthusiasts are unkind at home , unclean in private life , and unscrupulous in money matters . Hence they are without saving grace . That which appears supernatural about them is in reality demoniacal and from beneath . More will be said of this later . <p> In this discussion we do not have time to treat fully the doctrinal phase of the subject , but wish to quote from an " Open Letter " by one of the former leaders in the Pentecostal movement , F. F. Bosworth : <p> After eleven years in the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pleasure to see thousands receive the precious Baptism in the Holy Spirit , I am absolutely certain that many do not receive the manifestation of speaking in tongues . And I am just as certain , on the other hand , that many who seemingly speak in tongues , are not , nor ever have been , baptized in the Spirit . <p> The day of Pentecost witnessed the grandest and most effective display of the gift of tongues that the world has ever seen . Gods purpose was that it should be " a sign , " * ( 1 Corinthians 14:22 ) not to believers , but to the unbelieving Jews dwelling at Jerusalem " out of every nation under heaven .

He so loves and enjoys adding to his heavenly store that he is eagerly seizing upon every opportunity for the making of such addition . No miser ever counted his gold with such joy as the Christian reflects upon his riches in glory . But how different the nature of the joy . The one is " earthly , sensual , devilish , " * ( James 3:15 ) while the other is heavenly . How sweet , how blessed the joy ! No man in his earthly pursuits manifests such interest and eagerness as the saint in his heavenly pursuits .

No earthly-minded man meditates with such complacency , in the waking hours of the night upon his bed , of earthly things as the saint finds in meditating upon heavenly things . Note the great delight the psalm singer found in meditating upon God in the night watches ( Psalm 63:6 ) . Is this the measure of our life and enjoyment ?

One was a man who sought and gained the riches of the world . The other was a man who sought the kingdom of God and His righteousness . These men were both brought down upon their dying beds the same week . When the rich man was spoken to concerning the future of himself and his neighbor , he said , " I am leaving my treasures , but my neighbor is going to his .

What Jesus tells us to do is the wisest thing to do . Some act like they thought they knew what was better for them more than Jesus did . The reason why it is better to lay up treasures in heaven than on earth is because " where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .

Do not turn to your bank account or your broad acres to see what you are worth . Look into your character . We say with emphasis that no man can build up a Christian character and not do all he can with his means to advance Gods cause . <p> Having the heart in heaven is the secret of living heavenly .

The tribute money the Israelite was obliged to give , but the money here spoken of was the money that he had in his heart to give . It was this money given out of the heart that was precious to God .

They do not mean that we should not be the legal owner of a single thing on earth . Such being the case , a man could never have anything to give . Neither does it mean that a man can not have legal ownership of a considerable portion of this worlds goods ; but it does mean that whatever a man may possess in a legal way he has to hold such , not as his own , but in trust for the Lord , so that if the Lord calls for the last penny , he will not go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about dwelling deep in God and living close to Him . He who holds all his earthly possessions in such a manner that he can hear the faintest call of God for any part or all of it , and give it up to God with a willing and glad heart , dwells very near to the Lord . This is one of the best tests of nearness to God . When we dwell deep in God , whatever earthly store we hold in possession , we hold it not for its own sake , but because we are fully assured we can glorify God more by possessing it than by not possessing it . But how careful we need to be at this point lest the flesh deceive us . Have there not been those who have said , " I believe it is pleasing to God for me to possess this , " when it was only the flesh that is pleased . The flesh is a great reasoner .

One thing is certain , when we are enjoying such nearness to God , we will not be gathering earthly store around us and yet doing very little for the Lord . The Bible says that " God loveth a cheerful giver . " * ( 2 Corinthians 9:7 ) There is no better measure of mans love to God than his giving . Those who love the Lord are known to be liberal givers .

Just the extent of this treasure we do not know , but of this we are assured : every penny you give out of sincere love to God ennobles your soul and gives you a greater capacity for enjoying heaven . Herein is a great treasure . There is never a word spoken , nor a deed done that is lost . We are never the same after speaking a word or doing a deed . The words we speak and the deeds we do make us more or less like Christ , and fit or unfit us more for heaven . Listen to the unto you , he shall no wise lose his reward .

" * ( Romans 8:14 ) Our vision , perception , or discernment of the Lords body will be proportionate according to our fellowship and communion with the Lord in the Spirit .

The voice of a seducing spirit desensitizes ones spiritual ears to the voice of the divine Spirit . A spiritual illusion then takes place . Spiritual landmarks that were once clear by virtue of the eye salve of the Holy Spirits anointing , become foggy and dim . Understanding that was once revealed to the inner man by divine inspiration begins to give way to human reasoning and philosophical criticism . Sacred standards and boundaries that were once perceived clearly begin to move or disappear . The voice of the seducing spirit now reveals doctrine from a different perspective , in a " new light , " suggesting to the mind a different slant or interpretation of the scriptures . The illusive spirit may even produce an emotional high to accompany that new light . But yet the fruit of that new light is " variance " and " discord , " which Gods Word declares to be " works of the flesh " * ( Galatians 5:19-21 ) and " an abomination .

Therefore " grieve not the holy Spirit of God , whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption . " * ( Ephesians 4:30 ) Any work of the flesh or unholy provision we make for the flesh grieves the holy Spirit of God and will break the seal of our redemption if not repented of . <p> The divine Spirit always brings His subjects under one government , into one body that conveys the essence of Christ in a visible manner and not after Christ .

And ye are complete in Him , which is the Head of all principality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely as there exists the Holy Spirit and other opposing spirits , so there also exists the Lords body and other opposing bodies . Every religious group , unit , or corporation is animated and united by some kind of religious spirit . Just as the Holy Spirit animates all who are led by Him , uniting them into one corporate body and making them partakers of the fullness of the Godhead in Christ , so other spirits also unite those who are led by them into corporate bodies , units , or groups , making them partakers of the essence of what they are all about . Each schismatic group pivots on some point of theology or ideology . The animation of each is the spirit that promotes whatever " heresy " or area of doctrine or practice it has been seduced in . The words " heresy " and " sect " come from the same Greek word , hairesis , which literally means " a choice , a party , or disunion .

God wants none of His children to have any connection or identification with any heresy , sect , or schism . To do so is to grieve the Holy Spirit and make ones soul vulnerable to other spirits . <p> A common approach to religion is , " It does n't  really matter what group you fellowship with just as long as you love and serve the Lord . " Beware ! Is that a Bible doctrine , or is it part of a deceitful , humanistic philosophy ? Is that not the same as saying you can choose to fellowship any schism , sect , or heresy you please and still serve the Lord ? Your choice in this matter will mean the difference in whether or not you attain to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ .

" And it is the Spirit that beareth witness , because the Spirit is truth . " * ( 1 John 5:6 ) <p> in the world . " * ( 1 John 3:24-4:3 ) <p> This is how we can tell whether or not a spirit is in harmony with Gods Spirit : If it confesses through its manifestation in human flesh an identity with the life of Christ , in all humility , holiness , denying ungodliness and worldly lusts ( which is what the anointing of the true Spirit of grace teaches us Titus 2:11-12 ) , and in keeping unspotted from the world ( James 1:27 ) , then we know this is by the influence of the real Spirit of God . But if a spirit manifests evidences of carnality and self-interest , a love for the things of the world , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition to reason around the requirements or the principles of the scriptures , or to put any confidence in human wisdom , we know that this spirit is not of God , but is a spirit of antichrist . Whoever is not joined to the Lord in one spirit ( 1 might be made manifest in his body , " * ( 2 Corinthians 4:10 ) is not confessing that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh , and therefore can not be identified as part of His true body . " They that are Christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. " * ( Galatians 5:24 ) They identify as real " members of His flesh , and of His bones " * ( Ephesians 5:30 ) because they are crucified with Him ( Galatians 2:20 ; 6:14 ) . They are dead , and their life is hid with Christ in God ( Colossians 3:3 ; 2 Corinthians 4:11 ) . @ @ who mind earthly things . " * ( Philippians 3:18-19 ) Peter said , " For when they speak great swelling words of vanity , they allure through the lusts of the flesh , through much wantonness , those that were clean escaped from them who live in error . While they promise them liberty , they themselves are the servants of corruption : for of whom a man is overcome , of the same is he brought in bondage. " * ( 2 Peter 2:18-19 ) Whoever chooses to give liberty to the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , or the pride of life will certainly be brought in bondage to corruption and will imbibe a spirit of antichrist . The apostle John , after warning against the love of the world and the things that are in the they were not all of us.

" * ( Jude 19 ) <p> Just as the human body rejects foreign material , so does Christs spiritual body . Physically speaking , our bodies will not retain a substance that is foreign to their own composition . Also , our bodies release and eliminate all dead cells . The body has no use for those cells that are no longer receiving the nourishment that flows through the blood . They die and the body disposes of them by natural process .

The Holy Spirit is like the blood that flows through the body and feeds and replenishes all the living cells . The Holy Spirit feeds every living cell of Christs body , the Church , the very substance of Christ . " This I say then , Walk in the Spirit , and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh .

The seeker after holiness is told that he must consecrate himself ; and he endeavors to do so . But at once he meets with a difficulty . He has done it , as he thinks , and yet does not feel differently from before ; nothing seems changed , as he has been led to expect it would be , and he is completely baffled , and asks the question almost despairingly , " How am I to know when I am consecrated ? " <p> The one grand temptation which has met such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fails to assert itself on every possible occasion , and generally with marked success , and that is in reference to feeling . The soul can not believe it is consecrated until it feels that it is ; and because it does not feel that God has taken it in hand , it can not believe that He has . As usual , it puts feeling first and faith second . Now , Gods invariable rule is faith first and feeling second , in everything ; and it is striving against the inevitable when we seek to make it different . <p> The way to meet this temptation , then , in reference to consecration , is simply to take Gods side in the matter , and to put faith before feeling . Give yourself to the Lord definitely and fully , according to your present light , asking the Holy Spirit to show you all that is contrary to God , either in your heart or life . If He shows you anything , give it to the Lord immediately , and say in reference to it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , then you must believe that there is nothing , and must conclude that you have given Him all . Then you must believe that He takes you . You positively must not wait to feel either that you have given yourself or that He has taken you . You must simply believe it , and reckon it to be the case . <p> If you were to give an estate to a friend , you would have to give it , and he would have to receive it by faith . An estate is not a thing that can be picked up and handed over to another ; the gift of it and its reception are altogether a mental transaction and therefore one of faith . Now , if you should give an estate one day to a friend , and then should go away and wonder whether you really had given it , and whether he had actually taken it and considered it his own , and should feel it necessary to go the next day and renew the gift ; and if on the third day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should again go and renew the gift , and on the fourth day go through a like process , and so on , day after day for months and years , what would your friend think , and what at last would be the condition of your own mind in reference to it ? Your friend certainly would begin to doubt whether you ever had intended to give it to him at all ; and you yourself would be in such hopeless perplexity about it , that you would not know whether the estate was yours , or his , or whose it was . <p> Now , is not this very much the way in which you have been acting towards God in this matter of consecration ? You have given yourself to Him over and over daily , perhaps for months , but you have invariably come away from your seasons of consecration wondering whether you really have given yourself after all , and whether He has taken you ; and because you have not felt any differently , you have concluded at last , after many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you know , dear believer , that this sort of perplexity will last forever , unless you cut it short by faith ? You must come to the point of reckoning the matter to be an accomplished and settled thing , and leaving it there , before you can possibly expect any change of feeling what ever . <p> The very law of offerings to the Lord settles this as a primary fact , that everything which is given to Him becomes by that very act something holy , set apart from all other things , and can not without sacrilege be put to any other uses . " Notwithstanding no devoted thing , that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath , both of man and beast , and of the field of his possession , shall be sold or redeemed : every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD . " * ( Leviticus 27:28 ) Having once given it to the Lord , the devoted thing henceforth was reckoned by all Israel as being the Lords , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The giver might have made his offering very grudgingly and half-heartedly , but having made it , the matter was taken out of his hands altogether , and the devoted thing by Gods own law became " most holy unto the LORD . " <p> It was not the intention of the giver that made it holy , but the holiness of the receiver . " The altar sanctifies the gift . " And an offering once laid upon the altar , from that moment belonged to the Lord . I can imagine an offerer who had deposited a gift , beginning to search his heart as to his sincerity and honesty in doing it , and coming back to the priest to say that he was afraid after all he had not given it right , or had not been perfectly sincere in giving it . I feel sure that the priest would have silenced him at once with saying , " As to how you gave your offering , or what were your motives in giving it , I do not know . The facts are that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lords , for every devoted thing is most holy unto Him . It is too late to recall the transaction now . " And not only the priest but all Israel would have been aghast at the man who , having once given his offering , should have reached out his hand to take it back . And yet , day after day , earnest-hearted Christians , who would have shuddered at such an act of sacrilege on the part of a Jew , are guilty in their own experience of a similar act , by giving themselves to the Lord in solemn consecration , and then through unbelief taking back that which they have given . <p> Because God is not visibly present to the eye , it is difficult to feel that a transaction with Him is real . I suppose if , when we made our acts of consecration , we could actually see Him present with us , we should feel it to be a very real thing , and would realize that we had given our word to Him and could not dare to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so . Such a transaction would have to us the binding power that a spoken promise to an earthly friend always has to a man of honor . And what we need is to see that Gods presence is a certain fact always , and that every act of our soul is done right before Him , and that a word spoken in prayer is as really spoken to Him , as if our eyes could see Him and our hands could touch Him . Then we shall cease to have such vague conceptions of our relations with Him , and shall feel the binding force of every word we say in His presence . <p> I know some will say here , " Ah , yes ; but if He would only speak to me , and say that He took me when I gave myself to Him , I would have no trouble then in believing it . " No , of course you would not ; but He does not generally say this until the soul has first proved its loyalty by believing what He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the witness , not he that doubteth . And by His very command to us to present ourselves to Him a living sacrifice , He has pledged Himself to receive us . I can not conceive of an honorable man asking another to give him a thing which , after all , he was doubtful about taking ; still less can I conceive of a loving parent acting so towards a darling child . " My son , give me thine heart , " * ( Proverbs 23:26 ) is a sure warrant for knowing that the moment the heart is given , it will be taken by the One who has commanded the gift . We may , nay we must , feel the utmost confidence then that when we surrender ourselves to the Lord , according to His own command , He does then and there receive us , and from that moment we are His . A real transaction has taken place , which can not be violated without dishonor on our part , and which we know will not be violated by Him . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy God , and to walk in his ways , and to keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his judgments , and to hearken unto his voice : And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people , as he hath promised thee , and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God , as he hath spoken . " <p> When we avouch the Lord to be our God , and that we will walk in His ways and keep His commandments , He avouches us to be His , and that we shall keep all His commandments . And from that moment He takes possession of us . This has always been His principle of working , and it continues to be so . " Every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD . " * ( Leviticus 26:27 ) This seems to me so plain as scarcely to admit of a question . <p> But if the soul still feels in doubt or difficulty , let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject from a different side , but which settles it , I think , quite as definitely . It is in 1 John we desired of him . " Is it according to His will that you should be entirely consecrated to Him ? There can be , of course , but one answer to this , for He has commanded it . Is it not also according to His will that He should work in you to will and to do of His good pleasure ? This question also can have but one answer , for He has declared it to be His purpose . You know , then , that these things are according to His will , therefore on Gods own word you are obliged to know that He hears you ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and know that you have the petitions that you have desired of Him . That you have , I saynot will have , or may havebut have now in actual possession . It is thus that we " obtain promises " by faith ( Hebrews 11:33 ) . It is thus that we have " access by faith " into the grace that is given us in our Lord Jesus Christ ( Romans 5:2 ) . It is thus , and thus only , that we come to know our hearts are " purified by faith , " and are enabled to live by faith , to stand by faith , to walk by faith . <p> I desire to make this subject so plain and practical that no one need have any further difficulty about it , and therefore I will repeat again just what must be the acts of your soul in order to bring you out of this difficulty about consecration . <p> I suppose that you have trusted the Lord Jesus for the forgiveness of your sins , and know something of what it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made an heir of God through faith in Christ . And now you feel springing up in your soul the longing to be conformed to the image of your Lord . In order for this , you know there must be an entire surrender of yourself to Him , that He may work in you all the good pleasure of His will ; and you have tried over and over to do it , but hitherto without any apparent success . <p> At this point it is that I desire to help you . What you must do now is to come once more to Him in a surrender of your whole self to His will , as complete as you know how to make it . You must ask Him to reveal to you by His Spirit any hidden rebellion ; and if He reveals nothing , then you must believe that there is nothing , and that the surrender is complete . This must , then , be considered a settled matter . You have abandoned yourself to the Lord , and from henceforth you do not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much as listen to a suggestion to the contrary . If the temptation comes to wonder whether you really have completely surrendered yourself , meet it with an assertion that you have . Do not even argue the matter . Repel any such idea instantly and with decision . You meant it then , you mean it now , you have really done it . Your emotions may clamor against the surrender , but your will must hold firm . It is your purpose God looks at , not your feelings about that purpose , and your purpose , or will , is therefore the only thing you need attend to . <p> The surrender , then , having been made , never to be questioned or recalled , the next point is to believe that God takes that which you have surrendered , and to reckon that it is His . Not that it will be at some future time , but is now ; and that He has begun to work in you " to will and to do of his good pleasure . " * ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing more for you to do , for you are the Lords now , absolutely and entirely in His hands , and He has undertaken the whole care and management and forming of you ; and will , according to His word , work in you " that which is wellpleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ . " * ( Hebrews 13:21 ) But you must hold steadily here . If you begin to question your surrender , or Gods acceptance of it , then your wavering faith will produce a wavering experience , and He can not work . But while you trust He works , and the result of His working always is to change you into the image of Christ , from glory to glory , by His mighty Spirit . <p> Do you , then , now at this moment surrender yourself wholly to Him ? You answer , Yes . Then , my dear friend , begin at once to reckon that you are His ; that He has taken you , and that He is working in you " to will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep on reckoning this . You will find it a great help to put your reckoning into words , and to say over and over to yourself and to your God , " Lord , I am Thine ; I do yield myself up to Thee entirely , and I believe thatTthou dost take me . I leave myself with Thee . Work in me all the good pleasure of Thy will , and I will only lie still in Thy hands , and trust Thee . " <p> Make this a daily definite act of your will , and many times a day recur to it , as being your continual attitude before Him . Confess it to yourself . Confess it to your God . Confess it to your friends . Avouch the Lord to be your God continually and unwaveringly , and declare your purpose of walking in His ways and keeping His statutes ; and you will find in practical experience that He has avouched you to be His peculiar people and that you shall keep all His commandments , and that you will be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hath spoken .

I would advise the use of them in daily times of devotion , making them the definite test and attitude of the soul , until the light shines clearly on this matter . <p> I. Express in definite words your faith in Christ as your Savior ; and acknowledge definitely that you believe He has reconciled you to God ( 2 Corinthians 5:18-19 ) . <p> III . Definitely surrender yourself to be all the Lords , body , soul , and spirit ; and to obey Him in everything where His will is made known ( Romans 12:12 ) . <p> IV . Believe and continue to believe , against all seemings , that God takes possession of that which you thus abandon to Him , and that He will henceforth work in you to will and to do of His good pleasure , unless you consciously frustrate His grace ( 2 Corinthians 6:17-18 ; Philippians 2:13 ) . <p> V. Pay no attention to your feelings as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend to the state of your will and of your faith . And count all these steps you are now taking as settled , though the enemy may make it seem otherwise ( Hebrews 10:22-38 ) . <p> VI .

Remember , that all discouragement is from the devil , and refuse to admit it ( John 14:1,27 ) . <p> VII . Cultivate the habit of expressing your faith in definite words , and repeat often , " I am all the Lords and He is working in me now to will and to do of His good pleasure " ( Hebrews 13:21 ) .

God conditions salvation among the lost on the spiritual life of the churchand a very high plane at that . And yet these leaders of the people deliberately ignore what the Divine Being says about the matter and would have judgment commence among the lost when the Lord says it must begin at the House of God ( 1 Peter 4:17 ) . <p> God still has His true prophets and evangelists who observe the divine requirement and insist upon the Upper Room experience for the church , before conversions can be expected in the streets as at the day of Pentecost .

Then , and not until then , did the revival break out in the streets where we see three thousand born of the Spirit in one day , and five thousand on another . Zion was in travail and sons and daughters were born unto God by scores and hundreds and thousands . <p> Of course , to the spiritually-enlightened , it is very evident why the divine plan is not approved , relished , or followed by most of the churches today .

My brother , thinking he could take our little sister across , started with her , but I called to him to go back and wait for me to do it ; for I was then about half-way over . The stream was not wide , and he thought he could take her over as well as I. <p> Just as I started back , oh , what a sight met my eyes ! I saw my little sister slip off the log into the water . I ran to catch her , but was not quick enough . As I reached for her , my brother and I both rolled from the log into the water with her .

By the time she got to us , the logs were under motion , so that she could not stand on them ; and she , too , fell into the water . <p> The six-year-old sister , whom I had taken across , saw it all and made an attempt to come to us . Mother called to her to go back . She turned back , and reached the shore all right . Just as mother spoke , she felt something come against her feet . She raised her foot with the weight , and caught the dress of little Emeline , who was sinking for the last time .

During this time I had caught hold of a log that was crowded between others , so I could pull myself up without rolling , but could get no farther . My sister Sarah and brother Willard were helped ashore . Emeline , whom mother had been trying hard to hold up , was taken out , but showed no signs of life . She was laid on a log while they helped mother out . <p> As soon as mother saw Emeline , she told the men to turn her on her stomach .

The men were near enough to shore where they fell in , so that they could touch bottom , and were not long in getting out . <p> Mother had to be taken home , where she was cared for by the best help we could procure . It was impossible to get a doctor where we lived in those days . Little Emeline and mother were watched over all night , and at sunrise the next morning they were pronounced out of danger . <p> The men who fell in got off with only an unpleasant wetting .

@@72205223 @905223/ <h> Devotion to God <p> Devotion to God implies ardent affection for Hima yielding of the heart to Him with reverence , faith , and piety in every act , particularly in prayer and meditation . We catch a glimpse of the true meaning of devotion from what is said of the centurion of the Italian band . He was termed " a devout man " * ( Acts 10:2 ) because he feared God , gave much alms to the people , and prayed to God always . This is the essence of true devotion . He loved God , without which there can be no devotion . The more we love an object , the more devoted to it we are . Devotion is therefore love manifested . At the feet of Jesus stood a woman weeping and washing His feet with her tears and wiping them with the hairs of her head and kissing them . Is not this a picture of devotion ? It is love and devotion expressed in action . Jesus said , " She loved much . " * ( Luke 7:47 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every devoted Christian desires to be more devoted to his God . I am glad we can be . It is pleasant to feel in our hearts an ardent desire to love God more . A fond mother clasps her babe to her bosom . She loves it , and her heart is happy in that love ; but she feels she can not love it enough . She longs to love it more . Her heart yearns to love it more , though she loves it from the fullness of her soul . This longing to love increases our capacity to love . By being filled with air some vessels are made to expand . Unless filled to their utmost capacity , they would not become more extended . To the extent that the heart is filled with the love of God , man is happy . <p> To desire to be more devotional is not an evidence of lack of devotion , but , on the contrary , an evidence of devotion . Those who are the least devotional have the least desire to be more devotional . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and although it is happy and satisfied , yet it longs to move . Oh , how we long to clasp our arms more tightly about Him ! How we long to have Him clasp His arms more tightly about us ! How we long to nestle more fondly and lovingly on His bosom ! What rapture to our love-flooded souls to receive of His caresses and hear His tender words ! To the soul in the ecstasy of its heavenly love , the world with its pleasures has vanished away like a morning vapor . <p> It is not understood by all how and why we should have a desire to possess more of that of which we are already full . It is the desire for development , it is an innate desire ; it is a principle planted on our constitution under grace . Let me repeat what I have said elsewhere : Every living thing consciously or unconsciously struggles to conform to type . When the little plant bursts through the ground , it enters the race in conforming to the type that it carries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a miniature oak tree . The little chick carries within it an image of the mother bird , to which it will naturally though unconsciously conform . <p> In the natural world when things reach the highest point of development , they begin to decay or deteriorate ; but this is not true in the spiritual world . Never in this lifeand possibly never in that life which is to comeshall we reach the fullness of the type , or , in other words , the highest point of development . As the acorn or the little chick bears in its nature an image of the parent , so the Christian bears in his soul the image of God . This is the image to which he is to conform . Day after day he can grow in grace . Day after day the beautiful graces of the Spirit can become more beautiful and the exterior life be more preceptibly stamped with the holy image of God . There must be progress , or there will be regress . When a ball that has been thrown upward ceases to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the type is reached , then begins the retrogression . This is none the less true of spiritual things . The reason why there need be no declension in love is because the highest point of development is never attained . <p> For illustration let us set a little child in our midst . As a child it is perfect . All organs are in proper place and are properly performing their functions . It is a perfect image of the type of man into which it will grow . That childs nature tends toward , and the child longs to be a man . The childs innate desire for development does not make it discontented as long as its craving for growth is gratified . In this we behold the goodness and the wisdom of the Creator . That the child may be happy , it is so constituted that it satisfactorily meets all the requirements of the law of development . The child is thus kept in a state of contentment . Did it seek to fulfill the law of growth contrary to its nature , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a delight to the child to eat , to play , to sleep . And these things , producing growth , meet the demands of its nature . There is implanted in it both a desire to grow and a relish for the things necessary to its growth . Thus the entire process of development is a delight . In fact , there will be no delight or enjoyment unless there be development . <p> True , a child does not eat and play for the express purpose of growing . Indeed , it may take no thought about growing . But there is in the nature of the child , when in health , a demand for growth . When the child is in i 'll health , the growth ceases ; consequently there is no demand for development , and it loses relish for the things that go to meet that demand . <p> This very beautifully illustrates Christian development which includes becoming more devotional . You desire to be more devotional . Such a desire is legitimate . The nature of every sanctified soul craves development . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing child . As that developing life in the child moves it to seek for the things that produce development , so the life of God in the sanctified soul moves it to seek for the things that will unfold and amplify that life . " If ye then be risen have life with Christ , seek those things which are above . " * ( Colossians 3:1 ) Those things , coming into our souls daily , will unfold us more and more into an heavenly life . They are food to the sanctified soul . They keep the soul satisfied , because they are the means provided by a loving , all-wise Providence for the constant healthful growth of our spiritual natures . Herein only is true soul-rest . <p> God gives us a relish for the very things that go to fulfill the demands of our Christian nature . Prayer , meditation , reading the Bible , trust , and resting in the Lord promote increase in Him . How delightful is prayer to the soul that is healthful and growing ! And the Word of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the soul for these things , how delightful it is to engage in them ! Do you behold the beauty and the wisdom here ? God implants a desire in the soul for spiritual development and at the same time implants a relish for the things necessary for such development . Bless His name ! Understand me please , this desire is not a restless longing , an aching void as is found in an unregenerated heart or in a soul in spiritual decline ; but it is the delightful struggling of a soul bearing the likeness of God , to conform to the natural law of development pent up within its bosom . <p> What is it in the nature of the oak that causes it to send its roots down into the soil and to drink up of its substance ? What is it in the nature of the child that causes it so eagerly to eat and play ? It is the demand in their nature for growth , or that innate struggle to conform to type . Manhood is sleeping in the childs bosom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that image . What causes the Christian heart to long to root deeper into God ; that makes the soul seek His embrace ? It is that instinctive struggle to conform to Gods glorious image . The entire process of development is delightful . Whenever the natural tendency toward growth ceases , the soul is in an abnormal state , and loses relish for the things necessary to growth . <p> Christian , see to it that you keep in your heart a desire , a longing , a panting , or , if you would rather I will say , a demand , in your spiritual being to be more devotional to God , and meet that demand by resting by faith in Him , by prayer , by meditation , by sacrifice . Do this , and you will become more devotional . But I love the word desire . Desire in the soul for spiritual things is appetite . Satisfying this desire is a pleasure . Never were any viands so sweet to the physical sense of taste as that food to our soul which helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible term : " As newborn babes , desire the sincere milk of the word , that ye may grow thereby . " * ( 1 Peter 2:2 ) <p> One way of becoming more devotional is by being active in service . Desire must be gratified , or it will die . Likewise , motive must find expression in action , or it will die . You have a desire for prayer ; then grant that desire by actually praying , or you will lose the desire . An appetite once lost is difficult to regain . You may have in your soul a pure motive ; then carry it into action . Do something for God , and you will become more devotional to God . Not that devotion comes by works , to begin with , any more than grace ; but we do become more devotional by doing , just as we grow stronger physically by exercise . Follow every inclination to do good as far as you can , and you will become more devotional to God . <p> God loves to have you devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted . It is astonishing , nevertheless God has intense desire to be prayed to and great love for communion with our hearts . He says , " My son , give me thine heart .

" * ( Proverbs 15:8 ) Oh , that there are so few hearts that love God ! Jesus wept over Jerusalem because they would not come to Him . But why does He so intensely yearn for the prayers and devotions of our hearts ? Because it is another young life and struggling to conform to the image in which it was created . It is another soul which has been won for God and in which He has His throne . <p> O God ! take our hearts and compress within them that pure love from Thy own heart that will cause us to pray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 119:32 ) .

" he groaned . " I suppose I 'll be ordered out , anyway , the minute I sit down and stretch my legs . Wonder if father can be exactly right in his mind . He does n't  believe in wasting time , but I 'm wasting it today by the bucketful . Suppose he s doing this to size me up some way ; he is n't going to tire me out so quick as he thinks .

The worst of it was , the orders were beginning to assume the form of a schedule , and commanded that he be here at 3:15 , and there at 4:05 , and so on , which forbade loitering , had he been inclined to loiter . In it all he could see no purpose , except the possible one of trying his physical endurance . He was a strong boy , or he would have been quite exhausted long before he reached envelope No. 17 , which was the last but three of the packet . This read : <p> Reach home at 6:20 P.M.

He had to rub them hard to make sure that he was not mistaken : <p> Go again to Kingston Heights , corner West and Dwight Streets , reaching there by 6:50 . Read No. 19 . <p> The boy looked up at the windows , desperately angry at last . If his pride and his sense of the meaning of that phrase , " My word of honor , " as the men of the Woodbridge family were in the habit of teaching their sons , had not both been of the strongest sort , he would have rebelled , and gone defiantly and stormily in . As it was , he stood for one long minute with his hands clenched and his teeth set ; then he turned and walked down the steps away from the longed-for dinner , and out toward L Street and the car for Kingston Heights . <p> As he did so , inside the house , on the other side of the curtains , from behind which he had been anxiously peering , Cornelius Woodbridge , Senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in a satisfied way . <p> " He s comeand gone , " he cried , softly , " and he s on time to the minute !

" But the corners of his mouth slightly relaxed . <p> The car seemed to crawl out to Kingston Heights . As it at last neared its terminus , a strong temptation seized the boy Cyrus . He had been on a purposeless errand to this place once that day . The corner of West and Dwight Streets lay more than half a mile from the end of the car route , and it was an almost untenanted district .

There must be no weak places in his word of honor . <p> Doggedly he went to the extreme limit of the indicated route , even taking the longest way round to make the turn . As he started back , beneath the arc light at the corner there suddenly appeared a city messenger boy . He approached Cyrus , and , grinning , held out an envelope . <p> " Ordered to give you this , " he said , " if you made connections .

Cyrus looked back over the day with an anxious searching of his memory to be sure that no detail of the singular service required of him had been slighted . <p> As he once more ascended the steps of his own home , he was so confident that his labors were now ended that he almost forgot about envelope No. 20 , which he had been directed to read in the vestibule before entering the house . With his thumb on the bell button he recollected , and with a sigh broke open the final seal . <p> Turn about , and go to Lenox Street Station , B. Railroad , reaching there by 8:05 .

Cyrus recognized him as the porter on one of the trains of the road of which his grandfather and father were officers . Why , yes , he was the porter of the Woodbridge special car ! He brought the boy a card which ran thus : <p> Give porter the letter from Norfolk Building , the card received at restaurant , the lecture coupon , yesterday evenings Sentinel , and the envelope received at Kingston Heights . <p> Cyrus silently delivered up these articles , feeling a sense of thankfulness that not one was missing .

@@72205243 @905243/ <h> The Landmarks <p> In Deuteronomy 19:14 we read , " Thou shalt not remove thy neighbours landmark , which they of old time have set . " Again in Deuteronomy 27:17 we read , " Cursed be he that removeth his neighbours landmark . " We read again in Job 24:2 , " Some remove the landmarks ; they violently take away flocks , and feed thereof . " Proverbs 22:28 says , " Remove not the ancient landmark , which thy fathers have set . " Proverbs 23:10 says again , " Remove not the old landmark ; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless . " Verse 11 continues , " For their redeemer is mighty ; he shall plead their cause with thee . " In all these Scriptures we see that the original landmarks which were set in the time of laying out and allotting the land to the children of Israel when they received their inheritance were very important all the way through in maintaining proper identification of each persons land as the inheritance passed down from one generation to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old time had set ( Deuteronomy 19:14 ) . The ancient landmarks which had been set by their fathers were not to be removed ( Proverbs 22:28 ) . A curse was pronounced upon anyone who tampered with any of the original landmarks ( Deuteronomy 27:17 ) . The rightful inheritance of each one of the children of Israel could only be identified by reference to those ancient landmarks . <p> It is the same in maintaining proper land lines and boundaries now . When a surveyor runs a land line he must locate corner stones and run the lines according to them . I have known them to dig up a considerable area in an effort to locate a corner stone , and if it could not be located , they could not proceed with the survey until one was established . Neither was this done by arbitrary means . The surveyor did not just look around and decide on an arbitrary location as being the most likely or pretty close and run from there . Rather he went to where he could clearly locate a corner stone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from those stones and established a corner that tied in with the other established corners in the area . Sometimes they would have to go maybe as much as a mile and perhaps in some cases even farther and measure in from each direction to locate a given corner . But the survey could not proceed until that corner had been definitely established to correspond with the other established corners in the area . <p> Also , in a survey , the line must be run according to where the original corner stones are found . If there are obstacles in the way and trees and brush , etc. , which hinder him from seeing through to the other corner , he does not decide that the line can not be established in that place and just move it over to another place . Instead he will carefully measure over a certain number of feet from the corner stone at each end of the line to clear the obstacle and set up his flag at that point to shoot to and run the line through from there , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shooting is so many feet off from the actual line . This becomes a matter of official record . When this is done and recorded legally the adjacent land owners can just wrangle and fuss all they want to and sue each other in court over the property line , but it will be always settled by the legal record of that surveyor who made the survey and established those corners . Everything in a given area must correspond with everything around it and must be tied in with the general area . <p> Now let us come down to apply this thought to us and to our spiritual standards , etc . In 1 Corinthians 10:18 we read , " Behold Israel after the flesh . " But why behold Israel after the flesh ? Because Israel after the flesh is a type of Israel after the spirit spiritual Israel or the Church of God in this New Testament age of time . Those literal landmarks referred to in the above texts which were so important to the children of Israel in their inheritance , etc. were typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been established by our fathers for the church . In the 5th chapter of Hosea , God was pronouncing judgment against the priests and princes and people of Israel for their rebellion against Him and their idolatry , etc. , and said , " The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound : therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water . " * ( Hosea 5:10 ) From this we see that God considers a departure from established standards set in the Scriptures and established for saints to go by as removing the ancient landmarks , and His judgment is pronounced against it , and His wrath poured out upon those who do such in this book . " * ( Revelation 22:18,19 ) We see here that it is no light thing to tamper with Gods Word and the standards and principles it sets forth , to change them or remove them in any way . <p> Now , returning to the thought that in a literal land line survey all must be definitely established to correspond with everything around it , and must be tied in with the general area , this is also true in the over-all picture of spiritual things and in establishing true standards for the church to go by . Each individual part of that standard must be scripturally and spiritually established and must tie in with the general over-all standard of teaching of the church . In other words , if we see evil in a particular thing and oppose it as being not compatible with a holy life because of the evil influence of it , then we should oppose all things related to that in principle and every projection of that thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As an illustration : if we oppose the movies in general as an element of evil influence , and I am sure that all of us do and the saints have stood against this thing from the time it first came in , then we should also oppose its offspring , the television , which projects that same evil influence from the theater right into our parlors and brings it right home to our children . As one said , " We took the night life off the streets and brought it to our homes .

So long as they remained within those set bounds and followed that certain course in their lives Gods glory was manifest among them and His power worked mightily in their midst . But the removal of this landmark broke down the boundary and set the people adrift and threw them into confusion as to what the standard of Christian living was , and today almost anything of the world is acceptable and very little divine power and glory is manifest in the lives of many . But let us realize that the New Testament can become a dead letter to many of us also if we do not watch ourselves very closely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in every phase . <p> The general , over-all rule for Christian living , and which would also be the standard for the church to go by collectively and individually , is found in 1 Corinthians 10:31 : " whatsoever ye do , do all to the glory of God . " This should be the corner stone from which we would survey every thing in every area of our lives . To state this rule or principle conversely will not suffice in this case . To state it conversely would be to state it negatively : " Will this or that dishonor God ? " Let us realize we are here for the express purpose to glorify God , and we should hold this principle at all times in its positive form just like it is stated here . " Do all to the glory of God , " and survey everything in life from that cornerstone of truth . <p> Jesus Himself laid down this pattern for us to go by . In John 4:34 Jesus said , " My meat is to do the will of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Again in John 5:30 Jesus said , " I seek not mine own will , but the will of the Father which sent me . " In John 8:29 Jesus said again , " The Father hath not left me alone ; for I do always those things that please him . " Jesus did always those things which pleased His Father . He is our example . In 1 John pleasing in his sight . " <p> Now let us consider that those who keep His commandments may be save ( howbeit , not all are saved who are quite strict about the commandmentsLuke 18:18-23 ) , but we must seek to do those things which are the most pleasing unto God if we would enjoy His rich blessings upon our lives . This text is put in its positive form also : " Do those things that are pleasing in his sight . " * ( 1 John 3:22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its negative form : " Will this displease God ? " We are plagued to a great extent with negative thinking anyway . We think and talk more about the things we do not believe in than the things we do believe in . Some have come more to an attitude of thinking , " Is this or that sin ? " than of thinking " Is this or that glorifying to God ? " But let us realize there are some things which could not actually be located as sin which do not really please God for us in our particular case and would not be glorifying to Him . <h> The Importance of Established Landmarks <p> I esteem very highly the early pioneer ministers of this Evening Light Reformation and the standard of holiness they held both in life and teaching . I consider those standards to be right because they worked and produced results , and the results they produced are the very same results the people of God yearn for and decry the lack of in our midst today . I reverence those early brethren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I hear people criticizing them and challenging their teachings . But it is common practice among those who accept and condone the innovations of worldly things , which have been coming in among us little by little over the past few years , to speak lightly of the standards taught and held by the early brethren . They also discredit those who hold for those standards yet in our day , and sometimes such remarks as this are heard : " I do my own thinking . I do not accept a code that has been handed down by tradition from someone way back there that I did not even know , " etc . Sometimes those who stand for those old standards are accused of just subscribing to some old tradition and doing things because someone else said to do it , etc . But when we see those old standards and that old way work and produce results and better results than the codes which people want to bring in and go by now , that is the deciding factor in our thinking . <p> Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , for who of us do not do things because others do them ? Those who are in the " know " regarding those things , tell us that the human race produces only a very small percentage of leaders . All the others are followers . Have any of you ever been conscious of having originated any style or fashion which went on and later became popular and was generally adopted by the world ? If you can not say " Yes " to this question , then are you not just following the styles and fashions originated by others and doing those things because the world does them ? If you did not originate the styles and fashions you are subscribing to , then certainly you are a follower and not a leader . Then why would you think it fair to condemn and ridicule those who choose to stand by the standards who have come down to us from our fathers ? <p> Would any of you even imagine , that if the styles were to change in the world to long skirts , that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? If suddenly no woman of the world would ever curl her hair or wear a permanent , do you imagine you would still think it necessary to curl yours and contend for those things as you do now ? If not , why not ? Then why would you think it proper and fair to taunt those who choose to stand by the old landmarks and not move the bounds in such a way and think of them as you do ? <p> You may askand I have been askedif I believed the early brethren had all the light . I would not have to believe that for my statement to be true in regard to them . But let us realize there is a vast difference between new light as it is being advanced today and more light on what the brethren of the early days taught and the church subscribed to in that time . I believe without doubt that we of our day have more light on some points of truth than they had in their day because there have been developments in the intervening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truth than they could have had in their day . I can accept additions of light on these points of truth on that basis , but I can not accept " new " light which contradicts the basic teachings of the early brethren on any points of truth . But I believe that the doctrines taught in the early days of this Evening Light Reformation contained the overall coverage of the truth as taught in the New Testament , though some of it was perhaps in a limited sense which developments have brought out clearer than they had it . <p> But let me make it clear in this respect that most of the points I could call to mind in this category would be dealing with scriptures of prophecy and having to do with the signs of the times and the fulfillment of prophecy and not with the real standards of holiness and Christian living . In regard to that , I believe I can say here that I accept the standards as taught and lived by the early brethren as being right , full and complete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I feel inclined to warn all of you at this point to be careful about accepting or being carried away with any of the innovations of worldly things or variations in teaching and practice which have been coming in among us the last few years and are coming in among us now . <p> If I could see more real godliness and deep holiness of life and more of the power of God accompanying these things , I could be more interested in them . But when I fail to see this but rather the opposite , a decline in spiritual power and deep holiness of life and more worldly-mindedness , etc. , I feel that the best policy for the church is to flee these things and follow after godliness . Let us not remove the old landmarks nor remove the bounds which have been set for us by those who have gone before us . Let us remember that Gods Word pronounces a curse on all who do this . <p> I do not believe anyone could successfully contradict that there was more real divine power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and genuine powerful conversions and devils cast out , etc. , in those early days than what we are able to witness and testify to in the church of our day . I know you do n't  like that . I do n't  either . I would like to see it different , but to be honest I must face up to the facts as I see them and I feel you should , too . Some of the very folks who are taking in with these innovations of worldly things and variations from the former teachings and practices of the earlier brethren , decry the lack of spiritual power and miracles and healings , etc. , in our day and refer back to how the early brethren did it and ask why our brethren of today do not do it that way . It is the age-old idea of wanting to have the cake and eat it , too , which can not be done . Some would like to have all that power and glory and benefits of the early church but they are not willing to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may as well stop trying ; and if we are willing to throw the standards of the early brethren overboard , just throw the rest overboard also , and quit worrying about what they had that we do not see in that same measure in the church of our day . We can never hope for the one without the other . <p> We hear folks sometimes talking about God restoring to us certain things which they are conscious to be lacking . This is the wrong approach to the problem . We should be praying for God to restore us to the standard and place in our lives and experiences where these things are . These things , divine glory , spiritual power and blessings , etc. , make up the faith which was once delivered to the saints . They were delivered once , were never taken away and consequently can never be given again . They were enjoyed by the church in the early morning time . Then when there was a decline from those standards of the early morning church , these things were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long reign of the beast of Revelation 13 ( Papalism ) , known as the " Dark Ages , " and the reign of the second beast ( Protestantism ) , known as the " dark and cloudy day , " when the Evening Light Reformation broke and the saints came out into the full light of the gospel and back to the standards of Christ and the apostles and the early morning church , they found these things right there where they had been left when the first apostasy came and they enjoyed them then just as the early church did . This should be sufficient to convince us that the standard of holiness and spiritual life are closely connected with the manifestations of divine glory and power among us . <h> Return to the Landmarks <p> In Genesis 26:12-25 , we have a story related concerning Isaac , the son of Abraham , which has an important connection with my thought here . Before this time Abraham had dwelt among the Philistines in the land and had dug wells of water there for his flocks and herds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philistines had stopped up the wells of water which he had dug . Isaac came to dwell in that same land and he had great flocks and herds also , and he went in and dug out those same old wells which had been dug in the days of Abraham , his father , which had been stopped and filled with earth by the uncircumcised Philistines . Verse 18 says , " And Isaac digged again the wells of water , which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father ; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham : and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them . " <p> Now let us realize that the common tendency is always to slacken and let up . This must be steadfastly resisted by all of us . The natural trend is always downward and the drift is always away from God and right . We , as saints , must not give way to this tendency but must pull against the tide of the world with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept just a little lower standard than the preceding generation held . Whatever standard we hold now , the rising generation will hold just a little lower standard and so on and on with each succeeding generation unless the heart is definitely wrought upon by the Spirit of God and a deep spirituality and deep holiness of life is maintained . Those among us who are more worldly minded and consequently less spiritual will always be ready to settle for a lower standard of life and ready to stop the wells which have been dug by our fathers . <p> But let us take note in the above scriptures that Isaac " digged again " in the wells of his father and called them by the same names , etc . Oh , how we need to dig deep in the wells of our fathersthe early brethrenthose wells of deep sincerity , deep humility , deep devotion , deep spirituality , deep godliness , and deep holiness of life and deep in the well of separation from the world and worldly things . Many today , are not living that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saints of the early church and those who lived in the early days of this Evening Light Reformation . Too much self , too much flesh , too much worldliness and the wells of our fathers become clogged , and we can never expect them to be a well spring of living water springing up into everlasting life and producing in our lives the blessings , joy , happiness , and power and grace that was and is manifested in the lives of those who keep all these things cleaned out of their lives . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a clearly set landmark and definitely established corner stone from which to run all our land lines and set our bounds . Let us call things by the same names by which our fathers called them and let us not feel it extremism to do so . The early brethren taught strongly against the wearing of gold and all ornamentation . Plainness and modesty in dress and behavior and general conduct of life characterized the lives of those early brethren and saints . The New Testament teaches this also : 1 Peter 3:3 and 1 Timothy 2:9 . But I have seen entirely too many gold watches , gold bands , and ornaments among us in recent years for my comfort . I see today too many short sleeves , short skirts , thin and sheer apparel , spike heels , bare limbs , etc. , among us . The brethren of former years taught against all these things and many more in principle . But there is a move on foot today to remove the bounds and destroy the old landmarks . Let us watch and be sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Bar Association , in an address to a convention of this association in Miami , Florida , on August 9 , 1965 , said , " An orderly society can not exist if every man may decide which laws he will obey . " Surely we can readily grasp the import of this and see that in a society where every man is a law unto himself , there could be no order . But how about a church where each one is a law unto himself and where the standard is set to accommodate the individual consciences of the communicants ? Could that be orderly , any more than a society could be orderly on that basis ? No . But God is calling for order in His church . His word says in 1 Corinthians 14:40 , " Let all things be done decently and in order . " I readily recognize the importance of the individuals conscience and contend that he should keep his conscience clear between him and God at all cost . His conscience may not be perfect and clear , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance does he have ? What chance would God have to deal with him ? One must never reach such a point as that . But while recognizing the place of the conscience in everyones life and relationship with God and placing proper importance upon it and keeping it clear between the individual and God , at the same time I contend that the individuals conscience has nothing at all to do with what we are to teach the church as its standard of holy living . I also recognize that God deals with people according to the light and knowledge they have , in part . But I also contend that the individuals light has nothing at all to do with determining what shall be taught to the people . <p> The individuals light is respected between him and God . So is his conscience . But neither is respected as a standard for the church to go by . If we just teach according to the peoples light and knowledge , how would they ever gain more light ? God wants us to lift up a standard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light or individual consciences and let them all come to it . But , of course , while they are getting to it , their standing with Him is rated according to their light , knowledge , and conscience , etc. and we should allow for that also in extending our fellowship and confidence to them while they are coming to it . <p> If God told us to lift up a standard for the people , would He not expect us to do that ? Certainly . Would He expect us to be governed in that standard by any individual circumstance or condition ? Certainly not . He would expect us to be directed by His Word and that only in lifting up that standard . But if we were to attempt to lift up a standard according to the individuals consciences , we would have many standards . But he said a standard . <h> The Deficiencies of the Conscience <p> Let us notice the different conditions of conscience spoken of in the scriptures . Imperfect ( Hebrews 9:9 ) . Purged ( Hebrews 9:14 ) . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3:9 ) . Defiled ( Titus 1:15 ) . Weak ( 1 Corinthians 8:7 ) , etc . Now let us realize that whatever state and condition an individuals conscience is in , it will pretty well set his course for life . A corrupt conscience would allow corrupt things in the life of the individual without remonstrating against them , while one whose conscience was pure would require strict purity in every phase of life and so on with all the different phases and conditions of the conscience . An imperfect conscience will allow an imperfect life , while a perfect conscience would demand a perfect life in order to keep clear . Paul persecuted the Church of God in a good conscience . He said in Acts 26:9 that he verily thought within himself that he " ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus . " We can see then that our conscience can be affected by the way we have been conditioned . Conscience is pretty much governed and regulated by what one believes to be right or wrong . It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his conscience will allow him to do it . On the other hand , it may be right , but if one believes it to be wrong , his conscience would condemn him in doing it . And let us realize that there is such a thing as a " seared " conscience 1 Timothy 4:2 , and when that happens , the conscience becomes entirely insensitive to anything . This condition is not arrived at immediately but comes gradually through one trifling with his conscience and failing to keep it clear and tender . I am told that there is in some heathen lands a belief that one can only appease the wrath of his god by sacrificing his firstborn child to the crocodiles in the river . These people take their children to the river and throw them in because their conscience requires that of them and would smite them severely if they withheld . But in more enlightened America , our conscience would smite us to death almost if we were to do such a thing . Thus we see that one persons conscience would smite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience would smite him severely for not doing . Thus we see that conscience does not set any kind of a general standard at all and if it did , what kind would it be ? Now let us realize that the teaching of conscience in the New Testament covers only things which are entirely neutral in principle and involve no moral principle of right or wrong at all . Paul brought it in under the heading of eating meat which was sacrificed to idols and said in his discussion of it in 1 Corinthians 8:8 that if we eat , we are no better and if we eat not , we are no worse . This covers a principle that should be applied and carried through all consideration of conscience matters . It applies only to things of an entirely neutral nature which would neither make one better nor worse either way . If it goes beyond this into something which involves moral principles of right and wrong , then we are to be governed by Gods Word and not by our conscience or what we think about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years for liberty of conscience . But let us realize that this tendency generally runs into a liberal conscience , and there is a vast difference between a liberal conscience and liberty of conscience . But God has talked to me some in times past on the text in Galatians 5:1 , " Stand fast therefore the the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free , and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage . " People today are contending for a great many liberties which Christ did not give them . He has never , at any time , liberated you and me from the obligations of His Word and the standard it sets forth . All He has done in that respect , at the best , is to just be patient and merciful and long-suffering with us and allow us time to get to the standard and get straightened out in our conscience and light , etc . But if we would not try to get to it but just contended for our own " think-so " in it , His patience , long-suffering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off . The liberty Christ gave us was never liberty to follow our own conscience alone as a standard of holiness and spiritual life . Many other liberties which people contend for and with which people do not want to be interfered are liberties Christ did not make them free in , also . <p> God has never given to you and me free license to follow any questionable thing , even slightly , but has instructed us to " abstain from all appearance of evil . " * ( 1 Thessalonians 5:22 ) The more we do this , the fuller and richer and more complete our spiritual lives will be and the more Gods blessings will abound in our souls . Brother Fred Pruitt and I were together in a meeting in Minnesota some years ago , and were staying in the home of a man who was pastor of the congregation where the meeting was being held . This man was accused to us by some of the members of his congregation that he drank beer . Brother Pruitt talked to him about it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his answer was that the Bible said to be temperate in all things , and that would include drinking beer the same as anything else , and one could not be condemned for drinking beer if he were temperate in it . But the liberties Christ gave never extended to such things as this , and He does not grant us license to indulge in any evil thing even temperately . <p> There seems to be a great fear with some of our people today with respect to extremism . I know there is such a thing and I fear it , too , to a certain extent . But I feel there is not much widespread danger of it within our ranks . There is much more danger of compromise among us at this time than of extremism and fanaticism as I see it . Those who are a little on the liberal side anyway seem especially fearful of fanaticism , but I certainly feel this is a trick of the devil to get their focus on this and pull them into compromise and liberalism to avoid it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared extremism so much would fear compromise just as much and religiously steer away from both of them . But it is not usually this way . I am fully aware that an extreme spirit can never be satisfied . But neither can a compromise spirit ; but when given way to , it will demand more and more and yet more , never being satisfied . <p> Let us consider Ahab , the king of Israel . He compromised the standard of God in the first place when he went out and married Jezebel , a heathen woman , which God had forbidden to be done in Israel . When he had done this thing , it took him out from under the favor of God and His sheltering wing . Then he was a victim of many things , being led captive by Satan at his will . When this woman came in , she naturally wanted to worship her god , Baal , and requested Ahab to have an altar built in the land to do sacrifice to Baal . He was already cut loose and drifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he conceded to this , also . Next , she wanted a temple built for Baal and he granted this request . This was a great abomination in the sight of God . But this woman could never be satisfied , so next she demanded that the altars of God be destroyed out of the land , and Ahab was so victimized by this spirit by then that he granted that request , also . Then she struck the final and fatal blow to the worship of the true God and demanded that the prophets of God be put to death and Ahab conceded to this , also . Brethren , let us realize that when we cut loose from our moorings and start drifting , there is no knowing where we will drift to . The only safe place for us is to stay anchored to the old landmarks and never take the first step away from them . We are instructed , in Jeremiah rest for your souls . " Here the " old paths " are called the " good way . " This is the way God views it . This is Gods Word . Let us view it the same way and love the old paths as we are instructed to do here . <h> The Seeds of Apostasy <p> Now we know that no religious movement ever fell to the bottom all at once . The greatest apostasy of them all that led to the establishment of the Roman Catholic hierarchy came by a gradual process and was 260 years in developing , even after it got a good start , and the leaven of it was working actively but gradually for a long time before that . <p> But stop at any point in that gradual decline and apostasy from the original spirituality and glory of the early church and name any one thing that was coming in , and it by itself would appear to be of too little consequence to be worthy of much attention , let alone create a controversy . This would be especially true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things always start on very minor points . After apostasy is farther advanced and the darkness in mens souls increased and their conscience becomes more seared , then they can take bigger steps at one time without any conviction . But they have to be conditioned for those bigger things , and the devil knows he could not impose the big things at first while there is still a lot of light in the soul and a considerable degree of spirituality and divine power and blessings manifest in the movement . He must begin with very minor points that appear so insignificant as to be absurd and work up to bigger things later on . The apostasy in the Evening Light Reformation movement is no exception to this rule but has followed the general pattern of all before it , beginning with only minor points and working on into the bigger things later on . But perhaps the apostasy in this movement has been the most rapid of any before it . This should cause us to stop and take notice , because this certainly indicates a general condition existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it easier for the people to accept these things and for the devil to push them in upon the people . No reformation before this one has ever fallen so far in such a short time . This should certainly cause us to fear to take the first step in that direction . <p> But , even though the first steps were small and insignificant , those first fruits of it are a part of it the same as the later fruits are a part of it . The little minor points on which it started are as much an important part of it as the bigger things that came later . Without the little things , there never could have been the bigger things . Little drops of water make the mighty ocean . Little grains of dirt make this great earth . And a conglomerate accumulation of little things make a great apostasy , the result of which is a fallen movement . I will now notice some scriptures in Gods Word directed to the ministry and I notice them here for a definite purpose . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak is a priceless treasure . Without it , he becomes useless as a minister and overseer of the flock of God and a watchman on the wall to warn of approaching danger . The scriptures given along this line are all aimed at protecting the ministers right to speak in any and all points . Note the following scriptures on this line . <p> " Let no man despise thy youth ; but be thou an example of the believers in word , in conversation , in charity , in spirit , in faith , in purity . " * ( 1 Timothy 4:12 ) <p> " In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works : in doctrine showing uncorruptness , gravity , thing to say of you . " * ( Titus 2:7,8 ) <p> " Neither as being lords over Gods heritage , but being ensamples to the flock . " * ( 1 Peter 5:3 ) <p> One can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scriptures and others along this line which could be produced , is to protect the ministers right to speak in any matter that arises . He is commanded to be an example in all things so that he may have a right to speak in all things and to " reprove , rebuke , and exhort , " * ( 2 Timothy 4:2 ) with effectiveness . <p> When Paul was giving instructions to the church at Thessalonica , he paused to remind them : " Ye are witnesses , and God also , how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe . " * ( 1 Thessalonians 2:10 ) And as a result of that , he was able to record this result from his preaching truth , the word of God which effectually worketh also in you that believe . " * ( 1 Thessalonians 2:13 ) His preaching and teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them gave him a right to speak in their own eyes . <p> This same writer says " And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience , when your obedience is fulfilled . " * ( 2 Corinthians 10:6 ) This makes it plain that we have no right to speak against the disobedience of another if we ourselves are disobedient on some point and not fulfilling all righteousness ourselves . <h> The Propagation of Apostasy <p> But let us get down to the point in all of this . It is believed by many that the rift which came about in this Evening Light Reformation movement in about 1910 to 1914 was all brought about by the necktie issue and the idea of causing a rift or split in the movement over such a little thing as a necktie is hooted at as an extremely ridiculous thing by many . If that were the truth of the matter and if that were the real issue and the only issue , it would be an extremely ridiculous thing . I agree with you that it would be . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins with very small things and move on to greater things as they progress . The apostasy of this Evening Light Reformation was no exception to this rule . But let us face it squarely as the history of the developments confirm it to be . The innovation of the necktie was definitely the removing of one of the landmarks of our fathers , and when one landmark is removed or destroyed , it throws all related things out of proper focus . <p> It is evident beyond question that the necktie has served as a mouth stopper in the hands of Satan . He who wears a tie has no right to speak against a string of pearls that a woman wears around her neck . Anything and everything that could be said for or against either of these could also apply to the other in the same way . Likewise the woman who wears the string of pearl beads around her neck would have no right to speak about the person who wore some other kind of jewelry . And this person who wears the jewelry , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak about the person who wore make-up , etc . And so on and on it goes , one thing after another , while the minister is helpless to prevent it . They have forfeited their right to speak . <p> " Oh , " but you may say , " I know ministers who really preach it straight and cry out against those kind of things . " Yes . But is there any authority back of it ? Is it effectual that they do ? Do not these things continue to increase , among those who profess to be the Church of God of this day , and also many other lines of worldliness , without letup ? We all know this to be true , and it is for no other cause than that the ministers in this movement who cry out against these things have forfeited their right to do so and consequently all their crying out is weak and ineffectual . The fact that these things are cried out against by some and yet increases only adds weight to my argument at this point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can remember when this and other innovations were first introduced among the saints . Many were afraid of them at that time but were consoled by the promise of the brethren who were endorsing them that it would just be these few minor changes to give us more influence with the better class of people of the world so we can reach more of them and we will go no farther . But was that the case ? History up to now and the present conditions of worldliness of every kind flooding the professed Church of God shouts in deafening tones , " NO ! " <p> Now I would not dare to say that these brethren willfully misrepresented the facts in the case and their honest intentions . No doubt , they spoke as they felt and did not intend for things to happen as they did . They could not possibly have foreseen all that has happened anyway . They certainly did not plan all of this in their own minds and hearts . But what did happen was that when they conceded to these things they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other kinds of worldliness , and the devil , who promoted the whole thing , just kept pushing in one thing after another that they had not seen or thought of before . A clearly established landmark had been removed , and it threw everything related to it out of kilter , and there were no fixed landmarks to go by in this area ; instead of the dearly defined land line of demarcation and total abstinence from all things of a worldly nature , which had characterized the church and the teaching up to this point , it now became a question of what types of worldly things would be permitted . If any worldly things at all were permitted , then how would other worldly things compare with them , and if one accepted or practiced one thing of a worldly nature , what right then did he have to condemn or criticize another who practiced some other thing of a worldly nature ? And so on and on it went . <p> It was like the story of the leak in the Holland dike . First there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . But the water had found a way through and soon it was a little trickle of water coming through , then a larger trickle growing into a stream , and then , in spite of all the efforts of all the men in the area to stop it , it broke on through the dike , a mighty , gushing , uncontrollable flow of water which flooded all the low land areas , destroying many homes and many lives and much property . This story fairly represents what happened in this Evening Light Reformation movement . <p> I read Charles E. Browns book , When the Trumpet Sounded . At one place in it , he was discussing the time when the question of the tie was first introduced . It was in regard to brethren being required by their employers to wear a tie as a part of their uniform while on duty . That was granted , and Brother Brown saidand said significantlythat " Anyone who understands human nature would know that when such a concession was made that henceforth there would be no standard on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is also true that when a standard on any point is destroyed , that standards on relative points are affected , and they in turn affect standards on other points related to them , until it passes through the entire system , and the result is the whole standard in general is affected and eventually destroyed . This has happened to a great extent by now in the liberal wing of the Evening Light Reformation movement , but I prophesy that Satan is not through with it yet . It will get worse yet than what it is now . Let us not forget that neither an extreme nor compromise spirit can ever be satisfied but will demand more and more and more and yet more as it progresses . <p> When I was a boy , I loved the game of football .

Their job is to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With good , effective blocking , the players handling the ball can successfully execute the play and make good gains .

They were the mouth-stoppers , and their acceptance made all protest against other things weak and ineffectual , because the ministers right to speak had been forfeited . In other words , these things served as blockers and ran the interference for the devil against any and all opposition , while he pushed through one thing after another and scored touchdown after touchdown against the church .

When one does this , the ocean is large and there is no imagining where one will wind up when drifting . <p> I read an article in a magazine once , the title of which was , " A Fortune in a Bottle .

She had thrown the bottle in the ocean over there in Scotland , and a lawyer investigating the case charted the course the bottle would have to follow to reach where it was found and estimated it would take approximately twelve years for it to make the trip . That was in keeping with the date of the will , and it furnishes a fair example of drifting . No one ever knows where a thing will go when it is cut loose to drift . Therefore , let us not think of taking the first step toward compromise . <h> Stay By the Landmarks <p> I heard a minister , in his message a while back , say that when he and his wife were first married , he sat down with her and asked her if she ever intended to divorce him . She was in the height of ecstasy of her newly-married joy , and of course the answer was " No . " He told her that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they never take the first step in that direction . He exhorted that they never go to sleep at night with anything existing between them that might have come up during that day .

He explained to her that it was not the big things which brought married couples to the divorce courts , but just an accumulation of small things and misunderstandings , etc. , which summed up to a big thing . This same thing applies to what I am dealing with here , and that is just the way things develop in apostatizing from the truthjust one little thing after another resulting in a great mountain . <p> I believe that was real good advice from this minister and his wife , for myself and you and everyone else , and I believe it is good advice in this case : never take the first step toward compromise . <p> Now in concluding , let me earnestly exhort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one mind , striving for the faith of the gospel , and that we all present a solid front against the enemy and stand solidly together to defend the church and the succeeding generations against the innovations of worldly things which today are hammering at our gates trying to push in upon us .

@@72205255 @905255/ <h> Understanding Marriage <p> Marriage is a lifetime thing , and is a sacred and divinely consecrated institution , ordained in the hands of a loving and all-wise God for the good , happiness , and general welfare of mankind . It should never be entered into thoughtlessly , recklessly , or hastily ; but thoughtfully , prayerfully , reverently , discreetly , and in full consideration of the purposes for which God ordained it . Remember as you approach the time when you will be casting about for the person who is to be your lifes companion , that your whole life lies ahead of you and the course of your life is being charted . The most important decision of your life is being made right at that time . <p> A solid marriage that will continue to produce peace and contentment on through the uneven journey of life and the changing fortunes of war , so to speak ( for life is a warfare , according to the Scriptures ) , must be established on something more than just physical beauty , physical attraction and attractiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes on , work its changes in the physical features and form of a person , and take its toll . <p> There must be deep mutual love , respect , trust , and confidence between the two parties to bind them together and undergird them for the struggles of life that lie ahead . This may exist entirely separate from , and independent of , physical charm , beauty , and physical attraction . Let me say right here that you should never enter into a marriage with a person you can not trust implicitly . That would be a great big mistake . Your life would be filled with misery and woe because of your perpetual suspicion and wonderment about your mate . <p> The great danger for youth is , that so many times they mistake infatuation and physical attraction for love , and later on , when that begins to fade , they find their foundation crumbling from underneath them . <p> A sister told me , not long ago , that there was not a single thing in common between her and her husbandnothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had no interest at alland then said , " After these three things I come first .

There are no common bonds to bind them together in their closing years of life . <p> Another sister in her middle years of life , who has raised a family , has married children , told my wife a while back that she did not know why she and her husband had ever married , as they had so little in common . <p> Another couple that I knew quite well and I have been in their home on various occasions were just two people living in the same housenothing more .

Everything that makes a marriage a real marriage was gone and their foundation had crumbled from under them . Do any of you want to face the advanced years of your marriage and of your life in situations like this ? Certainly not . Then you had better think now and project your thinking on ahead into those years and how things may be then . <p> But at this point , let us not mistake the value of physical attraction .

One does not have to put his or her spouse out of the house to put them away in this sense , but just withhold ones self from ones spouse and force him or her out into illicit affairs . In the sight of God that one becomes equally responsible and guilty for the adultery in such a case . <p> We see that physical attraction is important .

This saying proves to be quite true , works out quite generally and fairly sure . The strong points of character and disposition are more than likely to be transmitted to the children . If the man is surly , cantankerous , inconsiderate of the rights and feelings of others , and discourteous , you will more than likely have some children like that to deal with in your home .

If she is the dominant , domineering , bossy type , she will be the same toward you . Brother Chandler taught us in his lifetime that people would usually behave like they had been conditioned , and this is generally true . <p> Marriage is no place for pettish , peevish , selfish , self-centered folks to enter ; but it is good soil for self-sacrifice , self-denial , and selflessness to grow and develop . True love will cause one to think more of what he can give than what he can get . Infatuation and physical attraction will work just the opposite , causing one to think more of what he can get than what he can give . <p> Weigh out your prospective spouse real well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of your life with him or her , just as he or she is now . Do n't  ever make the mistake , and it is a very serious mistake that many do make , to marry a person with the idea of making him or her over to suit you after you are married .

@@72205273 @905273/ <h> The Vine and the Branches <p> " I am the true vine , and be done unto you . Herein is my Father glorified , that ye bear much fruit ; so shall ye be my disciples . " * ( John 15:1-8 ) <p> This beautiful analogy teaches us an important lesson . The standard of sanctification is clearly exemplified in the relation between the vine and the branches . Christ is the vine , and every individual Christian is an individual branch ; every branch is an individual member of the vine , and every Christian is an individual member of Christ . <p> What a clear view of the church , and how plainly we can see that there is but one . Every regenerate soul is by one Spirit baptized into this one body . This vine is cared for and kept by God Himself , who is the husbandman . Every branch must be a living , fruit-bearing one . It is placed into the vine by the hand which will care for it , and give it every necessary treatment to cause it to bring forth much fruit . If it bears fruit it will be kept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be taken away . The same life which flows through the vine also flows into the branches . It is the branches that bear the fruit . It is the part of the vine to sustain the branches , and the part of the branches to bear fruit . The fruit is the production of the vine-life in the branches . The word of God teaches us that Christ is pure and holy , and we are taught that " if the root be holy , so are the branches . " * ( Romans 11:16 ) The manner of the induction of the branches into the vine is illustrated by the process of grafting . We are not grown into Christ , but grafted into Him . The natural branches of a vine grow out of the vine , and accordingly bear the vine-fruit , but by grace we are grafted into Christ , the vine , and bear the vine-fruit . <p> A certain writer who advocates the repression theory of sanctification says : <p> But if I want a tree wholly made good , I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off on the ground , I graft it just where it emerges from the soil . I watch over every bud which the old nature could possibly put forth , until the flow of sap from the old roots into the new stem is so complete , that the old life has , as it were , been entirely conquered and covered by the new . Here I have a tree entirely renewedemblem of the Christian who has learnt in entire consecration to surrender everything for Christ , and in a wholehearted faith wholly to abide in Him . <p> If , in this last case , the old tree were a reasonable being that could co-operate with the gardener , what would his language be to it ? Would it not be this : " Yield now yourself entirely to this new nature with which I have invested you ; repress every tendency of the old nature to give buds or sprouts ; let all your sap and all your life-powers rise up into this graft from yonder beautiful tree , which I have put on you ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the language of the tree to the gardener would be : " When you graft me , oh , spare not a single branch ; let everything of the old self , even the smallest bud , be destroyed , that I may no longer live in my own , but in that other life that was cut off and brought and put upon me , that I might be wholly new and good . " <p> And , once again , could you afterwards ask the renewed tree , as it was bearing abundant fruit , what it could say of itself , its answer would be this : " In me , that is , in my roots , there dwells no good thing . I am ever inclined to evil ; the sap I collect from the soil is in its nature corrupt , and ready to show itself in bearing evil fruit . But just when the sap rises into the sunshine to ripen into fruit , the wise gardener has clothed me with a new life , through which my sap is purified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good fruit . I have only to abide in that which I have received . He cares for the immediate repression and removal of every bud which the old nature still would put forth . " <p> Andrew Murray ; Abide in Christ , " As Your Sanctification " <p> This author has entirely reversed the scriptural order of grafting in his application of the graft and root , and has illustrated the relation of Christ and the believer by the natural grafting process which can in no sense scripturally apply to this holy relation . Christ is the vine or root , and not the graft . The natural process of grafting is to graft the good graft into a poor root . The graft will grow into a tree and bear the same kind of fruit as the tree from which it was taken , and thus the gardener increases the production of good fruit . But the divine process of grafting is just the reverse . The apostle says we are grafted into the olive tree ( Christ ) " contrary to nature . " * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the kingdom of darkness and translates him into the kingdom of His dear Son . In this regeneration process the sinner ( the graft ) that was sinful and bore fruit is by Gods own process grafted into Christ , the holy vine , and from thence to bear holy fruit . This is certainly a great mystery , like all the works of Gods grace , and is indeed contrary to nature , but in perfect conformity with the plan of redemption . <p> Now , in this condition , there is a certain requirement of the graft necessary that it may bear the vine-fruit ; it must abide in the vine . This abiding requires a careful watchfulness lest there might be some sprout of the old inward nature , which yet exists within the newly grafted branch , which would spring up and hinder the perfect fruitbearing of the vine-life . And in this early life , in this new relation of the branch with the vine , it is an attested fact that in quantity this fruit production is more or less hindered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch , which if permitted to sprout and grow would certainly prevent the growth of the vine-fruit entirely , and thereby cause the branch to be cut off . That the branch is in the vine there can be no question , for its environments are completely changed and it finds itself a stranger to all of its former associations , customs , and habits . That the vine-life is in the branch there can equally be no question , for the branch has the inward consciousness bearing witness that it belongs to the vine , and it enjoys the sweet fellowship of the vine and all its branches . Also it bears the vinefruit which brings upon itself the approval of the husbandman . <p> But this early and new relationship is only the justified life of the branch . The standard of sanctification of the author from whom we have just quoted is in no respect any higher than this , and were it not that there is a higher standard taught in this lesson and in many other scriptures , we would have to be satisfied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he purgeth it , that it may bring forth more fruit . " * ( John 15:2 ) This purging is another process quite contrary to nature , for the term signifies an inward cleansing . A vine-dresser can prune or trim a branch and thereby practically make it clean outwardly from all unnecessary or harmful sprouts which would hinder it from bearing fruit , but there is no known natural process by which the grafted branch could have its inward conditions changed which would affect its nature . <p> We can see clearly that the entire process of grafting the inferior branch into the good root , and the subsequent purging is wholly contrary to nature , for no man with an object of profit would do any such grafting , neither could anyone reasonably expect the inward conditions of such a graft to become changed . <p> This purging is wrought within for the purpose of an increase of holy fruit . How beautifully it pictures the experience of sanctification , and subsequent work wrought in the soul of the justified fruit-bearing child of God . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are to be wholly kept from sprouting in the process of the life of bearing holy fruit in this justified relation . The branch is now bearing the very fruit of the holy root , but there is something to be done in it that it may bring forth more fruit ; it must be purged from its inward depraved dispositions which it possessed from its parent stockits " old man that the body of sin might be destroyed . " * ( Romans 6:6 ) Before the purging there was much time and energy occupied in keeping its depraved nature from sprouting . The holy nature of the root was indeed being manifested in the production of holy fruit which was a source of satisfaction , but there was that inward consciousness of an unfavorable condition which hindered the root-life from producing in the branch the quantity necessary to the perfect satisfaction of the husbandman , the vine or the branch . <p> But now what a glorious change : the old nature is entirely gone , and the sweet soul-rest which the purged branch now enjoys is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now repose itself so sweetly in the holy vine in its perfectly consecrated life , without any inward hindrance to a perfect flow of the vine-life through its entire being . It can now bring forth more fruit , for every energy from the root is sent direct into the fruit-buds of the branch , and the result is glorious . This purging is just what perfects the inward harmony of the branch with the vine . It could not continue very long in the abiding condition without a consciousness of the need of the purging process . This process becomes a necessity to every branch which abides . " He that abideth in me , and I in him , the same bringeth forth much fruit , " * ( John 15:5 ) which is equivalent to the text , " Every branch that beareth fruit , he purgeth it , that it may bring forth more fruit .

These will be described more fully in a later chapter . The second work includes , not only a perfect cleansing of the heart from inherited depravity , but also the baptism of the Holy Ghost . Inasmuch as the Holy Ghost baptism is especially important in this second work and is held up by Jesus and the apostles as being necessary to the highest success in the Christian life , it is proper that it should be given consideration here before the cleansing phase of the second work of grace is described . <p> Those opposed to the doctrine of a second work too often overlook the fact that in rejecting it they reject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baptism as subsequent to conversion .

When God created man , He purposely made his shoulders too narrow to bear the burdens of life alone , and his wisdom too limited to know of himself what way he should take . God intended that men should be dependent upon Him . He knew this very feeling of dependence on Him would cause them to find the blessedness of trusting Him .

Through sin , mankind has been deprived of the indwelling divine Spirit ; but , thank God , in the full salvation which Jesus provides the Spirit is again restored . <p> Jesus and the apostles give much importance to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and urge the disciples to receive him . In that great discourse recorded in John 13-17 , given on the solemn occasion of the last supper , Jesus sought to encourage those He was about to leave by the promise of the Comforter whom He would send to them . Also when the apostle Paul came to Ephesus , the first question he asked of the twelve disciples he found was , " Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed ? " * ( Acts 19:2 ) It was also the important thing in the visit of Peter and John to the newly established church in Samaria ( Acts 8:14-17 ) , in the visit of Ananias to Paul ( Acts 9:17 ) , and of Peter to Cornelius ( Acts 10:44 ) .

The Holy Spirit is not given to sinners , but only to those already saved . Jesus said , in promising Him to his disciples , " Whom the world can not receive . " * ( John 14:17 ) <p> The first example of receiving the Holy Ghost after conversion is that of the disciples among whom were the twelve apostles . Before they received the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost , they were already converted . They had believed on Christ ( John 17:8 ; Matthew 16:16 ) , and therefore had been born again ( John 1:12-13 ) . They were regenerated and therefore in Gods kingdom to the extent that it was already set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . They had been sent out to preach the gospel ( Matthew 10:7 ) . They were not of the world ( John 14:17 ; 15:19 ) . They kept Gods word ( John 17:6 ) . Surely they were saved , yet they were commanded to tarry at Jerusalem until baptized by the Holy Ghost ( Luke 24:49 ; Acts 1:4-5 ) . This they received on the day of Pentecost , when " they were all filled with the Holy Ghost . " * ( Acts 2:4 ) And this was not different from the experiences of those converted after Pentecost . <p> The Samaritan church are a very remarkable example of receiving the Holy Spirit after conversion . The people of Samaria " believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God , and the name of Jesus Christ , and they were baptized , both men and women .

How long it was before the information reached Jerusalem that these Samaritans had been converted , we are not told ; but when it did reach there , the apostles sent Peter and John to Samaria at least some days after the fact , and possibly a few weeks later . When these apostles arrived , they found that the new disciples there had not yet received the Holy Ghost . Therefore they prayed for them , and the new disciples received the Holy Ghost . Here is a plain case of a second work of grace . <p> The disciples at Ephesus whom Paul found on his first visit there , were saved . They had " believed " and were " disciples . " * ( Acts 19:1 ) Yet they had not received the Holy Ghost , and did not until Paul laid his hands upon them for that purpose . Pauls question , " Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed ?

He accepted and believed on Christ on the Damascus road . There he received his call to the ministry ( See Acts 26:16 ) . Also Ananias recognized him as a brother ( Acts 9:17 ) , and it was said of Paul , " He prayeth. " * ( Acts 9:11 ) But he did not receive the Holy Spirit until Ananias came to him . Other similar examples might be given . <h> Relation of the Spirit to the Justified <p> Though the foregoing Bible texts conclusively prove that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is subsequent to conversion , yet according to other texts the Spirit is with believers in some sense before . Jesus said to His disciples , " He dwelleth with you , and shall be in you . @ @ @ none of his . " * ( Romans 8:9 ) <p> These and similar texts cause confusion in the thought of some and furnish ground for objection to a second work for others . Jesus makes the distinction of " with " and " in , " but Paul seems to disregard such distinction . That the justified person has the Spirit working in him in some sense is certain . The Spirit even comes to and works in the sinner in conviction . He is everywhere present in His capacity to work , and it is in this sense that He is in the justified . But He is in the person who has been baptized by Him in a much greater degree to work in and through him . He works , not only in a greater degree , but also in different ways in the wholly sanctified person than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the prepositions " in " and " with " may be understood as a practical rather than as being an exact distinction between the two experiences . The distinction is not one of the Spirits location so much as of His power to operate . Probably a clearer understanding would be possible to some minds by illustrating this distinction by that between the ordinary sinner whose evil deeds are actuated by suggestions of Satan and the demoniac who is possessed by the evil spirit and is much more fully under his power and control . The Spirit-baptized saint is possessed by the Holy Ghost and sustains a very close relationship indeed to Him . One great difference in the case of the individual possessed by the Holy Spirit is that he is not bound nor compelled as is the demoniac , but , thank God , is gloriously free . <h> One Baptism But Many Fillings with the Spirit <p> Another practical distinction which should be made is that between " being baptized with " or " receiving " the Spirit , and " being filled with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need not be any repetition of it ; because if he lives right , the Spirit remains in him constantly . But there will be times when he will need and should have fresh anointings of the Spirit for particular services or circumstances . This being filled with the Spirit does not mean that one receives a greater measure of the Spirit Himself , who is a person , but a greater measure of His working . One may or may not receive this fuller measure of the working of the Spirit at the time of the baptism by the Spirit . The apostles at Pentecost received it then and also at later times . <p> One remarkable instance of the reception of this fuller measure of the working of the Spirit was when the apostles on a certain occasion were persecuted and threatened . They prayed , and " the place was shaken ; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost . " * ( Acts 4:31 ) Now we know these apostles received and also were filled with the Holy Ghost at Pentecost . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty working of the Spirit in them . This anointing was for the purpose of giving them boldness to preach in the face of persecution . Stephen was filled with the Holy Ghost at the time of his martyrdom that he might have grace to suffer ( Acts 7:55 ) . Paul was filled with the Holy Ghost to rebuke Elymas the Sorcerer and strike him blind ( Acts 13:9-10 ) . Elizabeth and others were filled to praise God and prophesy ( Luke 1:41,67 ) . <p> Every person today who has been much used of God is familiar with these special fillings of the Spirit . Often the preacher is temporarily filled with the Spirit for the preaching of Gods message . Sometimes it is for the praying of the prayer of faith for the healing of the sick , the carrying on of a revival meeting , or the winning of a soul to Christ . Every spiritual person should experience the special fillings . Reader , if you have received the Spirit , but have not been filled with His working , seek God more earnestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is of practical importance , because some sincere people who have really received the Holy Spirit yet who feel the need of a new filling by Him , become troubled , and go back to seeking the baptism again instead of the fresh anointing they need . Also false teachers often take advantage of this craving for a fresh anointing of the Spirit to make people think they have never received Him . Thank God , you can become filled with the mighty working of Gods Spirit and do great things for God without getting confused about your past experience and baptism , or without failing under the " power " in an unseemly manner and getting what some are pleased to call " tongues . " <p> If we pray as earnestly as did the persecuted apostles described in Acts 4 , if we labor for the advancement of Gods cause as diligently as did Paul when he met Elymas , if we are as devoted as Stephen when he was about to lay down his life for Christs sake , then we shall receive fresh fillings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Spirit <p> The works of the Spirit are described as including a wide range in the matter of our salvation . He it is who convicts the sinner of his sins , regenerates the penitent , and witnesses to the adoption of the converted . But we are here concerned especially with His works in and through us at the time of the Holy Spirit baptism . His work in us , or the subjective operation , is alike in all because all have the same general need of salvation from the depravity that will later be shown to remain in the justified person . We are therefore " sanctified by the Holy Ghost . " * ( Romans 15:16 ) At the time of the Holy Spirits baptizing men , His principal work is " purifying their hearts by faith . " * ( Acts 15:8-9 ) There is a proper similitude between the incoming of the Holy Spirit and the making holy the heart in which He comes to dwell . <p> But in the objective phase of His works , consisting in His operation through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is variation in different individuals , as is definitely stated in 1 Corinthians 12 . At the time a person receives the Holy Spirit he may receive any of the many gifts of the Spirit , or he may receive no particular gift at that time . One may receive the gift of tongues , or of prophecy , as did a few of those described in the New Testament . But there is no common need for these or any other gifts at the time of the baptism as there is need of a cleansing of the heart . In fact , one may as well obtain the gifts subsequent to the baptism according to Pauls reasoning in 1 Corinthians 14 , where he urges those who have already received the baptism of the Spirit and some of the less important gifts to " covet earnestly the best gifts , " * ( 1 Corinthians 12:31 ) which were yet possible to them . <h> The Evidence of the Baptism <p> The evidence of the Holy Spirits baptism is deserving of brief consideration here because of the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only proper evidence is speaking in tongues , and that all who get the baptism speak in tongues . It is said that anything so important as the baptism must be witnessed to by such an outward physical sign . But is the baptism more important than the salvation of ones soul ? And since conversion is not witnessed to by a physical sign , surely there is no necessity for such a sign of the baptism . If the evidence of the spiritual work of regeneration is the witness of the Spirit ( Romans 8:16 ) and if the call to service and other important things are witnessed to in the same manner , certainly such a spiritual work as the Spirit baptism requires only this spiritual evidence for spiritually-minded people . Only unspiritual , earthly-minded people could need a physical or outward evidence of a spiritual work , and such never receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost . <p> On only three occasions does the Bible state that tongues accompanied the outpouring of the Spirit ( Acts 2:4 ; 10:45-46 ; 19:6 ) . Of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no proof that they spoke in tongues . Those who on the ground of these three texts teach the theory that tongues is the evidence of the Spirits baptism are guilty of the fallacy of unsound reasoning . Peter , in speaking of the baptism of Cornelius by the Spirit , said , " As I began to speak , the Holy Ghost fell on them , as on us at the beginning . " * ( Acts 11:15 ) If all the many thousands who had received the Holy Ghost during the eight years since Pentecost had always received the tongues , why did Peter say , " As on us at the beginning " ? Why could he not as well have said , " As He has been baptizing all since the beginning " ? Though not a complete proof , this is reason for believing the speaking in tongues did not usually accompany the Holy Ghost baptism . <p> Those who advocate the theory that all who get the baptism speak in tongues also hold that this speaking in tongues is different from the gift of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1 Corinthians 12 shows that the " gift " and the " manifestation " of the Spirit are identical , and the apostle closes with the clear implication that all do not speak with tongues ( 1 Corinthians 12:28-30 ) . We agree with the apostle that all do not speak with tongues . The best evidence that one has the Holy Spirit is the Spirit Himself .

He wants many young men and women for certain positions in these industries . He announces that in one years time these positions will be open for those qualified for them . The salaries range according to the positions . $200 per month is the salary of those occupying the lowest positions , and $2,000 per month to those who are qualified for the highest positions . How they spend their moments of time determines what their qualifications shall be . Every moment rightly spent qualifies them for higher positions . Every moment misspent has a disqualifying effect . With this opportunity before you , you would feel something of the worth of each moment , and of the importance of spending it rightly . <p> Heaven gives out the announcement that as you spend your moments of life , so shall your eternity be . If you rightly improve the moments , you will be qualified for higher enjoyments and greater riches in eternity . All moments wasted have a woeful disqualifying effect . You shall give an account for every idle word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to render is that these idle words and wasted moments are disqualifying you for heavenly enjoyments . Every moment rightly improved is making you capable of higher felicity in heaven . <p> We see a mother coming with her boys , asking Jesus for a higher position for them in His heavenly kingdom . His reply to her is that such positions are " not mine to give , but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father . " * ( Matthew 20:23 ) And for whom has the Father prepared such positions ? They are prepared for all those who prepare for the position . There is a place close up at the right hand of Jesus for all those who will qualify for the place . How you spend lifes moments determines what positions you will occupy in glory . You will fit into the place for which you are fitted . <p> Young people , you have this matter in your own hands . How you spend the moments of this day goes to determine what your position in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , young man , young woman . You will pass over lifes pathway but once ; yes , but once . And every step you take never can be retaken . You do not have the privilege of trying it over again . If you make a misstep , the best it can doand it should do thisis to help you to not make another one like it . It is true that Jesus can and will forgive us all our missteps , but the effect they leave upon our character will stand through all eternity . By the way you spend the moments of time today you are adding to or diminishing your treasures in heaven . Your mansion in glory will be this evening according to how you spend the moments of the day . <p> There is great responsibility in life . It means much to live . Thank God it is blessed when we hide our life with Christ in God , and live in Him . <h> Reading the Bible <p> Dear young Christians , you have entered into a true relationship to Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace is your consolation , and His joy is your strength . There is a gracious inflow of the life of Christ into your soul that makes you feel like you belong to heaven more than to earth . You have a taste of the love of God and such a consciousness in your heart of His dwelling that you feel like no power can ever separate you from Him . <p> This is a blessed experience , but let me tell you in all seriousness that your keeping this experience is all in your hands . God will help you keep it . He wants to help you keep it , but there is something for you to do . You must work out your salvation ( Philippians 2:12 ) . You need have no tormenting fear about your losing this precious relationship with Jesus ; you can keep it , but there is something for you to do that you might keep it . God has a part in the keeping , and His part is done right along every moment you do your part . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He strikes with you . You act and He acts with you . You put forth effort and He will put His effort in your effort , and your relationship with heaven is kept inviolate . You want to know the secret of being kept , let me whisper it to your inmost soul , " Daily hide the Word of God in your heart . " <p> Every Christian knows that the maintenance of his spiritual life depends upon his daily feeding upon the Word of God , yet in the face of this , how very few feed upon it as they should . Not very many people in these days are taking time to feed their souls . God has the food prepared and set before them , but they must eat or starve . It does seem that a great many have gotten past the hunger point . <p> Our inner peace , our consciousness of Christs presence , our power with God , our fellowship with Him , is in exact proportion to our meditation on His Word . This is a fixed , established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as certain as that cause produces effect . <p> Are you conscious of a lack of spiritual strength , of abiding peace ? You can set it down as a fact you have not been face to face with God in His Word as often as you should . Are you conscious that Christ is not as real to you as He has been or as He should be , or that you have not that joyous fellowship with Jesus that your soul craves ? It is because you have not been as intimate with Christ in His Word as you should have been . <p> I write unto you , young people , to tell you that you can have a lifes walk with God , but it must be in His Word . God will meet you always in His Word . He will meet you there in prayer ; He will meet you there to guide you ; He will meet you there to comfort you ; He will meet you there to walk and talk with you ; He will meet you there face to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight secrets of hiding Gods Word in the heart . <h> 1 : It is the secret of abiding in Him . <p> If we fail to feed upon the sincere milk of the Word , ere we are aware we are cut loose from Christ . The branch , that it may not be detached from the vine , must feed upon the vine . The soul , to abide in Jesus , must feast upon His Word . Dear young man , if you value your souls spiritual welfare , and the highest enjoyment in the world to come , feed daily upon the living Word . Do not read it and believe it only as a matter of history , but hold it before your heart in meditation until the Spirit imprints it there . <h> 2 : It is the secret of prayer . <p> Not many realize this . They are having difficulty to pray free and joyously as they would like , and they wonder what is the cause . Very probably they have not been feeding on the Word of Christ . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prayer . A soul well-fed on the living words of Jesus will pray of itself . It walks , breathes , lives in a spirit of prayer . As you open your Bible in the stillness of the early morning and some gracious promise meets your eye , it awakens a prayer in your heart . Or it may be a word of command , and immediately your soul will rise to God imploring His grace . Or it may be a word of warning that is brought to your heart , which will stir the soul to seek a greater refuge in Christ . Or it may be a word bringing hope of a blessed immortality with Jesus , which will gladden the heart with the prayer of thanksgiving . The young man or woman who knows God as revealed in His Word is mighty in prayer . <h> 3 : It is the secret of peace . <p> The Word of God is a word of peace . Those who love His law have great peace . To hearken to the commands of the Lord is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled , turn in faith to some promise , and sweet peace will come stealing in , quieting every wave . When there is a raging storm on the sea of life , turn to the blessed Bible and you will hear a voice saying , " Peace , be still . " * ( Mark 4:39 ) <h> 4 : It is the purified seven times . " * ( Psalm 12:6 ) To keep the fountain of your life pure , keep it filled with the pure Word of Christ . The life that flows from a heart in which the Word of Christ is dwelling richly is a pure life . The mind that is well stored with the Word of God is not troubled with vain and impure thoughts . <h> 5 : It is the secret of strength . <p> Would you be strong , young man or young woman , to resist temptation and keep your soul a conqueror over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then feed your heart daily on the Word of God . Jesus met the tempter with the Word . There is power in the gospel of Christ . There is power to make you an overcomer in all the battles of life . Oh , how our heart has been made to weep at beholding the weakness of many of Gods children . Some are too weak to testify in public , or to pray , or teach a Sunday School class . A few good feedings upon the Word of God will put strength in them . Your power to do the work of God is in proportion to your feeding on the words of Christ . <h> 6 : It is the secret of perception . <p> If you would have a clear view of the true path of life , read the Bible very much . It will be a light to guide your feet . In these days we need to keep a keen spiritual perception . Keep Christ in view . Keep heaven in view . Keep your title to a mansion in the skies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have spiritual understanding ( Colossians 1:9 ) . The way to have it is to hide Gods Word in the heart . If you will give yourself to daily thought and prayerful meditation on the Word of Christ , you will have better understanding of spiritual things than many theologians . Never can man , with all his intellectual capacity , have spiritual understanding by judging from things natural . <h> 7 : It is the secret of guidance . <p> There are many by-paths and pitfalls lying close along the path of life . We need the guidance of the blessed Bible . A certain pastor said to a young sister that there was no harm in going to see a certain show in a theater . The young sister replied , " There is something in my heart that reads differently . " What was it that read differently ? It was the law of God . Have you made a study of the picture in the heading of the little paper The Path of Life ? The young girl is walking the true pathway . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has the Bible in her hand and she is reading it . There are mountains of difficulties on the left hand and deep pitfalls on the right hand , but her pathway lies straight between . By her following the Bible , she will keep clear from both . Read and meditate much in the law of the Lord and you will be kept from the by-paths of worldliness and sin . <h> 8 : It is the secret of spiritual growth . <p> " As newborn babes , desire the sincere milk of the word , that ye may grow thereby . " * ( 1 Peter 2:2 ) There is no need of backsliding . There is no necessity of spiritual declension . By the daily hiding of Gods Word in the heart , you will grow stronger and stronger in the spiritual life . You see a young man or woman who is a real stalwart saintand thank God there are someand they will tell you that the secret of their strength is the spending of much time in reading and meditating on the law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word about how to read the Bible . Upon taking up the Book to read , lift your heart to God for a moment imploring the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit . <p> Yield the whole heart to God ; open the door wide that the truth might enter in . <p> Meditate on each text . Is it a warning ? If so , do I heed it ? Is it a command ? If so , do I obey it ? Is it a promise ? If so , do I believe it and fully rely upon it ? Does it teach some heart experience ? If so , do I enjoy the experience ? <p> As you close your Bible , again breathe an earnest prayer that the Holy Spirit will enable you to reproduce in your life the truth you have read today . It is the careful practicing of the Word that fixes it deep in the heart . <h> Reading Good Books <p> The Bible is the Book of books , but there are other good books that will whet the appetite for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for our spiritual advancement is the reading of good spiritual books . Those who do not have a taste for such reading labor at a disadvantage . They need not be discouraged , however ; a taste can be cultivated . The most spiritual men of all ages have been those who had an ardent love for reading spiritual books . <p> The reading of a good spiritual book invigorates the intellect , warms the affections , begets in us a desire for more of Gods fullness , and for greater heavenliness of life . It is especially helpful to prayer . When the mind is dull and the spirits low and we have no inspiration for prayer , the reading of a good spiritual poem will often so stimulate the mind , raise the spirits , and animate the soul , as to make it easy to pray . <p> Too many young people waste moments in day-dreaming . Better be reading some good book that stirs the heart to seek more earnestly the things that are real and true . <h> Following Jesus <p> Young man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Follow me. " * ( Matthew 4:19 ; 16:24 ; 19:21 ; John 10:27 ; 21:19 ) Is this the aim and purpose of your life ? Is it your highest ambition ? Will you make this the dominant purpose of your efforts ? It is the only road to success . Christ is the perfect model of human nature . The teaching of Jesus and the example of Jesus are perfectly adapted to human nature . By this , we mean that man need not be anything but man to follow the teaching and example of Christ ; he does not need to be an angel . Jesus took human nature upon Himself , and His whole life is what human nature calls for and can be . The nature of man finds all its demands met in the life of Christ . <p> Now mans nature is such that he can not attain to perfection of that nature through teaching alone . This is a truth worthy of fullest consideration . A child will never learn how to build a toy house from oral instructions alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Precept alone is not sufficient instruction ; there needs be example . Jesus knew this . He not only gave a code of moral laws , but He also lived out these laws in His human life . Then , young people , you have before you , not only the teachings of Jesus , but you have His example of life also . Now to follow Him is to obey His teaching and live His life . <p> When we become true followers of Christ , then we become patterns for others to follow . The apostle said , " Be ye followers of me , even as I also am of Christ . " * ( 1 Corinthians 11:1 ) We should be able to teach the teaching of Jesus and also live His life . This is life in its highest attainment . This is the perfection of human nature . When man is able to teach the teachings of Jesus and to practice those teachings , then he has risen to the true standard of human life . The nature of man calls for this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left unhindered , will rise to it . The life in the heart of an acorn groans after the fullness of the oak . Under proper conditions , it will rise to that fullness . To follow Jesus is to rise to the fullness of His life . There is something in mans true life that demands this . <h> " Shall Not Want " <p> Blessed experience ! Wanting nothing . Having everything we want . Some of our younger saints may not have arrived at this experience . Older Christians are supposed to have . David said , " The LORD is my shepherd , I shall not want . " * ( Psalm 23:1 ) This seems to have been his experience . We are told in Hebrews 13:5 to be content with such things as we have . To be wishing for something we do not have is proof that we are not content with what we have . <p> Does not the Bible say that there is no want to those that fear Him ? Yes , it says those very words ( Psalm 34:9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not proof that you do not fear God ? The Bible says , " They that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing . " * ( Psalm 34:10 ) If you are wishing and wanting some good thing , is it not proof that you are not seeking the Lord ? Again the Bible says , " No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. " * ( Psalm 84:11 ) If you are wanting and wishing , is it not proof that you are not walking uprightly ? <p> The fact is , we all have what we want . You say that you want more patience , you want more love , you want more power , you want to be more spiritual . We think you are mistaken . We think you have about what you want . <p> Does God want you to be more spiritual ? <p> " Yes , " you say . " I think He does . " <p> If He wants you to be more spiritual and you want to be more spiritual , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us see if we can find it . <p> Suppose you go to the shoe store to get a pair of shoes . You look at a pair that you like very much . You ask the price . The merchant says , " $7.50 . " <p> You look at them a while longer , then you look at others . None of them suit . You come back to the $7.50 pair ; you say , " That is the pair I want . " <p> The merchant says , " That is the pair I want you to have . " <p> Now why do n't  you get what you want ? The fact is , you do n't  really want them . You do n't  want them as you should want them that you might get them . You want something more than you want the shoes . You want the $7.50 more than you want the shoes or you would get them . <p> You do n't  really want more patience , more love , or to be more spiritual . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , just as certain as you would have the shoes if you did not want the $7.50 more . <p> You say , " I do not know what I want more than to be more spiritual . " We can tell you . It is the price it takes to get it . You are not willing to pay the price . Perhaps you do not want to consecrate all to God , or deny yourself , or to wrestle in prayer , or to take the time to read , meditate , and pray that you might be more spiritual . You do not want to give up all those little things that hinder spiritually . <h> Christian Perfection <p> We are taking for granted that you believe in Christian perfection . It is our privilege to be perfect Christians . The Bible unmistakably teaches this . But we may not know in just what Christian perfection consists . At this time we shall speak of only one thing , of perfection in one virtue . It is <h> Perfect Patience <p> The apostle prays that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glorious power , unto all patience . " * ( Colossians 1:11 ) Notice the small word all . Then James says , " But let patience have her perfect work , that ye may be perfect and entire , wanting nothing . " * ( James 1:4 ) It appears , from these words , that we are not perfect except patience has her perfect work , and neither are we entire . If a wheel in a watch is bent out of its proper shape , the watch is not perfect . If patience does not have her perfect work in us , we are not perfect . If all the wheels in the watch are perfect , but one small wheel is missing , then the watch is not entire . If patience does not have her perfect work in us , we are not entireneither perfect nor entire . <p> Now we are to give to every text their proper meaning . This text does not say that we are not to have our patience tried , but it does say that when it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we will do this , it will work the beauty of perfect holiness in our lives . <p> There are two forms or acts of patience . These are very closely associated and spring from the same source , yet they do not affect us just the same . One of the works of patience is to wait for some desired thing without discouragement . Now this means everything . We believe that many people do not get answers to their prayers because they do not wait long enough . They get discouraged and cease to expect or hope . Another form or work of patience is to suffer without murmuring . To wait for something we greatly desire without becoming discouraged and to endure suffering of any kind without complaining requires a Christian fortitude and strength that is not possessed by everyone , but it is the privilege of all . Young Christians should develop in this virtue . <p> You will find at least three especial ways for the exercise of patience , and you will frequently be called upon for this exercise . The first is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if thrown into close contact with each other , do not become more or less a trial to each other . Seldom do we find two people , who if thrown into close contact with each other , do not become more or less a trial to each other . Very few brothers and sisters , husbands and wives but what are some trial to each other betimes . This is no sin , but is an opportunity for the development of patience . <p> Another exercise for patience is toward yourself . You may become impatient with yourself because you are not becoming more patient . You should not grow impatient with yourself because you do not arrive at perfect patience in a week or month or year . Let me tell you now , dear young folks , that perfection of character is not formed in a day . If your progress is slow , be patient with yourself . Real true spiritual progress , as a rule , does not make much showing in a week or month . Maybe at the end of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " progress " is not usually the firmer , nobler , finer quality . <p> The third exercise of patience is toward God . Be patient with God . You say you never get impatient with God . Do not be too sure of this . Do you sometimes get tried because you do not see results ? Do n't  you sometimes become tempted to hurry the Lord up a little ? Are you not sometimes tempted to think your especial work is moving too slowly ? Be careful in this that you do not get a little impatient with God . Wait on Him with patience . <h> Beautifying the Gospel <p> It is true that we can not make the gospel any more beautiful than it is , but we can live in such a way that we can reveal its beauty to others . This is true saintly living . The apostle exhorts us to " let our lives become the gospel of Christ . " * ( Philippians 1:27 ) Let us look , for a moment , at a life that becomes the gospel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus . Open your New Testament to 1 Timothy 1:11 and you will read , " According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God . " If you will read this in the Revised Version , you will get a somewhat different thought . There it reads , " The gospel of the glory of the blessed God . " RV This no doubt , is the meaning of the original text . The gospel is a glorious gospel , but it is glorious only because it declares , or reveals , or sets before us a living picture , clear and unmistakable , the glory of the blessed God . <p> This is the mission of the gospel . It is to unveil and show forth the beauty and glory of Gods character . It is to make all of Him known to us that we should know . God wants to set a picture of Himself before us , and to do this He photographs Himself in the gospel and commits it to us . This is Gods chiefest gift to man . We prize the photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up and behold it . As we look into the countenance , our heart warms afresh with love . The gospel is a picture of Christ . How frequently we should take it up and behold the face of our Savior in its undefiled beauty , and our heart quivers with a sweet rapture , and our soul swells with the emotion of adoring love . <p> Now the gospel as we have it in the New Testament is scarcely sufficient to meet all the purpose and will of God . It seems to come short of satisfying the heart of God . Sometimes a photograph of yourself does not wholly meet your approval . It scarcely does you justice . It appears to be too dim . While the gospel does justice to the character of God , gives no dim picture of Him , yet there is a dimness in the eyes of the people and they can not behold the face of God in the written Word as they can in the life of a Christian . Therefore , young man or woman , God has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has put His gospel in your heart , and as you each day live becoming that gospel , you are giving a picture of God to the world . The dear , unseen face of Christ is made visible in your daily life . Young Christian , you are Gods choicest gift to the world . He is pointing the world to a photograph of Himself as seen in you . Oh , how much depends upon this . God is greatly concerned about your life . He has grace to help you to live in the beauty of holiness . He wants your life to do Him justice . He wants your life to make Him known in the widest and fullest sense . He wants your life to give correct views of Himself . A light you are to be , revealing the character of God . <p> Your daily life a mirror is:Oh , keep it filled with grace , That those who walk a while with youMay see Gods smiling face . <p> Let deeds be done in tender love , As down lifes way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youA photograph of God . <h> Reaching for Light <p> In the material world , all plants reach toward the light . House plants grow toward the window . There is something in the heart of man that reaches up for something more than he can find in the world . It is Christ , the light of the world , that the souls true life is thirsting for . <p> A bulb of a water lily lies in the mud at the bottom of the pond . There is a hidden life in the heart of that bulb that cries for something higher . In its groans and struggles , it begins to rise . A young life springs out and begins rising , nor ceases to rise until it flowers in all the beauty of a water lily at the surface of the water . It then has met all that its life was craving . So there is in the heart of man that something that craves for a certain flowering . There is a life of beauty to which it longs to rise . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the soul , and give it freedom , it will climb upward until it blooms in the full beauty of the life of Jesus . <p> God has given a certain kind of life to every creature , which we call its source or its standard , or type . All life struggles to rise to its own source . The life in the apple seed struggles to rise to a mature apple tree . There is in the heart of everyone a cry for the life of Christ . Christ is the true source of the souls life , and that life can never be satisfied until it rises and blooms in the fullness and beauty of that life . <h> The Blessed God <p> In the apostles words recorded in 1 Timothy 1:11 , which we have quoted before , God is spoken of as " the blessed God . " As we read these words , we feel a need to meditate upon them . <p> In what does the blessedness of God consist ? We conclude that whatever would make God a blessed God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a somewhat similar meaning as happiness , only it is a deeper and richer word . It means the fullest joy , the deepest and highest felicity , the purest ecstasy , the richest and fullest contentment that can be experienced . Such is the blessedness of God ; but in what way does God find such blessedness ? <p> God is not made happy in the way most men seek for happiness . Dear young people , this a lesson you need to learn . We feel so incapable of telling to you , as we would like , how you can be the most and truest blessed and happy . Oh , how our heart sickens as we see how men are trying to find happiness . This world is seeking after pleasure . The highest pleasure they know is gratification of some physical sense . They are seeking for physical thrills . These are mean in comparison to the pleasures of God . Dear young people , go not into the ways of the world to find true pleasure . True happiness is not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight the eyes , that charm the ears , that play upon the feelings , that gratify the physical passions . Alas , how many are bartering away their highest happiness , truest joy for some sensual enjoyment ! O God , save our young people from the allurements of fleshly pleasures . The whole life of many a young man and woman has been wrecked and ruined by a momentary gratification of the flesh . <p> Jesus has taught us that the deepest and purest joys come through sacrifice and suffering . The joy of giving is purer , higher than the joy of receiving . How few have tasted this . The love of God is of such a nature that it finds its highest happiness in suffering for the object loved . Oh , the blessedness of pouring out our life for those we love ! Those who are the most capable of suffering find holiest delights . Multitudes of what many religious professors call " innocent amusements " serve only to dull the sensibilities of the soul to higher and finer joys . Have a care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beware lest they rob your soul of its sensitiveness to the touch of pity and sympathy for souls in the guilt of sin . Beware lest these sensual pleasures relieve your heart of its capability of being burdened for lost , wrecked , and ruined men . <p> It is not in the feast , but in the fast , that we come in touch with the pure joy of the Lord . It is in the agony of prayer that we experience the blessedness of God . It is in travail of soul that we taste of the joy of pain . It is in bearing the cross that we approach nearest to the felicity of heaven . It is in suffering love and sympathetic sorrow that the soul tastes of highest and holiest rapture . The blessedness of God does not consist in forgetting the sorrows of men , but in feeling them . Christ is not blessed in saving Himself , but in saving others . There are some sufferings of Christ yet left behind for you and me to fill up . We fill them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer that we might bring souls lost in sin to the light and love of Jesus . Those who have the spirit of the cross , who are workers with Christ in the great mystery of suffering , have found the secret of the blessedness of God . <p> Jesus said , " These things have I spoken unto you , that my joy might remain in you . " * ( John 15:11 ) The joy of Christ in the life is the highest happiness of man . Dear reader , we implore you to seek for the highest joys , and seek them in the way they are to be found . <h> How to View Lifes Circumstances <p> We want you to fully comprehend the fact that the events of life are not left to blind chance , but all come to us under the government and direction of a good and gracious God . To see the hand of God in every circumstance of life is the only correct view of life for the follower of the Lord . <p> Open your Book to John 12:24-29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice to Jesus . Some of those who heard it said that it thundered and others said it was an angels voice . There is a vast difference between thunder and the voice of an angel . There is also a vast difference in the way people accept the circumstances of life . Some hear nothing but thunder , while others hear an angels voice . <p> A mother had two bright , lovely little girls which were very dear to her . One afternoon both of these girls were brought home from the river where they had drowned . As the mother looked calmly into the faces of her silent dead , she said , " I see God wants all my heart and He shall have it . " Even in such circumstances as this she heard an angels voice . <p> There is an angels voice in every circumstance of life . Dear Lord Jesus , help us all to listen for it . <h> " Keep Thyself Pure " <p> This is our earnest word of exhortation to you , young man , young woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the highest attainment in life . Who can know the worth of purity ? We can know something of its worth by what it cost . It cost the life-blood of the Son of God . That blood is the Fount of purity . <p> The pure soul knows more of the real worth of things than any philosopher can through his philosophy . The pure sees the true worth where true worth belongs . It is only when the eye is single that the body is full of light . It is only when the soul is pure that vision is clear to see things as they are . Moral purity is the sole condition of clear spiritual vision . True beauty is hidden from the sensual . Sensuality blurs and befogs the glass through which the soul should look at the worthwhile things . What transparency is in the crystal , that is what purity is in character . The man of science scans the face of the sky and sees the distant star . The pure in heart look into the face of Jesus and behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom may know much about the works of God , but it is only the pure that know God . Things reveal themselves only to things of like nature . God , being pure , can reveal Himself only to the pure . <p> Man may invent machines whereby he can hear his fellows speaking across the continent , or hear the song of the growing grass ; he may gather pearls from the bottom of the sea ; he may be able to explain the moons control of the tides ; he may be able to analyze the various stratas of the earth ; he may count the stars ; he may weigh the sun ; he may be able to tell you the distance to Arcturusbut if he does not have a pure heart , he can not know God . <p> Not philosophic minds , but pure lives are the worlds best teachers . The poor widow in her mountain cabin who has God in her soul can tell you more about the best things of life than the president of a theological seminary who does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads the way to the worthwhile things of life . Men may teach you much about the mysteries of light , of sound , of electricity , or radio , but it is only the pure that can unfold the mysteries of Gods wonderful economy of grace . Give me the man whose life is pure , though he be one of earths most ignorant , that I may follow him , instead of the man who can exhaust the dictionary in the use of words in lecturing upon the ape theory of the origin of man , or the man who surpasses the oratory of Cicero in denying the virgin birth of Christ . <p> There was an old colored woodcutter who knew no grammar ; never saw inside a school room ; who could not write his name ; could not write a word . But when he prayed you felt that if you had put out your hand you would touch God . Give me such a man for a teacher . An hour in his presence is worth days in the presence of the worldly wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see and know Him . " Blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see God . " * ( Matthew 5:8 ) <p> Young man and young woman , we exhort you to associate with the pure . Shun the association of the impure . Just a little time spent in the presence of the vile and you will lose the clear vision of the delicacy of purity . A few moments contact with the ungodly will haze the mind until it will find it difficult to think the thoughts of God . A good man said , " I would give ten years of my life if I could forget the pictures which one year of my youthful days spent in impure doing has hung in my memory . " <p> " Keep thyself pure . " * ( 1 Timothy 5:22 ) Keep your thoughts pure . The indulgence of impure thoughts foul the very spring of life . A few impure imaginations dim the mind to that which is pure and beautiful . You can not have a high standard of thought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If evil images are tolerated in the silent halls of your imaginations , you will not see the realities and the beauties of worthy things . <h> Saintly Living <p> Saintliness of life lies in doing the will of God . If you desire to live the noblest , purest , and most useful life possible , seek to know the will of God and cheerfully do it when known . If you would live a consistent and acceptable life , do not follow impulses and emotions . The great question of life , dear young Christian , is not , " How do you feel ? " but " How is your will ? " Is it set to do the will of God ? Do not watch impressions so much as the path of duty . When an opportunity is open to you to do some good , do not wait for inward impressions to know if you should do the good . <p> We wish we could make it clear and simple to you , and also to help you to know the importance of keeping your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good common sense and under the control of your will , which is to be in perfect harmony with the will of God . Here lies the secret of success in the Christian life . Do not think that your affections and impressions are indicative of the will of God . Many a life has been wrecked at this point . Real true affections and impressions arise out of the will . To allow the will to be guided by the affections and by impulses is like going out to sea without chart or compass . <p> Some years ago we were called , by a young man , to take a walk with him . Seated under the spreading branches of a maple , he told me what was on his heart . A few years before he had met a young lady at a social gathering . On shaking hands with her , she slightly pressed his hand . A peculiar sensation passed over him . He thought it was love . They married . His life was ruined . His affections and what he thought was love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait to know the will of God . But how to know the will of God is the question . The will of God does not come to guide you by emotions , sensations , impulses so much as by giving you good judgment , sound reason , and clear understanding . A young lady said to us , " I have a strong feeling that I should do such a thing , but my better judgment tells me that I had better not do it . What , " she asked , " shall I do ? " We told her that ninety-nine times out of each hundredif not alwaysthe will of God intertwined with our better judgment instead of with our strong feelings . The will of God is not to be discerned by inward impressions only or mainly , but by reason , providence , sense of duty , and by the Scriptures . <p> " But shall we not love ? " This question was asked by a young lady . It is expected that we love . God made us to love ; but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes all through you and seems to center at the heart . Not that passion that runs away with your will and good common sense , but that pure , calm , sober , sensible passion that arises out of the will , and is kept under its control . <p> Here is a statement we want you to write down in your notebook and refer to frequently : The love of God intertwined and intermingled with your love will never act contrary to , nor seek to control the will of God intermingled and intertwined with your will . <p> Listen , if you have an impression or a notion or ideanot only in sexual matters , but also in spiritual or religious mattersthat is not consistent with good judgment and reason , do not think that such leading is of the Lord . To follow it will mar the beauty of saintly living . <h> Fleeing Youthful Lusts <p> Timothy was a young man . Paul knew the danger of young men being overcome by youthful lusts , therefore exhorts Timothy to " Flee also youthful lusts. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestness of heart , likewise exhort you , young reader , flee away from youthful lusts . Keep away from those things that have any power to allure away from God and spiritual exercise . We could tell you of scores of boys and girls , who were once blessedly saved , but who have gone back into the ways of sin , all because they did not keep aloof from those things that tempt to mind fleshly things . <p> We shall speak of a few of the many alluring things that are calculated to lead the feet of the young Christian away from the true path of life . <h> Evil Companions <p> Many a young Christian has gone down to defeat because of too much association with sinful young people . This does not mean that we can not go among them at all , but it does mean that we are to be guarded and never to come down out of our sacred spiritual realm and strike a line of fellowship or affiliation with them . You should go among them as God leads , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to keep yourself surrounded by a heavenly atmosphere that no spirit of worldliness can penetrate . You are to lift them up . Beware , lest they drag you down . <h> Reading <p> There is much soul-destroying literature in the world today . That is one reason why we need wholesome literature . Do not read fiction ; the cheap , trashy novel is deadly poison to mind and soul . Be sparing even of the reading of the newspaper . It is proper that we know something of what is transpiring in this world in which we live , but there is very much in the newspapers that you should not read . It dwarfs the mind and degenerates the soul . Be very sparing , therefore , of newspaper reading . Too much is a waste of time . Beyond that which is worthy and honorable , present-day history is profitless . <h> Amusements <p> Perhaps more souls have been allured away from right paths by present-day amusements than in any other . There is such a thing as getting such love for God , His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little for any other way in which to spend our time . We willingly admit that there are some recreations and amusements that are harmless and innocent in themselves , but we should have a care lest there be an overindulgence in , and fondness for them . A young lady , speaking of a certain amusement , said , " I am passionately fond of it . " Such is too great a fondness . We should be passionately fond of nothing but God and matters that pertain to His worship and service . No one can have a passionate fondness for any amusement and keep the passion of Christ in his soul . <p> We can not name to you just what amusements are innocent and what are not . Circumstances and conditions have much to do with it . I would advise , however , never to attend anything where the rabble of the world are gathered . You are to learn some things from God yourself . Live much in prayer , whenever you find that any amusement in which you may have some participation betimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible , then cease to have any part in such recreation . <h> The Association of Christians <p> God has made us social creatures and we should associate together . Our constitution calls for it . But young and old should be careful of the spirit of your associations . Christians can associate together and lose spirituality by the manner or spirit in which they have been associated . They can also associate together in such a manner as to be greatly benefited in a spiritual way by the association . But it is very easy for young people to gain a greater love for the association of each other than they have for communion with God . The religious meetings of young people can very easily become a mere social gathering rather than a religious spiritual service . If they are a little watchful they can determine which they enjoy most , the service itself , or the chatting together after the religious service is dismissed . <h> Covered Sins <p> We are told in the Book that they that cover their sins shall not prosper ( Proverbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are done in secret . These secret sins have great power over the youth of today . Flee , young man and woman , in horror , from the first suggestion of the tempter . Keep clean . The Psalm-writer in old age prayed , " Remember not the sins of my youth O LORD . " * ( Psalm 25:7 ) He referred to these secret sins of his life . He looked back , in his declining years , with regret upon those sins of his youth . Save yourselves , young people , of those regrets that will mar the peace of those days when your sun of life is sinking low . Keep your thoughts pure , your acts holy in the days of your youth . Follow after temperance , faith , meekness , purity , and righteousness ( 1 Timothy 6:11 ) . Walk close with God that you may have power over the flesh . We beseech you to heed this advice . <h> Courtship and Marriage <p> We realize something of the delicacy of our subject . There is nothing relating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first act of God after creating man and putting him in the garden was to make a life companion for him . The Creator had put in the constitution of man a desire for companionship . When woman was created , the Lord brought her and presented her to the man . This was the first marriage . The man said , " This is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh . " * ( Genesis 2:23 ) This is marriage . There is no closer contact among mankind . This stands as the highest and most perfect analogy of Christ and the Church . In the spiritual life , Christ is the Bridegroom and the Church is the Bride . They are one . The Church is a member of His flesh and of His bones . The union of man and woman in marriage is the most perfect illustration of this union that nature affords . Marriage is pure , honorable , and heaven-ordained . God ordained the union of man and woman in accordance with their constitutional demands . <p> That which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That which is the highest can fall the farthest . All that is pure in the life of man has been corrupted and perverted by sin . <p> That man and woman might live together agreeable and happy , God put in their nature a quality called , in our English language , love . Now man in his entire nature has more than one love or one kind of love . Man has at least four loves . These are different in their nature . A man loves his wife or a young man loves his maiden . This is love of the sexes . The Greek has a special word for this kind of love . A mother loves her child . This is different love to that of man for his wife . We in our English language use the same word , but the Greek does not . Then there is the love of society . This love has a nature of its own . And man is to love his enemies . This again is different from any other sort of love in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man loving his friend , he uses a different word than that which he uses when speaking of a man loving his enemies . This same is true when speaking of a young man loving his sister and a young man loving his maiden . <p> We are now to talk about the love of the sexes . This , as given of God , is pure . But this , like other God-given passions , can be corrupted , and perhaps no pure virtue ever given to man has been so shamefully corrupted as this love of man and woman . This love of the sexes corrupted has occasioned more crime than perhaps any other perverted quality in the nature of man . It oftentimes overpowers all other love . Just a few days ago in a nearby town a young mother killed her own child through the influence of this abused love of the sexes . This love corrupted has led multiplied thousands into marriage . Wrecked and ruined lives occasioned by this perverted love are all around us . It is not love , but lust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of love . Dear young saints , beware . You need to live very close to God and keep your affections pure . An amorous feeling may be very deceptive . It may become a clever counterfeit of love . <p> A young man asks , " Does God have a part in the matter of marriage ? Will He select a companion for me ? " Just as truly as He made Eve for Adam , or selected a wife for Isaac . Young saints , wait on God . That mad thing called lustand that is its namehas rushed many a one ahead of God . God will get a companion for you if you will but await His time . When two are in what they call love , it is difficult for them to wait . School boys and girls are getting married . How many times did you ever know such to result in the greatest happiness and usefulness to such young people ? Not once in ten . This should be a warning to you . When two are in love , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs be a perfect yielding to the will of God . It is one of the most difficult periods in the life of man for him to yield his will to God . Many have thought they had , but were mistaken . A young man says , " I thought I had my will entirely surrendered to God , but when I prayed and my lips said , Lord Thy will be done , my heart said , But give me Betty. " Watch your heart , young Christian . Do not give too much heed to what the lips say . Listen to the heartbeats . Does it beat in perfect unison with the will of God ? <p> God wants you to be guided , not by your feelings , but by His providences , by the counsels of true friends , and by the good , sound mind He is willing to give you . Do not think , young man , because you have a peculiar feeling and a fluttering of the heart when you come into the presence of a young woman that God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be guarded . A young lady can be so possessed with an amorous feeling or sexual fondness that she will cause you to have a peculiar feeling when you come into her presence . There will be a drawing power . Down in your heart of hearts you feel a drawing back , but there is a power that draws you on . Awful danger here . Many have been overcome by this drawing power to their ruin . Many a young man has been overcome by that strong feeling of sexual fondness gushing out of the life of a woman to him . It strikes like a dart to his heart . Her words , her eyes , her caresses are filled with an alluring power . Young man , " Let not thine heart decline to her ways , go not astray in her paths . For she hath cast down many wounded : yea , many strong men have been slain by her . Her house is the way to hell , going down to the chambers of death . " * ( Proverbs 7:25-27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by designing men . The innocent , also , have mistaken a sexual fondness for true love and have become sadly mis-mated . <p> The question is often asked , " At what age should young people marry ? " We would answer , " Whenever God wills and no earlier . " We can not set an age for all . Some arrive at a proper age earlier than others . A few never arrive at the proper age . <p> We have now a letter before us from a precious , young brother which reads , " Now concerning the matter of which I wrote you , I will say that I have simply placed it in His hands and He will take care of it perfectly . I am waiting on Him . " How sensible . If you wait on God , you will not marry too early . Young school boys and girls sometimesperhaps we had better say , often timesget a fondness for each other and think they should marry . Instead of entering into a courtship , they better keep out of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out if that attachment was occasioned by pure love or was a silly sexual fondness . We do not mean that sexual fondness is silly . That of itself is pure , but it makes some young people silly , and some older ones too , for that matter . <p> Boys and girls arrive at an age when they develop a fondness for each other . Not only is this not the age for marriage , but neither is it the age for courtship . For a young fourteen-year-old boy and a thirteen-year-old girl to enter into a courtship because they have a fondness for each other is very unwise . Many a life has been ruined because of giving place to this fondness . If they will keep out of company of each other for a short time , that thing they thought was love will pass away like a morning vapor . <p> Our young people need the prayers of older Christians . They need sensible Christian counsel . They need firm , loving , parental authority . And they need , most of all , a heart consecrated to the will of God .

Many of those who do evil while they desire to do good refer us to Pauls experience . Paul did have such an experience , but it was because he had not begun right . Later he went back to the beginning and started right .

@@72205311 @905311/ <h> The Joy and Blessings of a Christian Life <p> The pathway of life has its shadows and sunshine , its pleasures and sorrows ; and in the Christian life , I am convinced , many people live in the shadow more than in the sunshine , when they could very well have it otherwise . <p> When I was about thirteen years of age , I yielded myself to the Lord and made a decision to spend my life in His service . Since that time , like Christian in Bunyans Pilgrims Progress , I have met with many and varied experiences . But one beautiful and encouraging thought has been that , no matter how hard my trials , how near my strength was gone , nor how close my courage came to failing , just at that time , when I was the most helpless , God was always present to help , either by His Spirit or by sending one of His servants to encourage and strengthen me . <p> I have , indeed , found the Christian life to be a warfare . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the forces of evil to battle against , but God has made provision whereby every child of God can be an overcomer in every conflict . The one who has a firm decision to be true at any cost will receive such power and help that Satan can not prevent him from serving the Lord . The enemy may try to hinder by causing trials , difficulties , and perplexities , and at times the way may seem dark , with no apparent hope of day ; but our God , who is mighty , will turn all these seeming hindrances into real blessings and make them stepping-stones to glory . <p> In my youthful days I felt a deep desire to work for God and longed to fill some place in life where I could feel that I not only was living a life of salvation , but was really engaged in my Masters service . As I knelt in earnest prayer and consecrated myself fully to the Lord for Him to direct me as seemed best , a dark sorrow filled my heart ; for Satan whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand against the powers of evil that all young people must meet . Your covenant with the Lord is too great for you to keep . " But with tears I cried unto the Lord to know if these suggestions were true . At that moment the Lord gave me the assurance that if I decided to serve Him He would teach me how to do so . He would give me grace in every time of need . <p> Sometime after this I became very i 'll and knew that unless God came to my aid I should soon have to leave this world . As I thought of my condition , a joy filled my soul that I might soon be with the Lord . With this joy came also a sadness , as I realized that I had done nothing in the vineyard of the Lord . It seemed that I could not bear to go empty-handed . I prayed God to spare my life that I might work for Him . He graciously and instantly touched my body with His healing power , and in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to make a decision and take a step that would have hindered me from filling the place the Lord designed I should fill . At that moment the Lord made known to me by His Holy Spirit in such a way that I could not question His leadings that He had called me to His service , and also made known to me the place that I was chosen to fill . Immediately I was reminded of my covenant with the Lord , although I had to stand against the pleadings and earnest entreaties of some of my very dear friends . <p> Before this I had decided not to leave my mother , but to work near my home so that I could readily respond in case of sickness . After considerable meditation about the matter of leaving my father and mother , brothers and sisters , in order to take up my work for the Lord , the matter became very serious . Finally I went to the Lord one morning in earnest prayer . I shall never forget that season of prayer , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My consecration was put to a test as one question after another was presented , as to whether or not I should be willing to die , to really give my life , if God so designed , that my unsaved loved ones might be saved , or to do the same for lost souls who were not dear to me according to the ties of nature . And again , should I be willing to give my life for lost sinners and have them scoff and spurn me ? These were hard questions , but my heart said , " Lord , Thy will be done . Where thou leadest I will follow . " I was solemnly impressed with the thought : Jesus came to save a lost world , but they crucified Him ; instead of accepting His love , they rejected it . <p> Within a short time I had the matter settled beyond a doubt that the time had come for me to enter upon the mission whereunto the Lord had called me . The way began to open before me , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my soul that my decision and action was in accordance with His will .

I was trying hard to be an overcomer and to cast every burden upon the Lord . The enemy would suggest that it was of no use for me to try to stand against the things that were oppressing me and that it would be better to surrender , and even give place to discouragements , and that even if I should come out a conqueror later , no one would ever know anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon further consideration I said : " No , I will not surrender .

Occasionally the trials would lift and God would bless my soul , but again the darkness of depressions would settle over me . I began to weary and to long for deliverance . The suggestion came that it would be better for me to cease serving God and never to try again . Over and over something whispered that there was no use to continue ; that if others who were older and better qualified fell by the wayside and could not stand , there was positively no use in my trying . Finally the enemy insisted that there was nothing else for me to do than to give up , and that , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no hope for me . At this point I discerned that it was the enemy , and , kneeling before God , I promised Him that if He could get more glory out of my life by my being in such a trial all the rest of my days , I was willing to submit to the trial . When I came to this decision my trial vanished suddenly , and God poured the glory into my soul and the victory was far sweeter than the trial had been bitter . <p> Sometimes I have had trials in which I could see no good nor from which I could not perceive how any good could possibly result ; but later I would be enabled to know that those very trials were worth more to me than any treasure this earth could afford . <p> As I look upon my past life and see how mercifully God has dealt with me , how He has guided and protected , and how He has shielded me from the power of the tempter , my heart cries out , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

He will cease to be obedient when opportunity permits . This is the obedience that criminals give to laws , slaves to their masters , and which many children give to their parents and teachers .

When the lesson of self-government is learned , one of lifes greatest victories is won . <p> The girl who comes to perfect womanhood must learn to be obedient . Her whole life must be governed , not by whim or pleasure , but by right and duty . Her first lessons of obedience are learned at home . She becomes aware that all things are not for her personal convenience and pleasure , but that she must do her part in service , restraint , and sacrifice , that home may be orderly and happy .

But every girl does not have the same hard battle with it . Here is one point where she who is blest with a humble and submissive nature has the advantage . She can do quite naturally what her willful and rebellious sister will have to struggle hard to accomplish . Many girls are like my little friend Betty .

She followed the dictates of her own free will . It is true that to do this she had to keep within the bounds of law and order ; but she found that no bondage . Now , however , since duty beckons her she is pressed on every side . There is scarcely any time she can call her own . She must do her duty or lose her own self-respect .

They speak as if in some way the curse had been taken off the world , and its nature somehow softened .

They regard the work of the church as being to permeate the world with a Christian spirit and take possession of it .

They say that the church has the power , and even duty , of taking possession of the world " for God . " This is certainly not what Scripture teaches . The cross removes the curse from the believer , not from the world . Whatever has sin in it , has the curse on it as much as ever .

There are many who profess to make their boast in the cross , and count their faith in the righteousness of Christ as our justification before God , as the great proof of their faithfulness to Scripture . And yet , in their wholehearted enjoyment and toleration and participation of what is of the spirit of this world , they prove that the glorying in a cross which crucifies the world has no real place in their religion . The cross that atones , and the world that crucified , are astonishingly at peace .

He may have to pray fervently at times , sometimes wrestle unto the breaking of the day ; but if he is earnest enough , God will tell him something . God will grant him the petition or tell him he will not grant it or tell him to wait and He will answer later . To go to God with a petition and come away and know nothing is to show indolence . Prayer is a mental effort . We are to pray in the Spirit , certainly , but we can not pray without taking thought . We can pray with the mind and not pray from the heart ; but it is certain we can not pray from the heart without praying with the mind . The schoolboy sometimes meets with a puzzling problem in his mathematics , one that requires him to put forth great mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to grasp other and more difficult problems . God sometimes brings us face to face with difficult problems , problems that can be solved only by earnest effort . This must needs be , in order that we may be able to grasp the deeper things of God . It is true we can become habituated to prayer , as the pianist to playing , so that but little mental effort will be required . But we must be very constant in prayer and keep a truly devotional spirit , or the mind will wander and we shall have to pay the penalty of mental toil to get our thoughts back in the right channel again . <p> There are times when the Christian finds it easy to pray . The Spirit seems to have touched the mind and unsealed the fountain of thought , so that the thoughts flow out so spontaneously that the mind is not conscious of any effort . Then how blessed it is to pray ! But is it always so ? It is well for us that it is not . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the accident , but the adept . It is when but little mental effort is required that the performer becomes careless and neglectful . But however skilled we may become in the art of prayer , God will bring us face to face betimes , so that He might save us from neglect with difficulties and will hide His face from us , resulting from a lack of anything upon which to exercise the mind and heart . If we become indolent and will not strive in prayer , then we shall become very feeble in prayer . This will be especially in secret prayer . <p> The apostle says , " Now I beseech you , brethren , for the Lord Jesus Christs sake , and for the love of the Spirit , that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me. " * ( Romans 15:30 ) " Agonize together with me " ( Rotherham ) . This earnestness , this agonizing was for Jesus sake and the love of the Spirit . We are not on unscriptural grounds when we exhort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lament : " There is none that calleth upon thy name , that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee . " * ( Isaiah 64:7 ) It is by faith that we behold God , yet the clearer the intellect , the more vivid will be our conceptions of Him . There can be no profound feeling in our soul without vividness of thought in beholding the beauty of the Lord . The apostle to the Gentiles , after recounting a number of the hardships of his Christian warfare , said , " Beside those things that are without , that which cometh upon me daily , the care of all the churches . " * ( 2 Corinthians 11:28 ) From the language used and the order it is in , we naturally conclude that the care of the churches , concerned him more than all his perils , persecutions , and hardships . If he had such care for the churches , what must have been his prayers for them ? In his Colossian letter , he tells us something of his conflict and agony in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his working , which worketh in me mightily . For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you , and for them at Laodicea , and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh . " * ( Colossians 1:29-2:1 ) I wish you would read the above quotations over again carefully , and from them picture to your mind something of the earnestness of his prayer . It was no drowsy , droning prayer . In the Greek , the labor and striving here is the same as in chapter 4:12 , where Epaphras is spoken of as " laboring fervently . " It is the same down to the ground . " We have the same in the Greek again in Luke 13:24 : " Strive to enter in at the strait gate . " The thought here is " a struggle for the masteryforcing ones way in . " " Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not be able , " for none but " this violence " will ever take the kingdom of God . <p> Fervency in prayer is a good preventive of thought-wandering . Many persons are seriously troubled by the wandering of their thoughts . This very often is because of mental indolence and lack of earnest mental discipline . Be earnest and fervent in your prayers . Gird up the loins of your mind and center your thoughts on God . <p> Importunity is not only reiteration of the petition but also earnestness in the petition . In importuning the throne of grace each coming should be more pressing and earnest . Fervency and perseverance make us conquerors over that which is otherwise unconquerable . In the parable of the widow and unjust judge , Jesus teaches us the value and the necessity of importunity . Do we get the full import of His teaching in this parable ? The widow kept coming ( Luke 18:5 ) . She would not be denied . Wearied by her continual coming , the judge granted her request . If an unrighteous judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was an object of contempt , can not the righteous Lord , whose name is Love , be persuaded to hear the prayers of those who cry unto Him day and night ? He can . See to it that you cry " strong crying and tears " * ( Hebrews 5:7 ) and not sigh , a mere wish ; and let the crying unto God be day and night . Though your prayer be seemingly rejected , do not cease your crying . Pray on until you get a definite answer . Jesus did not give the Syrophenician woman a positive refusal . He only said , " Let the children first be filled : for it is not meet to take the childrens bread , and to cast it unto the dogs . " * ( Mark 7:27 ) There was yet some hope for her . " There may be , " she thought , " a crumb left after the children have been filled . " She was not denied this . Be willing to take the answer in the most humiliating way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly deaf to your cry . Perhaps He wants you to become more humble and earnest . Be willing for Him to answer in His way . But pray on . The very fact that He has not positively denied you is some hope that He will hear you . Only get more earnest and humble . The apostle Paul prayed three times before he received a definite answer . I think that he would have prayed many times more if it had been necessary . <p> The Spirit gives us heavenly visions . The vision may be the meekness , patience . tenderness , sympathy , or love of Jesus . Desire springs up in our hearts to possess that meekness or whatever it may be . Give vent to that desire ; ask , seek , knock , strive , and wrestle for that excellence , and He will surely give it . But He will not bestow His graces where they are not longed for and eagerly sought . <p> " Longing is Gods fresh , heavenward willWith our poor earthward striving ; We quench it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hearts full scopeWhich we are hourly wronging , Our lives must climb from hope to hopeAnd realize our longing . " 1 <p> 1 : <p> James Russell Lowell ; " Longing " <p> In closing this chapter , I will relate a story I read about an ant . A warrior was once forced to take shelter from his enemies in a ruined building , where he sat alone for many hours . To divert his mind from his hopeless condition , he fixed his observation upon an ant that was carrying a grain of corn larger than itself up a wall . He numbered the efforts it made to accomplish this object . The grain fell sixty-nine times to the ground , but the insect persevered , and the seventieth time it reached the top of the wall . May the Lord help His saints to be fervent and persevering in prayer . Pray until you get an answer . 
@@72205373 @905373/ <h> Concerning Temptation <p> Certain very great mistakes are made concerning this matter of temptation , in the practical working out of this life of faith . <p> First of all , people seem to expect that , after the soul has entered into its rest in God , temptations will cease ; and to think that the promised deliverance is not only to be from yielding to temptation , but even also from being tempted . Consequently , when they find the Canaanite still in the land , and see the cities great and walled up to Heaven , they are utterly discouraged , and think they must have gone wrong in some way , and that this can not be the true land after all . <p> Then , next they make the mistake of looking upon temptation as sin , and of blaming themselves for what in reality is the fault of the enemy only . This brings them into condemnation and discouragement ; and discouragement , if continued in , always ends at last in actual sin . The enemy makes an easy prey of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very fear of having fallen . <p> To meet the first of these difficulties it is only necessary to refer to the Scripture declarations , that the Christian life is to be throughout a warfare ; and that , especially when seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus , we are to wrestle against spiritual enemies there , whose power and skill to tempt us must doubtless be far superior to any we have ever heretofore encountered . As a fact , temptations generally increase in strength tenfold after we have entered into the interior life , rather than decrease ; and no amount or sort of them must ever for a moment lead us to suppose we have not really found the true abiding place . Strong temptations are generally a sign of great grace , rather than of little grace . When the children of Israel had first left Egypt , the Lord did not lead them through the country of the Philistines , although that was the nearest way ; for God said , " Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) But afterwards , when they learned better how to trust Him , He permitted their enemies to attack them . Then also in their wilderness journey they met with but few enemies and fought but few battles , compared to those in the land , where they found seven great nations and thirty-one kings to be conquered , besides walled cities to be taken , and giants to be overcome . <p> They could not have fought with the Canaanites , or the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , until they had gone into the land where these enemies were . And the very power of your temptations , dear Christian , therefore , may perhaps be one of the strongest proofs that you really are in the land you have been seeking to enter , because they are temptations peculiar to that land . You must never allow your temptations to cause you to question the fact of your having entered the promised " heavenly places . " <p> The second mistake is not quite so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that temptation is not sin , and yet most of the distress about it arises from not understanding this fact . The very suggestion of wrong seems to bring pollution with it , and the evil agency not being recognized , the poor , tempted soul begins to feel as if it must be very bad indeed , and very far off from God to have had such thoughts and suggestions . It is as though a burglar should break into a mans house to steal , and , when the master of the house began to resist him and to drive him out , should turn round and accuse the owner of being himself the thief . It is the enemys grand ruse for entrapping us . He comes and whispers suggestions of evil to us , doubts , blasphemies , jealousies , envyings , and pride ; and then turns round and says , " Oh , how wicked you must be to think of such things ! It is very plain that you are not trusting the Lord ; for if you were , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your heart . " This reasoning sounds so very plausible that the soul often accepts it as true , and at once comes under condemnation , and is filled with discouragement ; then it is easy for it to be led on into actual sin . One of the most fatal things in the life of faith is discouragement . One of the most helpful is cheerfulness . A very wise man once said that in overcoming temptations , cheerfulness was the first thing , cheerfulness the second , and cheerfulness the third . We must expect to conquer . That is why the Lord said so often to Joshua , " Be strong and of a good courage " * ( Joshua 1:6,9,18 ) ; " Be not afraid , neither be thou dismayed " * ( Joshua 1:9 ) ; " Only be thou strong and very courageous . " * ( Joshua 1:7 ) And it is also the reason He says to us , " Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid . " * ( John 14:27 ) The power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The enemy knows this well , and always begins his assaults by discouraging us , if it can in any way be accomplished . <p> Sometimes this discouragement arises from what we think is a righteous grief and disgust at ourselves that such things could be any temptation to us ; but which is really a mortification arising from the fact that we have been indulging in a secret self-congratulation that our tastes were too pure , or our separation from the world was too complete for such things to tempt us . We have expected something from ourselves , and have been sorely disappointed not to find that something there , and are discouraged in consequence . This mortification and discouragement are really a far worse condition than the temptation itself , though they present an appearance of true humility , for they are nothing but the results of wounded self-love . True humility can bear to see its own utter weakness and foolishness revealed , because it never expected anything from itself , and knows that its only hope and expectation must be in God . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives it to a deeper and more utter trust . But the counterfeit humility which springs from self , plunges the soul into the depths of a faithless discouragement , and drives it into the very sin at which it is so distressed . <p> I remember once hearing an allegory that illustrated this to me wonderfully . Satan called together a council of his servants to consult how they might make a good man sin . One evil spirit started up and said , " I will make him sin . " <p> " How will you do it ? " asked Satan . <p> " I will set before him the pleasures of sin , " was the reply ; " I will tell him of its delights and the rich rewards it brings . " <p> " Ah , " said Satan , " that will not do ; he has tried , it , and knows better than that . " <p> Then another spirit started up and said , " I will make him sin . " <p> " What will you do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pains and sorrows of virtue . I will show him that virtue has no delights , and brings no rewards . " <p> " Ah , no ! " exclaimed Satan , " that will not do at all ; for he has tried it , and knows that wisdoms ways are ways of pleasantness , and all her paths are peace.* ( Proverbs 3:17 ) " <p> " Well , " said another imp , starting up , " I will undertake to make him sin . " <p> " And what will you do ? " asked Satan , again . " I will discourage his soul , " was the short reply . <p> An old writer says , " All discouragement is from the devil " ; and I wish every Christian would just take this as a pocket-piece , and never forget it . We must fly from discouragement as we would from sin . <p> But this is impossible if we fail to recognize the true agency in temptation . For if the temptations are our own fault , we can not help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " Blessed is the man that endureth temptation " * ( James 1:12 ) ; and we are exhorted to " count it all joy when we fall into divers temptations. " * ( James 1:2 ) Temptation , therefore , can not be sin ; and the truth is , it is no more a sin to hear these whispers and suggestions of evil in our souls , than it is for us to hear the swearing or wicked talk of bad men as we pass along the street . The sin only comes in either case by our stopping and joining in with them . If , when the wicked suggestions come , we turn from them at once , as we would from wicked talk , and pay no more attention to them , we do not sin . But if we carry them on in our minds , and roll them under our tongues , and dwell on them with a half-consent of our will to them as true , then we sin . We may be enticed by evil a thousand times a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enticings . But if the enemy can succeed in making us think that his enticings are our sin , he has accomplished half the battle , and can hardly fail to gain a complete victory . <p> A dear lady once came to me under great darkness , simply from not understanding this . She had been living very happily in the life of faith for some time , and had been so free from temptation as almost to begin to think she would never be tempted any more . But suddenly a very peculiar form of temptation had assailed her , which had horrified her . She found that the moment she began to pray , dreadful thoughts of all kinds would rush into her mind . She had lived a very sheltered , innocent life , and these thoughts seemed so awful to her , that she felt she must be one of the most wicked of sinners to be capable of having them . She began by thinking she could not possibly have entered into the rest of faith , and ended by concluding that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agony of distress . I told her that these dreadful thoughts were altogether the suggestions of the enemy , who came to her the moment she kneeled in prayer , and poured them into her mind , and that she herself was not to blame for them at all ; that she could not help them any more than she could help hearing if a wicked man should pour out his blasphemies in her presence . And I urged her to recognize and treat them as from the enemy ; not to blame herself or be discouraged , but to turn at once to Jesus and commit them to Him . I showed her how great an advantage the enemy had gained by making her think these thoughts were originated by herself , and plunging her into condemnation and discouragement on account of them . And I assured her she would find a speedy victory if she would pay no attention to them ; but , ignoring their presence , would simply turn her back on them and look to the Lord . <p> She grasped the truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy , " I have found you out now . It is you who are suggesting these dreadful thoughts to me , and I hate them , and will have nothing to do with them . The Lord is my Savior ; I take them to Him , and settle them in His presence . " Immediately the baffled enemy , finding himself discovered , fled in confusion , and her soul was perfectly delivered . <p> Another thing also . The enemy knows that if a Christian recognizes a suggestion of evil as coming from him , he will recoil from it far more quickly than if it seems to be the suggestion of his own mind . If Satan prefaced each temptation with the words , " I am Satan , your relentless enemy ; I have come to make you sin , " I suppose we would hardly feel any desire at all to yield to his suggestions . He has to hide himself in order to make his baits attractive . And our victory will be far more easily gained if we are not ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first approach . <p> We also make another great mistake about temptations in thinking that all time spent in combating them is lost . Hours pass , and we seem to have made no progress , because we have been so beset with temptations . But it often happens that we have been serving God far more truly during these hours , than in our times of comparative freedom from temptation . Temptation is really more the devils wrath against God , than against us . He can not touch our Savior , but he can wound our Savior by conquering us , and our ruin is important to him only as it accomplishes this . We are , therefore , really fighting our Lords battles when we are fighting temptation , and hours are often worth days to us under these circumstances . We read , " Blessed is the man that endureth temptation , " and I am sure this means enduring the continuance of it and its frequent recurrence . Nothing so cultivates the grace of patience as the endurance of temptation , and nothing so drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its continuance . And finally , nothing brings more praise and honor and glory to our dearest Lord Himself , than the trial of our faith which comes through manifold temptations . We are told that it is more precious than gold , though it be tried with fire , and that we , who patiently endure the trial , shall receive for our reward " the crown of life , which the Lord hath promised to them that love him . " * ( James 1:12 ) <p> We can not wonder , therefore , any longer at the exhortation with which the Holy Ghost opens , wanting nothing . " * ( James 1:2-4 ) <p> Temptation is plainly to be the blessed instrument used by God to complete our perfection , and thus the enemys own weapons are turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things , even temptations , can work together for good to them that love God ( Romans 8:28 ) . <p> As to the way of victory over temptations , it seems hardly necessary to say to those whom I am at this time especially addressing , that it is to be by faith . For this is , of course , the foundation upon which the whole interior life rests . Our one great motto is throughout , " We are nothing , Christ is all . " And always and everywhere we have started out to stand , and walk , and overcome , and live by faith . We have discovered our own utter helplessness , and know that we can not do anything for ourselves . Our only way , therefore , is to hand the temptation over to our Lord , and trust Him to conquer it for us . But when we put it into His hands we must leave it there . It must be as real a committing of ourselves to Him for victory , as it was at first a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do all for us in the one case , as completely as in the other . It was faith only then , and it must be faith only now . <p> And the victories which the Lord works in conquering the temptations of those who thus trust Him are nothing short of miracles , as thousands can testify . <p> But into this part of the subject I can not go at present , as my object has been rather to present temptation in its true light , than to develop the way of victory over it . I want to deliver conscientious , faithful souls from the bondage into which they are sure to be brought , if they fail to understand the true nature and use of temptation , and confound it with sin . I want that they should not be ignorant of the fact that temptations are , after all , an invaluable part of our souls development ; and that , whatever may be their original source , they are used by God to work out in us many blessed graces of character which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God also , superintending and controlling its power . " Where wert thou , Lord , while I was being tempted ? " cried the saint of the desert . " Close beside thee , my son , all the while , " was the tender reply . <p> Temptations try us ; and we are worth nothing if we are not tried . They develop our spiritual strength and courage and knowledge ; and our development is the one thing God cries for . How shallow would all our spirituality be if it them that love him . " * ( James 1:12 ) This " crown of life " will be worth all that it has cost of trial and endurance to obtain it ; and without these it could not be attained . <p> An invalid lady procured once the cocoon of a very beautiful butterfly with unusually magnificent wings , hoping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her sick-chamber . She watched it eagerly as spring drew on , and finally was delighted to see the butterfly beginning to emerge . But it seemed to have great difficulty . It pushed , and strained , and struggled , and seemed to make so little headway , that she concluded it must need some help , and with a pair of delicate scissors she finally clipped the tight cord that seemed to bind in the opening of the cocoon . Immediately the cocoon opened wide , and the butterfly escaped without any further struggle . She congratulated herself on the success of her experiment , but found in a moment that something was the matter with the butterfly . It was all out of the cocoon it is true , but its great wings were lifeless and colorless , and dragged after it as a useless burden . For a few days it lived a miserable sickly life , and then died , without having once lifted its powerless wings . The lady was sorely disappointed and could not understand it . But when she related the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had all been her own fault . That it required just that pushing and struggling to send the life fluid into the veins of the wings , and that her mistaken kindness in shortening the struggle , had left the wings lifeless and colorless . <p> Just so do our spiritual wings need the struggle and effort of our conflict with temptation and trial ; and to grant us an escape from it would be to weaken the power of our soul to " mount up with wings as eagles , " * ( Isaiah 40:31 ) and would deprive us of the " crown of life " which is promised to those who endure .

To join a sectarian denomination is never by divine prompting , but is urged from human source . A young convert possessing the spirit of Christ is naturally at home in the Lord and with Christians anywhere . It is foreign to that spirit for one to limit oneself by subscribing to any particular creed of men . Accordingly , our young brother was only " acting natural " when he manifested no particular anxiety to " join the church . " Representatives of the denominations in his neighborhood proposed to him and presented their articles of faith . The fact that he referred the great question to the Scriptures and could see no authority for joining anything not recognized in the Scriptures shows that he was already poor material for sectarian construction , at least so far as the common arguments for sects go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was persuaded . The followers of John Winebrenner called themselves the Church of God . As they professed to hold to no creed but the Bible , repudiated sectarianism , baptized by immersion , and observed as an ordinance the washing of feet in conjunction with the Lords Supper , all of which seemed good to him , and especially as they had the exact New Testament name for the true church , he was constrained to unite with that body . The mark of fellowship which differentiated them from other Christians and constituted them a sect was not apparent to him , and so , even during the many years of his earlier ministerial career , he identified this body with the true church . He said in later years that he had more liberty as a minister before he took that step than he had during the years he belonged to the denomination , which after all was but a sect . <p> The Church of God , spelled with a capital C , and more fully denominated " General Eldership of the Churches of God in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1830 . Winebrenner had been baptized and confirmed in the German Reformed Church ( now the Reformed Church in the United States ) , and was given the pastorate at Harrisburg . He was a good man and the work of the ministry became the uppermost desire of his heart . He sought to raise the standard of true piety . His earnest preaching resulted in a revival in which he opposed theaters , dancing , gambling , lotteries , and racing . Revivals of religion were new experiences in the churches of that region , so that his ministry awakened strong opposition , which resulted in official charges against him . He severed his relations with the Reformed Church but continued his ministry , extensive revivals following . <p> Dr. C. H. Forney , in his History of the Churches of God , says : <p> Winebrenner did not entertain the purpose of founding a new denomination . These bodies he stigmatized as sects . Professor Nevin called the United Brethren and like bodies " rolling balls , " and accused Winebrenner with " putting in motion a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not without abundance of noise . " Winebrenner denounced this as gross misrepresentation . " But , sir , I did not retire for the ignoble purpose , as you have intimated , of putting another sectarian ball in motion . No , not at all . I had seen , through mercy , the great evil of these rolling balls , put in motion and kept in motion by the cunning craftiness of men and devils , and how by their repeated and unhappy collusions they hindered and marred the work of God in the earth ; and , therefore , I resolved to fall back upon original groundsto stand aloof from all these sectarian balls , and to do the work of an evangelist and minister of Christ by building up the church of God ( the only true church ) according to the plan and pattern as shown us in the New Testament . This is the high and firm ground we take . Our ball , therefore , is not like your ball , nor similar to other human balls . Ours is the Lords ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the hands of Calvin and others as was yours . But it was cut out of the mountain without hands.* ( Daniel 2:45 ) The ball commenced rolling upwards of eighteen hundred years ago , and it continues rolling to this hour ; yea , and it will never cease rolling till every other man-made ball shall he either crushed or rolled up by it , and until the sound of it shall be as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of a great thunder.* ( Revelation 14:2 ) " <p> Winebrenner was indisposed to begin the organization of churches . The uniform testimony of his contemporaries is that he " had not at the beginning the remotest idea of organizing a distinct or separate body of people . " But driven out of the pulpit by the Reformed Church , ostracized and persecuted , he was led to a closer personal investigation of church polity . He went to the highest source for light . He applied himself with singleness of purpose to the study of the Word of God . The result was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he himself testified later : " As the writers views had by this time materially changed as to the true nature of a Scriptural organization of churches , he adopted the apostolic plan , as taught in the New Testament , and established spiritual , free , and independent churches , consisting of believers or Christians only , without any human name or creed or ordinances or laws . " The local church was the unit . It possessed perfect autonomy . It was wholly independent of every other unit . Each such unit " possesses in its organized state , " as Winebrenner expressed it in 1829 , " sufficient power to perform all acts of religious worship and everything relating to ecclesiastic government and discipline . Every individual church is strictly independent of all others as it respects religious worship and the general government of its own affairs . " Fellowship between these " free and independent " units there would be , but no higher organization was then recognized by Winebrenner which could limit the powers of the local church . Each of these local organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but would adopt the divine name and creed and ordinances . In his broad platform he saw a basis of the union of all Christians and churches . And so the imperative duty of cultivating union between all believers was strongly urged . These views prepared the way for Winebrenner to fall in with the growing demand for local church organization . For the multitudes of converts had " conceived the idea of , and began to talk about , organizing themselves into churches founded on Bible doctrines and principles even before Winebrenner had determined in his own mind to do so . " <p> Thus there were independent local churches organized in and around Harrisburg , which Winebrenner denominated simply " Churches of God . " Each assumed the name of " Church of God at . " The members of these churches had equal rights , and elected and licensed men to preach . <p> There was as yet no common bonds , no general organization or directing authority . In order to effect this and adopt a regular system of cooperation , a meeting was held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the licensed ministers . Of this meeting Winebrenner writes , " Thus originated the Church of God , properly so called , in the United States of America , and thus also originated the first Eldership . " This organized body assumed no other name than Eldership , though later the term General Eldership was used to distinguish this body from the eldership of the local church . The term General Eldership was , however , applied at first only to the presbyteries or Elderships of sections or States , which held their sessions annually . In October 1844 , Winebrenner proposed a General Eldership for the transaction of all business of a general nature affecting the various annual Elderships . It was provided that this General Eldership should hold its meetings triennially for the first twenty years and after that every five years . Thus we see that by this time Winebrenners views of church government were still further modified . <p> The work continued to grow and spread to adjoining counties and to Maryland , western Pennsylvania , and Ohio , where Elderships were organized . <p> Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the pastor constitute the church council and are the governing power , having charge of the admission of members and the general care of the church work . The churches within a given district are associated together for cooperation in general work . The pastors and other ordained ministers within a district , together with an equal number of lay members , constitute the Annual Eldership , which appoints the ministers of the various charges . Each local church votes for a pastor , but the Annual Eldership makes the appointments within its own boundaries . These Annual Elderships elect an equal number of ministerial and lay delegates , who constitute the General Eldership . <p> The Churches of God , as already stated , have no written creed but assume to accept the Word of God as their only rule of faith and practice . They hold the doctrine of the Trinity , believe in human depravity , the atonement of Christ , justification by faith , the resurrection , future punishment , and are , in general , orthodox . Through these articles of their faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church of God , the followers of Winebrenner made their appeal to D. S. Warner . But they were lacking in some very important particulars , without which they could not possibly be , as was claimed , identical with the New Testament church . Winebrenner started out well , but on the subject of Holy Spirit organization and government he was not sufficiently illumined to avoid more or less of the human ecclesiastical authority which crept into the body of his followers and constituted them a sect . When holiness came they repudiated it , thereby revealing their position as outside the Holy Spirit control of believers . However , their teaching on the church question was correct as far as it went , and it took years of actual practice of obeying the lead of the Spirit to discover to Brother Warner and others the clash between the Holy Spirit rule and the rule of human authority .

The most valuable acquisition , however , was the use of his diaries , kindly granted by his son , D. Sidney Warner , now living in Canton , Ohio . These diaries do not cover all of his early ministerial career , but the quotations from them will reveal the Christian character of the man as well as show considerable of his itinerancy and of the facts of his life . <p> As to the source of information respecting the latter period of his ministry , when his work took the character of a reform , recourse has been had to the files of the periodicals he edited and also to the personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement .

Warner and to be more or less closely associated with him during the last five years of his life . To one who never knew him personally no printed account can afford an adequate conception of what it was to come in contact with this wonderful ambassador of God , whose presence wrought conviction in the unregenerate , and inspired confidence and courage in the hearts of believers . The divine manifestations in his preaching , his prayers , and his ministrations can not be told . Many very striking instances of physical healing which we have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these pages may reveal , if in no other light than the historical , that here is an example of true consecration , devotion , courage , diligence , humility , faith , patience , kindness , self-denial , and the Christian graces generally , that is worthy of being followed , is the earnest hope of <h> Introduction <p> The life and labors of D. S. Warner are so closely associated with a religious movement that any attempt at his biography becomes in part necessarily a history of that movement . I have therefore chosen the term Birth of a Reformation as a part of the title of this book . Brother Warner ( to use an appellation in keeping with the idea of universal Christian brotherhood ) was doubtless chosen of God as an instrument for accomplishing a particular work . What that work was , why it may be called a reformation , and why , in particular , it may be considered the last reformation , a few words of explanation by way of introduction are offered the inquiring reader . <p> It will be necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review some of the important events and conditions . We note the characteristics of the church in the days of the apostles , which , by reason of its recent founding and organization by the Holy Spirit , is naturally regarded as exemplary and ideal . It had no creed but the Scriptures and no governance but that administered by the Holy Spirit , who " set the members every one of them in the body , as it hath pleased him " * ( 1 Corinthians 12:18 ) apostles , prophets , teachers , evangelists , pastors , etc . Thus subject to the Spirit , the early church was flexible , capable of expansion and of walking in all the truth and of adjusting itself to all conditions . It was in very essence the church , the whole , and not a section or part . The apostles and early believers did not restrict themselves and become a Jewish Christian sect or any other kind of sect . Peters way of thinking would have thus limited him , for as a Jew he declined any particular interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed his mind and advanced his understanding to include the universality of the Christian kingdom . The Holy Spirit in the heart was necessary , of course , to the successful government of the church by the Spirit , otherwise He could not have been understood . There were no dividing lines , for it was the will of the Lord particularly that there be " one fold , and one shepherd . " * ( John 10:16 ) Jesus had prayed believe that thou hast sent me. " * ( John 17:21 ) These conditions of being subject to the word and Spirit , of leaving an open door through which greater light and truth might enter as was necessary , and of possessing the love and unity of spirit that cemented the believers together and carried them through all their persecution , constituted the ideal and normal status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which it was ordained that there should be but one , only one , as long as one hope of your calling . " * ( Ephesians 4:4 ) <h> Spiritual Decline <p> It was possible , of course , for the church to decline from her state of purity and thereby to forfeit her standing as the church . So long as her conflict with paganism lasted and the various forms of persecution tended to bring into exercise those principles and qualities which distinguished her from the world , she practically kept her first estate . When , however , the tide turned , persecutions ceased , and Christianity came into favor , and to be made the state religion of the Roman Empire , there were presented conditions favorable to every form of spiritual decline . Christians , instead of being longer persecuted , were protected , and to profess Christianity became popular and easy . The divine features of the church , by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were lost . Every form of corruption came in . Human rule supplanted the divine , Holy Spirit rule almost universally , both in the East and the West . The bishop of Rome , in particular , rose in prominence until he was made supreme headpopeof the Holy Roman church . The reader of church history knows of the long eclipse of Christianity that followed , of the darkness and ignorance that reigned , and gave to that period the name Dark Ages . The true church , impossible of representation by such a colossal counterfeit as then appeared in her place and became in turn a persecuting power , could continue only in fragmentary form , in obscure places in the wilderness of the Roman Empire . She could not be manifest in her evangelizing capacity , but was persecuted . Millions of Gods people , who refused allegiance to this false system of Christianity , were slain as heretics during this period . Thus , in the historical foreground we see , not the pure woman representing the church of God , but we see an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " * ( Revelation 17:3 ) the of the martyrs of Jesus . " * ( Revelation 17:4-6 ) <p> The Word and the Spirit , the two divine authorities , were set aside . In the place of the former were the traditions of the Roman Church , and for the latter was substituted human rule and authority . These two divine witnesses prophesied in sackcloth during those long centuries , until such time as they should again function in their proper sphere in the churchI say until such time : for we are not to assume that in the design of God this state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perish from the earth . The book of Daniel prophesies of the papacy , " And he shall speak great words against the Most High , and shall wear out dividing of time . " * ( Daniel 7:25 ) ( See the time-periods of the various epochs of the Christian era in our chapter A Prophetic Time . ) For this vast agency of unrighteousness the time should come when the cup of iniquity should be full and the judgments of God should be executed and his people delivered . When Christ comes , his bride will have made herself ready , which implies that Gods people will have been gathered out of spiritual captivity and brought again to Zion . Light and truth and the Holy Spirit rule will have been restored as at the beginning . <h> Reformations <p> Now the rise out of apostasy was expressed by a series of reformations , not by gradual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iniquity , " * ( 2 Thessalonians 2:7 ) which crystallized in the blasphemous " man of sin , " * ( 2 Thessalonians 2:3 ) had already begun to " work " in Pauls day , and the drift into spiritual darkness on the part of the professing church was without specific opposition . But , on the other hand , to break away from conditions apostate always means war with infernal powers . The wrong is endured until a rising sentiment of protest breaks out with stern denunciation . God raises up instruments for this purpose . John Wycliffe , in the fourteenth century , denounced the errors of the so-called church and the conduct of the monks , and also had sufficient light to see the papacy as the " man of sin " foretold by the apostle Paul . His reform efforts , however , centered mostly in the translation of the Bible into English , which work , in spite of the attempt by Rome to destroy it , God graciously caused to be preserved . <p> John Huss , a little later , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned at the stake as a heretic . His martyrdom furnished the occasion for him to utter this prophecy : " You are now going to burn a goose Huss meaning " goose " in the Bohemian language , but in one hundred years there will arise a swan whom you can neither roast nor boil . " True to this prophecy , in one hundred years came the intrepid Luther , under whose leadership history records the great reformation of the sixteenth century . Church and state were at this time united , which gave this reformation a political prominence , as it resulted in the change to Protestantism of two strong nations , Germany and England . What the sixteenth century reformation accomplished spiritually was , among other things , the bringing to light of the Scriptural doctrine of justification by faith in Christ instead of by priestly absolution . <p> It could not have been expected that all the Scriptural truths and principles should at any time or by any one reformer be recovered from the rubbish under which they had been buried for a thousand years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truths that had been obscured by the apostasy . Thus Truth in her progress upward to the Scriptural level has arisen only by successive steps , God having to use human instrumentalities that were limited by the prevailing tendencies and beliefs of the times . Each reformer naturally dealt with conditions that were most conspicuous from his viewpoint , and was exercised in questions of truth that applied only to such conditions . His reform work was not final in character , inasmuch as it left some errors still uncorrected . Hence the progress upward was by a succession of reforms , each , as a general thing , springing from a higher level of truth and spiritual attainment than those preceding . With the great decline into apostasy now in the past , the church of God was disposed to rise out of confusion , her destiny being the attainment of her original standing , when it could be said that her sun should " no more go down . " * ( Isaiah 60:20 ) <h> Human Rule Instead of Divine <p> The apostasy of the church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecclesiastical ambition and degeneracy . " The human element got in the way where there should have been only the divine . There is necessarily the human element in the work of God , for Christian work is God and man working together ; but in the true relation man is Gods instrumentality and is altogether in subjection to the divine Head , who rules over all . When the human element supplants , gets in the way of , or acts in the place of , the divine , we have a fundamental error that always results in apostasy . This human ecclesiasticism , always more or less intolerant , reached its autocratic perfection in the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church and constituted he is God . " * ( 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4 ) <p> The spirit of human government in church affairs has shown itself in , or has followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . The Spirit of God worked in the movement to accomplish good , but was always checked by this baleful element . Luther meant well but was himself dogmatic and intolerant . He held to many doctrines of Catholicism whose wrongs he could not see . He did not make proper allowance that others besides himself might be right , or at least have some truth . Neither did he or his associates or followers leave the way open for God to lead into more truth , much less the whole truth . Thus the reformation of the Sixteenth Century , while it recovered from the debris of apostasy the doctrine of justification by faith , became the occasion for Protestant sects , human-ruled institutions , and these were succeeded by other sects . Some of these have been as intolerant , inflexible , and as unlike early Christianity as the Roman Catholic Church itself . <p> Church government , as humanized in the sects , has taken forms other than the hierarchic . We have the episcopal , or rule by bishops ; the presbyterian , or rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local brotherhood . Our object here is not to discuss which of these forms most nearly resembles or is most different from the Scriptural , but merely to show that man rule has manifested itself in various ways . <h> Characteristics of the True Church <p> The true church of God , comprising all Christians , has in her normal state under her divine head certain essential characteristics which make her exclusively the church , the whole and not a part . These might be expressed as follows : <p> Possession of divine spiritual life . If the church does not possess this she is not Christs body and therefore not the church . She must know the Spirit of God . <p> Disposition to obey all Scripture and to let the Spirit have His way and rule . This constitutes her safety in matters of doctrine and government . <p> An attitude receptive to any further truth and light . This safeguards against dogmatism and a spirit of infallibility and intolerance , against interpreting Christianity in the light of traditions and old ideas . <p> Acknowledgment of good wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any who might be Christians . This makes salvation , a holy life , and a Christian spirit the only test of fellowship , and disapproves all human standards of church membership and fellowship . <p> We repeat that these constitute the Scriptural standard of the church and characterize her in her unity and integrity . It is by lacking in one or more of these essentials that a sect is a sect . In the rise of the church out of apostasy , any reformation that does not develop to the full the essentials that characterize the church in her wholeness and completeness must necessarily fall short of being the final reformation and must leave a cause for further reformation . This is the explanation of the existence of the so-called Christian sects , viewing them in the most charitable light . The Wesleys and their early associates sought for deeper personal spirituality as well as better spiritual association than was afforded in the state church of England . They brought to light and gave particular prominence to the doctrine of sanctification by faith and the witness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in that day the question of division among Christians was not prominent , nor was the question of the one true church understood or appreciated , their work took definite form in a body humanly organized and called Methodist . The Campbells had considerable light on the unity of the church , and proposed the Scriptures alone as a basis on which all Christians could unite . But they blindly shut themselves in on a point of doctrine by associating entrance into the kingdom or church with the act of immersion in such manner as to make a wall between them and other Christians who should give evidence of having received salvation and therefore church membership , otherwise than through baptism . Thus they made themselves a sect . John Winebrenner had the correct idea of the church as comprising all the saved , and his work was on an un-sectarian basis . Lacking , however , in the quality of letting the Spirit of God rule , eldership organizations were soon set up , man rule came in , and they also became a sect . Inflexible as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , rejected the truth on holiness , and became one of the most narrow of sects , though bearing the Scriptural name , Church of God . <h> A Final Reformation <p> It must follow , and the assumption is already established , that a reformation which takes in full the characteristics defining the church in her wholeness must thereby reach the New Testament standard and therefore be the last , or final , reformation . No reformation can make good such claim if it does not proceed on whole-church lines or principles . If a reform does progress on those universal principles , we need look no farther for , nor await future years to reveal , the final reformation resulting in the restoration of all things to the Scriptural ideal . <p> The errors of the religious world are , and have been , the failure to so preach salvation truth that people may obtain and enjoy full deliverance from sin ; failure to conform to the divine standard on all lines ; the human ecclesiastical system , which hinders Holy Spirit organization and government ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church relation impossible . A movement that comprehends a correction of all these , and meets the Scriptural standard , must therefore fill the measure of reform . <p> Reader , it is claimed for the movement represented in the teaching and labors of D. S. Warner , that it possesses these elements of finality , that by it God is bringing His people " out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day " * ( Ezekiel 34:12 ) of Protestant sectism , and is restoring Zion as at first . It is not assumed that Brother Warner was right on every point of doctrine or in every application of a Scriptural text , but that the movement , in addition to being based on correct Scriptural principles otherwise , possesses that flexibility and spirit of progress by which it adjusts itself as God gives light . <p> It teaches the Scriptural process of salvation , by which people may obtain a real deliverance from sin and have the Holy Spirit as a witness to their salvation . <p> The truth only , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizes the rule of the Holy Spirit in the organization and government of the church . <p> It does not assume to possess all the truth , but stands committed thereto , holding an open door to the entrance of any further light and truth . <p> The spirit of the movement is to acknowledge good wherever found and to regard no door into the church other than salvation and no test of fellowship other than true Christianity possessed within the heart . <p> Thus its basis is as narrow as the New Testament on the one hand , and as broad as the New Testament on the other . May it ever go forward on this line in the spread of the truth to all the world . <h> Another View of Sects <p> In order to get a clearer understanding of the reformation which took definite form in the work of D. S. Warner , as well as why he denounced the sectarian spirit in such scathing terms , let us take further notice of the evil of sect institutions . <p> In the first place , sects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are associated more or less with good . Many of them in their origin followed reform movements which apparently had divine sanction and were progressive in Christianity , and many of them have upheld truth which when preached was productive of good and brought salvation results . But here it should be noted , that whatever of salvation work has been accomplished has been directly by the Spirit of God in individuals , quite apart from any sectarian agency . It must be said , too , that whatever has resulted from Christian endeavor or influence and expenditure of means , whether in home or foreign lands , would have been in greater degree had the church back of these efforts been one spiritual whole instead of many sectarian divisions . So , when we come to apply analysis to this question of sects , we find that they are in no sense good . That they are called churches is but the part of confusion , for in the popular mind and in actual practice it tends to identify sects with the divine church , whereas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are differentiated by the isms of men are not , and never can be , Scripturally churches , for except in the local geographical sense the church takes no plural form . There is a distinction between the true people of God as constituting the divine church and the human institutions called churches that have divided them and placed them in unnatural and unscriptural relations . The true church of God , by virtue of comprising all the saved and therefore being a unit , places sects in comparison only as false churches . A commentator truthfully remarks , " False Christendom divided into very many sects is truly Babylon , that is , confusion " ( Jamieson , Fausset , and Browns Commentary ) . Thus sects , because they are a hindrance to proper Christian activity and because they present a spectacle of religious confusion , professing to be churches when they can only be false , are bad . <p> This is no disparagement of the many noble men and women of God who have been connected with sects and have gone on to their heavenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not from the sectarian . They may have honestly loved their sect , but in this they were honestly misplacing their love . It was the religious association with their fellow Christians that they loved , and this , had they only known it , was not enhanced but rather hindered by the sectarian distinction . They will not find these distinctions in heaven . If they really loved the sect , they had to leave that love behind , for it could not be included with such Christian excellence as entitled them to heaven . Thus our good parents and grandparents and the long line of reformers and Christian worthies receive their heavenly reward quite independent of the sectarian institutions that divided them here . <h> Evil of Sects in Positive Light <p> We have shown why sects are bad in rather a negative light , as being confusion and therefore a hindrance to proper Christian representation in the world . They are evil in a more positive sense , and it was because of this that God prompted Brother Warner and others in the reform to utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that arises and fails to qualify on all principles that mark the church of God as a whole , that proceeds to human organization and rule instead of recognizing only Holy Spirit organization and government , at once limits itself and becomes thereby a sect , a false representation of the church . As a false church , it is soon a corrupt institution in which human pride and every element contrary to God may exist and become active . The human will , intended for the rule of our bodies and things terrestrial , things which belong to mans province , becomes sadly out of place when exercised in any sphere or capacity that belongs to God . In such sphere it becomes a rival of God , a monster evil of great proportions , a distinctive satanic spirit , always opposing the true work of God . <h> Beastly Character in Prophecy <p> This man rule in a province to which God alone has rightful claimfor , indeed , it exercises the prerogative of God when it presumes to direct Gods work and peoplehas characterized all Protestant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in milder aspect . Man rule is represented in prophetic symbols by beastly character , whether it applies to political or ecclesiastical government . Thus in the 7th chapter of Daniel we have the symbols of four great beasts , representing in their respective order four universal kingdoms , as follows : Babylonia , Medo-Persia , Greece , and Rome . These were temporal powers that ruled the world . When a mere temporal power is indicated the prophetic symbol used is a dumb beast . If a beast or any part of such symbol is represented as speaking or exercising human propensities , then the thing indicated is also an ecclesiastical power . Thus the fourth beast in Daniel 7 , which represents the Roman Empire , exercises first as a dumb animal ; but directly a particular horn appears among the horns of this beast , and is given eyes to see and a mouth to speak great things , which indicates ecclesiastical exercise , so that we have here Rome first as a heathen power , and then as a so-called Christian power speaking great things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revelation 13 we find this same Roman power represented by a beast to whom was given " a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies , " and power " to make war with the saints and to overcome them . " These anthropomorphic qualities given to a beast indicate man rule in ecclesiastical matters , a thing which is at once blasphemy in Gods sight , utterly obnoxious and foreign to Him . <h> Protestantism in Revelation <p> Beginning with the 11th verse of Revelations 13 , directly after the prophecy of the Roman Catholic hierarchic power , we have the spectacle of a second beast , having two horns like a lamb , but speaking as a dragon . The fact that he speaks gives him the quality of ecclesiastical rule . In this beast we have man rule in the form of Protestantism . He has a lamb-like aspect instead of the vicious , threatening character of Rome in the days of her power ; but he has the voice of a dragon , which betrays his diabolical spirit . He exercises as much power in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing " great wonders , " * ( Revelation 13:13 ) displaying spiritual manifestations . He causes people to worship the first beast ( Catholicism ) by copying its standards and doing reverence to a human ecclesiastical system ; and an image to the first beast is made whenever a sect is organized . He causes the image to " speak " * ( Revelation 13:15 ) ( exercise man rule ) and to persecute those who , instead of bowing to the sect image , are disposed to exercise in their spiritual freedom and give allegiance alone to God . <p> Thus we see so-called Protestantism as a particular form of beast religion , a distinctive spirit that animates and dominates the sectarian system . The beast element is the man rule . We are not speaking merely of human instrumentality , which God certainly uses in His church when the will is wholly submitted to Him and susceptible to His Spirit , but of that exercise and dominance in ecclesiastical matters which , as apart from God , is distinctly human . Such prevails more or less as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pride , and emulation , wants to be let alone , and opposes any reform that threatens it . This is the element which naturally becomes disturbed at the preaching of the truth that exposes it , and which became a persecuting power against Brother Warner and all who executed the divine judgment against false religion . In this deceptive form of evil covering almost four hundred years Satan has had his seat . When the present reformation shall have resulted in bringing Gods people out of sectarian divisions and placing them on the whole-church basis , Satan , driven to some new project , will muster the Gog and Magog forces in a last conflict against the saints , which shall end with the utter destruction of those forces by the judgment fires ( Revelation 20:7-9 ) . <p> We have , then , Protestantism represented in two aspects : 1 . As a period during which truth by a succession of reform movements has to a considerable extent been recovered from apostasy and restored to Gods people . 2 . As a system of false religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satanic spirit that deceives the world and opposes any effort to restore the church of God to her Scriptural unity , since such effort naturally threatens the ecclesiastical element lying at the base of organized sectarianism . <h> A Dispensation of God <p> We apprehend , then , that wondrous times have come upon us . Great ecclesiastical systems are crumbling and are being left destitute as Gods people make their escape . This movement proceeds with no show of prominence in the world . It causes no political disturbance , but works only in the province of genuine Christianity , silently , effectively , as the leaven in the meal . It is altogether a spiritual movement and its discernment can therefore only be spiritual . It may appear outwardly as only one religious body among many ; for it is only when judged by the spiritual standard of Gods word that its character is seen . It is a call to those who are willing to be led of God . <p> The dispensations of God are in their beginning often insignificant and despised in mans eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nought things that are . " * ( 1 Corinthians 1:28 ) The fact that Brother Warners work was done in comparative obscurity counts for nothing against its being the work of God . It is quality that counts . Brother Warner had the right spiritual quality , the secret of which was letting God have His way . His entire abandonment to God in a complete consecration , together with his adaptable temperament and gifts , made him suitable for Gods use in this great work , and God chose him . The time was at hand . Others , contemporary with him and leaders in the holiness movement , saw the evils of sects and deplored them , but when it came to renouncing their sectarian affiliations and coming out of the spiritual Babylon in obedience receive not of her plagues , " * ( Revelation 18:4 ) they drew back . This point of leaving the sects , abiding in Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first basis , was the real test . They longed for the time when Gods people should all be one , but chose to believe that the time was not yet . And so they have been believing for forty years , and are today in the greater confusion . They lacked the spiritual equipment . One of Brother Warners special endowments was that of considerable light on the prophecies . He saw that the sectarian denominations were of the true spiritual Babylon in which Gods people were being held captive . He also had in the Spirit the prospective vision of the pure church unruled by man . His contemporary leaders who opposed him were too blind spiritually to have such a vision ; or , if they had it , were disobedient to it . <p> But there were those , the humble ones , who were willing to let God have His way . At the sound of the trumpet , which God was giving through Brother Warner , thousands have rallied to the standard of truth , and through them the truth has been and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Christians will be led out of sects , all justified believers will be led into sanctification , the church will be perfectly organized and governed by the Holy Spirit , the whole truth will be preached uncompromisingly , full salvation will be held out to the world , and all will be led to cooperate and do their part . This is the full measure of Christianity today , and is Gods design with His people . Here is true Christian unity . Such unity can come only by absolute abandonment to God , for He must be the one-making agent . Men may attempt a unity through some Interchurch World Movement or other plan , but no plan can represent the true Scriptural unity unless God does the work Himself . He must have the full right of way in human hearts . <p> Brother Warners mission was strictly that of a reformer . It was his part to venture boldly with the truth God had given him , with a willingness to run the gauntlet of persecutions that were sure to greet him on the right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent with his pioneer position . There first had to be an awakening , a breaking up of old conditions , particularly of the recognition ( into which the minds of people generally had settled ) of the sects as being the church of God . His work was the initial , or birth , stage of the reform . <p> Following the initial stage has come the constructive , which comprehends the reformation in the local sense , the sense in which the Christian life and true ideal of the church must be exemplified in the community as something more than theory , something that will appeal as being better than what is represented in the sects . The constructive stage calls not so much for continual denunciation of sects as for manifesting those essential principles that characterize the church in her unity and entirety . The responsibility is to make good the claim , and this means much . Any tendency to establish traditions , or to regard a past course as giving direction in all respects for the future , or to become self-centered and manifest a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of progress against the entrance of further light and truth , or in any way to refuse fellowship with any others who may be Christians , would itself be sectarian , altogether unlike the true reformation , which , if it be final , must necessarily be a restoration and possess universal characteristics . <p> For proper representation everything depends upon the understanding of , and the attitude toward , this great movement . For any body of people to hold that the reformation is entrusted to them , or that they have become the standard for the world , is a self-centered attitude , vastly different from that which regards the reformation as something prophetically due , as having come independent of man , and as being greater than the people who have been favored with its light , and that it is their part to conform to it in principle , doctrine , and everything . The great movement is in the world , and any attempt to " corner " it or to limit it to a particular body of people could only result in making that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself would proceed independently . <p> The true spirit of the reformation will be , however , with those who measure to its standard , whether they be few or many , and God will manifest Himself accordingly . Satan has tried to becloud and defeat the movement by counterfeit factionsbodies of people who profess to be on the reformation line , but who misrepresent the truth by denying some part of it , as , for instance , the doctrine of entire sanctification in this life , or of the Christian ordinances , or who misrepresent it by advancing erroneous doctrine , such as the continuation of the Old Testamental law and Sabbath , or the speaking in tongues as a necessary evidence of having received the Holy Ghost . Many are the counterfeit movements today . One must ignore every influence of man and then rely on the witness of both the Word and the Spirit in order to be guided aright . <p> Brother Warner was a remarkable example of a man possessing the Christian spirit and the Christian graces wonderfully developed . While he could rebuke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the meekest and kindest of men . Christ-like , he loved all men , even his persecutors . As a husband , father , Christian brother , and friend , his love and respect were genuine and reached to the very soul . And yet the responsibility of his calling as a Christian and as a minister of Gods truth as it applied to his time , he held more dear than all else , and to it he was wholly devoted . Not with any object of exalting the man , but to illustrate what God can accomplish in and through one who is so devoted , we introduce him to our readers . <h> Ancestry and Early Life <p> Among those who fought in the second war against Great Britain was one Adam Warner , who was born in Virginia , and whose father was Christofel Warner . In this period of our national history a great tide of emigration from the Atlantic States was spreading itself over what is now the Middle West . Adam Warner seemed to catch the spirit of the times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his family for the new country beyond the Alleghanies . He settled in Stark County , Ohio , where , about the year 1845 , he died , at ninety-three years of age ( a history of Williams County , Ohio , says ninety-eight , and that he had a sister who lived to the advanced age of one hundred and three ) . It is probable that before moving west Adam Warner lived for a while in Frederick County , Maryland , for there is where his son David was born , June 6 , 1803 . <p> David Warner , after moving to Stark County , was married , in 1823 , to Leah Dierdorf , * who was born in York County , Pennsylvania , February 6 , 1805 . In 1830 he moved to Wayne County , Ohio , and a little later to Portage County , then back to Wayne County in 1836 , to a place then called Bristol , where he kept a tavern for eight years . Of the parentage of David and Leah Warner , at their humble abode at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment of tavern life , was born Daniel S. Warner , destined to be one of the principal instruments in Gods hands to produce a shaking in the ranks of spiritual Israel , and to lead the hosts of the Lord back to Zion from their wanderings in the wilderness of denominationalism . <p> The children of David and Leah , in order , were as follows : Adam , Lewis , Joseph , John , Daniel , and Samantha . John died at the age of twenty , leaving but the five children . All are now deceased . A granddaughter says that the family was Pennsylvania German . Evidently the mother was . The father , as already noted , was a Virginian . <p> It was the misfortune of Daniel S. to be frail , sickly , and to a great extent unappreciated , from his very birth . His lungs were weak and he was denied that stock of vitality with which every child has the right to begin life . Intoxicants were freely used in those days , and David Warner had fallen an easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be ascribed to paternal indiscretion , possibly inebriety , it is not because such instances were uncommon . Into how many homes has the demon of strong drink entered to bring sorrow to the wife and mother and to curse the unborn with the blight of its baneful effects ! In this case , at any rate , the father was rough , and inconsiderate of his offspring . While he exercised toward his family a degree of temporal care , it seemed that the very frailty of this child , which should have awakened compassion , met only his frown and disfavor . In later years Daniel , in reflecting on the circumstances attending his birth and childhood , wrote the following lines , which are a part of his poem on Innocence : <p> Conceived in sin , to sorrow born , Unwelcome here on earth , The shadows of a life forlorn Filing gloomy oer my birth . <p> But life held on its tender thread , Days unexpected grew To weeks , and still he lived Why , Heaven only knew . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flood of tears , His body doomed to cruel pain , His mind to nervous fears . <p> In contrast with this paternal attitude , however , was the constancy of a truehearted mother . Blessed with this and endowed with indelible memories of a mothers devotion , what child growing up to cope with lifes obstacles may not , after all , hold a chance of succeeding , however handicapped otherwise ? If ever any planting bears fruit in the human breast , or becomes a latent force tending to guide one steadily through lifes dangerous rapids , it is that of a mothers love . Especially is this true of the love of a Christian mother , coupled with her prayers . <p> Mrs. Warner was an excellent woman . Her patient and gentle bearing under disturbing conditions , her disposition to make the best of disappointment and discouragement , left an impress , not only upon the family , but upon the neighborhood . Her kindness is referred to in two other stanzas of the poem " Innocence " : <p> If angels blessed his thorny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two eer showed their smiling face In all his suffering youth . <p> One was his mother , ever kind , A blessed providence ; The other , pure and lovely friend , Was angel Innocence . <p> It has been true generally that great men have first had great mothers . But what is a mothers greatness , after all , but simple , unalloyed , Christian motherliness ? <p> I should have become an atheist but for one recollection , and that was the memory of the time when my departed mother used to take my little hand in hers and cause me on my knees to say , " Our Father which art in heaven . " * ( Matthew 6:9 ; Luke 11:2 ) <p> John Randolph <p> " All I am , all I hope to be , I owe to my angel motherblessings on her memory ! I remember my mothers prayers . They have always followed me . They clung to me all my life . " <p> Abraham Lincoln <p> If my mother could rise in the dead of the night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worth something . I then and there resolved to prove myself worthy of my mothers prayers . <p> James Garfield <p> It is to my mother that I owe everything . If I am Thy child , O my God , it is because Thou gavest me such a mother . If I prefer the truth to all things , it is the fruit of my mothers teachings . If I did not perish long ago in sin and misery , it is because of the long and faithful years which she pleaded for me . What comparison is there between the honor I paid her and her slavery for me ? <p> St. Augustine <p> One more tribute . In his book Bible Proofs of the Second Work of Grace , published in 1880 , Daniel S. Warner places the following dedicatory note : " To the sacred memory of my sainted mother , whose tender affections were the only solace in my suffering childhood , and whose never-failing love , and whose pure and innocent life were the only stars that shone in the darkness of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> From Wayne County , David Warner brought his family , in 1843 , to a farm of 140 acres near New Washington , Crawford County , Ohio . The house , built partly of logs , stood three-fourths of a mile southwest of the village . It was here that Daniel spent his childhood . Of this period he writes : <p> It seemed the special pleasure of Another certain one To quite demolish everything He set his heart upon ; <p> To chafe his spirit , and extort The flow of bitter tears Out of a soft and pensive heart , Through all his tender years . <p> He never knew that " Father " was A sweet , endearing name ; Its very mention was a dread , His lifes most deadly bane . <p> The demon of intemprance there Infused the wrath of hell , And most upon this sickly head The storm of fury fell . <p> Like chickens when the mother bird Gives signal of a foe , The little peeps are quickly hushed , All chicks are lying low , <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps we heard , All ran and quickly settled down , And not a lip was stirred . <p> Oh , horrors of the liquor fiend ! Weve seen thy hell on earth ; Thy serpent coils around us twined , The moment of our birth . <p> The Warner family , though clever , straightforward , and strictly honest , were but a simple rural folk and not inclined to religion . That such a bright spiritual light as was afterward exhibited in Daniel could come from such a family is one of the puzzling questions of blood relation . Was it that in the family blood there was latent quality which in his case only was near enough to the surface to he called into action and developed by higher influence ? Or should it be said that he represents a variation in the strain , such as is sometimes seen in biological observation ? If the latter , the mystery remains ; for why do such things occur ? Aside from natural phenomena , we believe that Brother Warner was a " chosen vessel " unto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him capable of high development in the divine graces . He was a Christian whom perhaps none other ever lived who was more reverent , spiritual , and devoted ; and God had a special work for him . <p> In his boyhood Daniel early displayed a gift of entertainment and of public speaking . The school in his district was ungraded . On occasions of entertainment , such as the last day of school , after the younger children had spoken their " pieces " and the program began to grow monotonous , a call would be made for Dan Warner . Then he would take the floor and soon would have them convulsing with merriment . Mischievousness and clownishness were traits . The trouble he sometimes caused the teacher was frequently such that the latter could not locate it nor determine just who was to blame . When he would be stood on the floor he would soon have others with him . On one occasion he did something for which he was sentenced to a scourging . When he appeared at school the next morning he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three coats . He was , however , bright in his studies and in a general way sociable and well liked . <p> The community in which he lived was strongly democratic in politics . His father , a staunch Democrat , actually had a degree of pride in his boy when the latter would make stump speeches during a campaign . It was natural for Dan to mount a store box on the street or anywhere and address a crowd on the issues of the day . In later years , however , when he became a minister and his oratorical abilities were directed in the channel of preaching the gospel , his father was not pleased . <p> Among the sports in which he indulged was coon hunting . On finding a coon tree at night he and his companion would cover themselves with a coon robe and lie under the tree until morning . He got to be rather wild , and took particular delight in the dance , but never indulged in the lowest forms of sin . <p> These are but brevities of his boyhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this part of his life that would be to any considerable degree full . One accident , by which he was maimed for life , should here be noted . He attempted to remove a bunch of grass that had clogged the sickle of a mowing-machine . As he was in this act the team started and the ends of two of his fingers , the middle ones of the left hand , were suddenly clipped off . Fortunately the loss of these members did not hinder him in writing , nor was it a disfigurement usually noticed in his preaching . <p> There was one more move for the David Warner family , and this was to Williams County , Ohio , the northwest corner of the State , where , in Bridgewater Township , about four miles north of the town of Montpelier , farm life was resumed . Here the parents spent the rest of their lives . The removal to this place was made in 1863 , during the Civil War . Joseph Warner was drafted for the army . Being a man of a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Daniel offered himself , and accordingly became a private in Company C , 195th Regiment , Ohio Infantry . Little is known of his army experience . It is said that he found favor with the captain and was made his clerk , or secretary . At the close of his term he was honorably discharged . <p> While living in Williams County , the occupation of teaching school appealed to him , and for several terms he was an instructor of the young in matters of common-school education . He was now in his early twenties . But here we shall close this chapter , and introduce him in our next in a different aspect . <h> Conversion , College , and Calling <p> It is natural that the question of religion should present itself to a young man or woman when approaching maturity . It is then that life is full of prospects , when one plans and builds for the future . It is then that opinions are formed , and there is an inclination to reach some kind of decision , for the time being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parting of the ways and the question comes , " Which road shall I take ? " The answer , so far as religion is concerned , depends to some extent on what one has observed in those who make a profession , though it is true that the influence of the Holy Spirit alonethat monitor who makes his appeal to the inner consciousnesssometimes decides the question . <p> The community at New Washington , where the Warner family lived , was strongly Catholic and Lutheran . There was too much whisky and tobacco and too little of genuine Christianity for a convincing testimony in favor of the latter . As for Dan Warner , he thought to decide the question of religion by trying to be an infidel . But of course he had not considered that God might speak to him and convince him against his will . He naturally possessed a tender conscience , a capacity to exalt righteousness and a susceptibility to right spiritual influence . <p> And so we find him on reaching the age of maturity trying to believe there was nothing in Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were certain persons within his field of acquaintance whose Christian piety made its impression . Then again , there was the influence of song . He had a good voice and found enjoyment in engaging in song with the young people . On a Sunday afternoon , at a neighbors , where a number were gathered and were singing gospel hymns , he became greatly affected . God spoke to his conscience . His conviction was so strong as to cause him for several months to lose his love for the dance and to reflect seriously on his course of life . It was his turning point so far as infidelity was concerned.1 <p> 1 : <p> The use of tobacco was very common among the professors in his community . It is related that he received an impression of the evil of this habit when on attendance at a prayer meeting he saw one of those present attempt to take a chew secretly , by hiding his face behind a chair . <p> But after a few months , when the conviction had worn away somewhat , he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more reckless than ever regarding his spiritual well being . His heart , however , was yet tender from the wound made by the spirit of conviction . One night during a severe illness of his sister he attended a dance . After he had returned home at two oclock in the morning , his mother went to his room and expostulated with her boy regarding his sinful career . Here again is where a mothers part played effectively . As she reasoned with him on his wrong conduct , his going to a dance while his sisterhis only sisterlay at the point of death , and his offence against a just God , before whom he must one day stand in judgment , the depths of his heart were broken up and he fell on his knees and called for mercy . <p> From that time he was deeply convicted , though to his companions he gave no evidence of a changed life , as he had not received the new birth . With some young friends he began to attend a protracted meeting in a schoolhouse not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , and sinners were made to reflect on the question of their souls salvation . On their way home one night his companions were expressing their opinions as to religion , what it was , etc . One of them , addressing Dan , said , " What do you think it is ? " He replied , " I am going to find out . " Knowing him to be prankish the others supposed he meant to play some trick , and as they separated , wondered to themselves what Dan could have up his sleeve . Not until he had gone forward to the altar the next evening and they had seen him rise a changed young man with the peace of God in his countenance did they take his words and actions seriously . <p> The date of this , his conversion , was February 1865 . He refers to the event some years later as follows : " Passed once more the old schoolhouse where I gave my heart to God ( February , 1865 ) . Thank God for that step ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a Christian ! " <p> Another item of interest relating to this time was his engagement to Frances Stocking , reference to which in his diary for June 11 , 1874 , the reader will find further on . <p> One quality that was manifest in Brother Warners early religious life as well as throughout his entire career was earnestness . He was sincere and intense in his devotion and his Christian work . We shall find as we read the notes from his diary that his words breathe a spirit of love and devotion , evincing a deep spirituality . When he yielded to God , he meant it as the decision of his very soul , and his conversion was for him an actual change for time and eternity . Old things were passed away . New propositions and prospects arose to occupy his thoughts . <p> What ideals and plans were his immediately after his conversion we do not know . It was not long , however , until he decided that a more advanced education was needful . Nothing will give a young person nobler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and associated with usefulness than Christianity . On the 5th of September of the same year of his conversion he started to school at Oberlin College* and enrolled for an English preparatory course . The details of his study at Oberlin and just how long he remained have not been learned . An old memorandum of his accounts indicates that he attended there only two months at first , and then taught school through the winter at Corunna , Indiana , returning to Oberlin in the spring , and that he started again with the new school year in September , 1866 . It is known , however , that his excellency of character shone while he was at school and was the subject of remark . <p> He did not attend college as long as he had expected to ; for it was while he was there that he began to feel Gods hand upon him for the ministry . When he saw how long it would take to complete his college work and the need of laboring in the Lords harvest while it was day , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college course and to prepare at once for the ministry . He accordingly went home , arranged for a room in his fathers house , and spent one season there in applying himself to prayer , Bible study , and those other things which he believed were directly necessary to his ministerial preparation . <p> Preparation for the ministry is more successful when , along with it , there can be more or less of actual practice . We can believe that Brother Warner was spiritual enough to keep in touch with God and to discern the divine leading in the important matter to which he had committed himself . At any rate , in connection with his work of preparation he began to engage in ministering the gospel . He preached his first sermon on Easter night , 1867 , in a Methodist Episcopal protracted meeting in the Cogswell Schoolhouse , not far from where he lived . The text was Acts 3:18 " But those things , which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets , that Christ should suffer , he hath so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At the time of his first effort in the ministry , which occurred more than two years after his conversion , Brother Warner had not as yet given his name to any religious society . To join a sectarian denomination is never by divine prompting , but is urged from human source . A young convert possessing the spirit of Christ is naturally at home in the Lord and with Christians anywhere . It is foreign to that spirit for one to limit oneself by subscribing to any particular creed of men . Accordingly , our young brother was only " acting natural " when he manifested no particular anxiety to " join the church . " Representatives of the denominations in his neighborhood proposed to him and presented their articles of faith . The fact that he referred the great question to the Scriptures and could see no authority for joining anything not recognized in the Scriptures shows that he was already poor material for sectarian construction , at least so far as the common arguments for sects go . <p> There was one society , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winebrenner called themselves the Church of God . As they professed to hold to no creed but the Bible , repudiated sectarianism , baptized by immersion , and observed as an ordinance the washing of feet in conjunction with the Lords Supper , all of which seemed good to him , and especially as they had the exact New Testament name for the true church , he was constrained to unite with that body . The mark of fellowship which differentiated them from other Christians and constituted them a sect was not apparent to him , and so , even during the many years of his earlier ministerial career , he identified this body with the true church . He said in later years that he had more liberty as a minister before he took that step than he had during the years he belonged to the denomination , which after all was but a sect . <p> The Church of God , spelled with a capital C , and more fully denominated " General Eldership of the Churches of God in North America , " was founded by John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the German Reformed Church ( now the Reformed Church in the United States ) , and was given the pastorate at Harrisburg . He was a good man and the work of the ministry became the uppermost desire of his heart . He sought to raise the standard of true piety . His earnest preaching resulted in a revival in which he opposed theaters , dancing , gambling , lotteries , and racing . Revivals of religion were new experiences in the churches of that region , so that his ministry awakened strong opposition , which resulted in official charges against him . He severed his relations with the Reformed Church but continued his ministry , extensive revivals following . <p> Dr. C. H. Forney , in his History of the Churches of God , says : <p> Winebrenner did not entertain the purpose of founding a new denomination . These bodies he stigmatized as sects . Professor Nevin called the United Brethren and like bodies " rolling balls , " and accused Winebrenner with " putting in motion a similar ball , which continues rolling to this hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denounced this as gross misrepresentation . " But , sir , I did not retire for the ignoble purpose , as you have intimated , of putting another sectarian ball in motion . No , not at all . I had seen , through mercy , the great evil of these rolling balls , put in motion and kept in motion by the cunning craftiness of men and devils , and how by their repeated and unhappy collusions they hindered and marred the work of God in the earth ; and , therefore , I resolved to fall back upon original groundsto stand aloof from all these sectarian balls , and to do the work of an evangelist and minister of Christ by building up the church of God ( the only true church ) according to the plan and pattern as shown us in the New Testament . This is the high and firm ground we take . Our ball , therefore , is not like your ball , nor similar to other human balls . Ours is the Lords ball . It was not cut out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was yours . But it was cut out of the mountain without hands.* ( Daniel 2:45 ) The ball commenced rolling upwards of eighteen hundred years ago , and it continues rolling to this hour ; yea , and it will never cease rolling till every other man-made ball shall he either crushed or rolled up by it , and until the sound of it shall be as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of a great thunder.* ( Revelation 14:2 ) " <p> Winebrenner was indisposed to begin the organization of churches . The uniform testimony of his contemporaries is that he " had not at the beginning the remotest idea of organizing a distinct or separate body of people . " But driven out of the pulpit by the Reformed Church , ostracized and persecuted , he was led to a closer personal investigation of church polity . He went to the highest source for light . He applied himself with singleness of purpose to the study of the Word of God . The result was a material modification of his former views on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writers views had by this time materially changed as to the true nature of a Scriptural organization of churches , he adopted the apostolic plan , as taught in the New Testament , and established spiritual , free , and independent churches , consisting of believers or Christians only , without any human name or creed or ordinances or laws . " The local church was the unit . It possessed perfect autonomy . It was wholly independent of every other unit . Each such unit " possesses in its organized state , " as Winebrenner expressed it in 1829 , " sufficient power to perform all acts of religious worship and everything relating to ecclesiastic government and discipline . Every individual church is strictly independent of all others as it respects religious worship and the general government of its own affairs . " Fellowship between these " free and independent " units there would be , but no higher organization was then recognized by Winebrenner which could limit the powers of the local church . Each of these local organizations would accept no human name , creed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creed and ordinances . In his broad platform he saw a basis of the union of all Christians and churches . And so the imperative duty of cultivating union between all believers was strongly urged . These views prepared the way for Winebrenner to fall in with the growing demand for local church organization . For the multitudes of converts had " conceived the idea of , and began to talk about , organizing themselves into churches founded on Bible doctrines and principles even before Winebrenner had determined in his own mind to do so . " <p> Thus there were independent local churches organized in and around Harrisburg , which Winebrenner denominated simply " Churches of God . " Each assumed the name of " Church of God at . " The members of these churches had equal rights , and elected and licensed men to preach . <p> There was as yet no common bonds , no general organization or directing authority . In order to effect this and adopt a regular system of cooperation , a meeting was held at Harrisburg in October 1830 , attended by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes , " Thus originated the Church of God , properly so called , in the United States of America , and thus also originated the first Eldership . " This organized body assumed no other name than Eldership , though later the term General Eldership was used to distinguish this body from the eldership of the local church . The term General Eldership was , however , applied at first only to the presbyteries or Elderships of sections or States , which held their sessions annually . In October 1844 , Winebrenner proposed a General Eldership for the transaction of all business of a general nature affecting the various annual Elderships . It was provided that this General Eldership should hold its meetings triennially for the first twenty years and after that every five years . Thus we see that by this time Winebrenners views of church government were still further modified . <p> The work continued to grow and spread to adjoining counties and to Maryland , western Pennsylvania , and Ohio , where Elderships were organized . <p> Each local church elects its own elders and deacons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the governing power , having charge of the admission of members and the general care of the church work . The churches within a given district are associated together for cooperation in general work . The pastors and other ordained ministers within a district , together with an equal number of lay members , constitute the Annual Eldership , which appoints the ministers of the various charges . Each local church votes for a pastor , but the Annual Eldership makes the appointments within its own boundaries . These Annual Elderships elect an equal number of ministerial and lay delegates , who constitute the General Eldership . <p> The Churches of God , as already stated , have no written creed but assume to accept the Word of God as their only rule of faith and practice . They hold the doctrine of the Trinity , believe in human depravity , the atonement of Christ , justification by faith , the resurrection , future punishment , and are , in general , orthodox . Through these articles of their faith , and the fact that they took the Scriptural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made their appeal to D. S. Warner . But they were lacking in some very important particulars , without which they could not possibly be , as was claimed , identical with the New Testament church . Winebrenner started out well , but on the subject of Holy Spirit organization and government he was not sufficiently illumined to avoid more or less of the human ecclesiastical authority which crept into the body of his followers and constituted them a sect . When holiness came they repudiated it , thereby revealing their position as outside the Holy Spirit control of believers . However , their teaching on the church question was correct as far as it went , and it took years of actual practice of obeying the lead of the Spirit to discover to Brother Warner and others the clash between the Holy Spirit rule and the rule of human authority . <h> First Years in Ministry <p> Brother Warner had the right view of ministerial qualification . He realized that in order to succeed he must have the spiritual anointing , and that since it was Gods work it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it would be God in him accomplishing the result . He held education to be very useful and it was his endeavor throughout his life to add to his knowledge ; but he regarded the spiritual qualification as paramount . He soon proved to be gifted as an evangelist and engaged much in evangelistic work . <p> Before proceeding far in active ministerial work he was married , on the 5th of September 1867 , to Tamzen Ann Kerr. * It is probable that he became acquainted with this young woman while he was teaching school in the vicinity of her home , which was near West Unity , Williams County . She lived to enjoy his companionship and to share his labors only about four and one half years . Early in 1872 she gave birth to triplets , which lived only a few hours . Nor did the mother long survive the ordeal , as she died on May 26 , after a succession of spasms . A family record in an old Bible shows also the birth of a son , on December 29 , 1868 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refers to this son once in his diary. * <p> He was granted a license by the West Ohio Eldership , 2 which met in its eleventh annual session at Findlay in October 1867 . His reference to this event in his diary is given in another part of this book . In this chapter as well as in some of the succeeding chapters , the copious extracts from Brother Warners diary will give the reader a better understanding of his character , his temperament , his spirituality and devotion , and his work , than would description by another . Unfortunately these journal records for the first five years of his ministry ( for it is assumed that he kept such records ) , which no doubt would be very interesting , are not available . All the information to be obtained covering this period is from those still living who had personal knowledge of the events , and from references to this period in his later records . In one of these he says he began traveling in 1868. * In another he refers to having labored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection with Findlay . <p> 2 : <p> Dr. Forney , in the account of the Eleventh West Ohio Eldership in his History of the Churches of God , refers to D. S. Warner as being " later the leader in Ohio and westward of a body of people who gave the brotherhood considerable trouble . " <p> During the first six years of his ministry his activities covered practically all of northwestern Ohio and a small portion of Indiana . Persons now living who were present in some of his revivals during this period state that they were remarkable for manifestations of Gods power . Hard-hearted sinners , some of whom had not attended a meeting for years , would get under conviction and cry audibly for mercy . He ranked high as an evangelistabove the average of his day . In physical appearance he was slightly above average in height , rather slender and frail in build . His temperament was sanguinenervous , eyes blue , hair browna fine , sensitive organization . He wore a full beard , which in later years he kept shortly trimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gospel , and his speech and conduct were fully consistent . His mentality was keen . His lungs were weak , but he wore well as a speaker . His voice was musical and possessed good carrying quality . One of his earliest revivals was held at New Washington , Crawford County , the home of his boyhood . He refers to it under the date of November 24 , 1872 , as follows : <p> This town had ever been abandoned to the mercies of Catholics , Old Lutherans , and saloons , all of which were equally destructive of all moral good . No protracted effort had ever been made in the place . No conversions had ever been heard of . In the fall of 1870 I was put upon the Seneca circuit , of which New Washington was nearly in the center , and knowing the debauchery and ignorance of the people in general , I determined to lift up the standard of King Immanuel in that place . Accordingly I settled in the place and rented a vacant building that used to contain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having asked quite a dear rent for the room . But during the winter I and companion made special prayer to God for his conversion . <p> The meeting was begun on the 17th of February 1871 . The night before , the owner slept not for deep conviction . As soon as I arose in the morning he came to me in tears and confessed his sins and asked my prayers . I directed him to look to Christ for immediate pardon and deliverance . I gave him some of the great promises of Christ . And there , standing in his own stable , he looked to Christ and experienced a full pardon of all his sins . This settled the rent for the house . The third night six came to the altar . The meeting was attended with great power and produced a great stir among the people , many of whom had never seen the like . Fifty-six were converted , forty-six baptized , and forty-six fellowshipped into the organization . <p> Among these converts were a number of his schoolmates , old acquaintances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indiana , an old schoolmate and a former resident of New Washington , makes this statement concerning this meeting : " The meeting was held in my fathers drug-store building . Brother Warner held the meeting unaided . He stood there alone and preached while others threatened . There were bad elements that rose in opposition , the Lutheran being the worst and the Catholic next . My father protected him . It was a wonderful meeting and many were saved . " <p> The earliest of his diary records so far available begin in November 1872 , as follows , when he was on the Seneca circuit and had his home with a Brother Wright , in Crawford County , Ohio : <p> 8 . Brother P. Wright brought me to Bucyrus . Staid all night with Bro . J. G. Wirt . The Methodists had a festival . I and a few members of the same church ( who repudiated these follies and inconsistencies ) met for prayer and the Lord was with us . These brethren were much dissatisfied with their church relation . <p> 9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stopped at the Burnet House till 1:20 P.M. Wrote a letter to my brother and one to brother-in-law , L. W. Guiss . <p> 10 . Sabbath . A.M. , prayer meeting at Brother Dagues , P.M. , heard a Lutheran minister in Milton . Evening , preached from Isaiah 28:16-17 . I occupied the Presbyterian house . I preached here some in the schoolhouse in 1868 , the first year I traveled . <p> 11 . Took the train at 7:30 A.M. for Tontogany , with the design of finding where God wishes me to labor as a missionary . O Lord , guide thy servant to the place thou canst best use him ! Walked from Tontogany to Brother Hardees . Evening , went to Evangelical meeting . Brother W preached . Heard a great noise , but to the congregation it appeared as a tinkling cymbal and sounding brass , evidently having no effect . Nearly all blew loudly the horn of sanctification but manifested little of its fruits , such as travail of soul for the sinner and sympathy for the one soul at the altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but each in turn arose and boasted of his holiness . Oh , the delusions of Satan ! How manifold they are ! <p> In the entry just quoted the reader will notice his prejudice , existing at that time , against the doctrine of holiness , or sanctification . How strange it seems to those who knew him afterward to be a whole-souled advocate of the doctrine of holiness that he should thus speak ! It was altogether a matter of light and understanding . His heart was consecrated and he certainly was not unacquainted with the Holy Spirit during his early ministry . But as a definite experience to be believed for and testified to , he knew nothing about sanctification as yet . Also , it is possible that in its advocates whom he had met thus far , the doctrine and experience had not been rightly represented . <p> It will be observed also from these quotations from his journal that he meant to stand , and believed he was standing , free from sectarianism . He had considerable light on the church question and spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was near Holland , Lucas County . <p> 13 . Visited Father and Brother John McNut and Brother Irvin . Eve , preached in the brick schoolhouse , on James 1:27 . Here the Church of God had long been slandered and persecuted , principally by the United Brethren Church . One of the epithets they had for years called us is " Johnny Cake Church . " Brother Henry S. McNut lives here nearly alone . He and his wife and their ancestors for generations past belonged to the United Brethren , but in the fall of 1870 , after a hard spell of sickness in which he feared that he should die and be lost for not obeying the truth , he came to the West Ohio Eldership and received a license and began to preach amidst a storm of persecution from the United Brethren Church . Even his own companion , though an amiable woman , had been so poisoned against the Church of God that she joined in to oppose him . But he was firm and now commands the position . Every foe had fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . Some will doubtless soon cut loose from sectarian bondage . Those that were the bitterest enemies now confess that we are right and they are wrong . <p> The Church of God , as we have seen , repudiated sectarianism , and the assumption by that church that it was the Scriptural one was a strong underlying principle . In some respects it held the correct idea of the Scriptural church . To some extent , therefore , Brother Warners membership in that denomination afforded him light that naturally led to the full Scriptural standard , which he afterward taught . His affiliation with that denomination in the first place was , as we have seen , because of a disposition to be Scripturally right on this point . <p> 14 . Brother McNut and I went to Toledo to look for a place in which to open a mission in that city . <p> 15 . Walked nearly all day in search of a place to open a mission . No success . May God soon open the way for the establishment of his church in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something for each day . Every time he preached it was noted and numbered and the text was given . The Eldership required each minister to give a report of his work . It is not necessary to quote all the shorter entries and items from his diary , which are much the same and generally speak of his visiting someone , making some trip , reading , writing , preaching , praying , fasting , baptizing , etc . Only the more interesting items , or such as are the most representative , will be given . <p> 22 . Returned to Auburn . Meeting at Basswood still in progress . The young men who made a start the last night I was there have all found Jesus their Savior . Preached from Malachi 3:8 . A deep seriousness pervaded the minds of all . The feeling of that night shall not soon be forgotten . It was as solemn as the grave . A sensation of dark and fearful forebodings of some approaching calamity ran through every mind . Brother H. Caldwell arose and said he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was that before tomorrows sun should set some one in this community would suddenly be killed . At his request we arose and pledged ourselves to offer one more fervent prayer that night in behalf of poor sinners . <p> 23 . Spent the day at home in reading , meditation and prayer . Brother Jenner preached in the evening . I labored hard to bring penitents to the altar . Three came out , two of whom were old acquaintances of mine , for whom I had felt a deep interest . One found peace . <p> After meeting was dismissed we heard that Ezekiel R , an old man eighty-two or eighty-three years of age , who lived one mile and a quarter east of the schoolhouse , had that day been killed by the cars in crossing the track at Shelby . I knew the man from my boyhood ; he bought out my father in that country in 1853 . He was very wealthy . God had blessed him with long life , prosperity , and good health . But he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whole heart upon the god of this world . There was no place for Christ in his heart . He leaned toward Universalism , because congenial to the carnal mind . He was filled with skepticism and was always in the habit of speaking lightly of preachers and professors of religion . I visited him twice during the meeting at Auburn last winter and conversed with him on the subject of religion . He acknowledged that there is one thing in the Bible that caused him to study a good deal , and that is the new birth , which he said , was perfectly dark to him . He told of having once gone to hear one of the greatest champions of Universalism preach on the subject . " But , " said he , " I received no light whatever . " His case was a clear fulfillment of 1 John 2:11 , " Darkness hath blinded his eyes , " and 2 Corinthians 4:4 , " The God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not . " He had a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest developed organ . What a pity that the devil perverted these faculties ! <p> I was informed that he was going that day to close a mortgage and take a widows farm from her . His last words to his wife , who cautioned him to beware of the cars at the crossing , were , " I was not made to be killed by the cars . " This is like one who said , and be merry . " * ( Luke 12:19 ) But God said , " Thou fool , this night thy soul shall be required of thee . " * ( Luke 12:20 ) He said , " I was not made to be killed by the cars . " But God said , " Thou fool ! This day shalt thou be killed by the cars . " His brains were dashed out and strewn along the road . His body was much mangled . But his poor soul has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened his eyes in torment . <p> The entry for the 24th , which was Sunday , records his preaching a farewell sermon to the congregation at New Washington , and also his reference to the revival held there in February 1871 . He had had the care of the congregation there . <p> 25 . I and Brother S. Kline came to Conlays , near Annapolis , Crawford County , Ohio , and began my first protracted effort in the name of Christ . Preached from Psalm 85:6-7 . A good interest was manifested . Oh that God would visit the place in power , save many precious souls , and raise up a people for his name ! <p> 27 . Started early for Bucyrus on our way to the Standing Committee at Rock Run . Took train at 10 A.M. , arrived there at noon . I was chosen to fill a vacancy on the committee . Upon us devolved the solemn and responsible duty of trying and disfellowshipping Elder L. E for immoral conduct . Oh , what a pity ! May the Lord have mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the confidence of the people . May he be saved in the day of wrath . Oh , how careful the man of God , especially the minister of the gospel , should conduct himself in this wicked world ! Lord , deliver us from temptation . <p> The meetings referred to in the next few entries were a protracted effort at the Conlay Bethel , near Annapolis , now called Sulphur Springs , Crawford County , Ohio . <p> December 4 , 1872 . Visited a sick saint , J. McEntire , who has been afflicted for many years . He was near his last . Oh , what a happy soul . The night before he was almost gone . Said he , " I saw a convoy of angels around my bed waiting to carry my spirit home . I thought I was going home . Here I am yet lingering on the shores of time . " Then a brother came in , to whom he remarked , " Sister Polly has gone home . I thought I would beat her , but I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Polly have had a hard race , but they have both crossed over and I am left to struggle on ; but every gale wafts my little ship nearer the shining shore . " " Oh ! " said he , " It is all bright ahead , not a cloud do I see . " After a little rest he remarked , " Oh ! Brother , I know that my spirit will not go down into forgetfulness until the resurrection ; but I am going to Jesus , which is far better . Oh , how sweet the name of Jesus ! " I spent the day with this brother , sang and prayed with him . Eve , preached from Acts 3:19 . <p> 9 . Spent the day in fasting and in much wrestling and prayer for poor souls under the guilt of sin . Preached from Luke 13:6-9 . One young lady came to the altar . <p> 10 . Under much discouragement during the day . Evening while singing the opening hymn I was greatly refreshed at the coming in of Bro . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my labors and baptized by me last winter . He was a very wild , wicked man , but has become a model of piety and earnest devotion . He has a brilliant intellect and has already made great proficiency in preaching . Thank God for such men of holy zeal . He being tired with the walk of eleven miles , I preached , from Ezekiel 33:11 . The penitent of the previous night came out and soon the good news went to heaven that another soul was saved by grace . It was a glorious meeting . One sister shouted . I got a great victory and was very happy . Likewise testified the convert and all the rest who spoke . <p> 17 . Good day meeting . Rebuked a boy for trying to pollute the house of God by spitting tobacco juice and quids on the floor . I said nothing to him , knowing that I should be insulted in return . But being filled with the Spirit I tried to encourage the three little mourners ( girls who had come to the altar ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the early conversion of children , stating that it is enough to make the angels in heaven weep to see how the devil is leading even the children to wallow in sin and " glory in their shame . " * ( Philippians 3:19 ) " Now , look at that poor boy , " said I , pointing to him . " Ever since he came in here he has been doing his best to defile the house of God with his filthy tobacco . his deeds should be reproved , * ( John 3:20 ) but the devil has so polluted poor souls that even children in broad daylight do not blush to do such evil and dirty work for the devil as that . Christ said , that which cometh out of the mouth , this defileth a man.* ( Matthew 15:11 ) How defiled that heart must be , all that stench having come out of his mouth ! A few nights ago a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next evening , but did not pollute the house one half as much as that boy has done in half an hour . " At this he grabbed his hat and , " being convicted by his own conscience , went out . " * ( John 8:9 ) God pity that boy and help older people to take a hint . <p> 18 . A.M. , wrote most of the time . P.M. , visited Brother McEntire . Found him much cast down and depressed , being overanxious to be absent from the body , in which " tabernacle we groan , being burdened . " * ( 2 Corinthians 5:4 ) I told him that he ought to wait patiently till his " change cometh , " knowing when he got home once he would have long time to stay there , even through all eternity , and the longer he should be tossed about upon the dark and tempestuous sea of this troublesome life the greater would be his joy when at last he should land in the peaceful harbor of the great city of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had great peace and perfect resignation to God . <p> 25 . Another Christmas is here . O thou Child of Bethlehem , may we this day bring the offering of a grateful heart ! May every tongue on earth and all the angels in heaven join together to spread the glory of Jesus name ! Dear Lord , we thank thee for the unspeakable gift of thy Son to man . Oh , may every heart prepare him room ! Dear Savior , draw poor sinners to thee . Show them thy bleeding hands , temples , and side . Oh that the star of hope would this day guide many poor wandering souls to thee ! <p> 28 . Came to the place of meeting . Distance thirteen miles . Schoolhouse was full . Good attention . Went to Solomon Bs , an infidel . Talked till twelve at night . <p> 29 . Sabbath . Talked with Mr. B. until 10:30 A.M. He is a very smart man . Has his excellent memory stored with the writings of almost every wretch that ever dared to attack God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best readers I ever met . What a pity that this noble intellect should be so basely employed ! His horrid utterances are enough to chill the blood and heart of man and cause the angels of heaven to weep . He claims to be " a smarter man than Christ . " " The devil is a gentleman compared with God . " " Your God is not fit to be worshiped by a dog . " " All professors are either hypocrites or fools . " Oh , that God would pity that poor wretch who in the blindness of his depraved heart dares to rush with violence upon the Almighty ! <p> 30 . Spent the day in reading , writing , and prayer , at Brother Conlays . Eve , preached from Romans 2:4 . Good congregation . Saw some omens of good . <p> 31 . This is the last day of another year . How swift the years roll around and each brings us nearer eternity ! Lord , help us to redeem the time and so " number our days , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Psalm 90:12 ) that at last it may not be said of us that " we spend our years as a tale that is told .

Yea , <p> " What countless millions of mankind Have left this fleeting world ! Theyre gone , but where ? Oh , pause and see Gone to a long eternity ! " <p> One there was , the dearest of my earthly friends , who a year ago stood by my side , the joy of my life , the sweet , innocent object of my fervent love . But she is gone , that dear companion upon whose rosy cheek and harmless lips I used to impress the kiss of burning , never dying love . O Tamzen ! Thy heart and life , as pure as the white and fleecy snow that this morning covers thy peaceful resting-place , has reared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee on earth . <p> I have now seen thirty years pass into eternity . Not quite eight years have been devoted to God . The year has been one of Gods goodness to me , notwithstanding the loss of my blessed wife , which is her gain and Gods glory , and therefore I am willing to travel on a lone pilgrim in search of souls for Jesus sake <p> T was very stormy . Wrote and read . Preached from Psalm 90:9 , " We spend our years as a tale that is told . " Tried to show the folly of living in sin . <p> January 1 , 1873 . This is the first day of the year . O my soul , set out afresh for heaven ! Lord help me to spend the year all to thy glory if we live to the end . But if it is said of me , " This year thou shalt die , " * ( Jeremiah 28:16 ) may I be ready to enter into rest . <p> 7 . Preached from Romans 6:1 . Told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way of a score of souls . <p> 8 . Fasted today . Very solemn meeting at Brother Crims . All wept for poor sinners . O Lord , hear the prayers and groans and bottle up the tears of thy children and bring thy salvation nigh ! Preached from Hebrews 2:3 . The meeting has received a great backset . I fear the whole work is killed . Before I came here I had a peculiar dream in which I saw a face that was strange to me . There was much confusion in those features , as in the midst of a council it stood out conspicuous , and there was something in the position of the person that pierced my heart . Last night I announced that I had recognized these features since I came here . Mr. B. , the infidel , arose and asked whether he were the man . I said no . Tonight Esq . K. , a poor blind Lutheran , came to meeting , and before I closed he arose and enquired if he were the man . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit of God and replied , " Thou art the man . " He was daunted , but stammered out a denial ; but before I had time to ask a question he confessed that he had forbidden his family to come out to the altar . They 're five young men and one daughter , three of them were under deep conviction and others serious . One of the boys is married and his wife and all their associates were serious and some anxious to come out , but all were prevented from coming to Christ by this poor wretch , whose form of religion fitted him to do this work for the devil . <p> In this attack I realized the fulfillment of the promise speaketh in you . " * ( Matthew 10:19-20 ) I warned him of the fearful account he would have to give at the judgment-bar of God . <p> 9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt the Spirit of God had been grieved out of the community . Eve , preached from Jeremiah 28:16 . Gave a farewell address and closed the meeting because , first , the work was so stagnated that nothing could be expected to be accomplished without a longer effort than I could devote to the place and , second , because it was highly probable that as soon as the work should break out again Satan would stir up trouble again from some source . I gained many warm friends and sowed seed which I trust will bring fruit to God . Some of the young men that desired religion I think will not give up the struggle . They sent me some money and word that if I would hold a meeting somewhere in reach that they would attend and seek religion , but there they had not the heart to come out . <p> 25 . Visited Brother and Sister Chapman . She is an excellent saint . Found her much afflicted . Brother C. had for many years been a skeptic and Universalist , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bro . T.

Good day meeting at Brother McClintocks near Larue , Marion County . Eve , preached from Ephesians 2:2 . Four came to the altar and were blessed , one of whom had been an avowed Universalist . Others doubtless would have come out but the house was so densely filled that we could not crowd the people back to get more room for penitents . <p> March 1 , 1873 . Spent the day at Mother Melvins . Wrote an article for the Advocate . Brother Burchard preached . Four at the altar . All were blessed , I think . House crowded and many outside . <p> 2 . Sabbath .

Meeting at Brother Deens . Fellowshipped twelve . P.M. , because of the immense crowd that thronged the schoolhouse we divided the meeting . I preached at Windfall , from Job 22:15-17 . Several rose for prayers . Brother Burchard preached at the Ellen Schoolhouse , one and one half miles north . <p> 9 . Sabbath . Brother Small and I went to the Shertzer Schoolhouse , where he preached at 1l A.M. on church matters , after which we received in fellowship eleven members , most by letter from the Methodist Episcopal and Presbyterian Churches . After taking a hasty dinner we mounted our steeds and rode four miles , partly through a woods , in the midst of a rain and severe storm . Reached Windfall at 2:30 P.M. Eve , preached on Acts 26:18 . One at the altar . <p> 11 . A.M. , preached on sisters right to speak and pray in meeting , after which we had a speaking-meeting . Fellowshipped fourteen members .

We had a speaking-meeting . All that had been immersed said that it had been a happy day for them and that they had turned a new and brighter page in the history of their pilgrimage . Oh , how good it is to obey God ! A good part of the number had been sprinkled , some after making a profession of religion in adult years . Great God , what a pity that the world is cursed by an unholy sectarian ministry who " teach for doctrines the commandments of men " * ( Matthew 15:9 ; Mark 7:7 ) ! <p> 12 . Eve , preached on barren fig tree , Matthew 21:18-22 . Four came to the altar , one blessed . Went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to ride .

At ten William Risers house was filled with brethren and sisters . We had a glorious meeting . All were happy , many shouted . It was something very strange to have a meeting in this house . All remarked that it was something they had never expected to see . Mr. R. is a man of nearly fifty years and a great sinner . His wife has been converted and I think the Lord is striving with his heart and his brothers , who is still older . Oh , that God would raise them up as monuments of his mercy ! Eve , Luke 19:10 .

Before me is the little mound which shows the resting-place of my three little infants who a little over a year ago passed in a few hours through this vale of tears , and their little spirits are forever at rest with Jesus ; and in one little box their bodies await the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graves shall burst open and the bodies shall come forth ! They that have done good to the resurrection of life and glory , and they that have done evil to the resurrection of shame . Oh , may I be among the former class ! Lord , make me a good man and keep me pure in heart . Farewell , sacred spot . Farewell , little tomb , with thy three-fold treasure . <p> 16 . Went to Bryan Williams County and ordered a tombstone for my wifes grave . The one selected cost fifty dollars , has a Bible lying on it , and I gave the following epitaph : <p> How sweet and pure in social life , As daughter , sister , friend , and wife ! Now done with cares below the sun , She shines before the snow-white throne . <p> 18 . Came home . Found Father and Mother and Brother well . <p> 23 . Commenced an editorial on Islamism . <p> 24 . Wrote and studied phrenology alternately . <p> 26 . Sent my article on Islamism . Brother Cassel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to come to that State . <p> 27 . Sabbath . Preached today from 2 Peter 1:10 in the Cogswell Schoolhouse near his fathers home , where I made my first effort to preach the gospel , on Easter night , 1867 . T was in a Methodist Episcopal protracted meeting . The text was Acts 3:18 . Never preached there since . In those six years I have preached all over northwest Ohio and some in two counties in Indiana , in all 1241 sermons . The number of converts 508 , about the same number fellowshipped , some less baptized . Thanks be to God for his blessings and his presence ! Though always of weak lungs , thought oft to be consumptive , yet my health has been better since in the ministry than ever before . Bless God for his goodness ! I have never missed but one appointment on account of health . The years have swiftly passed , but , thank the Lord , I have enjoyed great peace and many rich blessings from the Lord . <p> May 13 , 1873 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Visited D. W. Dustin , one of my scholars . Exhorted him to give his heart to Christ . <p> 15 . Prepared a sermon on the evidence of the divine origin of the Bible . <p> 16 . Argument with Mr. Butler on the soul . <p> He attended , from the 21st to the 23d , the meeting of the Board of Missions . He does not indicate where this meeting was held , but says in connection that he " preached in the Smithville Bethel " and " had very poor liberty , owing perhaps to the presence of many eastern ministers . " It was at this meeting of the Board of Missions that he received his appointment to the mission in Nebraska , of which he thus speaks : <p> 23 . Beautiful day . Business finished up at 5 P.M. Brother Small was appointed to Chicago , I to Seward mission , Nebraska . Again I lay all upon the altar of God . It is very hard for me to leave my dearly beloved brethren of West Ohio . Thank God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and his cause is greatly prospering here , and I must go help the cause in the far West . We parted with tears and many farewells . <p> 24 . Brother Small and I took train at 7:14 A.M. , he for Marion , I for Larue , which I reached at 12 M. Received a letter from my beloved brother Sol . Kline . All our dear spiritual children are yet doing well on Seneca circuit . Wrote two letters . Preached at Windfall , 2 Peter 1:13 . Great row after meeting . <p> 28 . These days I have been low spirited and much cast down . It is the first anniversary of the death and burial of my blessed companion . How lonely I feel ! My bereavement comes with all its weight upon me . Lord , be thou my comforter in all my loneliness . In eve , preached in Larue on the Church of God . Text , Ephesians 1:10 . I treated it as follows : <p> 29 . Staid last night with Brother L. Orr . Sister O. is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preached in Larue , eve , Ezekiel 43:10-11 . <p> 30 . It had been announced in the Larue Citizen that I would speak on the Church of God . This brought out quite a large congregation . Both nights I spoke plainly and boldly against the evil of sectarianism and other abominations . Many were i 'll at ease . Some preachers were present . The Lord gave me good liberty . Last night I diagrammed my subject with chalk upon the blackboard. 2 P.M. , took train for Pentecost meeting at Pleasant Hill . <p> Brother Warner became a strong exponent of the prophecies . Note his reference to some reform near at hand . This meeting was held at West Auburn , Crawford County , after his return from Pleasant Hill . <p> June 8 , 1873 . Sabbath . Thank God for life and health and this beautiful day ! Behold the throngs pressing toward the house of God ! Speaking-meeting was to begin at half past nine . Ere the time the house was filled . Others kept coming in continually , much to the detriment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated that could be and the aisles were filled , there were numbers yet without . The house had been purchased by the Church of God from the Methodist Episcopal Church and repaired in good style . At eleven , preaching began . Text , Haggai 2:9 , " The glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former , saith the Lord of hosts . " <p> I then took up the text used in the forenoon and showed that the destruction of the Temple and the Babylon captivity typified the dark age . The different attempts to rebuild typified the different reformations . Its final completion , i.e. , all the so-called churches arising in and growing out of the Dark Age , including the sects , in which are many of Gods people , who are , however , commanded of God to " come out of her . " * ( Revelation 18:4 ) Further showed that according to the type and other Scriptures the church of God must arise to a glory excelling that of the first age , and that , owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( of which we gave some Scripture evidence ) , some great revolution must be near at hand to bring about this prophesied glory of the church . <p> Some remarks were made on the ordinances , after which we engaged in the ordinances . Had a glorious time . A great many brethren and sisters were present to engage in following the Lord . Oh , how I love those dear people ! What a host of true hearts ! God bless them . <p> 14 . Traveled by buggy to the grove meeting at Windfall , four miles south of Larue . Brother Burchard preached an excellent sermon . <p> 17 . Received letters from Brother Bolton requesting me to come soon to my mission in Nebraska and one from Brother Shoemaker requesting me to stop and preach over Sabbath in Chicago . <p> 19 . Wrote out the record of the Church of God at New Washington . Eve , preached at Union . Here the church have a peculiar attachment to me . All wept much at my departure . A more true and faithful band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very dear to me . About half of the church are my converts . <p> 20 . Visited Brother E and Sister P. They embraced religion under my labors , and I joined them in marriage . Came home and packed for my journey . <p> 21 . Finished matters up to start . Received a letter from a kind friend . Went to New Haven in the evening . Farewell meeting at New Haven . <p> 22 . Sabbath . Thank God for a beautiful day . Many brethren came in from Union , New Washington , Auburn , and Liberty , and Brother Mitchell and others from east Ohio . We had a glorious meeting . I preached on south , and shall sit down in the kingdom of God . " <p> After preaching . Brother Jenner baptized four souls , two of whom had been converted here at New Haven , the other two were from elsewhere . Thus out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of deferring to baptize for six months . Evening , preached on John 6:66-68 . Had a good time in observing the ordinances . With many tears and farewell greetings , we gave each other the parting hand . Oh , what friends are these ! It tries the heartstrings to leave them . What a glorious thing that there is a meeting that knows no parting ! What must it be to be there ! May we all meet at last when the storms of life are over . <p> Before leaving for the West , a correspondence was arranged with Sarah A. Keller , of Upper Sandusky . She is doubtless the " kind friend " just referred to with emphasis . Out of this correspondence there soon sprang a glowing flame of love , the beginning of a companionship that meant for him so much of both weal and woe . <h> A Nebraska Mission <p> The denomination known as the Church of God , founded by John Winebrenner in Pennsylvania in 1830 , soon spread over western Pennsylvania and Ohio and gradually extended its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of labor in Nebraska covered more or less the counties of Seward , York , Polk , Hamilton , and Fillmore . We shall again let him speak for himself . <p> June 25 , 1873 . This is my birthday . Thirty-one years of my hasty life have passed away . They have gone to eternity . Their record has all been entered upon the book by the Scribe of heaven . O Lord , whatever has not been set down to thy glory , for Jesus sake blot out in the blood of Christ ! Only eight years have been devoted to God and they crowded with many imperfections . Great God , I thank thee that we have an advocate to plead our cause and secure our pardon . Wash me , Lord , and make me clean . Oh , keep me pure in heart , that the remainder of life may all be given to God ! <p> Took train at Upper Sandusky for Chicago . Ate dinner in Fort Wayne . Stopped off at Warsaw and went to New Paris to visit my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord . Eve , heard Dr. Everitt lecture on phrenology . <p> 26 . Was examined by Everitt and received a chart of character and instruction . I heard him deliver a course of lectures in my schoolroom in Corunna , Indiana , the fall of 1865 . He lectured in the evening on temperaments . Took notes . <p> 28 . Put in the day viewing the great city of Chicago . Nearly all the burnt district is built again with enormous buildings . It is wonderful to think that for miles we can walk streets built up on either side with magnificent buildings of brick , stone , and marble , from three to nine stories high , iron fronts , etc. , all built since the fire . It inspires the heart with wonder and admiration to behold externally and internally the enormous hotels Sherman , Palmer , Tremont , and Pacific , of which the latter is the largest . It covers one half block and is nine stories high . Passed through under Chicago River . Chicago is one of the wonders of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was much interested with all we saw . <p> 29 . Sabbath . I preached in the evening from these words : " What do ye more than others ? " * ( Matthew 5:47 ) The day was pleasantly spent . Brother Shoemaker has spent nine years in trying to build up a Church of God here . Though the membership is yet small , we have a good church property and some good brethren here . I had the pleasure of seeing the wife , two sons , and one daughter of Elder John Winebrenner , who are members of the church here . <p> 2 . Enjoyed my visit very much with this lovely family . Received many useful hints from Brother B. concerning the West and the great missionary work . <p> 3 . Daylight found us at Creston . From there to Red Oak the country is a beautiful rolling prairie . Very little is cultivated , all grass . At Red Oak took branch road southwest to Nebraska City through a beautiful prairie valley . Beautiful corn . At Hamburg , eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed bluff , high and sharp , from which we can see the city . Crossed the Missouri River at Nebraska City on the steamer Lizzie Campbell . The river was high and ran swiftly . <p> 4 . This is a proud day for Americans , the anniversary of American independence . There was quite an interesting celebration in Nebraska City . Free dinner , band , thirty-seven young ladies dressed in white with badges bearing the names of the thirty-seven states , also the goddess of liberty . Judge Kinney delivered a good speech on the occasion . A great crowd of people were in attendance . The whole matter displayed skill and ingenuity in its design and execution . Arrived at Seward at 9:30 P.M. Walked out through the prairie two miles to Bro . William Andersons . <p> 5 . Visited Brother James Anderson . Walked across the country . How sublime and beautiful the rolling prairie ! There is a strong breeze here nearly all the time , which makes the summer pleasant and agreeable . The wind is from the east ; a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 6 . Sabbath . At 4 P.M. I preached my first sermon in Nebraska , in the Anderson Schoolhouse . Text , Isaiah 62:6 . <p> Here we have to pass over a period of eight months . It is unfortunate that we do not have all of the books , forming a continuous diary account . His notes written during his first winter on the Western plain would have been interesting . As it is , we have to pass over the fall and winter of 1873 and begin again in March 1874.3 By this time it seems that he had taken up a claim at Wayland , Polk County . The Advocate he refers to was the church paper , published at Harrisburg , of which he was a correspondent . This chapter includes a temporary absence from the State , occasioned by his marriage and visit in Ohio , after which he returns with his helpmeet to his Western field . His references to Sarah , his bride-to-be , are , of course , full of tenderness . We shall give but brevities from the diary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , number converted , etc . The meetings first mentioned were held near Seward . <p> 3 : <p> Dr. Forney , in his History of the Churches of God , says of D. S. Warners mission work in Nebraska , that in February 1874 , he organized a church at Fairmount , Fillmore County , of twenty-four members . Also one at Cropsey , one at Evergreen , one in the Anderson community , Seward County , of sixteen members , and one other . He had fourteen preaching places . <p> March 14 , 1874 . This is a rainy day , the first of any account since the 22nd of November . Wrote two articles for the Advocate and some letters . <p> 15 . Sabbath . Preached at eleven on the second advent of Christ , two hours . Eve , Brother Robotham preached . T was dry and dead enough to take all the life out of a meeting . I tried to exhort the people . Jesse Horton found peace to his soul . Thank God for the salvation of the old gray-headed sinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , and came to the altar in much earnest , seeking the Lord . This is a noble example . God bless the woman . I think her husband will follow . <p> 16 . The air was damp today . Read Nelson on Infidelity . Prayed and meditated . Eve , had some headache , but thank God it did not grow worse and prevent my preaching , as it sometimes does . The night was dark and damp . The congregation was much smaller than usual . Had good liberty . A number of young people were present , about all of whom were serious . <p> 17 . Had prayer meeting at schoolhouse . Came home and wrote a letter to my darling Sarah , then went to Seward . Received a letter from Brother Shuler , treasurer , with post office order for fifty dollars . <p> 19 . Day meeting at half past ten . P.M. , mounted a horse and rode in company with Brother Figard to Mr. Penses , two miles . Talked to them on the important subject of their souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not having some one else there to preach , as Brother Combs , of the Methodist Episcopal Church , had promised to be there for the last two nights . Thank God , my headache abated and I spake with liberty on the text , " My spirit shall not always strive with man . " * ( Genesis 6:3 ) <p> 21 . Started for Fillmore County . Stopped a few minutes at a store at Nickleville . Heard some poor sinners swearing horrible oaths . Oh , how my heart was pained to hear them thus insult the Author and Giver of all their blessings ! Came to Brother Witters . Found all well and faithful to their Savior . They were much joyed at my coming . The church has grown in grace and influence . <p> 22 . Sabbath . Beautiful morn ; Met at 10:30 A.M. , heard a number of the brethren and sisters speak . Went to Indian Creek , where I had the pleasure of immersing the following names nine persons . It was a glorious time . All were happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.M. started over to Brother Moffits . Passed a pond of some ten acres on which were all of a thousand brants , a species of wild goose ; they are white , except a black streak across their wings . Reached destination . Here are good prospects for gathering a church . <p> 23 . Quite cold this morn ; I have to drive about thirty-five miles against the wind . It was a hard days ride . Came on to the meeting and found that the work had not progressed in my absence . I could not have remained , but now I have only two nights and we must if possible see some poor sinners saved before I leave . O God ! in mercy hear us and bless our efforts . <p> 27 . Had to go forty miles today to an appointment . Called on some of the brethren at Wayland . The day was cold . <p> 30 . Last night I had a precious dream of meeting my angel love , Sarah . Oh , how happy I was to return to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whom my soul longs to be ! Now are only seven Sabbaths until I start . Oh , how our hearts yearn to be together ! Lord , speed the time . Never did woman have purer and stronger love for man than that of my dearest Sarah for meyes , even me . O Lord , what a blessing thou hast here bestowed on thy unworthy servant ! What a bliss to me , that I should thus be loved , and that , too , by the very creature that I would rather have love me than any fair female in all the world ! O Lord ! this is thy doing and it is wonderful in our eyes . How happy I would be this morning were my beautiful , virtuous , and loving companion by my side ! How hard it is to stay apart so long ! God give grace and strength of mind to endure this torture of separation . <p> April 3 , 1874 . What a bright and beautiful morn ! I am surrounded by beautiful scenery . The family lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blue . The house sits on the edge of a bank about twenty feet on the north ; on the south the stream making a loop comes around just far enough from the south side to make a nice little yard . To the east is a beautiful , large yard . To the west is quite a picturesque scene ; the stream , running very crooked , doubles around with but narrow , high banks between , and all covered with timber , some of the largest trees I have seen in the State , some oaks four feet across , yet not one of them enough to make a rail cut , branching out a few feet from the ground . The whole presents a romantic scene , Brother Querry settled here five years ago , when there were only a few families in the country . The settling up of the country has far surpassed in rapidity the wildest imagination . Bro . George Fellows and I went out on a hunt for prairie chickens and wild geese . We went in the buggy , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had a few shots at wild geese but killed nothing . <p> 5 . Sabbath . Easter . Bright , warm , and beautiful morning . Preached at eleven on the Church of God , diagrammed on blackboard . The truth was well received . There is a fine prospect for the Church of God . Dr. Stone who is no professor of religion but a thorough student of the Bible , and one whom I think will soon give himself to the Lord , is one with us in sentiment . Another good old Methodist Episcopal brother who preaches some sanctioned my sermon all through , even my strongest denunciation of creeds , sects , etc . Brother Stoner , a Disciple , was well pleased with the church but took exceptions to feet-washing , reception of the Spirit by faith before baptism , and the divine call to the ministry . He invited me home with him and we talked over the matter and he conceded my position on all these points . His companion before held with us on all these points . <p> 7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and staked off a yard , etc . <p> 10 . Wrote some letters . This was a warm and beautiful day . Oh , how lovely the spring after the long , cold winter ; emblem of the time of the Lords coming , the time of singing of birds ! The turtle-dove is heard in the land , all to remind us of the Lords coming . <p> The approach of summer also gladdens my heart because it is bringing us near the happy time when I shall be joined in holy matrimony with the pure and warm-hearted Sarah , whose constant and ardent love is worth more to me than all the treasures and honor of earth . Could I hold converse with that bright luminary whose beams and gentle rays fall so graciously upon the earth today , I would ask if the revolving earth brought another creature under his shining light so pure , fair , and lovely as my own blessed Sarah . <p> 13 . This morn is rainy . Drove to Wayland , fifteen miles , and then worked all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother Berry had just got the lumber hauled from Seward on the ground and begun the work . We worked through the damp weather and got it finished , a stove up , and a bed by 10 P.M. , when the brethren left , and I retired to sleep , the first night in my life in my own house and on my own land . Thank God for these blessings ! May God help me to use it as not abusing it . <p> 14 . Returned to my house and made a stand . P.M. , went to Barbers , where I preached at night on the signs of the coming of Christ . Had a house full of very attentive hearers . Spoke two hours . All seemed highly interested . <p> 15 . In the eve drove about seven miles over into York County and preached to a crowded house in the Parker Schoolhouse . <p> 16 . Went to Mr. Mahaffeys and had a good visit . He is a lawyer , a smart man , well informed in the Bible . Agrees with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart to Jesus . Wishes to borrow some of my books to inform himself for the service of God . I pray God that he may be soundly converted and become useful . I had left no appointment , but several came together and begged me to leave another appointment before going east . I never saw people more eager for the gospel than here . Many have fallen in love with the Church of God and desire me to form a church here . P.M. , went home and worked some at my house . <p> 28 . Drove to Brother J. A. Marks . The day passed off very pleasantly . Spent the time in meditation and singing praise to God . Drove about forty-five miles and reached destination about 6 P.M. There seemed to be no fatigue to me nor to my steed , Mattie Blaze . The roads were beautiful and the day delightful . How balmy the air ! There perhaps never was another such delightful country to travel in . Found no one at home at Brother Marks . Put up Mattie Blaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took possession of the house . Ere long the family came home , having been at a neighbors . They were well and glad to see me . <p> May 1 , 1874 . Came to Grand Island , in Hall County , about fifteen miles northwest of Brother Marks . Found Brother John Kramer and family well . They are a very fine people , firm in the principles of the Church of God . They have a beautiful place one and one fourth miles from the city . All that is wanting is a Church of God here . I feel sorry that they can not be supplied . But this is a hard place to do anything unless we have a house of worship . Brother K. could find no place in the city to have an appointment , so he has an appointment in his own house for Lords day . Sectarian bigotry abounds here in the West ; each sect , fearing the rottenness of its own foundation , is not willing to have it tried by the gospel . <p> 2 . Wrote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Brother Ks . How pleasant it is to have a place of solitary retirement , so seldom enjoyed in the small sod houses of this frontier country ! This afternoon there was a good deal of excitement in Grand Island on the occasion of breaking ground for a new railroad , the St. Joseph and Grand Island Railroad . It is now in operation from St. Joseph to Hastings . Grand Island is beautifully situated on the Union Pacific Railroad and on the north side of Platte River . It has a bright prospect for a large city and important railroad center . <p> 3 . Sabbath . Rainy in A.M. , hence no preaching . Spent the day pleasantly with the kind Kramer family singing and talking on Scripture . <p> 5 . Started this beautiful morn to Fillmore County . Took my dinner and fed Mattie Blaze on Sec. 12 , Twp. 9 . Range 6 W. Two miles east is the nicest railroad section I ever saw . I crossed the South Blue River in a beautiful grove , which was quite green . The place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop in the shade by the cool stream . I wondered if I should ever have the pleasure of crossing through this beautiful grove with my lovely Sadie , who of course is always brought to my mind when I meet anything that is lovely and beautiful , for she is the fairest and most lovely piece of Gods creation . <p> Two graceful ducks were swimming in the water . This as well as the cooing dove near by brought forcibly to my mind my beloved , who is far away . The doves cooing was an index to my heart , that longed to be with her , so clear to me . Even the beautiful stream suggested to me our two beings that were soon to blend fully into one to follow on in everlasting love , like two streams of water that mingle together and flow on in the same channel . <p> These lines are being penned in this beautiful grove while many feathered songsters are singing their sweet songs over my head . Thank God for the beauties of nature and all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Received a letter from Brother J. A. Shuler , treasurer , with an order in my favor for fifty dollars . Thank the kind Lord and all who gave to this fund . <p> 8 . Came to Indian Creek . Found all well and anxious for my coming . All seemed faithful . <p> 10 . Sabbath . Sabbath-school at ten . Preached on Genesis 28:12-13 . A strange brother arose and said he would like to speak a few words . He remarked that for some time he had been searching for the truth and the old paths and that he precisely agreed with me that there is but one church , i.e. , the church of God , so named by the mouth of the Lord , governed alone by the Word of God , including all who have the Spirit of Christ , by which they are baptized into the body , the church . The brother talks some to the people and accepted an invitation to preach in two weeks . Thank God for more laborers to contend for the truth . <p> After this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure of immersing names seven persons . At last baptizing Brother Winters told me that he had been baptized by his parents when a child , and now they were dead and gone , and out of respect for them he would never be baptized again . I told him to read his Bible and see whether that satisfied the demands of God upon him . I further reminded him that religion was a personal matter . He acted upon these suggestions and the result was he was anxious to obey God . Oh , how the commands of God are made void by the traditions of men ! The baptizing was one of great interest . All were happy . Eve , had a good speaking-meeting . Some said it was the happiest day of their lives . Preached on the ordinances and had a heavenly time in observing them . Bade the brethren and sisters farewell . <p> 13 . Was to have a breaking bee , but it rained all forenoon . P.M. , worked on my claim . Eve , preached from Acts 20:32 . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by eleven . It was raining and very dark . <p> 18 . Went to Seward in the morning . Spent the day preparing for my journey . Eve , preached in Seward and returned home . <p> 19 . The happy time has come at last that I start back to my beloved Sarah . May Gods kind care be over me by the way . Took train at half-past nine at Seward . This is the morning I have been thinking about so long . The hard labor of another year is over . Since last July 4 preached one hundred and fifty-five sermons . <p> 21 . Today the Board of Missions meets in Chicago . Wish I could he there to report in person ; but I sent out my report yesterday . At 7:20 P.M. started on my journey . Came via Hamburg , St. Joseph , and Kansas City where I arrived at early daylight . <p> 22 . Took the Missouri Pacific through the State of Missouri . Train stopped for dinner at Jefferson City . Ran through tunnels , under rocks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet on one side of the cars and on the other the Missouri River . Missouri in some parts seems to be a beautiful State ; but taking it altogether it falls far short of Nebraska as an agricultural state . It is rather rough . Had three fourths of an hour in St. Louis . Purchased a suit for thirty-five dollars , also a small present for my beloved Sarah , a collar , $1.50 , and cravat , $1.50 . Took train on Toledo , Wabash , and Western at 7 P.M. Crossed the Mississippi on a transfer boat near the great iron bridge , which is a wonderful structure . Took sleeping car and lay down with a heart full of gratitude to God for his protection through the dangers of the day and humbly entreating his care through the night . <p> 23 . Reached Fort Wayne at 7 A.M. Staid over till 12:30 P.M. Then came on with a light heart . Arrived at Upper Sandusky at 4:50 P.M. Rode out to Brother Kellers with Brother Hoffman . And now the long contemplated time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind Lord for his care and protection over us through these eleven long months that we have been so far , far apart . <p> This eve went to see Father Shriner , who is nearing the other shore to dwell with the spirits made perfect . Had a season of prayer . Returned with Brother Keller . <p> 25 . Father Shriner died at 4 A.M. yesterday , and at 11 A.M. today Brother Small preached the funeral , followed by Brother Updike and me . It was a very large funeral . Father S. was an upright and godly man , firmly devoted to truth and right . Well do I remember words that fell from his lips some four years ago when , during his report , he remarked : " Brethren , I have always tried to maintain a ministerial character . " These words , backed up by his exemplary life , had a great meaning and made a deep impression on my mind . They inspired me with new determination to live out the same character by the grace of God . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , how happy I am to have the blessed company of my dearly beloved Sadie ! Surely I should be a happy and grateful man , having such a rich treasure . <p> 28 . Took train for Crestline , where I am now writing these lines , waiting for the train to Shelby . But here it comes ! Twelve oclock , aboard the train . Oh , how convenient to the great cause of God is the railroad ! Reached Daniel Bakers , at Shelby , at 1 P.M. We were happy to meet again . <p> Nearly one year has passed since my last visit here in company with Bro . J. L. Jenner , who is now in eternity . Poor fellow , he became insane last April and on the 25th cut his throat and abdomen , from the effects of which he died some days later . From the best information I could get his mind was overcome by an unwillingness to preach the whole gospel of God , through a desire to gain the applause of man . As ministers of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear of God . <p> 29 . Came to W. Auburn , where I met many of the dear brethren beloved as children . Preached from Psalm 144:15 . How happy and grateful I am to meet with these beloved people ! <p> 30 . This morn I went up into my old room at Brother Peter Wrights and looked over all my mementos of my dear departed companion and sonny . <p> 31 . Sabbath . Had a good speaking-meeting . Preached on the signs of the coming of Christ . The house was crowded . Eve , Brother Awkerman preached on the ordinances , after which we had a happy time in obeying them . Human language can not express my joy . <p> June 3 , 1874 . Yesterday and today the women were busily engaged in preparations for our wedding . <p> 4 . This is the happy day to which my mind has so often soared ahead of time to embrace in sweet anticipation . Thank God that the onward flight of time has brought the day in which my angel Sarah* and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early to breathe the balmy air . At the rising of the sun there was a heavy fog which all disappeared in a very short time , leaving the morning bright and lovely . All nature seemed cheerful . Never have I heard the birds sing so sweet and melodious as this morn in the woods over the way from Father Kellers brick farmers home . It seemed that the dear little feathered songsters were congratulating me for the rich fortune the day brings to me . Went to Upper Sandusky in the morning . Weather hot . Here he mentions a list of the guests from Auburn , Tiffin , and elsewhere . At four the ceremony was performed , Brother Burchard officiating . Brother and Sister Tomlinson groomsman and groomsmaid . All passed off pleasantly . Received many warm congratulations , after which we proceeded to partake of the rich preparations in the dining room . <p> The evening was pleasantly spent sitting in the cool shade on the east of the house . Now a new leaf is turned , a new era begun , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thank thee enough for the great gift of my own pure , amiable , fair , and lovely Sarah ! May God assist me to make her life happy as far as it is in the power of man to do so . God bless our union and make us together happy and useful . <p> 5 . This morning still bright and clear . We started for Brother Wrights . Stopped at noon at Bucyrus . Reached my old home at Ws about four . Our arrival was greeted with ringing and cheers from the boys . A rich infare reception supper was prepared . The evening was pleasantly spent singing and with music from two violins by Brothers Alvin Burch and Burchard . <p> 7 . Sabbath . Good speaking-meeting in the grove near New Washington . Preached on baptism . After speaking one hour a small storm arose , which threw the congregation into confusion . We dismissed the people to meet at three by the side of the Maumee River . There being a grove there I proceeded to finish my discourse and spake about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names omitted . Eve , I spoke on the washing of the saints feet , after which observed the same . This was a good meeting . About a thousand people were present . <p> 8 . Took train for Bryan , where we were met by my brother , who conveyed us to my parents , in Bridgewater Township , Williams Co . Thank God for a safe return to my parents once more . <p> 11 . Visited Brother Joseph . Eve , we took a walk to a beautiful cemetery on my brothers place . A new grave was there that awoke a train of interesting thoughts to my mind . It was the resting-place of Frances Stocking . She was the object of my affections and attentions at the time I gave my heart to God ( February 1865 ) . She was handsome and accomplished , having a very strong mind and good education . Her father was skeptical , and the dire disease was transmitted to Frank and I think the whole family . Having talked matrimony together and supposing she and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry her notwithstanding her infidelity and her rapidly failing health . Out of sympathy for her suffering , which she claimed would be removed by marriage , I pledged her my heart and hand . But I asked to defer our marriage until I pursued my studies a few years . Ere many months had passed I began to doubt the existence of the proper elements of union in our case . I took the matter to the Lord and was soon confirmed in the belief that our marriage was not ordained of God . Our attachments grew weaker and soon correspondence ceased and she became married to a rough young man by the name of Baker . They moved to the West , ere long parted , and she came back a year ago . When at home I learned that she was a spiritualist and by spells was crazy , in which condition she was hurried to the grave , a poor wreck , morally , mentally , and physically . <p> 17 . Passed once more the old schoolhouse where I gave my heart to God ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh how glad I am that it was ever my lot to become a Christian ! A beautiful house of worship stands near the place , belonging to the Church of God . <p> 25 . This is my birthday . Thirty-two years have passed over my head . How the time has flown ! Oh God ! blot out of my past years all that is wrong and help me give all that remain to thee and thy cause . <p> July 8 , 1874 . This is my dear Sarahs birthday . She is nineteen years of age . <p> 24 . Brother Lewis Williams took us and our goods to New Washington . Had a good talk at the depot with Brother A. He seemed very much dissatisfied with my having organized a church in Upper Sandusky . Intimated that it would make me trouble . Oh , that God would save his preachers from envy and vindictive cruelty in biting and devouring each other ! Whatever the Eldership may do in my case , I am certain that I did what I have done through pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his cause , and I believe with his approbation . <p> 30 . This morn went to West Unity , thence to Father John Kerrs in Fulton County . Eve , went to prayer meeting . Heard a good number of my scholars testify for Jesus , thank God . Meeting was led by Brother G. W. Dustin , who is a noble young man . Since he attended my school , I have felt impressed that God desired to make a minister out of him . I pray that God may lead him into all truth . <p> August 11 , 1874 . Father , Mother and Brother Joseph brought us to Bryan . Bade farewell to the friends once again . Reached Goshen about four . Found Mr. Guiss , my brother-in-law . Reached his home in New Paris about dusk . My sisters health is poor . <p> 15 . Preached in New Paris from Matthew 24:3 . Four young brethren and two sisters were there from Syracuse . <p> 16 . Brother Keller came after us early this morning to convey us out to Syracuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Went home with Charles Strombeck , whose companion is sick . Prayed for her . She seemed strengthened . Four brethren each put a dollar into my hand . Returned to town . Eve , preached on Ezekiel 43:10-11 . Diagrammed on the board . House full . A collection was taken up for me . Never did I find such overabundant kind and benevolent people . They seem as near to me as though I had preached for years in their midst . God will surely bless them and greatly reward I their kind liberality . <p> 18 . In company with Brother S. , visited the scene of the late fire . Visited the great water-works , also the exposition building , the largest building I was ever in . Walked through the tunnel and visited the Union , Michigan , and Jefferson Parks , where was much of interest . Traveled by streetcar and on foot about ten miles . Took train on the Burlington at 10 P.M. <p> 19 . Reached Red Oak , Iowa , 7 P.M. Put up at the Tremont House . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom she had opposed as a suitor for her daughter . Four balls were fired , some of which took effect in the neck . She may possibly recover . The assassin was arrested and confined . <p> 20 . Took train for Nebraska City . Western Iowa is beautiful ; Sarah much admires it . Reached the Missouri River at ten , and Brother Kimmels in Nebraska City at eleven . Took train for Seward . The country looks beautiful . One thing strikes the mind as different from Iowa and Illinois , and that is the great abundance of wheat on this side of the Missouri River . Corn is raised in abundance in those States ; but little proportionately is raised here , and will be almost an entire failure this year owing to the drought and grasshoppers . As soon as we crossed the Missouri we landed among swarms of those insects . Landed safely at Seward at 10 P.M. Thank God for his kind care over us , permitting us safely to return to my field of labor . <p> 21 . This morning Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Andersons . <p> 22 . P.M. , we went out to visit a colony of prairie dogs . Eve , preached from 2 Peter 1:3 . <p> 24 . Went to Seward , Wife and I and Brother J. W. K. He leaves on the train this morn for Ohio to take a wife , a dear sister , Eliza T , who was converted under my labors and is a special friend of mine . About a year ago I introduced them to each other , since which time they have corresponded and now have pledged themselves to live in unison for life . I pray God that their union may result in unbroken happiness and usefulness . <p> 26 . Wife and I came to Polk County . Wife is pleased with the home , but fears we shall not be able to build . I pray God he may send help from some source . <p> 29 . Drove about twenty-three miles , to Fillmore . Preached in the old sod schoolhouse . The brethren and sisters were glad to see me , as I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them during my absence . He does well and is sound in the Scriptures . I am glad that I found him out before I left . <p> 31 . At 3 P.M. started for Seward County , thirty-eight miles . At sunset stopped and ate our supper by the way . Turned out Mattie Blaze to pick grass . Then came on . The curtains of night were soon thrown about us . It was cloudy . and not being able to see my guiding stars we lost our way . When I discovered the North Star we traveled some distance by it with no road at all . We went several miles out of our way and landed at Bro . J. Andersons after twelve . <p> September 4 , 1874 . Drove twenty-six miles to Polk County . <p> 5 . Went over to our house and found our goods ; Brother Fox had brought them from Seward . Found everything all right . Read in the Testament . Finished it today . Had finished and recommenced it last Thanksgiving Day . Oh , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future what I have , to read the precious Bible ! <p> 10 . Started to York Center . Rained . Turned in to Brother Samuel Marbles . No one at home . Soon he came . Left us in search of his wife . Did not find her till between three and four . We spent the time pleasantly in his old dugout . Instead of being lonesome it was pleasant to be found alone even in an old wet dugout and on a dreary day . It appeared like a small taste of the bliss that a home of our own would yield us . The greatest difficulty was something to eat . Plums were plentiful , else we could find nothing . When they returned they felt very bad that they happened to be away from home . They spared no pains to make us welcome and comfortable . Supper was served , after which the rain and darkening shades of night prevented our return . <p> 12 . Sabbath . Started early for Polk County . Received some letters , one from Father and Mother Keller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us here on the frontier , not even a disposition to do justice by us . Lord , forgive them . We will suffer all things for thy sake . O God , my heart is bruised and crushed ! We seem to meet with no sympathy from friends or brethren . Many have grown cold . Brothers H and O would not go to meeting . Went on to the Bense Schoolhouse . Preaching time , but no one there . Two neighbors came , no member of the Church of God . O Lord , the waves are rolling over me ! All things against us . Some are offended because we will not recognize the devils secret gods with which they have been polluted . Others are backslidden . Lord , the troubles of my heart are enlarged ! It is more than I can bear . I can not restrain my grief for the desolation of Zion . The people are now gathering , but my tears prevent the reading of a hymn . Companion and a few brothers and sisters shed their tears with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 . Sister Berry , Sarah , and I went to Lincoln Creek . Got tub of plums . <p> 18 . Tried to get lumber on time , but could not . Felt very much cast down . No money yet from the Board . Friends in the East have no sympathy for us . Brethren here have no means . Winter is coming on soon and no home for my dear Sarah and me ! With a heavy heart we started out to Brother J. H. Andersons . Heard he was not at home . Went on to Brother Greens . As soon as he found I could not build they kindly invited us to move into their north room , which is a pleasant room with bedroom above and cellar privileges . Thanks be unto God ! " Behind a frowning providence he hides a smiling face . " * <p> 19 . Sabbath . Eve , preached at the Osborne Schoolhouse , up Lincoln Creek , a new point . Stayed at Mr. Os , who is a Campbellite . Had some talk , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some grapes for Sarah . Came home to Brother Greens . <p> 21 . Sarah and I went to Polk County . <p> 22 . Spent in our house preparing to take things back to Brother Greens , Seward County . Sarah and I slept in our house all night . <p> 23 . Staid all day again at house . Brother J. W. Figard came to take our things . <p> 27 . Came to Seward County , Brother Greens . Stopped at noon in the timber of the Blue River . <p> October 1 , 1874 . Eldership meets in West Ohio . May God bless their deliberations . Worked till noon . At 3:15 P.M. started for York County , twenty-six miles . Could not reach it . Stopped at Brother Everetts . <p> 3 . About this time the West Ohio Eldership has passed through another session . I now begin another years work . <p> 5 . Drove home . Found my dear companion well . How happy we are to be alone this eve in our little home ! How sweet the home where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! How pure and strong , and still increasing ! How happy I am ! How blessed and favored ! <p> 6 . Worked at cupboard and helped my dear wash . <p> 7 . Provided and arranged things for wife . Dear creature wept this morn that I had to be away again so soon and long . <p> 10 . Visited and talked with nearly all the members of the church . Many are cold and indifferent . Many have strife and bickerings . Oh , shame ! Great God , save this church , of whose piety and devotion I have so often boasted . Some are spiteful at me because I touched the god of this world . Brother M raved and foamed over at me . God pity and forgive the poor graceless man . Thank God for grace to endure unruffled his abuse . Staid all night in my house . <p> 12 . Started for home , anxious to see my blessed wife . This is the longest we have been apart since our marriagefive days . How long the time seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely she must be ! God bless her . Came by way of Seward . Dear Sarah had been way out on the prairie waiting for me . <p> 20 . Started for the Oliver Schoolhouse , about twelve and one half miles to the northwest . Dear wife felt so bad to see me leave . The dear creature wept bitterly . Oh , how it pained my heart to leave her feeling so sad ! Greens folks were absent , which made it more lonely . O God , must I tear myself away from the dear wife bathed in tears ? But t is the cause of Christ and I must go . O Lord , comfort her loving heart . <p> 24 . Started for Fillmore County . Drove against a very heavy wind . <p> 25 . Sabbath . At 11 A.M. preached , Psalm 48:14 . The old sod was full of hearers . <p> 26 . Drove to Brothers and gathered quite a good load of vegetables and feed that these good brethren gave us . Came to Brother Weeters , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hauled it over for us . God bless these kind people . I fed and ate my dinner on the Blue River . Reached home 3 P.M. , found dear wife well . <p> November 1 , 1874 . Sabbath . This morn arose early and prepared a sermon on the subject of the Sabbath . <p> 2 . At three started home . Arrived at dark . Dear wife was very lonesome and almost despaired of my coming home that day . Thank God , we are blessed with a home and a thousand domestic comforts . Oh , what a blessing is home when illuminated with the pure love of an affectionate companion ! <p> 3 . Went to Seward , where were two barrels of apples sent to me by a kind friend in Ohio . May the Lord bless his soul and reward him . He not only donated the apples but paid one dollar for the barrels and $1.25 freight to Chicago . The cost here was $4.20 . Not having the money to lift transport them we let Brother Anderson have one barrel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.M. , started for Crete . Stopped in a deep draw at 1 P.M. to feed Mattie Blaze and eat our dinner . Sarah and I ate a whole chicken , some bread and butter , and finished off with an apple apiece . Went via Milford and Camden . Passed through a very large colony of prairie dogs . Enjoyed a leisure visit among this brisk and numerous little folk . <p> 7 . Was glad to meet our dear and esteemed old Brother Moore , of whom I had heard so much . He is a very intelligent old pilgrim , greatly in love with the doctrines of the Church of God . It was through his earnest appeals that missionaries were sent to this part of Nebraska . At 4 P.M. we met in the Bethel to take the preliminary steps to the formation of an Eldership in Nebraska . Organized by the election of Brother K. A. Moore speaker and Brother McElwee and myself clerks . <p> 9 . Met at 9 A.M. for business . The day was passed off very pleasantly . Love seasoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I delivered a discourse on church polity . Missionaries reported , and other business transacted . Closed by a touching speech from Brother Moore and prayer by me . The meeting was very edifying to us all and greatly strengthened the brotherly ties . <p> 10 . Met early this morning in the Bethel for a social meeting . Good time . Brother Moore left us for home . God bless the old pilgrim and spare his life yet many years to bless his cause . Brother McE. and I spent the day in transcribing the minutes of the Eldership . <p> I preached in the Bethel , 1 Chronicles 29:5 . God blessed my soul . This afternoon I had a special season of secret prayer and communion with my God . Oh , how near he came to his poor servant ! This eve I was unusually blessed in presenting the thoughts he had given me on the text , " And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day to the LORD ? " * ( 1 Chronicles 29:5 ) A deep interest prevailed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borne with an arrow in his heart . I expect to hear of his early conversion . <p> 13 . Made out program for Ministerial Association to be held next spring in Seward . <p> 14 . Came home . Pretty cold . Captured a wild duck which had its wing broken that day by some hunter . Reached home at nearly dusk . <p> 15. This was an earnest days work . I pray God that it may bring forth fruit to his glory . <p> December 25 , 1874 . This is Christmas . At eleven preached on the incarnation of Christ . Returned to Brother M. Hoffers , where the kindred , companion , and I partook of a good feast . Roasted fowls . All passed off pleasantly and in a Christian manner . I was solemn and meditative . We sang some . Eve , spoke on John 14:23 . With solemn and feeling hearts and minds performed the ordinances of feet washing and the Lords Supper . <p> 27 . Sabbath . I preached about two hours on the immortality of man . Read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , all positively declaring the spirituality of mans nature . Also several places proving that the soul came forth from the body at death and is as much more important than the body as the man is than the tent in which he lives . Proved also the conscious existence of a soul in an intermediate state . When through , Mr. K , a poor silly Adventist , harangued some moments . How confused the wretched Adventist doctrine ! <p> January 1 , 1875 . Another year has rolled into eternity . God is still favoring us with his kind care and preservation . Oh , how many souls are in eternity today who with light hearts enjoyed friendly greetings and sumptuous festivities a year ago today ! Some , alas , we fear , have been " cut down out of time , " * ( Job 22:16 ) who had no Christ in the soul . Oh , what a mockery are all the pleasures of the wicked ! True and warm hearts wished them a happy New Year one year ago today ; but alas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doom to eternal misery . O God ! Give us grace to enable us to spend our years to thy glory . Companion and I spent the day very pleasantly in Seward with . The two ladies are sisters , and old friends and acquaintances of Ohio . They had a sumptuous feast . We sang a few hymns , read a chapter , and knelt in prayer to our Father in heaven . Then came home . <p> 2 . Took Sarah to Brother Andersons and started to visit the church in Fillmore County , a distance of about thirty miles . Stopped in Nickleville and fed Mattie Blaze . Warmed and ate my dinner in a store . Reached Brother Weeters a little after dark . The brother was gone and I was so cold I could hardly put my pony away . Sister W. soon got me some supper , and after eating hastily I set out afoot one and one half miles to the schoolhouse . Found three brethren there . No light . Gave them a short discourse from Hebrews 10:35 . <p> 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old sod schoolhouse warm , but the stove was so poor they failed . They then came up to Brother Hortons , where I spoke to a little band of brethren and sisters from Hebrews 9:16-17 . Started for Brother Moffitts . Quite cold and stormy . Stopped at Brother P. H. Griggs . Talked till a late hour on Scripture . The brother is troubled with the no-organization doctrine advocated by Johnson , editor of the Stumbling Stone . The brother confessed that elders and deacons are authorized in the New Testament as the completion of the local organizations , and in short the polity of the Church of God is Bible . <p> 5 . Went to Seward . Got coal and a box sent by Father and Mother Keller . <p> 7 . Helped Wife wash . Read Moral Philosophy . <p> 8 . Made apple butter of the frozen apples in the box sent by father-in-law . <p> 9 . Very stormy and cold . Improved the time in mental and religious improvement . <p> 10 . Sabbath . Strange to find myself at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments here a week from today , I concluded not to go this week to York County , but hoping we would be favored with good weather I dispatched Brother Green to circulate appointments for tonight and during the week at Occidental . Eve , pretty good turnout . <p> 19 . At 12:45 P.M. started for York County , about twenty-six miles . Reached destination at 6 P.M. Small turnout . <p> 21 . This morn realized a precious nearness of Christ in family worship . Spent two hours in private room reading Testament and in prayer and meditation . It was a precious season . <p> 25 . Praise God for the great triumphs in his cause ! I am spending many hours on my knees praising God and imploring mercy for sinners . What a glorious work ! <p> 27 . Started for home . Dear Wife was much cast down owing to my stay being longer than I had intended . Dear affectionate creature ! My absence seems to rob her of all the happiness of life . It would be nonetheless the case with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my absence . <p> 29 . Strong wind from the west , and not feeling well I did not go to York County . Read and wrote . <p> 30 . Quite stormy . Can not go to the meeting today . Spent the day in reading and writing , prayer and meditation . <p> February 12 , 1875 . Wife , I , and names several others went to visit about two hundred Omahas , camped on the Blue two miles from Seward . They were on their return from their winters hunt . Were well laden with robes and furs . It was an interesting visit . The squaws were busily engaged in dressing and tanning buffalo robes ; the men stood and looked on . Poor creatures ! They seemed to be but servants for the men . How wrong and cruel such a custom ! We went into their wigwams ; but few could , or at least would , speak English . The little papooses were amusing themselves by loading each other down with bundles of weeds , etc. , in imitation of their pack-ponies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One girl about twelve had a little papoose but a few weeks old tied on a board and hung on her back . Sometimes she would lay it down face up in the sun , other times she had it on her back engaged in play with other children . I could see a marked improvement in the rising generation in the moral and intellectual organs . Their more frequent contact with white people and a general tendency to improvement in the tribe renders the children far superior to their parents . Some I noticed were as well constituted as many white children . One boy of about thirteen could spell quite well . May the kind providence of God yet elevate this poor distressed people to a higher plane of intellectual , moral , and religious enjoyment . The Omahas are among our most honorable and refined tribes . Bought a fine robe for ten dollars . Cost in Ohio about nineteen . <p> 16 . Brother Mc. and I came to the Oliver Schoolhouse . It was nearly enough to break my blessed wifes heart to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Were it not that " necessity is laid upon me , " * ( 1 Corinthians 9:16 ) I could not leave her . House nearly full . Psalm 85:6-8 . Came home with friend Mitchel . Turned cold . <p> 17 . The house being a small shell , I suffered much last night with cold . Arose and got overcoat . Fared some better but ached much and slept little . Spent the day till 4 P.M. at Mr. Ms. Talked much on religion . He acknowledged that he always read the Bible to condemn religion till I preached here last fall . He is not convicted . Hope he will soon yield to God . <p> 18 . I find that I have taken a severe cold from my cold nights lodging . After dinner examined Brother Hibbards head . A meeting two and one half miles south has been in progress some over two weeks and for a few nights there has been some interest , hence I must go there . <p> 21 . Sabbath . Had good speaking-meeting . Preached on Jeremiah 6:16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one half miles south . Brother Oliver and I went , found him , Brother John Cowan , scarcely able to be up , in great distress of mind . We read the Word , talked , sang , and prayed until God blessed his soul , and we all rejoiced . His mother shouted and anon praised God for " Winebrennerian religion , " declaring it was the old kind and as good as Methodist Episcopal or any other . It was amusing to see them all come down from deep-rooted prejudices . The brothers feet and anklebones having received strength , and he having eaten some , came with us to meeting . <p> 22 . Had family prayer meeting at 11 A.M. Examined Brother Mitchell and gave him a phrenological chart . <p> 23 . Stormy . A few of us met for prayer . Staid all day at Brother Hibbards . No meeting . Oh , how I longed to be with blessed companion this dreary day and night ! Through the night I spent hours listening to the muttering storm . Recalled all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled so as to be impassable . Determined to go home the next day if the driving snow would allow me to see three rods . <p> 24 . Morning came and the storm nearly subsided . Started for home . Mattie Blaze got into a snowdrift in which she could not reach the ground . Could not go through . Had to get out and get her loose from the buggy . Took her to Brother Hafers , nearby . Warmed myself , then drew the buggy back , hitched up , and drove out another way . Got home all right . Saw Sarahs smiling face . Thank God , the dear creature is well . <p> March 2 , 1875 . We had a glorious day meeting . How my heart leaped with joy to see my beloved Brother Anderson reclaimed again ! He has been a special object of my prayers . He is a brother I dearly love . <p> 5 . Good day meeting . Brother Briggs related how his little stepdaughter was blessed here yesterday . " She told her mother that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Brother Warner came and took her by the hand and said , Give your heart to Jesus , and she said to Jesus , Take my heart. Then she felt so happy . She got up and spoke like a little soldier . " Sister Anderson also told of her little girls singing " Good News Gone to Canaan " last eve and she got happy and clapped her hands for joy . <p> 9 . Went home with Brother James A. Tried to show the domestic duties of religion . It is a delicate task , but the shepherd often finds families that need plain talk on duties to each other and to God , in the family . Religion should find its most sacred altar in the family circle . There should its holy affections glow with the greatest warmth . If religion in all its tender affections and holy fruits does not burn on the family altar , the world will fail to see its light . God bless this family . <p> 10 . Last night and today a terrible cloud rested on us all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 11 . Staid at home . Read and prayed . Felt much depressed . Something is wrong . Satan has a victory somewhere . <p> 12 . The dark cloud , thank God , is passing . Find what the difficulty has been . Some of the young men who have been at the altar have been loafing and visiting saloons . Last night after meeting Sister Rebecca Anderson told them of their inconsistency , which I think has broken the devils chain ; hence we had a good meeting today . <p> 14 . Sabbath . Preaching at 11:30 A.M. Ephesians 3:14-15 . Proved the oneness of Christians ; the fact that this oneness is not manifest to the world ; that it should be ; and how . After preaching Brother S. got up and harangued in favor of sects . He said I had doubt of my sincerity . He believed I was a true Christian if there was one in the world , but what I had preached got him down in the heels . He made no attempt to prove nor even assert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never called up the question whether I had preached truth or not , only that my preaching made him and others feel bad . I told him that I had no doubt of it , for Paul had told us long ago that the time would come when men would not endure sound doctrine . Told him that I sympathized very much with him , that I had been in the same dread dilemma when I was not willing to accept the whole truth ; it always hurt me to hear it . In answer to questions I made him acknowledge to the truth of all that I had preached before the congregation . After meeting , Brother B , another poor sectarianized soul , pitched into me . The people crowded around . I made him confess that Paul forbade Christians at Corinth to divide into sects . Brother Riley , a fine man recently converted , seemed highly elated to hear the glorious doctrine of the Word defended . He will soon come into fellowship with the church . <p> Bro . Lewis Anderson , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . How fearful is a disturbed conscience ! Brother Hafer , who is a good man filled with the Spirit , remarked a few days ago to Brother Houck that we were having a good meeting but he feared Brother Warner would spoil the good feeling by preaching on the church . Brother H. told him that he need have no fears . If Brother W. preached the truth , it should not hurt a Christian ; if error , it is too weak to hurt anything . He advised him to come and hear for himself . He did so , sat with his head down , doubtless felt the force of truth but was too honest to trifle with it ; confessed that I had preached nothing but Bible . Oh , that the world were freed from the curse of human creeds , that men could be at liberty to obey God ! We had a good and pleasant meeting . My heart flowed with peace . <p> 18 . Dear Sarah very sick most of the afternoon . Confinement . I too felt nearly overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much comforted . Had the assurance that she would get along well from this time . She was no more so sick . At 6 P.M. the Lord delivered her of a large daughter , 8 pounds . Thank God for his goodness ! <p> And now , O Lord ! another sacred charge is committed to our trust . This day we acknowledge new responsibilities laid upon us . Thou hast committed to our care a pure and spotless soul . Give us grace and wisdom that we may bring up this dear child sound in body and mind , pure and innocent in heart and life , that thou , O God , its Maker , may be honored and glorified by its life and career on earth . O God ! thou author of its being , this night I bow before thy throne and consecrate this precious household gem to thee . Thou hast given it to us , and we wait not for one sun to pass over its head until we lay it upon altar of consecration to God , that all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vow to rear this child for thee . Shouldst thou see fit to leave it to grow up under our care , we shall bless thee for its angelic society ; and shouldst thou rather choose to take it to thyself in the dewy time of youth , O Lord ! we can not murmur ; for thine it is and only entrusted to our care till it seemeth good for thee to commit it to wiser and more worthy care in a more congenial abode than this dreary , sinful earth . God bless the dear little creature ! <p> 19 . Took care of dear Wife . <p> 20 . After taking care of Wife and child , went to Seward . When starting home Mattie Blaze stumbled , fell , and broke one of the shafts . Took buggy back to shop , left it , and rode home . Eve , preached at Occidental , returned at eleven greatly exhausted . Great weakness of back from stooping continually over the bed taking care of dear Wife and babe . <p> 23 . Sarah feeling rather worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad cold , being up so much of nights . <p> 25 . Am constantly taking care of dear Wife and child . They are getting along fine , thank God . Quite warm . Birds are singing . Summer appears ; nature is awakening from her long winter slumbers . <p> 27 . For some days I have had a severe conflict in my mind concerning my leaving to fill appointments in Fillmore County . T was hard to think of leaving dear Wife yet confined to her bed , as our girl has made no attempts to take care of her or child because I preferred to do it and she had no experience . Hard as it seemed for dear Wife , duty seemed all along to say I should go . I determined to do so . Preparations were made to go , but when the moment was at hand Wife wept , and fearing a want of care and too much anxiety might bring on a relapse I felt it my solemn duty to stay and take care of her . P.M. , went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eve , feeling that I dare not spend the Lords day without doing something for Christ ; but I failed to get a place to preach . <p> 28 . This is Easter Day . Spent the day in solitude with dear Wife and daughter . Wife feeling pretty well ; sat up much of the day for the first except a short time yesterday . Think this is the second Sabbath in eight years that I have not preached the Word of God . The day was mostly spent in reading and meditation . Felt i 'll at ease that I could not be preaching somewhere . <p> April 2 , 1875 . Sister Sarah Anderson , our girl , became homesick and would stay no longer . Could not leave to fill appointments in York and Polk Counties . Deeply regretted that I could not be with the dear brethren , but could get no one to take care of Wife and child ; besides , the roads were almost impassable . <p> 4 . Sabbath . Did up the work this morn , and though late I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to have at least one prayer with the dear brethren . Found they had just closed their prayer meeting . I read a chapter , talked some , and sang and prayed with them . My heart was full . Having been kept at home from public worship for some weeks , I felt as a bird set at liberty . Bless God for the privilege of appearing in his courts to offer our sacrifice of praise ! Returned home . Found dear Wife and child asleep , both feeling very well . The little creature slept right on till night . Sarah and I spent the time pleasantly reading and talking of our blessed hope of glory . My heart was light and happy . Bro . David Figard today kindly invited me to move into his house . Thank God for this kindness . The brethren know that we have not a very pleasant place to live , yet I have no room for complaints , but much occasion for thanks . <p> 7 . P.M. , heavy rains . About a mile to the southeast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud to the earth . It was a grand and sublime sight . As it followed a high ridge on the opposite side of the Blue River valley from us we had a beautiful view of it . We could see the water strike the ground and a dense spray arise around it resembling smoke . I have learned that it tore one house and a wagon to pieces . <p> 9 . Drove to Brother Figards via Seward . Our ride of about seven miles was the first for our dear little Levilla Modest . <p> 12 . About one last night I took quite sick with , I suppose , cholera morbus . Sick all day . Sorry I could not go to Polk County , but it is necessary that blessings disguised in affliction come at times as well as the almost constant blessing of health . Tonight , I think , is the third appointment in eight years that I have missed through my physical disability . <p> 13 . Drove to York County . Called at Father Fentons , a United Brethren preacher , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , who desired me to bring him some good books to read . Being anxious to bestow some kindness on this good old Methodist father , I left a book with him that I was taking home , having had it lent for some time . Had a season of prayer and then some conversation on the hope of the saints . <p> 14 . Found that my appointment which I had failed to reach had proved a blessing after all , for they had a good prayer meeting . Appointed another for the following Sabbath eve , which was a success also and resulted in the organization of a Sabbath-school , which is under the officership of those who hold with the church of God . Prospects are good here . A railroad station is expected close by . P.M. , drove to Fillmore County . How beautiful and pleasing , yea , charming , even to making happy , the day and the landscape ! <p> 17 . Brothers Figard and J. H. Anderson moved us today to Brother Fs . <p> 20 . Drove to Polk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and hungry for the gospel . <p> 23 . Wife and I drove to Indian Creek , Fillmore County , distance , thirty-four miles . <p> 26 . Wife and I went to Seward . Asked for the Presbyterian meetinghouse for Ministerial Association in case we are refused the Methodist Episcopal house . Found the latter wished to reserve some of the time hence accepted the Presbyterian house . Had programs printed . <p> 27 . Drove to Polk County and planted fruit trees . <p> 28 . Planted trees , potatoes , and garden seeds until after 4 P.M. At five minutes past five started for Wilson schoolhouse , about fifteen and one half miles . Reached in time . 1 Peter 1:13 . This is a new point , with good prospects . T is only a half mile from where it is said there will be a station on the Midland Pacific , which is now being extended to York Center . <p> May 2 , 1875 . Sabbath . Stormy . Went home with Brother Price , it being handy and the weather bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed off very pleasantly singing , and I lectured some on moral and mental culture . Examined some heads . <p> 4 . A.M. , wrote letters . P.M. , went to Seward . Completed arrangements for Ministerial Association . <p> 5 . Sarah and I drove over to the Blue . Had a pleasant time fishing . Caught a mess . <p> 8 . Visited Brother Mitchells . Left Wife there and drove over to visit Brother Lichty . He was one of our seekers when I closed the meeting last winter . I was anxious to see him ; but he being from home , I was disappointed . Found them quite poor . Large family of children . Live in dugout . Mrs. Lichty quite unwell , which added to the distressful appearance of things . Talked to the woman and children about Jesus and heaven . Read , prayed , and sang with them . Distributed fifty cents among the children . <p> 13 . Studied for Ministerial Association . <p> 14 . Ministerial Association began . Went early to town . Glad to meet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be with us . <p> 15 . I discoursed on the polity of the Church of God in lieu of Brother Howard . <p> 16 . Sabbath . This is Pentecost day . Thank God for the beautiful weather . All nature seems to be waking from its long winter slumber to praise God . The beautiful prairie is green with grain and pastures . The valleys are dotted with herds of cattle , which , as well as they on a thousand hills , are the Lords . The beautiful streams are lined with plum bushes all in bloom . The groves are preparing to cheer the heart of the prairie inhabitants with their pleasant shady foliage . <p> At eleven Brother Aller preached in the Methodist Episcopal house and I preached the Pentecostal sermon in the Presbyterian house . Acts 2:1-4 . At 3 P.M. Brother Aller preached a glorious and lovely sermon on the brotherhood of the saints . Deep and lasting impressions were made . How powerfully this dear brother preached for the unity of the saints of God , with the eloquence of tears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite late hour to meet at Crete second Tuesday in September . <p> 17 . Went to Brother Greens . While there Brother S came in . We were just ready to engage in prayer . The Lord wonderfully blessed me in prayer . I prayed fervently for him , though he has been acting the part of an open enemy to me and the cause I represent . Went to Seward . Received fifty dollars from the Board . Called on Brother J. W. Figard , who is applying himself vigorously to the pursuit of an education . Hope the Lord will raise him up for an effectual minister of the gospel . <p> 21 . Made out report to the General Eldership . <p> 23 . Sabbath . This was a glorious and happy days work in the vineyard of the Lord . The Master was very near me all day . Oh , what liberty in speaking ! what peace in my soul ! <p> 26 . Up at daylight . Brothers Figard and Anderson moved our things to homestead . We arrived about 1 P.M. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and staid all night in our house . <p> Here the record of Brother Warners labors in the Western field must end abruptly , as the succeeding portion was in a separate book that has not been found . We leave him with his little family just moved into their own house in Polk County , having spent the winter near Seward . Our next of the diary accounts begins in the following December and finds him back in Ohio fields , whither , probably by decision of the Board of Missions or Eldership he was called to labor again . The daily accounts which have been omitted for want of space show him always activetraveling , preaching , visiting , praying , etc . The selections that are given from his diary are chosen in order to display the various sides and aspects of his life and character . We have noticed his great zeal for the work of preaching the gospel and caring for those under his charge . The widely separated flocks meant much traveling and exposure in that new country.4 <p> 4 : <p> Dr. Forney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church in York County of thirty-one members , and further says of his work in Nebraska that " to such an extent were the ministers and churches encouraged that they conferred together on the advisability of organizing an Eldership in Nebraska . " Brother Warner notes in his diary account for November 7 , 1874 , that a Preliminary Eldership was organized at Crete , in Saline County . Application was made to the General Eldership , which assembled in Ohio in May 1875 , and an Eldership bf the Church of God in Nebraska was chartered . The first meeting of the Nebraska Eldership was held at Cropsey . October 1 , 1875 . Among the fifteen names enrolled Brother Warners does not appear , hence we conclude that by that time he had left Nebraska . <p> We note his attitude and teaching on the church question . In a large measure he had light on the true Bible church , and he supposed he was not a member of any sect when , as a matter of fact , he was . The benefits of his knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest of the so-called church of God , which he was ignorantly laboring to build up . It was not until he received the experience of perfect holiness and began to teach the truth on the subject that he was made to feel his limitations to human ecclesiasticism and thus discover the pen he was in.5 His teachings and applications of the Scriptural church ( there is but one ) was possible only among the followers of John Winebrenner or in some similar body supposing themselves to be that one true church . It is an interesting fact that upon the fullness of time for Gods people to throw off all human ecclesiastical bondage and sever themselves from spiritual Babylon , the lead was taken principally by those who had belonged to the Winebrennerian following . Thus this denominational body may be regarded as a sort of preparatory medium , or halfway step , for the reformation , which is now an established thing . At any rate God had in Brother Warner raised up a man particularly disposed to emphasize the church question , and the denomination mentioned seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more advanced light and truth forbade his remaining longer with them . <p> 5 : <p> That his disposition to be freely led of God made him poor material for a human ecclesiastical machine is evinced in the account by Dr. Forney of the Eighteenth West Ohio Eldership , for the year ending September 30 , 1874 . He says : " The beginning of trouble between D. S. Warner and the Eldership is foreshadowed in an action on the adoption of his report , which stated that he had organized a church in Upper Sandusky contrary to the Rules of Cooperation and regarding this as a schismatic movement , highly disapproved of his course in organizing said church . " <h> Back in Ohio Fields <p> In his resumption of the work in Ohio we find Brother Warner in charge , it seems , of the Ashland circuit , with his home at Hayesville , Ashland County . Here , as was characteristic of him everywhere , he was wholly absorbed in spiritual labor , the salvation of sinners and the general spiritual welfare of people everywhere within his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says : <p> Went out visiting and talking to the people . My soul was so happy all day that I could hardly refrain from shouting . Oh , how sweet it was to talk to sinners about Jesus and his love ! Found in shops and houses a number of precious souls that were serious . I admonished them to repent . Some gave much hope of a start . <p> The closing moments of the year 1875 were devoted to a renewal of consecration of himself and others . <p> A few minutes before twelve we all bowed down and to the service of God consecrated ourselves and vowed fidelity . God accepted the offering and sealed our vows to him by the gift of his Spirit . After affectionate New Year greetings and congratulations , we went to our homes to rest . <p> Into his congregation at Shenandoah an Elder L had come and was poisoning the minds of the converts by teaching the Campbellite doctrine of baptism as an essential condition to the pardon of sin . He afterward held a public discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the principal debaters of the Church of God . Dr. Forney mentions his debates as follows : In August 1871 with the Reverend Mr. Baker , of the Disciple Church , the proposition being , " The Church of God of which I am a member is the only church of divine origin . " In June 1872 with Leonard Parker , Methodist Episcopal Church , on the old subject of baptism . On May 15 , 1874 , near Orton , Nebraska , he defended the perpetuity and public observance of feet washing as an ordinance against E. Evans , of the Disciple Church . At the Osborne Schoolhouse , near Seward , Nebraska , with C. L. Boyd , Adventist . The proposition discussed was , " The first day of the week has been set apart by divine authority as Sabbath or Lords day . " The discussion was the outcome of a series of addresses by Boyd on the seventh day Sabbath . So well did Warner defend the proposition , says Forney , that at the close of the debate the congregation present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The debate continued three evenings . <p> February 19 , 1876 . Drove to Shenandoah . Found Elder L having a good time deluding and baptizing sinners . Found the converts greatly strengthened by the wind of doctrine that had been assailing them . However , a few had been corrupted by the false doctrine and were inclined to go from the Church of God , being carried by the wind of doctrine . With a mean , sneaking look they applied for letters . I told them that I had not taken them into the Church of God and could not dismiss them from it , and there was only one way to get out and that was through sin . This they could not deny , nor could they give a reason for their course . <p> About this time he gradually came into the knowledge of the truth respecting divine healing , and we find in his accounts an occasional reference to his praying for the sick and of their recovery . <p> He was sent for by his father-in-law to come to Upper Sandusky , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , 1876 . The sectarians are making a stampede this morning . They have been after about every convert to go to their church and now this morning they have their conclave outside and every convert is stopped and asked to join the Methodists . An excitement is raised and the peoples minds are bewildered , and some who had said they would stick to the Church of God are now standing back . Before closing , an old bigot , belonging to the Methodists , took the liberty to get up and call for all to raise their hands who wanted to go to Methodism . Some responded . O Sectarianism ! thou abomination of the earth , thou bane of the cause of God , when will thy corrupt and wicked walls fall to earth and cease to curse men to hell ? <p> June 4 , 1876 . This is the second anniversary of our marriage . Thank God for connubial and domestic happiness . May God continue to bless us with love , peace , and sacred union . <p> July 18 , 1876 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear mother . She died July 13 . The days of her pilgrimage were seventy-one years , five months , and seven days . Hers was a life of trouble and care . But , thank God , she has gone to her sweet rest in heaven . Oh , how sacred the memory of thy pure and virtuous life ! " Patient in tribulation , " * ( Romans 12:12 ) constant and untiring in thy kindness and care for all under thy roof . Oh , what love like a mothers ! What mother like my own dear , sainted mother ? In all the ordeal of life thy calm and peaceful spirit has never known a ruffle . Thy love has never once failed . Thy sorely tried patience never was exhausted . <p> Dearest mother , in childhood and youth thou wast my all . And when maturer years had launched my bark in the midst of awful breakers , dark clouds , and tempestuous seas of corrupt society , thy pure life was my only star of hope . Thank God , thou shalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wayward son by thy holy influence . Praise the Lord for a good and holy mother ! <p> She was always strongly inclined to piety , the fear and reverence of God . In October 1870 , she was fellowshipped by the Church of God at South Bridgewater and the same day immersed by me in the St. Joseph River . Though she was feeble and the weather cold and the distance over three miles from home , she chose to go home before changing clothes . She was a happy soul , and the next day seemed quite improved in health . Now she is gone . One of the dearest ties that bound me to earth now attracts me to heaven . I can not lament her departure . I only grieve that I was not informed of her affliction that I could have been there to cheer her while approaching the river . Or , had I only been apprised of her death that I could have seen once more the face of my own dear mother before she was laid in the tomb ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more and the Son of God shall come to call the saints from the dust of the earth . Farewell , dear mother . We soon shall meet again . <p> July 29 , 1876 . We visited the penitentiary in Columbus . Over 1,300 prisoners . All at work manufacturing nearly everything in use . The extensive work was interesting , but the study of the heads and faces of the workmen was much more so . One striking characteristic was , almost invariably , great firmness . This being perverted enabled them to execute their dark crimes . Conscientiousness was low in every head . This left them without moral restraint . Some I observed were very deficient in the social group , especially was inhabitiveness almost entirely deficient . This gave a rambling disposition , hence irresponsible and exposed to bad society . A large majority exhibited a very good intellect , many even above mediocrity . These intellectual powers , which had they been sanctified to God would have been very useful , being perverted were used only to devise crime . <p> October 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much overcome with emotion as I tried to speak of my meeting with the Eldership for the first time in that house nine years ago . Never shall I forget the solemn feelings I experienced at that time . I had not expected a license ; but how I trembled with fear and dread when I learned that a license and a field of labor were given me ! I thought it all a mistake of the Eldership . I repaired to the stable of Brother F , where I poured out my heart to God in prayer . Bless God , he heard me and comforted my agonizing heart . I then received the assurance that he was directing my way . My soul was unburdened and my peace flowed like a river . And now my laboring soul and inmost heart would give thanks to God who has upheld me in the arduous labors of the past nine years . Having begun an invalid , supposed by many to be a consumptive , my strength has gradually increased through Gods blessings and mercies . <p> 30 . Gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the woods . <p> November 30 , 1876 . This is Thanksgiving Day . Oh , that the whole nation would indeed thank God for his goodness and mercy ! Brother Oliver and I each made a short discourse on the occasion . P.M. , read O. S. Fowlers Physiology , Animal and Mental . O God , forgive me of the sin this book has convicted me of . By the grace of God , from this day forth I will reform in quantity , etc. , of food as much as my irregular mode of life will allow . How much I can improve the vigor of the mind and the fervor of devotion ! Thank God for this volume ! Oh , that every one had it who is suffering for want of its instruction ! <p> December 31 , 1876 . Sabbath . Arose early to go to my appointments . Levilla ill . Mother Keller very sick with headache , unable to be up . Was compelled to stay at home . Oh , what distress of mind I was in this day through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause ! How wretched I felt all day ! The day was pleasant and I know there were crowded houses to hear the gospel . How I longed to preach to them ! <p> January 1 , 1877 . Went to visit Mr. S , who is suffering awful distress . Was met by a young man who was coming after us . We went with the hope that the poor , dying man was eager to hear of Christ and his salvation ; but , oh , horror of horrors ! When we approached the house we heard the poor soul hollowing out in wild strains : " I cant die ; I cant die . " I asked him if we should pray for him . He hollowed out " No ! " But I thought he was delirious and concluded to sing and pray with him , which I did with all my heart . After prayer I talked with the family and learned that he had said he was a lost sinner , that he could not be saved . I asked him if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him of how Christ died for sinners and how he loved and desired to save him ; but there was a hideous look in his eyes . He looked frightful , yet he was conscious , answered every question we could ask him . I called for oil and said I would do as the New Testament directed . So I bowed down , anointed his forehead , and was about to anoint his breast when he seized his shirt and drew it together . I laid one hand on his head , the other on his body , and began to pray . He drew his head forward and tried to get it under the cover . He shoved my hand from under his head . I could pray but little . He told every one present that he did not want us to come back . He said he would die ; was not prepared to die ; did not believe that Christ died for him ; did not love Christ and did not want to . He showed every appearance of being possessed by the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at us with fiendish vengeance . When we approached he would turn his face to the wall . Poor soul ! Soon he will be in eternity , I presume , and yet raging mad against Christ and his people . I shall never forget the horrors of this day . When we entered the first room we met several women weeping . The old mother fainted away . He was crying loudly in the other room . <p> In 1877 , while on the Ashland circuit Brother Warner arranged , in connection with ministerial duties , to take some selective studies at Vermillion College , located at Hayesville . This was a Presbyterian school of some note at the time , enrolling three hundred to four hundred students . It was founded in 1845 . Dr. Sanders Diefendorf became its head in 1849 . Brother Warner and his wife were invited to occupy rooms in the building , and they did so , as they found they could live much cheaper there than in Mansfield and would enjoy better privileges of study . They engaged five rooms for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month . Among Brother Warners studies at this place were English Analysis , Greek , German , and studies in the New Testament . He took an active part in the literary society . <p> The year 1877 was a notable one in Brother Warners life . Already accomplished as he was in deep spirituality and devotion , it would seem that these graces were multiplied or intensified tenfold by an attainment that from this year became his permanent possession . That attainment was the experience of entire sanctification as received definitely by faith and subsequent to regeneration . He embraced the cause of holiness . <p> He had been for some years honestly prejudiced against the doctrine ; but he heard some truth by the holiness advocates that set him to thinking . It was doubtless largely through the influence of his father-in-laws family that he began to be won to the doctrine . They had become friends of the holiness cause and had received the experience . His wife also was sanctified , and the change in her was a test that he had no words to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandusky , where his wifes people lived . <p> The one minister who perhaps more than any other led him into the experience of holiness , was C. R. Dunbar , a Baptist who was laboring in connection with the Holiness Alliance . Brother Warner says of him , " He is a very able man intellectually , but still more potent in faith and gospel , Holy Ghost power . " He was the musical author of the song , now so common : <p> " I 'll live for him who died for me , How happy then my life shall be ! Ill live for him who died for me , My Savior and my God . " * <p> The great holiness movement was sweeping over the country at this time . Brother Warner was too loyal to God and to the teaching of the Bible ever to be classed among those who should reject holiness when brought face to face with the issue . He and his wife gave their names to the holiness band at Upper Sandusky , and he quoted the words of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fear thee , and of them that keep thy precepts. " * ( Psalm 119:63 ) At this time his impulsiveness led him to claim the blessing at once , but he soon found that it could not be picked up so readily ; that for him , as well as for others , there was a consecration to make and self to be crucified . <p> A little anecdote in this connection is told by a brother who heard Brother Warner relate it of himself . He ( Brother Warner ) had been attending some meetings of the holiness people and had received some light . On returning to his charge he preached a sermon on holiness without having obtained the experience . Two sisters who had received the experience knew that he did not yet have it and urged that he get it before attempting to preach it . At the altar service that followed he got down as if to pray for others , but first prayed privately for his own sanctification . Then audibly he began , " Lord , sanctify us , " whereupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not pray , Lord , sanctify us ; but say , Lord , sanctify me. " At this he wilted and came right out with " Lord , sanctify me . " <p> We shall quote freely from his diary , as his experience at this time is best expressed by his own words . <p> April 13 , 1877 . Had much talk with Brother Dunbar on sanctification . I have always believed in a full salvation , and agree that it is usually obtained after the justified state . This was my experience as well as that of all advocates of holiness ; but I was inclined to attribute the deficiency of the justified state to infantile weakness , which through outward sinful influence , was not able to carry out the pure nature fully in practice . But he and all sanctificationists attribute it to the remaining depravity of nature . <p> 16 . Since I arose this morning my constant prayer to God has been that he will lead me in all things . I pray God to take me like an old sack and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fullness of himself . O God ! turn out every nook and corner of my heart and purge me , soul , body , spirit , and mind . I received a blessing about the time I entered the ministry that seemed to correspond with the experience of sanctified ones ; but I have not always kept that state of perfect love , and my God knows that I need a fresh blessing of sanctification power Though I experienced sanctification ten years ago , when entering upon the work of the ministry , yet I want and need a renewal of Gods power , that my testimony for God may be more effectual . Also , I know that I have not always lived in this glorious liberty . I have this day examined my heart carefully and feel assured that I accept the whole will of God and now stand by faith upon the promise of God . I leave myself and all my concerns in his hands . By faith I say , " I am the Lords , and he is mine . " <p> Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How appropriate this was to his life at this point !

I was , as oft before , convinced that I ate too much , which stupefied my mind ; hence resolved , as oft before , to quit gormandizing to gratify appetite . I resolved in Gods name and in his strength to do this thing . I ate but a few spoonfuls of graham mush for supper . Felt cheered by Gods presence in evening worship . <p> 26 . My mind was active today . Lessons were easily learned , spirits cheerful , recitations more successful . O Lord , keep me in the possession of a clear , active , and retentive mind , a pure heart , and a consecrated life , devoted to Gods service . <p> May 19 , 1877 . Had a very interesting meeting in the Excelsior Society . M. J. Boyd and I conducted the main discussion on the following question : Do We Suffer More from Real Than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beautiful day . Arose early and , taking a testament with me , I took a long walk , enjoying the precious pure air , the beauties of nature , and communion with God through his Word and Spirit . Read and meditated upon several chapters . Precious season in family worship . Just when we were through with breakfast the boy raised the cry that the house was on fire . We ran to the bedroom and found the curtains and clothing around the wall in a blaze . Great excitement prevailed . But soon by means of a few pails of water and by throwing some of the burning fabrics out , the fire was extinguished with the loss only of some clothing . The fire was started by a small child , who finding a match on the candlestick , struck it and then dropped it on the end of the curtain that reached to the floor . <p> June 1 , 1877 .

There being few present , all other exercises were dispensed with but a general discussion on the subject , Is Force More Effectual in Government than Persuasion . I took the negative . Mr. W.

Spoke on the negative . Large majority in our favor on the final vote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Bethel . After a profitable season of prayer , reading the Word , testifying , etc. , I presented myself at the altar to seek entire sanctification . I enjoyed that blessing ten years ago , but I had all this time repudiated the second work and accounted for the wonderful change that God had wrought in me at that time to my yielding to the call to preach the blessed gospel of Jesus , after being disobedient . I had often been disgusted , too , with the fanaticism I saw mixed with the professors of the second work ; it had steeped me with prejudice through and through . <p> Though I could not deny that the experience of these people was in perfect harmony with my own , yet I strongly opposed their views , claiming that God does not do his work by piecemeal , but that he makes a full and complete finish of it at once . I attributed the second experience to the fact that after conversion we are weak infants and not able to carry into action the pure nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of strength that we can successfully cope with outer temptation , and that holy nature given to us in regeneration reaches a degree of development in strength that it will no more be under subjection to sin in the world around us . <p> Thus , while I did not doubt the truthfulness of their testimony , I thought I comprehended the whole matter and saw the slight mistake , as I supposed , in the basis of their experience . <p> But God having let Father and Mother Keller and the whole family into this glorious experience , with my dear companion , I began to search the Scriptures anew to see if I might not be mistaken myself . I carefully reviewed my conversion and recollected that I sought and asked of God only pardon of my past sins and relief from my past guilt . That in ten years labor , in which some seven hundred souls came to Christ , I never knew one to seek for anything else but pardon for actual transgression and it is a fact that we do not ask of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and God does not give until we ask of a thing . <p> Moreover , it is claimed that justification is not a partial but complete work of itself , and sanctification , i.e. , purification , another . Since seeing every day the change in my dear wife I thought I was beyond doubt of this second work . But , ah , the devil is rallying his forces against me . Am I making a fool of myself coming out here where I have invited and labored with sinners ? My old arguments would come up and I had powerful temptations to settle back upon them and forever repudiate the second work . I obtained no light . <p> P.M. We met at half-past two and held meeting till nearly five . I labored at the altar . At night after Brother Burlison read a Scripture lesson and talked for some time on holiness , we all bowed around the altar ; but I could do nothing , all was dark . I came here fully believing in a second work of God in the soul : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how thick the temptations of Satan come up before me ! How all my old arguments and objections gather like rubbish , obstructing the light ! Sometimes I was about to conclude that this was all foolishness . I was ashamed to bow at the altar and seek sanctification of " soul , body , and spirit " after I had invited sinners to and labored with them at the same altar . <p> 6 . Arose early this morning and searched the Scriptures and asked God for light . I noticed whenever I felt resigned to God and was willing to make any sacrifice to know the truth I was strongly impressed to seek sanctification . <p> This morn I was directed to 1 Peter 5:10 and Ephesians 3:14-20 . Light is becoming brighter in the Word . Thank God . Met at half-past nine . The foundation of faith was now becoming strong in me . I arose and read some portions of the Word and boldly declared my faith in the second work , and that I was resting in the promises of God to my entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent most of the interval in searching my heart , and truly I found that it has not been as good as I before supposed . Oh , how much self there has been in all my past labors ! God of power , kill and cast out all of self . I reviewed my observations of the past ten years labor . About seven hundred souls I have observed seeking salvation , and I can not recall any who did not definitely seek for justification from past sins . It appears that the condemned sinner can think of nothing else and does not possess a capacity to grasp the idea that God is able to destroy all evil in depraved humanity . " God , forgive my past sins and help me in the future to keep from sin , " is about as great a blessing as the mind beclouded by guilt can conceive and ask for . With a still more deep and fervent consecration I again sought the blessing of perfect holiness . Glory to God , I was able to claim the blessing by faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting I spent most of the time talking holiness to several brethren , which I felt was pleasing to God . <p> Eve , Brother Burlison read 1 Corinthians 3 , and talked a little ; then , an invitation being given , a good many surrounded the altar , several of whom were seeking the blessing . Thank God , some professed to receive the blessing . I am still standing , yea , resting sweetly in the promise of God for entire and constant salvation through the blood of Jesus . <p> 7 . Today we fasted all day . Met in the Bethel at 9 A.M. and held meeting until after 4 P.M. without intermission . This day I was the least conscious of a physical nature and my relations with a corporeal world of any day in all my life . I seemed to be entirely unconscious of passing time . Only the spirit seemed to live , stir , feel , and take cognizance . Glory to the God of wonders ! Is this really but the footstool of God ? <p> Mother Keller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She ( Mrs. L. ) very soon began to pour out her bitter railing against holiness and holy ones ; but praise God , he kept our souls in perfect peace . After my communing with God in secret for some time , the Lord told me to go immediately to see a poor sick girl near by . Mother accompanied me . Found her barely able to sit up , having been suffering for nearly one year . She had exhausted in vain all available medical aid . We spoke of the Great Physician . She said she believed that he was able to heal her . We called for oil , anointed her in the name of the Lord and laid hands on , and prayed for her present restoration to health . We entreated God with all the faith and earnestness of our inmost soul and then left her in the hands of God , with a comfortable degree of faith that God would raise her up again . <p> Eve , met at a quarter to eight . Mighty power filled the house . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several were seeking sanctification . Glory to God , this night he began to give me some of the evidences ( besides my hitherto naked faith ) that I had got out of the wilderness into Canaan . Jesus , my blessed Savior , just cut me off one bunch of the sweet grapes of this " land . " Oh , glory to God , once more I was a little child ! I felt the blood of Jesus flowing through my entire " soul , body , and spirit . " Heaven on earth ! Hallelujah , it is done ! <p> 8 . Sabbath . At five this morning a goodly number met in the Bethel for prayers . The Spirit was with us . Returned to Brother Bells ; ate a piece for breakfast , as we all felt that bodily wants were simple and few while the soul was so dearly fed with the bread of heaven . Met at half-past nine , and after many clear testimonies were given in for Jesus Brother Dunbar preached the word of life with great power and sweetness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto uncleanness , but unto holiness . " * ( 1 Thessalonians 4:7 ) He read much of the First Epistle to the Thessalonians , where this glorious second work is brought out so clear and forcibly . My soul was never before so wonderfully fed by the gospel in any sermon I ever heard . Oh , how sweet and glorious the word of life came to my renovated heart ! <p> Mother , Sarah , and I went to Brother Furmans for dinner . Returned to the two oclock meeting . Among many clear witnesses I testified today to the blood that cleanses from all sin and also uncleanness of nature . The long altar was again crowded and several found sanctification in the blood . Some backsliders were restored . God is wonderfully at work . All glory to his name ! <p> At six we met again in the Bethel , after spending a long time in the closet with God . The Spirit impressed me to talk to the people on the commands of Jesus , and in simplicity I did so , using John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord concerning the duty of washing the saints feet . Then we proceeded to obey the Lord . God wonderfully blessed me in talking , but my soul leaped for joy as I saw the dear sanctified ones come promptly to the bench and joyfully obey Him whom they love . God wonderfully blessed them , as they all testified the next day . Many of them had never seen the holy ordinance of feet washing observed before . The Church of God brethren had said that if these holiness people would obey these lowly commands then they would have confidence in them . Thank God , true holiness needs but to be tested to be proved genuine . <p> 10 . This morn had to miss prayer meeting in order to take Mother Keller and our dear Levilla to the train , as they go to Upper Sandusky this morn . We will go by buggy at the close of meeting . Sister Bell and Sarah went to the country today to get berries . I wrote and prayed most of the forenoon . Then , feeling very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sought God earnestly in secret and then started out to work for him . Visited and prayed with two families , but still felt destitute of the Comforter . Met at 2:30 P.M. at the house of God . Several observed that I was being much tried . But I was eager to defeat the enemy of my soul by testifying to the sanctifying power of the blood of Jesus . I did so , declaring that the blood of Jesus had washed from all sin . While I was talking , the Lord showed me that I had now entered upon the path of perfect trust in Jesus , and that as faith was eternal and unchangeable , I had forever abandoned the up-and-down road of feeling . I also ( in an absent-minded manner ) made the remark that I had been cheated out of the morning prayer meeting . But quick as thought I saw that it was wrong , for it was either complaining of or speaking lightly of Gods providence . This remark furnished a subject of meditation through the afternoon . I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt that the above remark and all similar ones , so common and admissible in my past state , were not only wrong , but could not be true , as I have given myself , all I have , to God , surrendered all my ways , time , talents , means , influence , name , reputation , and everything with which I am connectedwife , child , friends , my destinyall into the hands of God . I glorify in the blessed truth that no being in the whole universe can cheat me out of anything or do me the least harm . Glory to God forever ! How happy I am in accepting all the will and providence of God ! From the time of my testimony I realized the glorious river of life flowing through my entire being . What a sweet sense of perfect purity filled my mind and heart ! Holiness was written everywhere . My very body seemed sacred and pure , a temple for the holy God . Glory to the cleansing power of the blood of Jesus ! <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventies , and eighties of the last century witnessed a special revival of the doctrine of holiness , or sanctification . Sanctification was held as being a work of Gods grace wrought in the heart subsequent to pardon , and accomplishing for the individual , through consecration and faith in Christ , ( 1 ) restoration of the soul from innate depravity and uncleanness , the destruction of that carnal element which antagonizes the godly purpose of the soul , and ( 2 ) the infilling and indwelling of the Holy Spirit . In short , it was the doctrine of Christian perfection , the state of loving God supremely and of living victorious over every form of sin . <p> This doctrine was nothing more nor less than one of the great Scriptural truths that had been obscured by the apostasy . It had been taught by the Wesleys , but through the denomination-building zeal of their followers it had become to a great extent a dead letter in their articles of faith . The bright spiritual lights of the world throughout the gospel dispensation were generally individual men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctification ; but now the time came , in the unfolding of Gods plan , for holiness to be given specific attention on a scale amounting to a general awakening in religious circles . The various Protestant sects had about reached the heyday of their deplorable rivalry , and it was but natural that the unifying influence of holiness , appearing in striking contrast to such rivalry , should appeal to all true Christians . The movement did indeed , as a rule , enlist the most spiritual members of the so-called churches . <p> This holiness awakening was a movement that should introduce a prophetic day . It was of God . It was not planned by human agency . Individuals here and there of the more earnest and spiritual class of Christians were led into the deeper experience altogether independent of each other . For some reason they felt impelled to give special emphasis to the doctrine of holiness . These tiny flames were by some unseen hand fanned into a great conflagration destined to sweep the country . <p> A few paragraphs from M. L. Haneys The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . <p> A number of Christian farmers feel strangely moved to aid in the salvation of the perishing , and they plan a laymens camp meeting , in which the fires of holiness break out . This leads to the organization of a Laymens Holiness Association , and results in bringing many hundreds to the joys of pardoned sin and the experience of holiness . Three or four ministers are mutually impressed with the necessity of holding a holiness camp meeting . The seal of Gods approval of the service is so manifest that they are compelled to go farther . An association is formed for the purpose of holding a number of camp meetings for the promotion of holiness . The work enlarges till many earnest inquirers look to them for specific instruction on the subject of holiness . To meet this demand , and remain true to God , they are compelled to furnish these thirsting thousands with specific holiness literature . Thus the unexpected springing up of a monthly magazine , with books and tracts , all teaching the way of Christs cleansing blood . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He preaches , and prays , and testifies , and sings , and shouts , as here and there a soul is blood-washed through his ministry . He mourns the downward tendency , as the sympathy of his brethren seems ofttimes withdrawn ; but at last God brings one of them to stand by his side . Another , and yet another is added , till God has bound three or four souls in bonds of perfect love . The obligation to disseminate the gospel of holiness among the people of God in all the churches leads them , after much prayer on the subject , to publish a paper which shall be the medium of instruction on the special doctrine of holiness . Without a dollar , or a subscription list , with nothing at the base but unshrinking faith in the God who leads , they launch a weekly paper . But God touches the heart of a wealthy layman , and gives him no peace till he pledges three thousand dollars for the support of that paper . <p> " God moves in a mysterious way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to break the chains of slavery he revealed to no man the time or methods of its accomplishment . In like manner , in the holiness movement , his faithful servants have gone " out , not knowing whither they went . " * ( Hebrews 11:8 ) The way has been so rugged at times that many have turned aside ; but God has put two in the place of each faltering one , and the ranks of the holiness army are steadily increasing . <p> We call attention to the remarkable fact that the holiness work has sprung up simultaneously in different parts of the earth ; in the east , in the west , in the north , and the south ; in the old world , and in the new ; among Arminians , and among Calvinists ; in cities , in towns , and in country places ; indicating an unseen hand and guiding power . <p> A mechanic , in Pennsylvania , receives a call from the chaplain of King Williams court to come to Germany and teach the church of Martin Luther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit at the feet of a Presbyterian layman to learn of holiness in the city of Berlin . A young minister , whom God hath baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire , completely girds the earth with holy song , as he travels to regain his failing health . <p> One of Wesleys mightiest sons is sent to the other side of the globe to receive this blessed experience , under the instruction of a Presbyterian minister . Suddenly an organized army springs up in Europe to spread holiness , and the power of Satan is broken by its advancing legions . <p> A number of holy men and women are compelled by their convictions to make the circuit of the earth , and are invited to preach , and sing , and testify to holiness in the shadow of the Vatican . Reader , who do you think has planned , and whose hand is guiding , this movement ? <p> Milton L. Haney ; The Inheritance Restored <p> The truth is , the holiness movement was a movement prophetically due at this time as the introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , in which Gods people are not only embracing holiness , but are taking their stand free and complete in Christ , distinct from all humanly organized bodies called churches . The reader of church history will observe that the progress of Christianity has not been by gradual , steady increase of light and truth , but by reformation after reformation in which some special truth is emphasized and mens hearts are stirred . <p> Among the early leaders of the movement in this country* were Dr. W. C. and Phoebe Palmer , of New York . Mrs. Palmer , especially , was prominent in this respect . She wrote a number of books on holiness and with her husband held meetings in various openings in the East and was otherwise very active in the cause . William Macdonald , John S. Inskip , Daniel Steele , and J. A. Wood were others who , both by preaching and the press , gave prominence to the doctrine of entire sanctification as a second , distinct work of grace . Holiness societies sprung up , books were written on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to canvass the country . Well does the writer remember of seeing when a boy these holiness bands travel about the country in covered wagons . They carried a spiritual fire that caught in the hearts of the more fervent ones who , on the barren plains of sect religion , were seeking for a higher and better Christian experience . The activity on this line was not on the part of the various denominations , as such , but on the part of earnest Christians within the denominations . <p> Holiness , it must be remembered , is Scriptural , a part of Gods will to His children , and the movement must not be regarded as being something new , but as a revival of truth intended for man . Since the attainment of this distinct higher experience requires a perfect consecration , an entire abandonment , to God , it was but natural that the doctrine should be opposed by the pleasure-loving church members , those who were Christians only in name and did not care for any advancement or improvement of their spiritual status . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The holiness advocates were at once opposed and often persecuted ; but silently and surely , as leaven works in the meal , the holiness agitation increased and spread throughout the country . It was a very unwelcome and disturbing element among the cold professors . They said that sinlessness was not to be attained in this life ; that we could not be sanctified till death ; etc . But when shown by the Scriptures that it is indeed Gods will for Christians in this life , they would declare that it is attained by growth , or perhaps would say they had received it in conversion . They were opposed to having any further spiritual obligation placed upon them . <p> But it was not alone the advocacy of an advanced Christian attainment that might well make the holiness movement distasteful to sect devotees . Holiness is unifying . It makes Christians one , in accordance may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hast sent me. " * ( John 17:21 ) True holiness is destructive of divisional elements . That is why the advocates of holiness in the different denominations lost to a great extent their sectarian bigotry and could join together in holiness associations independent of their denominations . As a general thing the holiness editors and teachers spoke against sectarian divisions . <p> This brings us to the critical point . Would those espousing holiness dissolve their sect relations ? Here is where many in the holiness movement compromised and would not follow in the onward march of truth out of all denominational confusion and into complete oneness in Christ . Instead , holiness associations urged and even required their members to maintain also a sect membership . They seemed to believe sects were a necessary evil and they opposed the idea of coming out of sects . This is as far as the majority in the holiness movement would go . They deplored sects , but seemed to think that to be outside of all sects would be to have no church relation at all . Had they walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ and been led out of sectarian entanglements ; but failing to follow the true leading of God , they receded , and their holiness degenerated into what was mere sect holiness . To this day they have their holiness associations and their conventions , but fellowshipping as they do the sects and factions of almost every description , they are left to grope in their own darkness and confusion , still making an effort but accomplishing nothing toward Christian unity . <p> Their confusion on the church question is illustrated by the following quotation from the salutary address adopted by the General Holiness Assembly held in Chicago in May 1901 : <p> In respect to the matter of church fellowship we observe that the church is the institution of Christ , having many members in one body , Himself being the living Head . He has redeemed it with His blood , and engraven it upon the palms of His hands . Membership therein is a precious privilege , and always to be highly esteemed . Wherever practical , every saved man and woman should be connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their reference to the true Christian church as the one body of saved people everywhere , redeemed by Christs blood . But when in the next breath they urge that " every saved man and woman should be connected with some church , " as if such were not already in the church through redemption by Christs blood , they are talking about something else , not the body of Christ . They perhaps do not realize their own blindness ; but to the one who spiritually discerns the true church and its sufficiency for all the people of God , their confusion is very apparent . <p> The writer had an interview not long since with one of the holiness leaders who used to know D. S. Warner , and who still labors to bring about the unity of Christians through a holiness that respects sectarian divisions . This man was asked about the prospects for unity after so many years of effort . His reply , in which he complained of the bigotry existing among the denominations , was anything but encouraging . He seemed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regarded the present true church movement as only a sect , or faction , saying that " a sect is any body of Christians joined together in the same belief , " etc . <p> " But suppose a number of persons come out from and leave the sects with which they have been connected , and stand only on the Bible , independent of sectssuppose they assemble together in a body ; would they be a sect ? " he was asked . <p> " Yes , " was his reply . <p> " Then what about the body of Christ itself , the whole , of which sects are regarded as cut-off factionsis that a sect ? " <p> " Yes , " was his answer . And then , as if he could know nothing but sects , he referred to Paul as calling the Christians in his day a sect , and assumed to quote him thus : " For as concerning this sect , we know that every where it is spoken against . " * ( Acts 28:22 ) <p> He was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his opposers . <p> " Well , " said he , " I will look that up . " <p> Thus his conception of the subject makes the true church impossible . When men have been forty years in the ministry and in the holiness movement , and are just as far from discerning the church as when they started , and even suppose that Paul called the Christians a sect , how blinding and confusing must be the darkness in which they grope ! Having failed to follow in Gods way when came the call , " Come out of her , my people , " * ( Revelation 18:4 ) they have been building with wood , hay , and stubble a structure that only awaits the consumption at the last day . <p> But not so all who were engaged in the holiness movement . God had a remnant whom He was leading entirely out of spiritual Babylon , who were returning to Zion over the highway of holiness , with singing and everlasting joy in their hearts . Holiness led them to the threshold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but passed over . Keeping in the light they retained true holiness and all that God had given them . Thus , coming out of the holiness movement and embodying its true elements , is a movement that not only upholds holiness , but repudiates sectarianism and represents the true Christian unity that Christ prayed for . It holds and knows Christ as the only head of the body , and as complete , in all things , to the church . <p> It was through the workers in the holiness movement that Brother D. S. Warner was made to face squarely the issue of holiness . His rejection of holiness in his earlier ministry may have been because of its poor representation on the part of professors ; or , in other words , because his introduction to it was not such as would cause him to think seriously of its claims . When he comprehended that it was the line on which God was particularly working , he was not slow in being led into the light and experience and becoming an ardent advocate of the doctrine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which he belonged , and finally being expelled from the West 0hio Eldership , his associations were to a great extent with the holiness bands and Societies . Among these he stood prominent . <p> Of the holiness editors who were contemporary with Brother Warner were John P. Brooks , of the Banner of Holiness , Bloomington , Illinois ; George Hughes , of the Guide to Holiness , New York ; Isaiah Reid , of the Highway , Nevada , Iowa ; and T. K. Doty , of the Christian Harvester , Cleveland . There were also a number of others . Brother Warner himself came to be an editor and to have an acquaintance with nearly all the editors and prominent workers of his day . <p> As a delegate from Rome City , Indiana , he attended the Western Union Holiness Convention held at Jacksonville , Illinois , December 5-19 , 1880 . George D. Watson , who was a prominent holiness leader and author , was president of the convention . Brother Warner was appointed to the committee on program , serving with four others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject " The Kind of Power Needed to Carry the Holiness Work . " <p> At the close of the convention he was placed on a committee of seven to confer and decide relative to the calling of a future convention of holiness workers in the West , with authority to issue a call for such a meeting , if they deemed it necessary . Thus he stood prominent in the holiness movement . <h> A Preacher of Holiness <p> The attainment of the experience of perfect holiness led Brother Warner into a new and enlarged field of ministerial activity . Since the time had come for a reformation along the line of holiness , when it was the divine plan that the subject be made prominent , we should expect Brother Warner , as one of Gods ministers , to make sanctification his principal theme and at once to begin preaching it . He began writing articles on sanctification for The Church Advocate , the denominational organ . Also he began writing with a view of publishing a tract or booklet on the subject of sanctification . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new issue to defend . New lines were drawn in his ministerial relations , as there was opposition from many along a line that had not existed before.7 <p> 7 : <p> His profession of holiness soon brought him to conflict with the leaders in the church . Speaking of the period of 1875-1880 , Dr. Forney says in his History of the Churches of God : " During several of these years the Eldership was contending against inroads of heresies advocated by D. S. Warner . It had finally to resort to the old remedy of excision in order to prevent the spread of the disease and restore the body to good health . " <p> As his diary covers the events of his life at this point we will let him again speak for himself . The reader will remember , of course , that these are but selections , as he wrote something for every day , and the accounts are too full to quote in their entirety . He was at this time on the Ashland circuit , with his home in the Vermillion College building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of study at the College , but as he beheld the need of the evangelistic field in greater proportion than ever , he felt it his duty thereafter to give less attention to study and more to his ministerial calling . <p> July 14 , 1877 . Wrote , meditated , and prayed most all day with only the Lord present . Commenced article for the Advocate on sanctification . <p> 15 . Quite sick this morn . As the holiness meeting near Upper Sandusky was interrupted by an appointment by a Dunker preacher this A.M. , we all went to Rock Run to hear Brother Smith , but he absolutely required of me that I preach for him . I was very weak ; but thinking it was of the Lord I committed all to God and expected his aid . Text : " They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain , saith the LORD . " * ( Isaiah 65:25 ) The Lord helped me to show the dear people some of the Scripture and reasons for the second work of grace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy mountain , love , union , and peace prevailed without alloy . May God bless the truth . There was great attention . Some questions were asked at the close of discourse , all pleasantly , however . Oh , that God would lead the dear people on to perfection ! <p> 20 . The Ohio State Holiness Convention met last night in Marion on the fair ground . Will continue several days . I should be happy to attend , but the Spirit seems to direct us to return and lift up the banner of holiness on our field of labor . Hence we started this morn for home , the weather pleasant . Having brought feed and dinner we stopped under a shade tree and ate our dinner and enjoyed a pleasant rest and communion with God . <p> 25 . At Hayesville School begins today . Busy at domestic duties . <p> 26 . Wrote , read , and communed with the Lord . <p> 27 . Still writing on sanctification . The Lord is giving me much light . Praise his name ! Met with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 28 . Finished my second article on sanctification . <p> 29 . Sabbath . Arose as soon as daylight . Spent some time with the Lord . Started about seven for Mansfield . Met a few hungry souls . The Lord wonderfully baptized my soul from the time I entered his house . Glory ! glory ! glory ! Oceans of love flow through my soul . Oh , how inexpressibly sweet and joyful ! Read part of Acts 21 . After giving myself anew into the hands of God I proceeded to talk from Acts 21:14 . The Lord so greatly led me out on his work in us that I did not get to the last two points , namely , his will done with us , and his will done by us . Praise the Lord , he so abundantly fills my mouth with holiness that I can not get to anything else to say . <p> Had a long talk with a sister of the Church of God who was mortified over my going to the altar to seek sanctification . She thought I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something was wanting , but I knew very well what ailed me . I had been in need of the sanctifying power of God and , glory to Jesus , I have found it . She thought that she was fully sanctified when she was converted . I replied that if that were so her experience differed from that of the first converts to Christ , as well as that of the Corinthians , the Ephesians , the Thessalonians , etc . To this she could make no reply but that it was to be attained by growth , but I reminded her that God was to do the work . <p> August 3 , 1877 . This morn went into the Lords camp . Dr. Steele , from New York , was reading his interesting Bible lessons , giving the benefit of the Greek and Dean Alford . Very instructive . Was happy to meet several brethren of my acquaintance from Crawford County and elsewhere . Thank God , they are on the holiness line . <p> 4 . Went out to camp at 5:30 A.M. Prayer meeting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or until afternoon preaching by Brother Rice , who ( probably unknown to the Methodist Episcopal ministers ) had his license taken from him two days before by the Northwest Ohio Conference for preaching holiness . He gave us a straight , close-hewing sermon on sanctification . He did not preach holiness for the glory of Methodism , as some others seemed somewhat inclined to do . Some were much displeased at his exposure of the opposition to holiness in the Methodist Episcopal Church . Came home this eve . Found dear Wife and child well . <p> 8 . Sister Ella Snyder called on us . She was visiting at Brother McKeys , who , by the way , is a strong opposer of entire sanctification . Ella soon began talking on the subject and talking somewhat differently from what she did on last Sabbath . We think it probable that she had just been receiving the teaching of someone outside of the second work , She treated the subject with much lightness . Before she left we bowed in prayer , at the close of which she fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her if she was sick . She said not . Looked strange and confounded . Prayed some and confessed that the hand of God was upon her . Wife asked her if she was now sanctified . She replied that she knew not where she was . She grasped my hand very firmly . I raised her up , asked Sarah to support her ; but she would not loosen her hold . As I endeavored to give her over to Wife , she gripped my hand the harder . We raised her up but she could not stand . We dropped her into a rocking chair and soon kneeled again in prayer . She prayed constantly to God for a " clean heart , " " sanctification , " etc . Her full consciousness had hardly recovered when she said she had to go , as her party were waiting on her . Sarah accompanied her a piece and left her looking very solemn . I pray God to lead her to the cleansing fountain . <p> 12 . Sabbath . Beautiful morn . Was up early and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1 Thessalonians 5:24 . Observed that this text forever took away all excuse of inability ; that it laid down a principle which converted all the commands of God into promises ; that everything unto which the Lord called us he would work in us . Applying the subject , as the apostle did , to entire sanctification , I defended the distinct work by experience , reason , and " thus saith the Lord . " The Lord powerfully blessed the testimony of my dear wife before preaching , and I believe that seed of truth has been sown in the hearts of the people . Went home with Bro . Jacob Freed , Brother and Sister Long , and others . We talked some on holiness . Brother Long opposed it by denying inherited depravity , which he did after my discourse today in the pulpit . Much of the afternoon was spent in the closet and private walks with the Lord . Oh , how much I prefer the company of the Lord to any other ! <p> 16 . At Eldership convention . Place not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Topic : Proper Home Influence ; Duty of Parents to Their Children . The Spirit of the Lord deeply impressed this subject upon the minds of all . Hearts were melted . Tears flowed for unsaved children of ministers and members . Unconverted souls and backsliders were deeply affected . The Lord converted the convention wholly into an effort to save souls . Fervent prayers were offered , exhortations and tears , invitation hymns were sung ( the organ was forgotten ) , and all the congregation was deeply stirred . A few souls arose and asked prayers . The unconverted children of Brothers were especially prayed for . Oh , how I praised God that the dear brethren were willing to let the Spirit lead the meeting ! The whole forenoon was given to devotion . <p> 18 . Spent the day in writing , reading , and prayer . P.M. , long talk with Brother Mitchell and Sister Shriner on sanctification . Brother M. talks reasonably ; Sister S. is hostile to the blessed truth , but of course it is through ignorance . She thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy it by my doctrine of holiness , having actual fears of holiness . Oh , I hope and pray to God to lead my dear brethren on to this heart perfection . Would to God they understood this blessed full salvation ! Nothing but wrong notions of perfect holiness or an evil spirit can oppose entire sanctification , as it does not in the least disturb or conflict with any doctrine of the church . It allows all that the Bible or any man attributes to regeneration . Instead of depreciating , it has greatly magnified justification . <p> 19 . Sabbath . At ten a funeral procession arrived from Rome , bringing a sweet little angel form , Bertha Estella Curtis , the only child of Z. H. Curtis , of Van Wert County . As their parents reside at Rome , they brought the child back there for burial . Brother Wilson preached an impressive discourse from Job : " Man that is born of a woman is of few days , and full of trouble . " * ( Job 14:1 ) We laid the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . <p> Came to Shenandoah . Brother Burchard preached from : " Christ also suffered for us , leaving us an example , that ye should follow his steps . " * ( 1 Peter 2:21 ) With his usual earnestness he urged all to live a whole-hearted Christian life . I wish the dear brother would learn to bring dear souls to the blood that cleanses from all sin , instead of infusing strength and zeal to fight inbred corruption . Recently I talked with this brother on the subject of sanctification . I had a conviction of mind that he knew something about it . He confessed that after seeking for mercy for three days the load of guilt and condemnation fell from his heart and he testified to the pardon of his sins . ( This I remember myself . ) But soon he found himself wanting before God . Then began another struggle for deliverance from something ( he knew not what , as he felt no more guilt ) that greatly disturbed his peace and shut out the smiles of Gods face . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to God , he " sank down in all the depth of humility and nothingness that was possible for him to conceive of . " God wonderfully blessed him with perfect light peace and love . What was this but entire sanctification ? But for want of being better taught he calls this his conversion . Strange confused theology . The idea of pardon one week before conversion ! I pray God to show this brother his mistake and renew him in the blessing of perfect holiness . <p> 21 . Sent out about twenty-five cards of invitation in the mail . People began to come in to the reunion here at the College . <p> 22 . College yard filled . Some good speakers , but about all chaff and vainglory , ministers and lawyers alike using their brains to evolve some trashy nonsense to tickle the ears of the foolish . I was quite unwell . Eve , much reduced , but went out to Vermillion , where I met a few precious souls and preached that men should " trust in the Lord , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with strength to preach about forty minutes . <p> 26 . Sabbath . The Lord helped me to set forth his great power to save from all sin in this life . Went home with Brother David Donelson . Conversed on holiness , spent much time in secret prayer . Was impressed to preach on holiness , yet felt sure that the church did not want to hear it ; but I knew there was some hungry soul there that did want it . The church here is quite strong numerically and there is much good material . Oh , that all these vessels of the Lord would be purged , sanctified , made fit for the Masters use , prepared unto every good work ! Drove home , arriving at nearly one oclock . <p> 27 . Arose in good time , feeling greatly refreshed in the Lord . Helped to get ready to go to Shenandoah . <p> 28 . Sister Shriner is boiling over with railing toward Gods pure little ones . Glory to God ! He has saved me " from the strife of tongues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in imitation of his own example , from answering a word . It were folly indeed to try to talk holiness where there is no appetite but for carnal contention . Thank the Lord for this wisdom . <p> 29 . Fasted and prayed today . Father N seems very cold and unsociable toward us . Probably the enemy has put something in his heart . I sank very deep down in the great ocean of Gods love and goodness this morning . Had inexpressible conception of the wonders of salvation . Visited at Brother Klines . I spent about all the time on my knees in prayer , which I love most to do . <p> 30 . Sold my mare and colt to Mother Wolf for $130 . <p> September 1 , 1877 . Elmer Wolf took me part of the way to Mansfield . I gave up the faithful Mattie and little Billy to him . Walked a few miles and was overtaken by a kind man who took me in his buggy to town . Called at a few places . Spent much of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation . <p> 2 . Met in a holiness prayer meeting at 5:30 A.M. Took some breakfast . Stayed much on my knees before God . At 10:30 A.M. met , and tried to talk to the people from Ephesians 3:20 . Then we went to a small stream at the west side of the city and had the happy privilege of immersing . They all enjoy entire sanctification . Never before did I feel the solemnity of the ordinance as now . How unworthy I regarded myself to imitate my blessed Master , especially in immersing those whom he had led far out into the ocean of his perfect love ! We sang a hymn , then knelt down upon the green sod and called upon the Lord , who was so very sensibly near to us . The day had been very dark and dreary , the sun not having shone through the clouds since early morn . But now the gentle hand of God brushed the clouds aside and sent down upon us the most glorious and brilliant streams of light that I ever witnessed . Sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been walking with God upon the strait highway of holiness for some years and her whole life is swallowed up in God alone . Though the sun was shining brilliantly , yet as she arose from the water I was impressed that a light shone upon us " above the brightness of the sun . " * ( Acts 26:13 ) She stood calmly gazing upward for a moment , with the light of God beaming from her face . I gave way to the impression that the occasion and circumstances had made on my mind and spoke of the heavenly light , which I still supposed was natural ; but she afterward informed me that it was more than sunshinerays of glory . The whole assembly was awed into reverence , and a strange feeling of sacredness pervaded all our minds . How applicable the words of the prophet : " Arise , shine ; for thy light is come , and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee " * ( Isaiah 60:1 ) ! <p> 3 . Took train for Perryville to begin a holiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembled . I tried to teach them their rights in the gospel , taking special pains to admonish the brethren and sisters not to allow the enemy of their souls to stir up bitterness and hatred in their hearts against the way of perfect holiness , assuring them that this way was so hated by the devil that if possible he would overthrow the best of Christians and set them foaming and raging mad against the pure in heart and true holiness . I was surprised to learn that since my last visit here the enemy had already begun to work , fearing the destruction of his kingdom . <p> 6 . Meeting nearly all day . Satan still angry . Small stones were thrown into the house from the door and windows . Two brethren ventured to speak . The first took occasion to unload his mind of many grievous objections and charges against the holiness work , and sat down much humiliated when he saw that his harsh speeches only elicited pleasant smiles and kind words from the sanctified . The second said he did not endorse what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second work . Both asked for " thus saith the Lord . " <p> 7 . Fasted and worshiped God all day . Met at 10 A.M. and continued until 4 P.M. Just before closing we engaged in prayer to God for my perfect healing . I was wonderfully strengthened both in body and faith . Walked about one mile over hills to find places for Gods little ones , then drove to Loudonville and Brother L and I ate some refreshment , about 5 P.M. , at the bakers , I not having eaten anything since the day before at noon . Glory to God , I felt no weakness . <p> 8 . Drove back to the Ridge . Found Gods little ones there at noon and no food , and no encouragement to go anywhere for dinner . We sent to Perryville and got some provisions , but before it came we had begun afternoon meeting , and cared but little for the bread that perisheth . <p> 9 . Sabbath . In the saving strength of the Lord , Wife , child , and I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with scarcely any fatigue . Now began the eruption of a volcano in the form of a preacher , even my beloved colleague W. H. Oliver . The red-hot lava of scorn , scoff , and persecution , yea , words of slang fit only for the worldly rabble , poured forth about two hours , all against those whom the blood had washed whiter than snow . Glory to God , I only added that I thanked my holy Savior I was counted worthy to suffer persecution and reproach for his names sake . Praise God , he keeps me in a storm as well as in the calm . We came to Brother Fords . Sister Ella Snyder came along , and after she and Sarah had a good talk , we prayer together , and , praise the Lord , he sanctified her soul and body . <p> I came to Hayesville , where an appointment had been announced for me at 3 P.M. By the help of the Lord I talked from 1 Thessalonians 5:24 . Glory to God , the truth went home to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Poor old man tried to pick a quarrel with me on baptism . I finally calmed his nerves by singing " The Precious Blood Has Reached Me . " Shut myself up with God until meeting . Found the church mostly displeased with the harangue of the forenoon . Good speaking meeting . Wife testified boldly to the second work and admonished the church . Sister Snyder , whom the Lord smote down in my room some time ago , and who entered into rest this day , also testified to her entire sanctification . I talked to the people about twenty minutes from Acts 5:28-39 . Oh , how sweetly the Spirit led me and talked through me ! Some shouting . <p> 10 . My soul was very happy today . It appears that I only begin to realize the glorious work that God has done for me . I do thank God for the test of yesterday . O Lord , try me in every way and see if there is any evil way in me ! I do praise the Lord that I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persecutor . May the Lord enlighten , humble , and save him . I suppose he really thinks like Paul , the persecutor , did , that he is doing God service . <p> 13 . I walked over to Sister Smiths and called to invite her to the meeting . Had a season of prayer with her and family . As I was about to start she asked if I did not wish to sell my buggy . I told her I did . So she gave me a beast to ride to Shenandoah and bring the buggy back on my return . Thank the Lord , this is his kind dealing with me . Eve , abstained from supper , as I commonly do when I have services . Good full house . Delivered my farewell discourse to the people of Shenandoah . Acts 20 . Brother Oliver was present , and was so much annoyed when I addressed the few little ones whom the Lord has perfected in love that he could not compose himself and sit in one position three seconds . God pity any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Met a Brother and Sister Daily , from Morrow County . I enquired of that country as a missionary field and heard of some destitute localities , where the Lord may send me to win souls for Jesus . Came to Shenandoah , thence to Brother M. Bells , south of town . Visited until 5 P.M. Poor man thinks it impossible to get rid of the Adamic nature while we live . So " entered not in because of unbelief . " * ( Hebrews 4:6 ) Had a season prayer with the family and twice interviewed the Lord in the pleasant woods near by . Glory to Jesus , he is near , yea , reigning in me most preciously today . Came over to Pauls . Found that they had been in expectation of me all day . Prayed with and encouraged them to stedfastness . <p> 15 . Ate some breakfast this morn with the design of fasting the rest of the day . Desired much to visit some , but felt the importance of shutting myself up with the Lord , so I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met in the grove and had a profitable little meeting . Brother Oliver , by my request , again preached . <p> 16 . Sabbath . Early this morn I went to the beautiful grove prepared for services . Spent a long time upon my knees there in prayer and reading His Word . At ten people convened . Had a good speaking-meeting . Then Brother Oliver preached on Ephesians 3:14-15 . Preached over an hour on Christian union . I am sick of hearing union thrown at the people with the sling of depravity . Might as well go into a drove of sheep and expect to get them all into a solid mass by pounding them around with a club . It can but scatter more . <p> I took dinner with Brother and Sister Ferguson on the ground , then went off into the woods nearly a half mile and stayed with the Lord alone until 2:30 P.M. , the time for preaching . The Spirit directed me to read and talk upon 1 Corinthians 13 . Though I said scarcely anything but what every true Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in about a half hour opposing holiness as a distinct work of God . Poor soul , he is greatly disturbed with the subject of perfect love . Went home with Brother and Sister Tomlinson and Brother and Sister Crum . They were anxious to learn of the way of holiness . Had prayer together and some supper . I walked to the Bethel , found it full and Brother Oliver preaching . <p> Brother O. took me in hand on holiness ; asked me many questions , made grievous charges , and wanted me to leave what he termed " my theory . " Asked me if I was going to continue preaching as I have for the past month . I told him that I would continue to teach all the light I had received and as much more as the Lord would give . I patiently heard his long heckling and thanked him . As he finished he drew from his pocket a paper and handed it to me . My first impression was that it was a note that someone had sent to me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God go through my whole being and I knew that it was something from which God would bring great good to my soul and his cause . I thanked him and put it in my pocket . Came to Brother Stoners and got my beast and buggy and drove to Brother Wolfes . Stopping for some things there I took a moment to read the portentous paper I had received . I read as follows : <p> September 15 , 1877 . <p> The following charges are preferred against Elder D. S. Warner : <p> First . For inviting a sect of fanatics calling themselves the Holy Alliance Band to hold meetings in the local Churches of God without consulting the elders or trustees or myself . <p> Second . For joining in with these said band and bidding them God speed and thereby bringing schism and division among those churches . <p> Third . For the accommodation of this professed holy band that he invited to hold a meeting of ten days in the Church of God chapel in Mansfield . Elder D. S. Warner did on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour hold the ordinances of washing the saints feet and the Lords Supper attended to . <p> Fourth . For stating publicly in Shenandoah , about the 26th of August , that he had been preaching his own doctrine prior to seeking his so-called holiness . <p> W. H. Oliver . <p> I thanked God and put the paper away without saying a word . Bid all farewell , including Della Oliver , whom I invited to come and visit us . I drove to Sister Smiths , twelve miles . The night was beautiful and light , and my soul was happy . I praised God all the way and was too happy to sleep when I retired about 12 oclock . Of these charges I feel as Joseph told save much people alive . " * ( Genesis 50:20 ) <p> To the first charge I say : Thank God that calling people hard names does not make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No band was invited , but simply persons from different localities who enjoyed holiness . <p> Second . The charge of schism is without the least shadow of foundation . Through the mercy of God a few souls have been sanctified from their pride , etc. , and qualified to be useful in the church . <p> The answer to the third charge is omitted from the journal . Perhaps an oversight . <p> Fourth . This is a mistake . I simply said that on sanctification I used to preach what I believed , but now I am able to testify that I know . <p> 21 . At Canton camp-meeting . A.M. , Brother Oliver tried to preach , being very hoarse . After preaching a brother presented a call for money for Brother Olivers horse . I joyfully took a paper and solicited for him with his paper of charges in my pocket . Thank God for entire sanctification . P.M. , I addressed the people from 1 Thessalonians 4:1 . By the help of God a portion of the discourse was given to testifying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crossfire . Brother James followed him with his mixed talk , part of the time seeming to endorse me and the other Brother P. Oh , how much waste of time for the want of seeking a definite experience and then being able to " give the trumpet a certain sound ! " Brother James announced that in the evening he would preach from , " This is the will of God , even your sanctification. " * ( 1 Thessalonians 4:3 ) I prayed God to keep him from opposing the truth and , thank His name , he talked only to sinners and said little on the text . <p> 24 . Canton camp meeting . I thank God that I came to this meeting . I have never in all my life met so much good , old-fashioned , plain , humble , Holy Ghost religion . What a kind-hearted people ! God bless them . After long time was spent in sobs and farewell greetings around a large assembly of people who were solemnly touched by the deepness of the feeling , we marched around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the New Jerusalem . " Then we gathered in front of the stand , and as we stood singing , the Holy Spirit came upon us and there was wonderful shouting in the camp by sisters , about all young , single ones , who were carried entirely off in the Spirit . We did not get away from the sacred altar until about 2 oclock at night , so greatly did the Spirit rest on the camp of the dear saints . <p> 25 . Arose greatly refreshed . Went to the camp for breakfast once more , after we all bowed in the tent to worship God . Had a precious stroll and season of prayer out on the campground . Returning , met Bro . Milton S , a very faithful young man . I read in his face some very unfortunate misgivings , and told him the same , to his surprise . I gave him nearly an hours lecture on the evils of violating and perverting physical laws , also on self-culture and mental improvement . The dear brother was lost for language to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and urged me never to miss an opportunity to instruct and admonish persons in his condition . <p> Brother James and I started for Middle Branch , where I had an appointment . We stopped with Sister Lucy , ate a dish of peaches and cream , and had a season of prayer . Rather small congregation , and they rather sleepy from having been up so late last night at camp meeting . <p> On the 27th Brother Warner went to attend the Eldership meeting at Smithville . He says that on account of insufficient pure air in the house he did not remain in much of the time . He also says , on the 28th , that " Brother James was taken into the ecclesiastical mill today . " On the third day of the session Brother Warner was called upon for his report of the years work . He reported 203 sermons , 68 converts , 66 accessions , 40 immersed . There were 164 members in good standing , whereas there were 75 when he took charge two years previous . Proceeding in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that God had fully saved and sanctified me , and that I was under the necessity to preach that precious truth to the glory of Jesus ; that I desired to cooperate with the Church of God ; could not exchange truth for truth but must walk in all the light of God . The Holy Spirit rested on me in power , and tears flowed freely all over the congregation . Praise God for his power and presence ! Brother Oliver then arose and made known to the body that he had charges against me . The speaker appointed a committee to investigate my case . Brother O. subpoenaed a large number of witnesses , many of whom knew absolutely nothing about the case . I told the body that I had never informed but three persons about the charges against me , had asked no witnesses but had committed my whole case to God ; however , if anyone felt directed by the Spirit to appear in defense of the cause of God and holiness they should meet with us . We went at once to Brother Zs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed with the need of prayer and hoped these dear old saints would not begin such a solemn work without invoking the Holy Spirits guidance . But I was disappointed , as they opened the business at once . Even after investigation began I felt that I must go to God on my knees ; but I did not , as I had no control of business . Yet I did wrong in not demanding the right of prayer . I also lost power to conduct myself with that calmness and sweetness that I had been so ardently wishing from the Lord , though I felt no such thing as a roiled temper for one second for all the hard aspersions and carnal accusations thrown at me . Yet I did sometimes speak when I should have kept silent , as my blessed Master did . <p> What was my astonishment when Elder O. read letters from Vermillion and Brubakers signed by about all the church , charging me with insanity whenever I touched on sanctification , also with causing division and schism in the churches and every work imaginable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read over that were appended to those letters I had strange feelings . I truly felt myself in a queer world . Never in my life did my reasoning powers receive such a dreadful shock . I felt myself sinking , then looked to Jesus and all was calm and peaceful again . I asked Brother O. who had got up those letters . " They are headed respectively from the Vermillion and Brubaker churches to the Eldership . Please tell the Committee whether the elders have written them or who . " Brother O. looked very much confused and refused to answer . I demanded an answer . The Committee sustained me . Then with shame he confessed that they were both written by him . I told him that it was all right and thanked him for his trouble . <p> Brother Roller , elder from Vermillion , who confessed to me that at the ordinance meeting he was ashamed of Elder Os two-hour harangue of abuse against the work of " perfecting the saints , " being present , was then called to the witness stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sanctification , I asked him to inform the Committee what the manifestations of my insanity were . He gave the following three points , which I record to his shame : <p> First . " You hesitated to proceed to preach once at Vermillion , stating that you wished to be led by the Spirit in the selection of a subject and that if the Spirit wished you not to preach you would read the Word , talk experience , or be silent , as the Spirit directed . " <p> Second . " You do not act as you used to . At our ordinance meeting you sat back , and I believe Brother Oliver had to invite you forward . " Brother O. concurred in this remark . But I then appealed to them if it was not a fact that I came down from the pulpit immediately after closing my remarks and led in the preparation and observance of feet-washing . Then he remarked that it was at the Brick , on Brother Lynns charge , and Brother O. was not there at all , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked me to assist in the Lords Supper ( which was perfectly proper for meto wait for an invitation ) . <p> Third . " You do not preach as loud on sanctification as you used to preach , but you are more low and calm . " <p> These were his only reasons for the assertion of my insanity . <p> Brother Mitchell only stated that some young people asked him " what ails Brother Warner , he does not preach as heretofore , " hence concluded that I was partly insane . Brother O. said all he could to taint the character of the holiness workers . Many of his aspersions were never answered . It is of no use to give particulars , only this , that I was grateful to God for these fiery ordeals , and though the Lord kept me from an evil thought , yet I was conscious of great weakness and must say to my shame that I did not keep that perfect calmness and sweetness in the midst of the storm of unexpected accusation . However , I came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace had sanctified me wholly . " I was entirely free from the least hard feelings against any of my brethren . Glory to God , I felt good toward them all . Looked upon their efforts to condemn me and the holiness cause as springing entirely from ignorance , sin within , and a blind zeal to protect the church . I went to my room a happy soul . Related a few points of the many wonderful things developed before the committee and then we concluded that it did not minister grace to talk about them , hence we had a sweet season of worship and lay down and slept sweetly until morn . <p> 30 . Sabbath . Arose early and sought the Lord . Spent about all my time with God and my Bible until 10 A.M. , then went up to the Bethel to speaking meeting , and heard Elder T. Hickernel make a long speech of caution to brethren who seemed to have been flinging at sanctified ones . He made this sensible remark : " You who claim to have been fully sanctified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your claims false by picking and persecuting those who have the second experience . " At half past ten went to the Methodist Episcopal house of worship , where a large congregation had assembled to hear me speak on perfect holiness . I felt more like keeping quiet in some small corner . A number of the brethren were present , some to sit back and try to criticize . Yea , these were preachers , and about all of them left before the sermon closed . But there were several others who came to learn and who gave close attention and were compelled to sanction the truth . The Lord wonderfully baptized my soul and all the lovers of truth and holiness . I believe I never before spoke with such power and liberty . Glory to God , he so freely poured his Spirit upon us that it filled the whole house . After services , Brother Olivers daughter came forward and told us that she enjoyed the blessing of entire sanctification . She said she was wonderfully strengthened and wished that her father were fully saved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torbet , the Methodist minister , was also with us . We enjoyed a good season in reading some good holiness works , such as Dr. Steeles Love Enthroned , and prayer , then came to meet at the Bethel at 2:30 P.M. Went to the home of Brother Olivers daughter . Her father was to come also , but seeing us go there , or for some other cause , went elsewhere . The poor woman is very unfortunately married , but Christ is her only true companion . Eve , Brother Updike preached with all his might ( his usual style ) on Christ a teacher . We then observed the ordinances . <p> October 1 , 1877 . Committee on my case reported " charges sustained , " but recommended me favorably to the body for license with this restriction only , that I do not bring holiness workers or any outside elements to hold a meeting anywhere in the Churches of God without their consent . This I readily consented to , as a meeting thus appointed could do no good , or but little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some meetings in the past which to my surprise proved offensive to the churches . <p> The report was adopted and my license renewed . Thank the Lord ! However , I had perfect peace on the whole matter , and had my license been withheld I would equally have given God thanks . Glory to Jesus ! <p> Was out much of the day talking with brethren on perfect love , etc . The brethren from Stark circuit again called me out and consulted me about taking their circuit . I told them if they could stand perfect holiness and all the counsel of God preached , they might apply for me , and I would leave it all with the Lord and the Eldership . This eve I gave a concise account of my experience of justification and sanctification . At a late hour the Eldership closed with a report of the Stationing Committee . I was assigned to the Stark circuit , consisting of Canton , New Berlin , Middle Creek , and Stumps Bethel . Thank the Lord ! His ways are not our ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows best . I committed it all to him , besought him to prevent my appointment to a circuit if he did not wish me to take one , even by cutting off my license if no other way ; and now I receive this appointment of the Lord , and by his blessing and power I hope he will make his Word to run and be glorified in the salvation of hundreds of souls . <p> Following this decision of the Stationing Committee , Brother and Sister Warner had the task of changing their place of abode , which in their work they had so many times to do . Their belongings were certainly not many ; nevertheless the work of packing and the obtaining of some means of conveying their goods to the station was left generally for them to attend to . His literary society about this time gave an entertainment at the College , but he with Sister Warner preferred to attend a holiness meeting about four miles distant . Of this meeting he thus speaks : <p> 3 . Met Brother Ackers , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a wonderful specimen of Gods great salvation , raised from the delirium tremens to perfect holiness and mighty faith . <p> 7 . Brother Ackers testified for God that the happiest moment he ever saw was when he found he had lost all his property and had not a dollar left , though he had been a wealthy merchant in Bucyrus . I was led to testify how the Lord had taken me through some storms in great calmness . Eve , the church and the large schoolhouse on the same corners were both filled . I delivered a short sermon in the former on perfection , then went over to the other house and gave an exhortation to sinners . <p> Before leaving for Canton , Brother and Sister Warner decided to visit the latters former home near Upper Sandusky . From that place he went to visit his father , at Bridgewater , Williams County . <p> 11 . This morning arose before daylight , started quite early to Loudonville . Brother Eyer came to the station and brought a quilt for us and a small one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got up for us . I spent some hours in packing things more securely to ship . Took train at 2:16 P.M. for Upper Sandusky . Reached there after seven . Walked out to Father Kellers . They had about given me up and were engaged in family worship . With reverence and admiration I stood at the window and looked in at that dear , affectionate family , all made perfect " through the blood of the everlasting covenant , " * ( Hebrews 13:20-21 ) while bowed together in evening devotion . Father was praying with a beaming face toward me . It appeared that the whole house was illuminated with the presence of God . My heart was made to burn with love and the Holy Ghost . When through with prayer , I entered , and then we had a moment of joyful greeting in the name of the Lord Jesus . My full heart then suggested that we bow again in praise and thanksgiving to God , which we all did . Oh , how my poor heart tried to find utterance for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation ! Until quite late we talked of the kind dealings of God to our souls . I praise thee , O my God and Father , that thou hast ever connected me with this family . Through thy blessings , we have been wonderful helps to each other . <p> 13 . I took train at about half past five for my fathers in Williams County . Lay over about an hour at Toledo . Reached Bryan about half past one . Went up in the town and soon found a man by the name of Faith , who could take me within one and three fourths miles from Fathers . Talked with the poor man about his soul ; but he had taken an oath to stick to the Lutheran Church as long as he lived , and that oath must be kept if he violates every obligation to Christ and loses his soul . Called at Brother Deans . Found the poor man much cast down over the death of his dear wife . He wept as I alluded to her . Came on home . Found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I came from Brother Deans , I passed the old schoolhouse where I surrendered to Jesus . It is no more used . I revered the sacred spot . Approached the door and found that it was not locked . I entered and kneeled as near as I could where I bowed at the altar a penitent sinner twelve years ago last February . I poured out my full heart of gratitude to the Father of mercies that he ever sent his spirit to convict me of my sins and show me my awful doom if I continued in sin . I truly thanked God that he had there prevailed upon me to repent of all my sin . I praised the great Shepherd of my soul that his grace had kept me those years from the power of an enraged foe . My thanks ascended to God for all the good he had done through this lump of unworthy clay . There I reconsecrated to God , after a careful examination of myself before him . <p> After some talk with Father , we bowed down together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dreadful end of the wicked . For some time I have been unusually burdened in heart for my poor old father . I trust God in his infinite mercy will yet save him ere he goes to his long home . Before retiring , in my bedchamber I continued long in prayer with my blessed Savior . <p> 14 . Sabbath . Brother Joseph Neil and I went to Madison Bethel , where Brother Coblen ( recently from the German Baptists ) had an appointment to preach . Brother C. spoke about thirty minutes on Hebrews 2:2 . Did well . I then talked over thirty minutes , mostly on the perfect escape from sin . <p> The church here are living in a high state of justification and spirituality . They all sanctioned entire sanctification . We then had a good speaking meeting , when some of them acknowledged their need of full salvation . Oh , what a pity this church could not be led into the blessed land of perfect rest ! But perhaps the next preacher that comes along will try to turn them against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister ! O Lord ! make haste to " purify the sons of Levi . " * ( Malachi 3:3 ) Took dinner with Brother Troxel . As soon as we arrived , Brother Neil began to entertain some young people on the porch with stories , while the disgraceful pipe protruded from his unsanctified lips . I withdrew at once to the room , read a few chapters , then to the bedroom and communed with my God until dinner was about ready . After eating , the pipe presented itself again . The Lord led me to rebuke such filthiness of the flesh . I told them that the use of tobacco was positively a sin : First , because it was the gratification of an unnatural and unholy appetite ; second , it was offensive to all who were not therewith corrupted ; third , it was a sinful appropriation of the Lords means ; fourth , it disqualified for refined and pure society by its extreme filthiness . Brother Neil then hitched up his beast , drove to the front , and called for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of Gods Word and then engaged in prayer . The Spirit led me into some very solemn requests for my brethren , and I trust they will hereafter have a more sacred conception of what it is to be holy in life , heart , and " all manner of conversation . " * ( 1 Peter 1:15 ) Came to Fathers . Had a long season of prayer in the chamber where I dwelt so much with God at the beginning of my ministration of the Word . Then for exercise and meditation I chose to walk to the meetinghouse , about one and one half miles . The house was densely crowded . I was astonished that the word had spread so rapidly to such a great distance in every direction . The Lord gave me glorious liberty and power . 1 Thessalonians 4:1 . Touched on sanctification , and I saw in a moment that I had some hearers who were in the land and others seeking the crossing , all members of the Church of God . The Lord gave me a very solemn appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly melted down . <p> 15 . Father and I drove to Brother Josephs . I walked to the cemetery and communed with God beside the grave of my beloved and revered mother . I knelt down there and thanked God for having been brought into the world by such a pure and beloved mother ; for her tender and never-failing care for me when in sickly childhood and youth ; for the hallowed influence of her constant life of love and patience and humble trust in God in the midst of constant wickedness in this world ; for her triumphant death and the hope of meeting her in heaven . Though I began in secret I soon forgot my surroundings and called loudly upon my blessed Jesus , not only in thanksgiving , but for the salvation of Father , Brother and friends . <p> 16 . Arose early . Communed with the Lord . Bathed , as my custom is each alternate morning . Read a little tract on Joshuas stopping the sun and moon , written by D. M. Bennett . While reading the little bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my father . These facts flashed across my mind : 1 . The world was lost in ignorance of God and debased in sin . 2 . The first thing necessary in human salvation was for God to make man sensible of His existence and power . 3 . He had to take mankind in the condition sin had placed him . 4 . Man , possessing very little mental and less moral elevation and energy , would not have been impressed with awe and reverence before God had he manifested his perfections of wisdom and holiness , any more than a base society would entertain peculiar respect for a man who appeared among them with superior intellect and morals . 5 . As mans chief ideal of greatness consisted in valor , heroism , and physical achievements , it is a fact that on this low plane only could man be led to recognize the true greatness and actual existence of God , by the manifestations of his power in the manner he used in destroying those idolatrous nations . <p> P.M. , Father and I drove to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , and one dollar in silver for Levilla . He also gave me a small package of some of my revered mothers clothes . How blessed her memory ! Eve , Mr. Frisby ( married to my niece ) , my brother , and a large wagonload accompanied me to Madison , where I spoke to a full house . About the whole church received the light of holiness . <p> On the 19th he took train on his journey toward Canton . He stopped at Loudonville and visited the church . Arrived at Canton on the 20th and proceeded immediately to visit congregations on the circuit . Sister Warner and child arrived on the 23d . The search for a house in which to live extended over a period of several days . There were good , faithful brethren who assisted them with provisions , but yet to a considerable extent they were left to provide the necessaries of life themselves . Of his effort to procure wood and hay we observe , for November 6 : <p> Cold . Snowed some last night for the first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hay to spare . It seems hard that a poor messenger of God must expose himself to drive about sixteen miles through mud and very raw air to hunt those necessaries . It seems a light thing nowadays to sow to the people spiritual things , but a heavy thing to reap a few temporal things , even when we try to live more simple and cheap than our poor . Oh , how good it would have been for me to have had this day in the warm with the Lord in my library ! But glory to Jesus , we still joy in sustaining sacrifice for his sake and feel content with our lot . Only , dear Lord , give us a good supply of the spirit of love , zeal , wisdom , and power . <p> Meetings in town were held from house to house until a permanent place of worship could be opened . It was not long , however , until they both felt the Lord leading them to resign the circuit . Brother Warner had accepted with submission and good grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of mans appointment ) , but as a preacher of holiness with an ever increasing interest in a wider field , he doubtless felt that God wanted him to be free to go and do as the Spirit directed . The following is his entry for November 23 : <p> This morn before daylight , when having morning devotion , the Spirit of God spoke to both Sarah and me to fast today . Thank God for such a precious Leader . Who would not obey such a wise Counselor ? Spent most of the day in reading the Word , singing , and prayer . At ten A.M. we were both before the Lord in silent prayer when we were both directed by the Spirit to resign this circuit . Still on our knees , we made known the orders received . We could but say amen , and the refreshings from the presence of the Lord came upon our hungry souls . We engaged in prayer and praise , when I was directed to proceed at once to write my resignation . <p> This tried me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind brethren and sisters . It seemed hard that I must throw up the circuit without as much as consulting them . But we dared not disobey God , as some hesitancy to obey in the past had cost me much power and sweet rest in God . Praise God , our hearts were much lightened and we felt that we had now got back at the beginning of the highway of holiness , which we had to some extent missed . We could now sing , " He leadeth us. " * Eve , went up to the office and received a card earnestly calling for our services at Columbiana . Of this call I had an impression before I went to the office , and believe it of the Lord . Glory to God ! My way has been hedged up ever since we came on the circuit . <p> At Columbiana he found a number whose hearts were open to sanctification . His work there resulted in ten persons receiving the experience and one sinner being converted . Returning to his house in Canton on December 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in somewhat itemized form the solemn covenant that constituted his consecration to God . <p> 8 . I fasted today . Remained up with the Lord until after 11 oclock at night . I was led by the Spirit to a deep self-examination . I found myself utterly nothing in the sight of God . I read with great interest the experience of Brother R. Yeakel , in the Living Epistles of 1873 . As I read over the solemn written covenant that this holy man entered into with God , I was much impressed to do likewise , but feared that my impressions came from a wish to imitate one of Gods holy men rather than to follow the Spirit . <p> Went to the office this eve and received a letter from Brother Chambers , chairman of the Ohio Holiness Alliance . As soon as I saw his name on the envelope the conviction of last Sabbath that I should give myself up to be a holiness evangelist came strongly to my mind , and as I walked home I promised God that I would not lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . The Lord helped me to do so , and as I wrote down my convictions and surrendered to the Lord , the Holy Ghost graciously fell upon my soul . <p> 13 . The day was mild and fair . Took a walk in the woods to commune with God . Thought much of the words of God , " I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel . " * ( Jeremiah 31:31 ) In Hebrews 8 and 10 I read that this covenant related to the new dispensation , and the apostle , in Hebrews 10 , actually connects it with sanctification . I felt like entering more personally and formally into this covenant with the Almighty . But I thought , Can such a worm enter into an everlasting covenant with the Holy God of the universe ? God makes the proposition , and with solemn reverence I venture to step out upon it . And this I do in the name of the Lord Jesus , my only righteousness . <p> A covenant is an agreement of two parties in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain benefits . God is the party of the first part of the contract and has bound himself . <p> 1 . " I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hearts . " * ( Hebrews 8:10 ) <p> Now , therefore , in holy fear and reverence I present myself as the party of the second part and subscribe my name to the holy article of agreement , and following thy example will here and now write down the conditions on my part . <p> Lord , thou hast been true to thy covenant , though I have been most unfaithful and am now altogether unworthy to take hold of thy most gracious covenant . But knowing that thou hast bound thyself in thy own free offer to " be merciful to their unrighteousness , " I take courage to approach thee and would most earnestly beseech thee to fulfill thy wonderful offer to be my God ; and I do most joyfully yield myself entirely to be thine . <p> Therefore this soul which thou hast made in thine own image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as seemeth good . <p> This mind shall think only for thy glory and the promotion of thy cause . <p> This will is thy will , O God ! <p> The spirit within this body is now thine ; do with it as thou wilt , in life and death . <p> This body is thy temple forevermore . <p> These hands shall work only for thee . <p> These eyes to see thy adorable works and thy holy law . <p> This tongue and these lips to speak only holiness unto the Lord . <p> These ears to hear thy voice alone . <p> These feet to walk only in thy ways . <p> And all my being is now and forever thine . <p> In signing my name to this solemn covenant I am aware that I bind myself to live , act , speak , think , move , sit , stand up , lie down , eat , drink , hear , see , feel , and whatsoever I do all the days and nights of my life , to do all continually and exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but what honors God . I must have nothing in my possession or under my control but such as I can consistently write upon , " Holiness unto the Lord . " * ( Zechariah 14:20-21 ) The place where I live must be wholly dedicated to God . Every item of goods or property that is under my control is hereby conveyed fully over into the hands of God to be used by him as he will and to be taken from my stewardship whenever the great Owner wishes , and it is not my business at all . <p> She whom I call my wife belongs forevermore to God . Use her as thou wilt and where thou wilt , and leave her with me , or take her from me , just as seemeth good to thee and to thy glory . Amen . <p> Levilla Modest , whom we love as a dear child , bestowed upon us by thy infinite goodness , is hereby returned to thee . If thou wilt leave us to care for her and teach her of her true Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by thy aid to make her profitable unto thee . But if thou deemest us unfit to properly rear her or wouldst have her in thy more immediate presence , behold , she is thine , take her . Amen and amen . <p> And now , great and merciful Father , thou to whom I belong , with all that pertains to me , and thou who art mine with all that pertains to thy fullness and richness , all this offering which I have made would be but foolishness and waste of time were it not for what I have in thee obtained to confirm the solemn contract . For were it not that thou art my God , my promises would be but idle words . I could fulfill nothing which my mouth has uttered and my pen has written . But since thou , Almighty , Omniscient , Omnipresent , and Eternal God , art mine , I have a thousandfold assurance that all shall be fulfilled through thy fullness . <p> My ignorance is fully supplied by thy own infinite wisdom . My utter weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by thy omnipotence , to thy everlasting praise . <p> Glory to thy holy name ! Though I have solemnly pledged all things to thee , yet , as thou art my " all and in all , " I have nothing to fear . Now , O Father ! my God and Savior , I humbly pray thee so to keep me that all my powers of soul , body , and spirit , my time , talents , will , influence , words , and works , shall continually , exclusively , and eternally glorify thy holy name through Jesus Christ , my Lord and Savior . Amen and amen . <p> In covenant with the God of all grace and mercy , who has become my salvation , my all , and whose I am forever , to the praise of his glory . Amen . <p> Entered into by the direction of the Holy Spirit and signed this Thirteenth day of December , in the year of our Lord Eighteen Hundred and Seventy-Seven . <p> Daniel Sidney Warner <p> I realized much strength by obeying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God seemed present as though I was making an agreement with a person whom I could see by my side . <p> Eve , Romans 12 . The Lord was there to make truth effectual , and after preaching succeeded in getting about all the members in the altar , and we had a solemn , heart-searching time . Then we had speaking meeting . I urged the brethren and sisters to confess what they felt to be their true condition and their wants . About all confessed : " I have an evil nature within me which I would like to get rid of if that can be . " " I confess I have sin in me . " " Have carnality yet in me . " Glory to God , this brought the Lord very near . My soul seemed in heaven . Everything seemed melting down before God and yielding to his constraining love and sinners were serious . <p> 16 . Sabbath . Preached on Hebrews . Had a talk with Brother William Fuller on sanctification . He was critical and talked for argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not obey for some time , wishing to show my regards for the young brother . I have learned , however , never again to disobey God out of deference to man . When God says cease an argument , the cause of holiness can only suffer by disobedience . I finally withdrew to the closet and confessed my disobedience to the Spirit . After coming out , Mr. W , a poor sinner , attacked me , using some insulting language . I read a little Scripture and left him . <p> Eve , read 1 Thessalonians and 1 John on perfect love . The Lords Spirit was there to melt hearts . Opposition began to give way . Brother Fuller , after meeting , confessed that his eyes were being opened to the truth ; hoped I would return . Brother Abraham Whitmire confessed his convictions that unless this community accepted holiness the cause of religion would greatly suffer here . Others with tears asked our prayers . Glory to God , good seed is sown here which will bring forth in the future . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move to Upper Sandusky , the home of the latters parents . They had received word that a holiness revival was desired in Findlay , where the seed had already been sown . On arriving at Upper Sandusky they found that they were already engaged for Findlay and were to go there the following Monday . Of their work in Findlay , in which they were assisted by Father and Mother Keller , a few selected notes from the diary will give a sufficient account . <p> 24 . Reached the Bethel in Findlay before preaching . Found that God was wondrously at work here . Twenty-three sanctified . Some of the old members fighting the work . The Lord blessed me in preaching full salvation . His power rested on the people and some came to the altar . Father and I went home with Father Sherick . He had been opposed to holiness but , thank God , he is now yielding and begins to confess his need of full salvation . He is eighty years old and probably fifty years a Christianbut has never grown out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth of Christ . Arose before daylight , as usual , and after my daily bath Father and I had a precious season of prayer and praises . Met at ten at the Bethel . Had a prayer and general experience meeting . The " little ones " testified straight and strong . Eve , house full . Was asked to preach again . Felt much straightened . The elders were to let us know about our having the Bethel for a holiness meeting , and it was expected that tonight the meeting should be conducted for sinners ; but last night God showed me after preaching that this must be a holiness meeting . So I was hedged up by the church on one side and God on the other . Tried to preach some time to sinners , but was absolutely abandoned to myself . Oh , how empty and hollow all I said ! I saw that this would not do , so I proceeded to full salvation for believers . Glory to God , I had some unction then , but felt the displeasure of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves at the altar . One soul sanctified . After meeting a very intelligent and pleasant sister came forward and said , " God gave me the wonderful Christmas gift of entire sanctification while you were preaching . " Glory to God forever ! We announced meetings in the future on the holiness line . <p> 26 . Up before the family , bathed and prayed . A.M. , wrote , occasionally talked holiness to persons coming in seeking light . All the city is in an uproar on holiness . Hallelujah ! At half-past two met at the Bethel . Brother Linsey led the meeting . Satan made a dreadful rally today . All the old cold members got in the back part of the house . Bro . Samuel Ferguson acted as spokesman for the devil . He set out in a raging storm . Called this work the judgment of the whore , the abomination that maketh desolate . Called God to rebuke it , to smite it in the mouth until the blood should fly out . He hollowed and stamped and foamed like a madman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in perfect peace . God gave me great peace , and I could but say thank God for the trial of his holy cause . I proceeded in a calm spirit to show the people some of Gods sacred truth that they were rejecting . Brother Wilson arose on the opposition side and asked some questions , threatening a call of the Standing Committee . May the Lord help him to seek the cleansing blood . <p> A young man , member of the church , by the name of Teams stepped out in the aisle and began to yell and stamp and walk to and fro . He consumed about fifteen minutes in silly harangue against perfect holiness by the blood of Christ . There was no reason , sense , Bible , or even apparent civilization in his aspersions . All the little ones were kept in perfect peace . Eve , Brother Updike preached his farewell sermon to the church . He felt so directed because of the recent abuses of his wife by some of the church and because of the wicked opposition of the leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this charge . The old and formal part of the church were aroused most furiously . I followed by some remarks . A few came out to seek purity . <p> 27 . Had meeting at 2 P.M. in the courthouse , whither we have moved because of the constant disturbance in the Bethel . Eve , tried to preach to a good congregation at the courthouse . The Lord was with us in sweet peace and power . We felt we were in a purer spiritual atmosphere . <p> 30 . Sabbath . Met at ten . Hebrews 13:20-21 . The Lord helped me to show the people that perfection is commanded and attained now ; what it is and is not ; that it is not attained in conversion , but by a second work . At 2.30 P.M. met in the courthouse in a temperance meeting . Brothers Linsey and Ackers both glorified God by testifying to their wonderful salvation from drink and tobacco , both having had delirium tremens several times . Brother A. called the tobacco habit a twin sister to strong drink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunkard . After they spoke , a Lutheran minister arose and deprecated the springing of tobacco in the meeting and palliated this abomination as consistent with perfect consecration to God and piety . Shame ! Shame ! <p> A brother asked concerning our holiness . So we bowed together and had a season of prayer , and as we afterward began to talk he constantly interrupted me , would not let me finish a point , or connect the Scripture proofs of the two works . We bowed again in prayer and he led . He asked God to purify his heart and take all the evil nature out of him . After arising I remarked that as he would interrupt all my efforts to give him instruction I would now ask him some questions and learn . I asked him what things we were allowed of God . Answer , " Such things as he promises . " Do you always pray for such only ? " Yes . " Do you receive them ? " Yes . " Then you have just now been sanctified , made pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you should hereafter not ask God to do what he has done ! But he contended that he should keep on making the same prayer . Brother Larcomb suggested the equal propriety of continuing to pray to God to convert him . Oh , what confusion and ignorance ! Still they thought we had gone astray . <p> 31 . A.M. , wrote . Eve , met at seven and continued the meeting until after twelve . The house was crowded , the isles standing full of people to the close of the meeting . Pretty good order for the throng . Brother Updike preached . After some altar work , we had good testimony meeting . I then preached a short discourse on Ephesians 4:22-24 . A few minutes before twelve the altar was again filled with seekers and little ones . I read the Christian consecration , and all said amen . The power of God came upon us . Many shouts . A Mother Goodwin , of the M. E. Church , was the subject of a wonderful work of grace tonight . For eighteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful death , turned perfectly white and shook like a leaf . She hesitated to believe through the temptation of unworthiness . I asked her if Christ was not worthy . Told her to believe for the glory of his name . Then she took hold . She soon fully overcame by the blood of the Lamb and the word of her testimony . It was a wonderful work wrought by the power of God in one of the most intelligent and pious ladies of Findlay , of about fifty years of age . She was filled with wonder at the great change and testified with a halo of glory beaming from her countenance . How can such a marked work be doubted ? What a reproach upon the ministry that this dear saint should be kept eighteen years in the wilderness longing for some Joshua to lead her over to the land of perfect rest of soul from all sin ! <p> January 1 , 1878 . Praise God for the mercies of the past year . I am so thankful that the old year witnessed the final death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time I enter upon the New Year all renewed in the image of God . Glory to his name in the highest ! I am redeemed and washed in the blood of the Lamb . O Canaan , sweet Canaan , surely here flows milk and honey ! God is my everlasting all , my satisfying portion . Oh , wonders of redeeming love ! Can it be that through the precious blood of Christ I have " entered into the holiest " * ( Hebrews 10:19 ) and am forever shut in with God , and dead to the world ! O God , I feel that I can stand in thy holy presence ! I tremble with awe and reverence . O my God and Redeemer ! Keep me on thine altar and in spotless purity lest I offend thy Holiness and die . I shall forever dwell with thee , and through the riches of thy boundless grace my whole being , every thought , word , feeling , emotion , appetite , desire , wish , purpose , and action , yea , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the flames of his love . Amen . Almighty , All-wise , and ever present God , fulfill this thy pleasure in me . I am in thy hands . Amen and amen . <p> A.M. , wrote some . Met at 10 A.M. and held meetings until 4 P.M. ; the power of God rested upon us . Four , I believe , were sanctified . The Lord gave me much light on the sanctuary as setting forth the different degrees of grace ( Hebrews 10:19 , 22 ) . In chapter 8 the apostle compares the sanctuary and the temple service with the present spiritual house or church . 9:9 shows that the former temple service was typical of the church , also 10:11 . Now , as the temple all through the Bible typifies the church , so also the tabernacle . We must make some application of its departments . This the apostle does for us . The court represents penitence or approach to the church , the sanctuary or " holy . " From this we have access into the " holiest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( v.22 ) have " their hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience . " * ( Hebrews 10:22 ) Were justified when they came into the holy , and now are invited into the holiest , not into heaven but into a state of purity through the blood of Christ . <p> Two were most gloriously sanctified , one an old mother over eighty years of age . Oh , how wonderfully God blessed her ! She ran around as spritely as a young girl . The house , as usual , was greatly crowded , the space on the floor about all occupied bystanders . The whole city is stirred . All the protracted efforts in the place are without interest . All the elements are attracted here . Sinners want this kind of religion that saves from all sin . Glory to God forever ! Some of the county officials , I presume , are getting uneasy , hence concluded that we could no longer have the pure courthouse . Received the promise of the Reform house , at least for the next evening . <p> 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctified , one of whom , a sister Miller , was converted to God from Catholicism last winter . They say her conversion was among the most bright of the 150 converts and her life has been true . Oh , how calm and clearly she came out ! Her testimony was sublime and more than human . It was spoken by the Spirit . Praise God ! Another meeting was held in East Findlay . The Lord was also there in power . A brother in the Church of God who had rashly denounced holiness was sanctified at this meeting . <p> Eve , the promised house was not opened . The little ones were scattered , each not knowing where to meet the rest , and yet we felt a great desire to be together . One company gathered and we went to a United Brethren Church . As we passed along , crowds gathered after us and asked where we were going to have meeting . The people were much disappointed . Brother Engle , the pastor , preached an earnest sermon to sinners from , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proverbs 13:15 ) I felt that the church was an iceberg between this sanctified preacher and the sinners . We all prayed fervently for the efficacy of the word . Some twelve arose for prayer , among the number was Sister Werts son , a very intelligent young man with whom I called today . When I asked him concerning his souls interests , he said that he did not " go much on religion . " I calmly replied that I presumed he had none to go on . I added that I did not go on religion either before I had any to go on . This was God-sent , and he knew not how to express himself again . I waited a few seconds then proposed prayer . We all kneeled and I presented him to the mercy of God . After holding his hand and giving him a few words I left him , praying to God to bring him down to the cross . Praise God , I saw him rise in the congregation . <p> Brother Linsey and I stayed up all night in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts a dreadful agony for souls and gave us an awful sight of the wicked apostasy of the churches . Like the old prophets , we groaned and cried to God for salvation to come out of Zion . <p> 27 . Sabbath . Met at the United Brethren Church . Good testimony meeting . One sister said , " I do not believe in a second work ; would as leave you would hit me in the face as to speak of it ; it is like a dart to my heart to hear it . " Just so the " pure testimony put forth in the Spirit cuts , " etc . Brother Engle read a very interesting chapter of United Brethren history showing the holiness revival in that church . Otterbein , Bishop Edwards , Wilson , and many others of the most eminent ministers professed and taught holiness as a distinct work . <p> At this point in his diary Brother Warner tells of his expulsion from the West Ohio Eldership , and gives the subject a special heading . <h> Trial and Expulsion from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Full Salvation ; for Following the Holy Spirit ; for Helping to Save Over 150 Souls in This Place <p> 30 . Standing Committee met in Findlay today . Principal business to attend to was charges preferred by Bro . G. W. Wilson against Bro . J. V. Updike and meagainst him for maladministration of the church here , deserting it , and turning church interests over to the Holiness Alliance , etc. ; against me for ( 1 ) transcending the restrictions of the Eldership , ( 2 ) violating rules of cooperation , ( 3 ) participating in dividing the church . <p> As to the first , it relates to an action of the body last Eldership in which I was prohibited from springing the holiness meeting on any church where they did not wish it . This charge was not sustained by a single proof . The facts are as follows : Father Keller was led by the Spirit to go to Findlay to procure a place for a holiness meeting . He found a meeting in progress in the Church of God , tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , but they refused . He then engaged the Reformed house , but left an offer still with the Church pf God to occupy their house if they concluded to let us have it . When we received word that the meeting was about to close we went up and found it still in progress , and as the holiness workers were there , we wished to begin a meeting on the holiness line . We gave the church the first offer to use their house , and they consented to our using the house . However , this I think they did because they knew that if we went to another house we would carry all the interests from their house . And when the whole counsel of God was presented they could not stand it , but gathered in the back end of the house with wicked men and fought the work of God , so that we soon saw that nothing could be done there , hence we removed to the courthouse . I had nothing at all to do with the appointment of the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keller and Brothers Ackers and Linsey had got the use of the house from the elders and trustees , or a majority of them . <p> Second charge , " Violation of rules of cooperation . " The rule cited was like this : No person shall go upon anothers field of labor to hold meetings , etc , without the consent of preacher and church . When we announced meeting at the courthouse , one of the elders announced preaching there at the Bethel the next night . Brother Wilson filled the pulpit and continued some four or five nights with no success and small congregations . Now , because I assisted in the meeting at the courthouse while these church services were continued in the same town , I am thus charged , when these meetings were really appointed after and in opposition to the real work of the Lord , where souls were daily being saved . <p> Third charge , " Dividing the church . " I showed that the only results of the holiness meeting were fifty-three sinners converted and 118 believers sanctified , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carnal and wicked opposition on the part of the rest of the church , just like the envious Jews stirred up the people at Thessalonica and Berea ( Acts 17 ) , and interrupted the apostles in their peaceable work of leading souls to Jesus , as well as disturbed the peace of the city . The apostles , of course , had to bear the blame , and like everywhere else they went , bonds and prisons awaited them ; and I , too , was ready to suffer affliction with the people of God for the sake of Christ . All Adam became aroused , so that I was stopped from reading other Scriptures . He had been reading and speaking from Isaiah 32:15 . When for the sake of the dear people calling themselves the Church of God I was studying how to compromise the two elements in the church here , the Lord gave me this text , and the Spirit led me to preach it straight , although it conflicted with what I had cherished , that is , a hope of fraternizing the sanctified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was adjusted by the Committee , the elders , and himself . They tried hard to bind him down to abandon holiness as a definite work and to have no communion with holiness workers . He agreed to some restrictions about preaching holiness where it was not wanted . Received his license and was placed on McComb circuit . Evidently they have some hopes of leading him to a recantation . May the mercy and grace of God keep him from coming down from the highway ! Brother Chambers was at our meeting in North Findlay this eve . <p> 31 . Was brought to the depot this morn in sled . Heavy snow falling . After I had been riding some time in the train with him in conversation , Brother Cassel , one of the Committee , seeing that I was not enough concerned to ask him what disposition they had made of my case , informed me that the Committee had decided that the charges were sustained , and that they had withheld my license.8 I thanked him for their decision and assured him , that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human standpoint and consider my attachment to the Church of God and her principles , I should regard their action a dreadful calamity and intolerable to bear ; but that I had now that charity which " believeth all things and endureth all things , " * ( 1 Corinthians 13:7 ) and therefore I calmly rested in the promise of God that " all things work together for good " * ( Romans 8:28 ) to me , and the sweet assurance that my dear Father , to whom I belonged , would turn this and everything else ( as long as I stay on the altar ) to my good and his glory . Praise his holy name ! Reached home about 2 P.M. <p> 8 : <p> This trouble came up at the Eldership meeting the following September . " The Warner case was indirectly revived when the Committee on Resolutions adopted the following : That any minister of this body that may presume to preach the dogma of a second work for sanctification shall be deemed unsound in the theology of the Church of God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this Eldership. " ( From Dr. Forneys History of the Churches of God . ) <p> Up to the time of leaving Findlay there were 53 converted , 118 believers sanctified , including about all the 53 converts . Many of them were sanctified at the next meeting after converted , and a few the same meeting . Glory to God for full salvation ! <p> Following the effort at Findlay , a series of holiness meetings was held at Upper Sandusky in the early part of February . Brother Dunbar and others assisted . On the 9th , Brother Warner was called to spend Sunday at Dunkirk , and was kept there for several days . While at Dunkirk he was impressed by the Spirit to announce that if any sick in the town would send for him he would go in faith to pray for them to recover . A sister who had been afflicted for years with catarrh in the head , which had spread to the throat and lungs so that she was consumptive , thought much about being healed . She had strong faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to prayer was gloriously healed , perfectly sound . Another , a blacksmith in Dunkirk , was impressed to go and pray for the healing of a young colored sister on the verge of death from consumption . She was wonderfully benefited , as for six weeks she had to be lifted from her bed , but now was able to arise and , assisted by the hand of a sister , walk across the floor . She had been able only to whisper , but now could sing praises to God . <p> Brother Warner felt that he should return to Upper Sandusky to assist in the meetings that were being held there . In a day or two after returning he was called back to Dunkirk to preach the funeral of the young colored sister . The brother who had prayed for her and a sister who had strong faith believed that God would raise the departed sister from the dead in answer to their prayers . Brother Warner announced the funeral for 10 A.M. , if the Lord did not direct matters otherwise . He prayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1 ) Christ aroused and inspired faith and admiration in the people by miracles , ( 2 ) the final commission teaches miracles , ( 3 ) they were the means of the success of the apostles , ( 4 ) the gift is set in the church . Hence , he concluded that miracles were to be a permanent factor in the system of salvation . He does not say that he was particularly impressed that God was going to work a miracle in this case . He rather fell in with the idea as urged by the sister who felt so impressed . At her home she and her husband and Brother Warner waited in prayer for some time , then went to the house where the corpse lay . The two brethren kneeled in prayer while the sister uncovered the body and commanded the departed to arise in the name of Jesus . Their faith for some time was wonderfully strong and they confidently expected to see her arise . They held on with unwavering faith for half an hour , when they all felt relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brother Warner preached the funeral the next day . He writes that this incident seemed only to increase their faith and that he believed that God was well pleased with the effort to exert this faith ; that if not through them , God would through some one else revive this element of apostolic power . <p> There was a report , intended to ridicule , and published by some who opposed Brother Warner , that he with others tried to bring a dead body to life by standing it on its feet and commanding it to walk , etc . This of course was untrue . <p> Remaining in Dunkirk for a few days , he held meetings which resulted in about twenty conversions . He found himself much attached to the brethren and sisters here . They had come out of the United Brethren and Methodist Episcopal denominations and had formed themselves into a Wesleyan body . Many of them , however , were not satisfied with a human church and creed and there was a strong tendency to come to the apostolic faith . Returning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company with Father and Mother Keller he visited the jail and prayed with the convicts . One of those , by name , John Bristol , was gloriously converted . Bristol said he did not care a cent to get out of jail so long as Jesus stayed with him . He had been badly abandoned , and had followed shows , drinking , balloon ascensions , etc . He once fell sixty feet from a balloon , breaking an arm , a leg , splitting a hip socket , etc . The sparing of his life was only by the mercy of God . <p> For the 7th of March 1878 we quote the following : <p> Fellowshipped some fourteen souls in the Church of God formed on a congregational basis , with holiness the principal foundation-stone . On the 3lst of last January the Lord showed me that holiness could never prosper upon sectarian soil encumbered by human creeds and party names , and he gave me a new commission to join holiness and all truth together and build up the apostolic church of the living God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In March an evangelistic effort was made in Tiffin , but with difficulty . The denominational houses seemed to be closed to holiness . A few meetings were held in a private house and in a rented room . He states that at this place Sister Warner was called to go to Mansfield to assist in a holiness meeting . This was a peculiar test and he thus speaks of it : <p> 23 . Sarah left today . The Lord tested our loyalty by requiring us to labor apart . At first I disbelieved that it was the order of God and was decidedly opposed to her going . So were Father and Mother Keller . I thought it would give place to the devil and hurt the sacred cause and endanger our domestic happiness . But this morn I arose early and consulted the Lord . I laid down all my understanding and the many seemingly plain reasons for her not going and besought God to direct the matter , and to my astonishment the Holy Spirit confirmed Sarahs call by reminding me of my solemn covenant with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altar and given her back to God to use her where and as he saw fit . At the same time all unwillingness vanished from my mind . In fact , a desire was at once created within me for her to go . <p> God , thy ways are not our ways , but we will walk in thy ways all the days of our life . Season sad . Here she is greatly needed ; there is a strong old hand . How would it look for me to work for God here and she whom the Lord had joined to me go elsewhere ? Were I at home , not at all in a meeting , then there could be no appearance of evil in her going . But , ah ! I now see there would then be no test , which is just the thing God intended . Abrahams faith would not have been half so much tried and proved had not Isaac been the heir of the promise . Father and Mother still strongly opposed her going , so that doubtless she would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God raised help in me . <p> On the 4th of April he received a letter from her stating that the meeting at Mansfield was excellent for the establishing and strengthening of Gods little ones , and that she had gone home . <p> During this time Brother Warner was getting much light on the Scriptures concerning holiness and was writing with the view of publishing a tract on the subject . The matter he was accumulating , however , proved to be enough for a book , which , as we shall see , was published two years later . Also , he speaks of an effort at this time to obtain more of the manifestation of God in his soul . <p> 25 . I set out this day to seek a more full and conscious manifestation of the Father , Son , and the Holy Ghost in my heart . Spent much time in the closet . Visited and prayed with a few families . <p> 30 . Prayed much for a more perfect , full , constant , and conscious manifestation of God in my soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to start to walk home to Nevada , twenty-two miles . I thought it was too hard a task with such muddy roads . How I wished for the means to send him home by railroad ! Recently , being without means to send a letter , I took it to the Lord , and before I had the letter written a kind sister gave me fifty cents . I had a quarter left and I thought of giving it to Brother Lee if others would make up the remainder . But then the tempter said , " You are dependent yourself and should not give to others that which the Lord has sent to meet your wants . " I took it to the Lord and the Spirit said , " Give , and it shall be given . " * ( Luke 6:38 ) I gave the quarter to Brother Lee . The dollar needed by him was soon made , and he was able to stay until this morn . Praise God , this morn a kind sister called and said the Lord had sent her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise and gave four-fold . <p> April 3 , 1878 . God is daily giving me more of his great fullness and conforming me more and more to his glorious Image . This is because I am earnestly endeavoring to consecrate more perfectly every moment of my time to him and because I spend more time with God alone in the closet . I have on several occasions besought God to conform me more perfectly to his nature , and without any particular emotions that might indicate the answer I claimed the desire of my heart and by faith thanked Father that he had granted my petitions . To the glory of God I can say that as I went on my way I found from hour to hour that as my faith was so was it meted out to me . Oh , how sweet it is to go to our heavenly Father for all our hearts and souls need , and in the name of Jesus ask for it rejoicing that we know we have the desire of our heart ! Surely " happy is that people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that people , whose God is the LORD . " * ( Psalm 144:15 ) <p> On his return to Upper Sandusky on April 9 he found some urgent calls to go to Indiana , and he felt that the Lord was in it . On Sunday the 14th , he conducted the services in Upper Sandusky . The theme in the evening was , Salvation from Church , using 1 Peter 1:18-19 and 2 Peter 1:3-4deliverance from all that is human and the reception of all that is of divine origin . <p> The Lord blessed me and greatly awakened my own mind , and I think opened the eyes of others to the importance of abandoning all human and party creeds , party names , party spirit , and party interests in order to maintain a life of perfect holiness , as well as to the duty of returning to the " faith once delivered unto the saints " * ( Jude 1:3 ) in its entirety . <p> It is interesting to note that at this time , coincident to his receiving the call to Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the printing press as a means of publishing the gospel truth he was so burdened to promulgate . <p> Recently I asked my heavenly Father to send means to meet our wants , pay debts , and as soon as I was ready to print my work on holiness , to furnish the means . I received gracious answers by the Spirit , and the following night while lying in meditation how I could better honor God in publishing full salvation , the Lord opened a new field for me . The Spirit suggested that my heavenly Father would provide me with a small hand printing press by means of which I could print my book myself and scatter many holiness tracts as leaves of salvation . <p> Praise God , today I received a most cheering letter from Elder W. W. Roberts , of Missouri . He is in the land of Canaan , and having seen my articles and the Standing Committees action in the Advocate he writes to encourage me in the good work ; and though he knows nothing of my circumstances he offers to furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is faithful and always heareth his poor and needy little ones that cry unto him . <p> Returning to Tiffin with his father-in-law , Keller , he found the little ones in good spirits . All testified definitely and boldly . He held three services there on the following Sunday . He found there had come to be a wonderful awakening in Tiffin among the denominational churches on the subject of perfect holiness . <p> On the 22nd he took train for New Washington , the place of his childhood home . Here seven years previous he labored alone in a revival that resulted in the salvation of about fifty souls . For one year they did well . A good house of worship was built and twice a week it was filled at prayer meetings that were very lively and interesting . But adversity came and there now remained but a small force of faithful ones to tell the story of salvation . Elder Oliver , who had preferred charges against him for the preaching of holiness , was in charge of the work here and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the flock , however , had received the experience . <p> At this place , through his brother Lewis , who lived in the vicinity , he learned that his father was very poorly and he at once became much burdened for his fathers soul . <p> May 5 , 1878 . Sabbath . Met about 10 A.M. All the little ones testified boldly in the Spirit to sanctification . Brother Oliver and wife were much annoyed at the same . Brother O. preached from Revelation 21:27 . A good text to enforce holiness , but alas , the time and opportunity were wasted in attacks upon the Lords work of full salvation . How my heart was grieved that the dear brother was not led by the Spirit of God ! What a favorable opportunity and text to set forth the necessity of holiness and the all-cleansing blood ! But alas , how few unsanctified preachers know what spirit they are of ! Oh , how little they value the worth of souls ! How indifferent to the solemn responsibilities of the ministry ! <p> 16 . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was accidentally shot dead with a revolver . He died in fifteen minutes , calling upon God for mercy . He was married one week ago today . Life is but a vapor . <p> On the 16th he left for Indiana . He reached Silver Lake , Kosciusko County , the next day and was met by Brother F. Krause and conveyed seven miles through a heavy rain to Beaver Dam . In spite of bad weather a fair congregation assembled that evening to hear him peach . About all manifested their desire for sanctification by rising to their feet . In his sermon on Sunday he identified the inheritance in sanctification with the promise made to Abraham . At the afternoon service about fifteen were at the altar seeking full salvation . <p> In this section of the country Brother Warner found many warm hearts . They had read his articles on holiness in The Church Advocate , and had doubtless heard of his rejection by the Ohio Eldership . He held meetings at Beaver Dam , Yellow Lake , and Silver Lake . His diary gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yellow Lake . <p> Sabbath . This day was put in for God . From my waking moments this morn I began to plead with God for the salvation of the people . Had gracious answers to prayer . Was sure God would save a number of souls . We had announced a fast all day , and meeting to begin at 10 A.M. and continue until 4 P.M. The house was filled . Had a lively testimony meeting . Preached on the tabernacle ( Hebrews ) . Several at the altar . But there seemed to be a dullness . None grasped the blessings . We had speaking meeting , but the interest seemed to be moderate . I was impressed that the dear little ones were hungry , and Satan said we had better close . But , glory to God , I knew that God would yet come and save souls , as he impressed me in morning , hence I held on to him . Preached a short discourse on faith and gave another invitation . Several came to the altar for sanctification and soon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sanctified . Some that were not at the altar received the blessing . The Holy Ghost filled the house , and there was great rejoicing . A fellowship meeting resulted from following the Spirit ; and as the dear ones went about shaking hands many , yea , about all in the house , were melted to tears . I gave another invitation and then friend Yocum came out , also Brother Bears daughter , and another young lady for sanctification . She soon received a glorious baptism , and Sister Bear was converted . Came home with Brother Bear . We did not get to close until nearly five oclock . Spent much of the time until eve on my knees . <p> Eve , house crowded . People were there from a distance of six and eight miles . I preached mainly to sinners . I had announced a few nights ago that I had an impression to preach to the unconverted , but I now see my mistake . I should have made no such announcement . The Spirit seemed to be baffled in giving me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have for a long time , was conscious that Christ Jesus was not preaching as much as usual . Thank the Lord for the lesson learned . Three at the altar . Brother Yocum was greatly smitten down by the Spirit ; all physical strength was gone . About 9:30 P.M. we dismissed the congregation , but Brother Y. would not leave the altar . Several of us stayed until after eleven . He was measurably blessed . He has been a very good moral , benevolent , and honorable man , and thought heretofore that he had but little sin and could easily get salvation when he once came for it ; but he found himself a great sinner under the searching light of the Spirit . <p> Glory to God for this days work ! It was a high day for my soul . Among the fourteen sanctified were two very fine young men by the name of Smith . They are brothers , both schoolteachers , and I pray that God will make them both very useful . <p> He found a widespread awakening for holiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual Eldership Meeting of the Church was at hand , and he asked the Lord whether he might not stay and attend the meetings instead of going to the Eldership . As there were others who could continue the meetings the Spirit seemed to relieve his mind of all burden for that place , and he felt it his duty to attend the Eldership . <p> June 1 , 1878 . Came home today . Found family well . At the General Eldership I found that the leaven of full salvation was working . Had many private talks . Found some in the experience , but rather mute . Strengthened them . Many spoke of my articles in the Advocate and said they were seeking light . But the Eldership possesses little of the power of godliness . The first night it made me mourn for Jerusalem . Here were assembled the best elements of the whole church , and yet I could feel no God in her . There was no spirit of devotion , no communion with God . Pride and nearly every other manifestation of carnality were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blessing of home and family . Dear Wife met me at the train . <p> 9 . Sabbath at Findlay . Awoke before day . Was much pressed in spirit for Brother Burchard . Arose early and had a gracious season of prayer . Was led out much for Brother B. At 10:30 A.M. heard him preach . A dreadful death reigned over the congregation . He spoke with a good deal of energy , according to his pathetic temperament , but he surely had not help by the Spirit . But I think he is honest , and if he had the cloud of prejudice removed from his mind he would want full salvation and would be useful . Oh , that God would lead him into the light ! <p> Feeling that he should visit his father , in Williams County , he took train for Bryan , Ohio , on the 10th , arriving there late in the evening . The account of the death of his father and of the events that followed are here given . <p> June 11 . Arose early . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodging , went to the bakers and got a loaf of graham bread , and started on my way . Got to ride about five miles and footed the rest . Reached Fathers about half-past ten . Found him very weak , and failing . He was overcome by emotion when I came in . His breathing is difficult . I soon sought a private room and poured out my heart for his salvation . Brother Joseph is staying with him all the time . Father can not last long . Oh that God would be pleased to have mercy upon his poor soul ! <p> 14 . Father still failing . <p> 15 . Brother Lewis reached here about 5 P.M. Eve , went to the Cogswell Schoolhouse to hear Bro . Henry Barckley , but he having gone from home did not appear . I was asked to improve the time . After prayer I began to look to the Lord for a message , but nothing came to hand . Soon young Brother Wallace came in . He came by request to fill the appointment . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indisposed to go ahead ; but I told him that I thought it was the order of the Lord . He consented . Did well enough , but needs the special unction of the Holy Ghost . I talked some . <p> 16 . Sabbath . L. W. Guiss came at four oclock this morning . Father failing very fast this morning . At 10:30 A.M. met a congregation at the Cogswell Schoolhouse . Hebrews 7:25 . God blessed his precious word . Mr. Guiss , my brother-in-law , who has become a bold infidel , was much affected by Gods truth . Some wept for clean hearts . I asked all who knew they were children of God to hold up their hands . A good number responded . I then asked all who could testify to perfect salvation from all sin to hold up their hands , but there was no response . But when I asked all who wished to be wholly the Lords to hold up their hands , a number responded , some with tears . Time would not permit altar exercise . <p> Took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declining very fast . Poor man , he is near his end , yet unsaved . O my God , must my poor father go into eternity bearing all the sins of his past life ! Oh , the death of an immortal soul ! Since God has converted my soul and called me into the ministry , I have often seen Fathers heart touched by divine truth and the Holy Spirit . Tears flowed freely , but he would not yield . When I began to preach , twelve years ago , I spent a summer at home , and he afterward told Mrs. Rang that my constant praying gave him much trouble and that he was glad I was gone . I marked the deep convictions that followed him all that summer and hoped he would soon be brought to God , but he wore them away . Two years ago this coming July my beloved mother passed away gloriously saved . She held his hand and exhorted him until he trembled . Not long after , I came home and spoke in the Dean Church , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to God , but again he refused Christ . Since his last illness , I have daily implored the mercy of God upon his poor soul . Since I have been with him I have talked to him about his soul , but do not see that he was awakened to his condition . I felt that all depended upon the blessed Holy Ghost to discover to him his sin and awful danger . He asked my prayers and songs of salvation . He shed tears over the wicked infidelity of G. , my brother-in-law ; but when he made any reference to his hope he based it all upon his principles of honesty and doing right , and that he had favored a good many persons in his life , etc . He confessed some misgivings of conscience for not having been confirmed in the Lutheran Church as he had promised his parents he would when married ; but said he , " I always felt some way that I could not get religion . " When conscious of much distress he would wish he might die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time , and when on a certain occasion his throat seemed to be closed against food , he said , " I just believe that it is my doom to lie here and waste away ; that there is nothing grown for me to eat any more . " Frequently he expressed a strong desire to get well ; but I never heard him say that if he did he would live a different life . <p> I went alone into the woods where so often I sought God and his grace when a young convert . I had a long and precious communion with God . Returned . Father is very rapidly approaching his end . He can not live through another night . Once while I was wetting his lips he looked very pitifully at me and said , " If you could only give me something that would make me well ! " <p> O my God , how hard it is to close a life that was not given to thee ! But " it is appointed unto men once to die , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Joseph feels this stroke very much . I thought it best not to go to the schoolhouse this eve . <p> 9:30 P.M. Father is gone . He passed off with no struggles or convulsions . His spirit has left the body . Probation is ended , and a lifeless corpse only remains . I sensibly feel the cords of love that bind my heart to my last earthly parent , but the gentle breathings of the Spirit of God seemed so graciously to sustain me that all was calm within . I felt a perfect loyalty to God and all his providence that so sweetly over all prevailed and gave me such perfect peace that I could not even weep . Oh , how tranquilizing to my soul was the deep assurance that God doeth all things well ! <p> 17 . Brother Joseph is almost down sick with sorrow and loss of rest . Poor father lies a corpse . Two brothers , L. W. Guiss , and I wore away the long , melancholy day as best we could . <p> 18 . Last night at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some gentlemen without that had a telegram for me . I arose and dressed , feeling a very calm peace keeping me . The Holy Spirit brought these words to me : " He shall not be afraid of evil tidings . " * ( Psalm 112:7 ) The following was the dispatch : " Come home , your child is very sick . L. W. Keller . " I came in , examined the papers and my railroad guide . Found that a train left Bryan at 8 A.M. that made connection at Toledo , bringing me to Upper Sandusky at 1 P.M. , but if I waited for a later train I should not reach home until late at night . What shall I do ? Here lay my father cold in death , to be buried this A.M. , and should I stay or not ? I had a season of communion with the Lord , and the Spirit seemed to say go . I took my usual morning bath , packed my valise , and started to my brother Josephs , bidding adieu to my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see no more until the heavens cease to be and the earth shall flee away before the approach of the great Judge of the human family . <p> I was conveyed to Bryan by David Warner , my nephew . Improved the time in meditation and prayer . I recalled the feeling that had rested upon me for some days , a deep solicitude for my family . Both on Sabbath and yesterday I went out into the woods where I used to seek the Lord when a convert and besought God to preserve my dear family . I also felt led to ask God to try us in any way he wished to . I felt the need of some trial of our faith and loyalty to God . <p> In my deep meditation and fervent prayer to God the time passed off swiftly with the fast gliding train , and at 1 P.M. we reached Upper Sandusky . Leaving my valise , I walked out at once and found the dear child very sick , having first taken down with a sick stomach and then with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and made an effort to embrace me with her loving little arms . Her sweet little lips could responsively receive a fathers kiss , but they were silent for want of sufficient strength to articulate . A good number of kind neighbors were in attendance , and I at once saw what was threatening the very life of the poor little sufferer . She was exquisitely fine in the texture of brain and her head measured nineteen inches in circumference around her forehead , and she had a very sensitive nervous temperament . Hence it was extremely important that the most perfect silence should be maintained in her presence , and with this strong nervous action , with any sickness or weakness , much talk and noise would necessarily draw the disease to the brain . I had her removed from the room where the family mostly stayed and everybody came in , to a more retired room ; demanded silence and forbade more than two at a time to be in the room . Sarah had seen the necessity of such regulations , but many dear good old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit around the lounge and talk , and not being in her own house she had not been able to enforce them . <p> 19 . Dear Levilla still low , but I had good hopes of her recovery . Spent as much time as I could with the Lord . Left all with him . <p> 20 . Dear child still dangerous , but we trust some better . <p> 21 . The doctor could see no improvement . <p> 22 . Wife and I thought Levilla better and still clung to the Lord for her life if it be his will to restore her ; but all others had given up hope . We thought it impossible that we should do without the company of this sweet little creature . <p> 23 . Sabbath . The doctor did not come as usual this morning . I presume from the report last eve he supposed she was dead ; but all day she seemed better . P.M. , sent for doctor . He thought she had some symptoms for the better , which raised our hopes . Eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep them away they would crowd around the dear child . She grew worse . She had had very light spasms all day but they did not seem to hurt her ; but now she began to fail fast . Phlegm began to accumulate in her little throat , making it difficult to breathe . <p> 24 . Toward morning the poor little sufferer was compelled to struggle hard to get her breath , and it became apparent that unless God miraculously interposed , her suffering must soon end in death . While we sorrowed for her suffering , we felt a calm and sweet resignation to the will of God , to whom the dear child belonged . We could say in truth , " Thy will be done . " * ( Matthew 26:42 ) At five oclock in the morning her redeemed spirit was freed from its earthly abode and taken away to be with Jesus and holy angels . <p> Now remained only the poor little emaciated body . As we recalled the large , active , plump , and rosy-checked Levilla , we could scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colorless form , " Is this Levilla ? Can it be that this is our child ? " Since my return I had anxiously cherished a hope that ere long I should hear those sweet lips utter words again ; but they are now silent in death , or rather the sweet and dreamless sleep that shall pass off when the Lord comes to call us forth from our earthly repose . <p> 25. Brother Leay conducted services . We looked for the last time upon our beloved child , whose sweet and innocent little form was robed in its little white dress and skirts , with a beautiful little bouquet of flowers protruding from her little hands folded upon her heart . As my dear wife was deeply afflicted with her departure , her sweet little face seemed to speak forth from its little white coffin and say , " Weep not , dear mother , for though your loss seems to be great , my gain is infinitely greater . I have gone to the better land , where sickness , sorrow , pain , and death never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only child in the Mission Cemetery at Upper Sandusky , near the road at the west side , between two evergreens . There with sad , yet resigned , hearts we left her to sleep beneath the angels care until called forth at the last day . <p> Levilla Modest was born March 18 , 1875 , near Seward , Nebraska . She passed from suffering to the society of angels June 24,1878 , and was therefore three years , three months , and six days of age . She was a child of more than ordinary mental ability . Her organic quality was the very finest . Her temperaments were sanguine and mental . Her brain measured nineteen inches . Though of such great nervous activity , we had by careful diet imparted to her a good , large physical structure . She measured three feet five inches . She was very knowing about all kinds of work , and ever eager to assist . For some months past she would stand upon a chair beside her mother and wipe knives , forks , spoons , saucers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do the most of her dressing and undressing , and never failed to hang up or put away every garment and everything she handled . She seemed to have very fine taste and perfect order . Her causality was wonderfully developed for a child . She daily astonished us with questions concerning everything she saw , and her remarkable ability to anticipate what next was wanted , and with what eagerness those little feet ran errands for mother and father , and grandmother and grandfather . Since eighteen months old she would sing parts of familiar tunes and hymns . I believe her first was " O Happy Day . " For some time past she would tread the organ with one foot , place her little fingers upon the keys , and sing loudly , " Hallelujah , T is Done ! " " I am washed in the blood of the Lamb , " etc . She had a remarkable tendency to imitate all that was pure and religious . She often had her little prayer meetings by herself , and would teach older children to engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attending an ordinance where she paid marked attention to the saints washing feet , the next day she called for a washbowl of water and washed her feet , then took off her mothers shoes and stockings and washed and wiped her feet and gave her a kiss . Every evening she kneeled at her mothers knee and said her little prayer . At the sight of the picture with raised hands she was sure to say . " Man lift up hands and praise the Lord . " In her sickness she would sometimes sigh out , " 0 , praise the Lord ! " She excelled all other peculiarities in the wonderful depth and fervency of her affections . Her love seemed to possess the purity and strength of one fully renewed in the image of God and yet the innocence and simplicity of a child . As she placed those precious little arms around our necks and gave the warm kiss , we could not help but feel that this was real and not mere childs play and those embraces were free for all who sought them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but still in the midst of all the Lord supports me and comforts . Though we can not understand this bereavement , yet God knows all about it and will doubtless bring our highest good and his own glory out of it . The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away . " Blessed is the name of the LORD . " * ( Job 1:21 ) <p> 26 , 27 . Spent the time largely in communing with God . Wrote some letters . <p> 29 . Wife and I drove to Tiffin . When about one mile from the city , our beast , that we thought very safe and quiet , began to make efforts to run off . I held her , when she began to kick desperately . I turned her to the side of the way and got her stopped . Before this I was out . I told Sarah to get out behind if she could . We had a top-buggy . The curtain was rolled up , but she could not get out . The beast was loose from the buggy all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , when she found that she was hurt . Some friends came up just then . I gave the mare to one to hold and I helped Sarah to the fence , where she sat upon a stone . We found that she had been hit upon both limbs . On one the mares hoof ( she had no shoes ) cut through linen duster , dress , skirt , and stocking , and cut a small wound to the bone . She had much pain . Three or four men kindly tendered all the help they could . They took us in a one-horse wagon to Tiffin , having fastened our buggy behind , and one led the mare . We came to Sister Lewis . A small congregation gathered and I preached a short discourse , of course on holiness . <p> July 2 , 1878 . Got a crutch for Sarah . She concluded that she could go home by railroad . Took her to the train and committed her to the care of the Lord . I drove the mare and buggy , trusting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Lord preserved me from harm . Found dear Wife had safely made the trip . <p> 4 . Spent much of the day picking berries all alone with the Lord . Meditated upon the goodness of Cod in continuing our national blessings . <p> 6 . Spent the day in prayer , meditation , and reading . Impressed with the duty of preaching against the enormous sin and galling yoke of sectarianism . <p> 7 . Sabbath . God helped me and blessed me in exposing the yokes of Satan by which Gods children are brought under bondage . <p> On the 12th of July 1878 , Brother Warner , accompanied by his wife , made a second trip to Indiana . He stopped in Goshen with Mr. Guiss , his brother-in-law , on the 18th . As the latter was a bold and reckless infidel , he did not enjoy his visit there . He felt that he was staying where the Savior was excluded and that he could be admitted only apart from him . <p> He reached Yellow Lake on the 20th , and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenings after he left in May . Several had been saved . On the 23rd his wife returned home to Ohio , while he went on to Auburn , to Brother Lowmans , whom he found firmly established in holiness . When he and Brother Lowman began to open their minds to each other he found that both had been impressed with the idea of together printing a holiness and church paper , Brother Warner to edit the former and Brother Lowman the latter department . <p> After discussing the publishing project with Lowman he returned to Ohio , to Wood County , where he held a number of meetings and assisted in a camp meeting near Rising Sun , and also attended a United Brethren camp meeting at Portage . He speaks thus of a manifestation in his meetings at Rising Sun : <p> August 22 , 1878 . Mr. Gay , a spiritualist , or rather a mesmerist who possesses a superior mind and is believed to be possessed by evil spirits , was present . He has attended for some time and has at different times attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last meetings his wife has been seeking sanctification , and he has made some good speeches in favor of the gospel . Today from the beginning of the meeting he began to maneuver his spiritism . He made many strange motions ; walked the floor once and tried to dance . It is probable that this was all involuntary on his part . But we all kept our minds on Jesus and God through the Holy Spirit to take care of him . He began to show signs of distress , got upon the floor , wept and cried out . A stronger power than the indwelling one had taken hold of him . His suffering became more intense . His wife brought him water and he drank some . She fanned him for a long time , and he became speechless and seemed nearly suffocated . <p> In September , Brother Warner attended the Ohio Holiness Camp Meeting held on the fairground at Marion . Of his experience there he records the following : <p> September 8 , 1878 . Sabbath . I began to fast on Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Lord came very near to me . Oh , how he let me down to nothingness ! I saw and felt ashamed of the trouble the Lord has had with me . I sank down into the dust before him , and instead of wondering why God did not give the greater measure of power that the Spirit impressed me I should have , I was led to wonder that he had entrusted me as much as he had . Oh , what shameful weakness and many errors were disclosed by the more perfect light that God has flashed into my soul ! O God , let me be buried deeper and more perfectly hid away with thee . <p> 12 . Came home . An incident in this camp meeting should be recorded to the glory of God . Brother Rudic took sick not long after he came here . After lying in camp a few days he was taken to Brother Kennedys . Prayers were being offered for him , still he grew worse . Last Saturday night he sent word to camp that after meeting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his recovery . They did so , and great power and strong assurance came upon them . They claimed the answer to their prayer , and some of the number were able to praise God for the brothers restoration just as if he had been raised up before their eyes . Sister Lea , who had taken violently sick that eve , was also taken to the Lord with much assurance . The next morn both were in camp perfectly healed . Brother R. suffered so much during the night and was so reduced that he thought he surely must die , and made some arrangements for his departure . But early in the morning he began to look to God once more , when his faith joined that of the party in the camp at eleven in the night , and he arose , instantly made whole . All glory to God ! <p> Following the part just quoted there is a gap in his diary until October 2 , the entry for which will explain . In this , one observes his humility , his deep self-examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , 1878 . Today I resume my pen again , with an earnest endeavor to record some of the mercies and blessings of God upon my poor soul . After I returned from camp meeting , the Lord saw fit in his tender love to suffer affliction to befall me . Yea , " I was brought low , and he helped me. " * ( Psalm 116:6 ) I had bilious remittent fever and an attack of hemorrhage of the lungs . Friends and even a physician were much alarmed and felt my work was done . As soon as taken down , I ordered cards sent to the " little ones " at different places to pray for me . I put my case in the hands of the Lord and wished only his will . Dear Wife was kept in great tranquility of mind through an unwavering faith in God that he would raise me up again . My rest in God was so deep and perfect that I hardly knew anything of my physical condition . I thought myself but slightly i 'll , when others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked only in a whisper , and when I began to recover I was astonished to find myself reduced to a mere frame and unable to stand . <p> During my afflictions , the Lord not only kept my mind in perfect peace , but also taught me many precious lessons of my littleness and his exalted greatness . Oh ! let us praise and magnify the name of the Lord . I saw myself but a speck of dust resting upon an invisible grain of sand . Oh , how the eye of God scrutinized my past life and showed me yet more than at the camp meeting my weakness and unworthiness ! Oh , how vile I had been in the sight of God ! How many times Satan had succeeded in resurrecting some self in me ! The Spirit has plainly shown me that I should never speak of having prayed for certain persons in connection with their conversion , etc . Oh ! I am so ashamed of my folly and weakness in often relating such things . I thought I was doing it all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was some self in it . O Lord ! save me in the future from such presumption and sin . I thank thee for this affliction , for I know it is all for the good of my soul . Thou hast also shown me that I have boasted too much of my health and ascribed it too generally to my knowledge of and prudence in observing natural laws . O God , forgive me of this offense . I thank thee that thou hast such a constant supervision over all thy works that every good must be ascribed to thee and thanks be given to thee just the same as if no means were used at all to convey them to us . Blessed God , let me sink down forever out of self . " I cried unto thee , and thou hast healed me . O LORD , thou hast brought up my soul from the grave : thou hast kept me alive , that I should not go down to the pit . Sing unto the LORD , O ye saints of his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * ( Psalm 30:2-4 ) ! <p> 3 . I have had a desire to attend the Northern Indiana Eldership , which convenes tomorrow eve . But Wife and friends all entreated that I should not venture from home in my present weak condition , so this morning I went to my study to write a letter to that body ; but before doing so I consulted the Lord , when he gave me a strong baptism of the Spirit to go , and a strong assurance that he would abundantly support me and strengthen me . I said : Lord , I will go in thy name . I firmly declared my intentions . Wife began to take the matter to the Lord and soon felt resigned . Oft through the day as I thought of going the Spirit would come upon me , and I increased in strength with wonderful rapidity . <p> On the morning of the 4th he was conveyed to town to take the train . The weather was unfavorable and there was some rain , but he felt he was carrying out the Lords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio , to Fort Wayne , Maryland , he had the company of Brothers S. Rice and C. E. Rowley , two prominent holiness evangelists . He reached Silver Lake in the evening and was conveyed to Beaver Dam , the place of the Eldership meeting . <h> Northern Indiana Eldership <p> The pagan system of Freemasonry began to make inroads in the body of Christians known as the Indiana Eldership of the Church of God . A storm of opposition arose from some who were of the more spiritual element of the Church when a number of the members became affiliated with the Masonic Lodge . It appears that the main body of the Eldership did not object to secret societies , and the result of the agitation was that a number of ministers who stood for the opposition and refused to fellowship Freemasons were expelled from the Eldership and were denied a renewal of their licenses . Others left the body of their own accord . In consequence a new Eldership was formed called the Northern Indiana Eldership . <p> Among those who constituted the original members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shock , C. Clem , E. B. Bell , B. F. Bear , I. W. Lowman , and J. W. Ray . The new body came into possession of most of the church property and the best churches . They appointed a Board of Publication , which took steps to begin publishing a paper devoted to the interests of the cause for which they stood . Accordingly there appeared in January 1878 , the first number of the Herald of Gospel Freedom , a monthly periodical published from Wolcottville , Indiana , at fifty cents a year . It stood for the promotion of gospel truth and freedom , opposition to all oath-bound secret societies , Freemasonry in particular , and loyalty to God and conformity to his Word . I. W. Lowman was editor . <p> At the Eldership meeting which convened at Beaver Dam on October 5 , 1878 , and which was the third annual session , Brother Warner was voted a member . In his diary for October 5 appears this account of the proceedings : <p> 5 . A good deal of time was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone through with in the various Elderships was dispensed with . All went off smoothly and with love . Not a grating word or discordant note in all that was said and done . No one was called to order ; no one was materially out of order . The manner in which business was done and the good degree of devotional spirit with which it was pervaded was a great stride from the carnal and formal wranglings of Elderships of the present to the simplicity and spirituality of an apostolic Eldership . Praise God , he is leading his children out into the glorious freedom of the gospel . <p> The most of the time was devoted to the publishing interests . A very important measure was enactedthat of enlarging the Herald , issuing it semi-monthly and devoting a part of it to the promotion of Bible holiness . Praise God for this glorious movement . It is wonderful how he is controlling things for his glory . Probably a large majority of the Eldership are not in the experience of full salvation , and of course some are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preachers . Brother Shock , one of the number , the present speaker , is probably our most talented man . But all glory to the name of God , he controlled all these elements so that Satan could not move one to open his mouth against this work of God , and this Eldership voted to support holiness as a second experience . Trusting in God , I can see glorious results from this project . It is bringing about what the Lord showed me last winter ; that is , a people straight before God in holiness and truth . By this blessed little organ God is going to bring the true church foundation and Bible truth into the hands of holiness people , and holiness doctrine into the hands of Church of God members , which must result in a divine union of truth and holiness . And this is just what is wanted to save the world . Holiness , the great lever of power , has since the Reformation been weakened and encumbered by party names and creeds and human traditions ; whereas the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless been without strength to accomplish her mission for the want of perfect holiness , the divinely appointed power to bring the world to God . <p> At this session of the Eldership , as Brother Warner says , special attention was given to the Elderships paper , the Herald of Gospel Freedom . During its first year it had been a 10 by 15 four-column folio . It was now increased in size to a five-column 13 by 20 . It was made a semi-monthly and its subscription price advanced to seventy-five cents . Lowman was reelected editor and publisher , and Brother Warner was elected associate editor to conduct a new holiness department . A number of special contributors were chosen . A music department , already established and conducted by Professor J. F. Kinsey , of Cincinnati , was to be continued . The best exchanges were secured , and with this prospect the paper started on its second year , 1879 . A portion of the prospectus for that year is here given . <h> Prospectus of The Herald for 1879 <p> This paper was started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eldership of the Church of God , a body of Christian workers who were raised up through the following circumstances : <p> Several ministers of the Church of God in Indiana through a scrupulous regard for truth and righteousness refused to fellowship men who were yoked together in the dark leagues of secrecy . For thus reproving the works of darkness their licenses were withheld . Accordingly through the providence of God and the force of circumstances they formed themselves together as an independent body , recognizing God as the founder of his own Church and all true Christians as her real membership . <p> The Bible is their only creed , and Christian character their only test of fellowship . <p> The labors of this little band have been signally blessed of God , and their members increased . <p> The Herald , all things considered , has been a decided success . At the recent session of the Eldership Elder I. W. Lowman was reelected Editor and Elder Warner was elected Associate Editor . <p> As heretofore , it shall be the aim of the Herald to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saints , " * ( Jude 1:3 ) not a part , but the whole faith of the gospel , ignoring the traditions of men , reproving the works of darkness and enforcing all the will of God . <p> It believes in raising men to the Bible standard of holy living by leading them into the Bible measure of grace . <p> It advocates a salvation that lifts men above the regions of mere duty and places them in such sweet and perfect harmony with God that they delight to do his will ; a salvation that constrains to every good work by the infinite power of perfect love , and not by the lash of the law . <p> Viewed from a human standpoint the Herald may appear to possess two separate features ; namely , that of an organ of the Church of God , and an advocate of holiness . But viewed from a pure Bible standpoint these distinct features naturally blend into one effort to restore and propagate the pure religion of the Bible . <p> Church signifies " called out . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the called out of God , or separated unto God . Holiness means the same thing ; that is , to be separated from all sin and wholly given up to God . <p> The editors of the Herald firmly believe that apostolic truths and Bible holiness can not be separated . <p> The work of holiness has been too long encumbered by human creeds and disintegrated parties among its friends . <p> Though holiness as a distinct experience is the most precious and important truth of the gospel , its wonderful triumphs have been much limited and rendered comparatively unstable for the want of being identified with all other Bible truths and divested of human systems . <p> Upon the other hand , the Church , ever accepting the only infallible and divinely authorized standard of discipline , and wearing the only church title that was " given by the mouth of the Lord , " is utterly disqualified to perform her appointed mission in bringing the world to God unless she be girded with the invincible power of perfect holiness and the full and distinct baptism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being the fullness of God in man , is almighty . The union of these divine forces , we believe , will make a complete conquest of this world for God . <p> To restore the divine plan in the harmonious action and the spread of these elements of salvation is the primary object of the Herald . <p> A part of the paper will therefore be devoted especially to that doctrine and experience of entire sanctification , to be conducted by the Associate Editor , the Editor-in-Chief being also fully in line with holiness definitely through the blood . <p> With an unshaken trust in God , and confiding in the integrity of our cause and the support of all lovers of truth and Christian purity , we begin Volume II of the Herald in the name of the Lord Jesus . <p> I. W. Lowman , Editor and Publisher . <p> D. S. Warner , Associate Editor . <p> An entry from the dairy , dated October 7 , contains an interesting item and will close this chapter . <p> As I arose this morning and approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father for some means , as I was entirely destitute , having been just able to pay my ticket fare here by the addition of a postage stamp , which through the kind providence of God I happened to have and the agent was kind enough to take . I came down , washed , and took my little morning walk for exercise and meditation , returned , and as soon as seated Father M. said , " I feel impressed that I should give this brother some money and I believe we all ought . " He handed me a half dollar and the several brethren all followed with half dollars and quarters . Glory , honor , thanks , and praises be unto God our Savior forever and ever Oh , bless the Lord , my soul , who supplieth all my needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus ! <h> Editor and Author <p> The difficulties and privations incident to Brother Warners years of faithfulness in the ministry , his persecutions on account of holiness culminating in his expulsion from the Ohio Eldership , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw him only closer to the Divine and thereby fitting him for greater responsibilities and usefulness . As we become acquainted with his career and the mission to which God had chosen him , we discern the hand of Providence leading him to his appointed field . <p> On his return to Upper Sandusky from Tiffin on April 9 , 1878 , he found some urgent calls to go to Indiana , and he said , " I think the Lord is in it ; expect to go next week . " At this time he became more fully awakened to the importance of abandoning all party names and creeds and returning to the " faith which was once delivered unto the saints " * ( Jude 1:3 ) in its entirety . At this time , also , he began to have some conception of the printing-press as an aid in publishing the truth . The manuscript for a tract on the subject of holiness , which he was writing , was growing to the proportions of a book , and he began to pray for means to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spirit , " as he says , and the following night while he was lying awake in meditation , the Lord opened up to him the new field of publishing holiness by means of the printing press . <p> Over the State line , in Wolcottville , Indiana , the Lord had prepared the opportunity . The little paper Herald of Gospel Freedom was in its first year , and its editor , I. W. Lowman , was favorable to holiness and had been impressed that Brother Warner should conduct a holiness department in the paper . The appointment was made at the Eldership meeting , as stated in our previous chapter . As usual when undertaking any responsibility , Brother Warner placed himself in entire dependence upon God . He thus speaks of the project : <p> Oh , that God may endue us both with grace and wisdom to discharge this solemn and important calling ! O my God , I cry unto thee for help ! I am sure thou hast put me under this solemn and responsible charge . Now thou must qualify thy poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to touch my heart and all my intellect and religious powers afresh with the Holy Ghost . Be thou thyself my qualification . I am so glad thou hast promised to be my wisdom . Oh , give me also thy mind . Be thou the fountain of all knowledge and goodness in me . Lord , I accept thee for my all . <p> His holiness articles contributed to The Church Advocate , the regular Church paper , had been effective and had won for him openings and warm hearts in various places . He possessed excellent gifts for writing as well as for speaking . His discourse was entertaining and instructive . He began his editorial duties in much physical weakness , as , it will be remembered , he was just recovering from a severe illness that laid low his naturally weak frame . <p> October 16 , 1878 . Feeling bad . Much fever . Called upon the Lord . Fasted most of the day . Applied water frequently to my head and back of my neck . Was compelled to do some writing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This greatly increased my fever and pain in the head . <p> 17 . Gathered some apples for myself . Feeling better . Praise the Lord ! <p> 18 . At twelve Brother Lowman and I started to Wolcottville . Undertook to me the enormous task of walking to Waterloo , a distance of three and one half miles . The roads were muddy . I soon felt that it was impossible for me to go through on my strength and began to look to God . I took him for my strength . All glory to God and the Lamb , when we reached the station I felt stronger than when we started . Lay over some time in Kendallville . Visited printing offices , as we are contemplating the purchase of press and type to run the Herald . <p> 19 . The Lord is opening the way for us to buy a whole printing office here very cheap . Praise his name ! <p> On the 24th he visited Rome City in view of finding a suitable place to reside . He felt directed to locate here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26th of November they moved to their new location . He bought the south half of lots 103 and 104 for $213 . <p> The entry for the new year , January 1 , 1879 , is of interest . <p> Since the last account , my time has been closely devoted to writing for the Herald and on my little book . This seems to have been the order of the Lord , and he has most wonderfully blessed me in the work . The Spirit is continually taking the things of Christ and showing them to me . Glory to God for the new beauties and blessed unfoldings of divine truth under the clear light of the anointing that " abideth " and " teacheth of all things . " * ( 1 John 2:17 ) The luminous heavens of revelation seen through the all-searching telescope of the Holy Ghost raise many texts that were but dim and of doubtful application to the definite purifying grace , to their true magnitude of absolute authority ; while one beautiful , blazing constellation of Bible truth after another is brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divine evidences of the " second grace " save the end of revelation itself ; and even there the Spirit takes up the eternal theme and writes it all over the soul , on the tablet of the heart and upon every fiber of our conscious being ; yea , writes it upon the " merchandise " of the saints all over the entire universe of Gods creation , on every surrounding object . Even " shall there be upon the bells of the horses , HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD . " * ( Zechariah 14:20 ) <p> We can begin to see the effects under God of " praising the beauty of holiness " * ( 2 Chronicles 20:21 ) in this place in our prayer and class meetings . Many express a hunger for full salvation , and as we frequently present our dear neighbors to God in prayer , the Spirit seems to indicate a glorious harvest of souls in this place in the near future . All glory to God ! <p> And now , my soul , another year of thy earthly career and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the first whole year of my life that I have dwelt in the Canaan of perfect love and sinless glory . All its events through God have indeed worked together for good to my soul . <p> 11 . Since last writing we have constantly shared the goodness of God . The time has been closely devoted to writing on my book and for the Herald . The Holy Spirit has greatly assisted . The weather has been very cold , as much as twenty-four degrees below zero . The first week of the new year was observed as a week of prayer . The weather being severe , but few attended our union prayer meeting . Last night in the name of Jesus we began a meeting here in the Methodist church-house on the line of holiness . <p> The book he speaks of was the Bible Proofs of the Second Work of Grace . It was printed and bound the next year , 1880 , at the E. U. Mennonite publishing house in Goshen . Two thousand copies were printed . It contained 493 pages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sanctification as a second work of grace as shown by the Scriptures . It was counted an excellent book by the holiness people and leaders , and doubtless accomplished much good . Copies of the book may yet be found in individual libraries . This was the first book of which Brother Warner was the author . He became the author of a number of publications afterward . <p> 27 . Closed meeting tonight . A few souls have found Christ a perfect Savior . The leading elements in the M. E. Church did not come near during the meeting . Some did all they could against it . The preacher in charge a week ago made a very brave defense of sin in the flesh , justifying rather than condemning it . Oh , the shameful clamor for sin ! The dead and godless condition of the Church ! Surely her glory has departed . Some who were longing for full salvation , when they saw the united influence of an apostate church arrayed against this very fundamental doctrine of their creed , were scared away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poor souls ! Having lost a good conscience they can not look me in the face ; and vainly they talk of growing the remaining sin out of the heart . Oh , that God would appoint salvation for this people ! <p> February 2 , 1879 . Have been very busy writing during the past week . Brother Lowman moved the press here last Thursday . Praise the Lord , He showed me by the Spirit that I should locate here , and that the press would be located in this place , when nothing had been thought or said about it . Oh , I am so glad the Lord does lead his little ones ! I can do much more for the paper now . Oh , that God would keep Brother Lowman and me straight on the line of holiness and continue to make the Herald a real herald of gospel freedom ! Our circulation is increasing , thank the Lord ! <p> 10 . It is wonderful how God takes care of his dependent little ones . When we came here , kind friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiness evangelistic work would not support us here , where we had no friends and acquaintances . But what a lesson our heavenly Father has taught us ! He has abundantly provided for us , even at home . I must record some of his kindness . <p> Fuel is rather scarce here , wood quite high , and the weather being quite severe I could not well see from whence we should be supplied . But as we do not walk by sight I trusted all in the hands of the Lord . We have a neighbor who is a very wicked man , but no loving children of God could be more kind and benevolent to us than the whole family are . They tell us by word and action that we shall not want for any good thing while they have it . Another very wicked young man had bought twelve acres of timber about three miles from town . The best timber and most of the nicest cordwood timber had been taken off . My kind neighbor asked him how much he would take for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I will give it to you for five dollars . " Neighbor and I had talked the matter over before and he agreed to take me in partnership if we could get the wood reasonable . He was true to this agreement , and we both have wood enough to do us for two or three years . <p> This is nothing else than the dealing of God . Oh , who would not trust thee , blessed Father of mercies ! Thou art all love and boundless goodness . But thou art also perfect wisdom , therefore will we trust thee when thy providence seems to be against our wishes and inimical to our happiness ; for we know that such can only be in appearance , because of our ignorance . Oh , we thank thee that we can rejoice in all thy righteous will ; for as thou art thyself love , nothing but love can proceed from thee . <p> 11 . Brother L. Spencer and Brother Kimmel brought me home , each bringing me a load of wood from my place of procuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as usual . Arrived at one oclock , and at two I was to preach the funeral of Miss Sigler . Poor girl , I visited and prayed with her last Saturday before leaving home . The family are not religious , the father is quite wicked and intemperate ; but Mary gave me satisfactory evidence that God had forgiven her sins . However , when about to die she was left in great distress of mind . Brother Newton , residing near by , was sent for ; he prayed for her . She obtained the victory and closed life in peace . <p> The temperance meeting that was in progress when I left continued with success until tonight . Over three hundred signed the pledge , and a permanent organization was effected . <p> 23 . Sabbath . A.M. , preached in Albion on faith . P.M. , led the holiness meeting and organized a holiness band of sixty-six members . Praise the Lord , they expect to work for the Master in spreading holiness . <p> On the 11th of March he and Elder Lowman drew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editors and publishers of the Herald and all other papers , books , etc. , issued from their office . Brother Warner was to pay Lowman $250 for a half interest in the paper and office . Both were to bear half the expense of publishing the Herald and any other publications . Both were to share equally in all the income of the office except the job work , which Lowman was to do with his own press and stock , and receive the proceeds . Brother Warner , however , was to realize fifteen per cent from all the job work he should procure . All manuscripts written by or donated to either party after the date of their agreement were to be jointly published and owned , and all manuscripts written by or donated to either party before the date of agreement were to yield to the owner ten per cent more than one half the proceeds . <p> From this time the diary entries are rather scattered , until finally they cease altogether . This is owing to the fact , doubtless , that the events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went largely into the paper as news items . <p> May 4 , 1879 . Sabbath . Went to hear Brother Allison , United Brethren minister . He requested me to talk . I did so , with great liberty and power of the Spirit . Brother A. , who had hitherto been an opposer of distinct holiness , was overwhelmed by the power of God and truth , and confessed that it was Bible doctrine . Another man , whose carnality was greatly stirred , turned pale , grew nervous , and finally interrupted me with questions and contradictions . Just then God sent an increased volume of sweet love to my heart . Glory to God ! Burning coals freely heaped upon his head , and soft words soon turned wrath away , and after meeting he humbly apologized . <p> 17 . Brother and Sister Shock brought me to Syracuse . Being late , Brothers Martin and Bell had left just a few moments before . Brother and Sister S. began to lament their disappointment . I began to praise God , for the Spirit seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . " I said I expected a glorious time by the way . They looked astonished that I was so free from complaint and regrets . They suggested that I should go by the cars . I remarked that the conductor would probably put me off , as I had no money . I praised the Lord that he would be my strength to walk . They looked the more strangely as I started off with praises to the Lord . I hope that God may convince them of the blessedness of the rest of faith . Walked about sixteen miles to Warsaw , and God did most wonderfully bless my soul by the way . Reached Warsaw about 3 P.M. , without fatigue or hunger . Called at Brother Barbers a few moments . Looked for a team that was going out south , but had to take the train , the Lord having told Brother Barber to give me fifty cents to pay fare . Brother Lowman was on the train . After reaching Silver Lake we had three miles more to walk to Gospel Hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even without food from early morning till late in the eve . <p> 18 . Sabbath . Brother Bear and many dear holy ones came from Yellow Lake and elsewhere . Glorious time in the Lord . P.M. , met at half-past two . I was urged again to lead the meeting . The Spirit of the Lord was wonderfully upon me ; anointed me to preach the acceptable year of the Lord . Hallelujah ! The deep prejudices began to give way ; opposition ceased ; God was triumphing . <p> Eve , Brother Lowman having the sore throat , Brother Martin not being well , and Brother Bear having left , I was much humbled before God in talking again to the people . I was brought low in the dust at the thought of being too prominent among the brethren in thus leading the meeting so much . <p> June 4 , 1879 . This is the fifth anniversary of our marriage . Took early train for home . Found dear Sarah quite i 'll ; may the Lord bless the precious object of my strongest earthly love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a horse and buggy and went out three miles and picked a fine lot of raspberries , and thus escaped the throng and rabble that filled our little picturesque city . Oh , how much more sweet and comfortable to get away with the Lord alone ! <p> 6 . Sabbath . At home . Unwell . The Lord sent a young man here today , that I might have something to do for Him . Some weeks ago I found the poor wayfarer at the lake , fishing . Having learned that he was a stranger and without money I brought him home for the night . He seems very teachable . I tried hard to get him to call upon the Lord and be saved . This is the second time he has been to see us , not having found us at home the former time . He is a very intelligent Swede . Has had some practice in type-setting , and has corresponded some for papers . <p> August 6 , 1879 . Came to Warsaw camp meeting . The Lord was at work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weaver , William Taylor and a host of preachers present . Rejoiced to form the acquaintance of Brothers Lambert , Krupp , and Low , of the New Mennonite Church . They are gloriously saved and definite for Jesus . We found a wonderful affinity in our hearts . If the Lord will , I shall attend their conference . I pray God we may become one fold . <p> The Lord did not have his way fully in this meeting . Too much looking to men . <p> September 3 , 1879 . Took train for Upper Sandusky . Found Wife and friends and many of the holiness workers already on the campground . <p> 10 . Meeting closed tonight . A mob of two or three hundred of the baser sort were let loose by Satan upon us . They threatened everything to Brother W. T. Ellis , against whom they were incensed by what appears to have been imprudent conduct of his own . We finally succeeded in escorting him through the surging , raging rabble to our quarters . Some eggs were fired upon us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His conduct is very rough . He is truly " a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth . " * ( Isaiah 41:15 ) Notwithstanding he provokes malice from the world and forfeits confidence of believers , he brings souls to God . <p> On Tuesday we had a faith meeting . Special faith and gifts of healing were considered . All who had infirmities which they believed the Lord desired them to be healed from presented themselves before the Lord , and several remarkable healings were performed . Sister Monnett , from Bucyrus , who walked upon crutches , was made whole , and used them no more . Another sister was healed by the Great Physician of a spinal affliction which she had had from her youth . The next day she was surprised to find that even the deformity had disappeared . Praise God ! <p> 22 . Came home via the Baltimore and Ohio . <p> 24 . Went out to the Mennonite conference in the Hawpatch , about nine miles from here . <p> 26 . Bade these beloved brethren farewell , feeling that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delegate to our Eldership . <p> 27 . Met beloved companion this eve at our Eldership at Yellow Lake Bethel , she having come directly from Ohio . <p> 29 . Sessions very pleasant , even spiritual . After leaving the house , very strange feelings came over me . I felt sure that the powers of darkness were about to make a desperate rally . We stayed up at Brother Bears and prayed until one oclock . I then lay down and took a short sleep , when the Spirit bade me arise and go out in the woods . Oh , what wrestling and agony of soul ! What burden of heart and cries unto God for the salvation of his cause in that lone place from about 4:30 till 6 A.M. ! Received some relief and victory . An evil spirit seemed to be upon the session from the opening this morning . The foreseen darkness was there . Business did not pass off so pleasantly . At noon I spent all the time shut up with God , and received great relief from the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and strange experience to my soul . Closed business at a late hour at night . The Eldership purchased the office from Brother Lowman and me . <p> October 1 , 1879 . Sarah started home this morning . I felt led to go to see the brethren in the Cook neighborhood and Warsaw concerning the formation of a State Holiness Alliance . <p> 14 . Received an urgent call to go to Wakarusa . Was led to go . Asked God for the means , and in less than one hour a gentleman came and summoned me to affirm a small matter before the court , which any of my neighbors could have done as well . <p> 21 . At Palestine . Quite a good turn out . Two quite zealous Christians who disbelieved the second work of gracea father and sonboth spoke . The first believed in sanctification as a gradual work after pardon and consummated at death . The latter testified that he received it in conversion . What incongruity in the two , but harmony in all who have the fullness ! <p> Eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many holy ones present to fill the Bible description of Gods holy army , moving out in every direction , setting the wilderness on fire , invading every city , casting down every wall , staying and burying Gog , beating the mountains fine , and blowing the mass of chaff from the Lords threshing-floor ( Ezekiel 38-39 ) . <p> 23 . Came home . Among the mail awaiting me was a card stating that obligations to the amount of $45 must be paid at once in Wolcottville . Blessed be the Lord , another letter contained the precise amount of $45 , that had been due me nearly a year from Nebraska . Glory to God , he supplies all our needs . How perfectly he meets all our wants ! <p> November 16 , 1879 . Sabbath . A glorious meeting was in progress at Churubusko . Brother Wood , the leader , had taken sick and the little ones were praying to the Lord to send someone to proclaim the word of the Lord . We heard of the meeting and at once were moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A good band of holiness witnesses and singers all had their eyes on the Lord to send a man to lead the host . Praise his name , he anointed me for the work and a glorious meeting ensued . Four or five fully saved . <p> 17 . This morning we found Brother Wood still quite sick . The doctor anticipated a severe attack of bilious pneumonia fever . We anointed him with oil and the Lord heard prayer in his behalf and raised him up at once . <p> 18 . Brother Wood quite well and able to work in the meetings . Held a special faith meeting today . Prayed for the restoration of the boy who is perfectly deaf . We were not at all discouraged , but felt it our duty to continue in prayer from day to day just as we often have to do with those seeking pardon and purification . <p> 19 . After our day meeting a brother and sister and I formed one of the visiting committees . When nearly sundown we found a poor , suffering " woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and blind for some time , and afflicted with much pain . We told her that Jesus could wash away her sins and heal and open her eyes . The Spirit soon brought on conviction and new-birth labors . She was gloriously converted , and giving a shout she sat down , and after a few seconds composure said , " Glory to God , I can see ! My eyes are healed ! " She then embraced her child and husband , whom she had not seen for about two weeks . She had lost all power to move her eyes , and they were both turned upward in her head . She was very weak , having eaten but little for days , and she sat with her hands over her eyes to exclude the light . Now she had the lamp lit and proceeded at once to get supper . All glory to the Great Physician ! Twenty-seven sanctified arose to join into a holiness band . Hallelujah ! God is mustering his host to the battle . <p> The accounts immediately following , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that he had not as yet gotten away from the idea of an external union in addition to that which the bonds of salvation alone can afford . He had already made a trip to Goshen , and had met Brother Lambert and others of the Mennonite faith . <p> December 5 , 1879 . Am pushing my book to completion . Today Sarah and I started for the joint meeting of our Standing Committee and the Mennonite Quarterly Conference at Hawpatch . <p> 6 . Drove eight miles this morning to the place of meeting . Was happy to meet with those beloved brethren once more . Had a joint convention . The subject of consolidation was warmly advocated from both sides , while our hearts glowed with the unifying glory of Jesus Christ . The following preamble and resolutions were adopted : <p> Whereas , the God of all grace has most emphatically taught us in his Word that his church is one as the Father and Son are one , and that a manifestation of this unity is to be the world-saving salt of the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God and members of the United Mennonite Church and the Church of God assembled in the name of Jesus Christ in a joint meeting , do confess it our duty to put away from us every accursed thing that might in the least distract , divide , and alienate us in heart , or cause divergency in practice ; and for the sake of securing an answer to the prayer of the adorable Savior , we do solemnly agree to abandon anything not warranted by the Word of God and accept any and everything it teaches . Therefore <p> I. Resolved , That we joyfully consent to the will of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and agree to unite in one body as soon as in the providence of God the consolidation can be consummated , and <p> II . Resolved , That we recognize the Word of God as the only true basis of Christian union . Furthermore , <p> III . Resolved , That we believe that the truth as it is in Christ Jesus is within our reach , hence , can be ascertained on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morally bound to learn and abide its decision . <p> 14 . At home . Preached at the Wesleyan house at 1 P.M. on faith in relation to gifts of the Spirit . In the evening at the United Brethren house on the philosophy of faith . <p> 16 . Though very stormy , quite a company of dear brethren and young men turned out to chop and haul me wood . Oh , the goodness of God ! <p> January 1 , 1880 . Last night after a very successful and powerful meeting at Chambers Schoolhouse we came to the watch meeting at Albion . The Spirit greatly moved us to come . On reaching the house I dropped on my knees , when the Spirit gave me a searching message for the people . We kept up until after twelve . The old year passed away while we were on our knees in solemn consecration to God . <p> This is the last quotation which we make from his diary . By the first of the year he was given full charge of the Herald , and any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papers which he was editing . Unfortunately , from January 4 , 1880 , the date of the last entry in his diary , until the issue of the Herald for November 7 , 1880 , is a gap over which we must bridge with silence , as I have no access to any copy of the Herald for that year other than the one mentioned , nor have I been supplied with information from any other source covering that period . In it is also announced that the following resolution was passed . " Resolved , That we are willing to consolidate the Herald with any other paper that advocates the same gospel principles . " <p> In the number of the Herald referred to is printed the decision of the Board of Publication to make the following announcement : " Edited in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ , by D. S. Warner , Rome City , Indiana . Dedicated to the God of the Bible and to the service of all saints who desire to love God with a pure heart fervently , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> From his book Bible Proofs we have drawn material for our next chapter . <h> A Spiritual Shaking <p> In his book Bible Proofs of the Second Work of Grace , Brother Warner devotes three chapters to the prophetic description of the great work of restoration in the latter times , when , through the preaching of holiness and the upholding of the full Scriptural standard of truth , God should bring His people into unity again . This chapter is intended as an abridgment of the three chapters referred to . <p> I wish to say by way of introduction that many of the events in the history of ancient Israel are figures of and have their counterpart in things occurring in the Christian dispensation . And many of the utterances of the prophets , associated primarily with the events of those times , have their fulfillment as well in connection with the things foreshadowed . To regard these prophetic writings as referring only and finally to the literal affairs of the people of the Old Testament is to stop far short of their intention and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was full of types and figures of things to be realized in the latter . Everything pointed forward in anticipation of the fullness of times when God should establish His new and better covenant with His people . Shall we say then that the prophecies did not share this anticipationthat they had to do only with the literal figures ? Nay , it was the spirit of prophesy more than anything else that foretold of the times of the gospel dispensation , not only by direct reference , but also in many of those passages which touched first those immediate affairs in Israels career and through them those greater things farther on . We note how the New Testament writers picked up the Old Testament prophecies and applied them , with such reference as " that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , " or , " as it is written , " etc . <p> But let us not suppose that the applications of prophecy were to be confined to the days of Christ and the apostles . Many things were said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more important fulfillment in Christ or in the establishment of the church , but there were other utterances that had their final import in the later affairs of the New Testament kingdom . Those that cluster about the captivity of Israel in Babylon and their reestablishment in their own land and the rebuilding of Jerusalem are especially rich in secondary application to the corresponding crises in the history of the church . <p> It is thus that many of the prophecies have a twofold application , not that they mean two different things , but that they apply to both the literal and spiritual phases of the same thing . A sufficient proof of this lies in the fact that in the Revelation , where their spiritual meaning is assumed , we find the same Old Testament figures . There is unity of purpose in Gods system of types and figures and in His plan throughout , and hence many of the prophecies that pertained in the first place to events in the history of Israel are used by the Spirit today in connection with the antitypes of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God by some particular institution unfolds His plan , or in which there is involved the divine approach to man , whether for approval or for judgment , are attended more or less by violent manifestations in the earth or the elements . Thus on the occasion of the giving of the law at Mount Sinai the mountain shook and smoked and there were thunders and lightnings , and the people trembled . At the crucifixion of Christ , the central event in all history , the sun hid his face and the earth shook , the rocks were rent and graves were opened . The Pentecostal outpouring of the Holy Spirit was with the sound of " a rushing mighty wind . " * ( Acts 2:2 ) When the apostolic church prayed for the special endowment of divine power , " the place was shaken where they were assembled together , and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost . " * ( Acts 4:31 ) When the imprisoned Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises to God , the divine response came with a great earthquake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors , and loosed everyones bands . On the day of final judgment the very earth will be moved out of her place and the elements will manifest the awful day of God . <p> The shaking of things , as accompanying the divine visitation , is also taken in the spiritual , or figurative , phase , and it is this application of the idea of shaking as used in the Scripture that Brother Warner employs in reference to the great spiritual movement of these latter times . As a key to the prophecies on this subject he uses Hebrews 12:25-29 , which reads him that speaketh from heaven : Whose voice then shook the earth : but now he hath promised , saying , Yet once more I shake not the earth only , but with reverence and godly fear : For our God is a consuming fire . " * ( Hebrews 12:25-29 ) <p> We have here two distinct shakings . The first one , according to the apostles words beginning with verse 18 , plainly refers to the manifestation at Sinai when the first covenant was given to Israel ( Exodus 19 ) . The second shaking attends the voice which in this dispensation speaks from heaven . The former was a literal shaking , while the latter is of course spiritual , and attends the establishment of the new covenant . " See that ye refuse not him that speaketh " is in the present tense to this dispensation and is an injunction for us . <p> Now , the new covenant involves the very highest standard of relation between God and His people , a standard much superior to that of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God being written in our hearts and comprehends our perfect obedience to them . In this relation we become His people and He our God in the very closest sense ( Hebrews 8:10 ; 10:16 ) . This relation is none other than entire sanctification , which to attain requires the complete crucifixion of the self-life , the destruction of every idol , and entire abandonment to God . It is a close-girding covenant and admits of no sin either in practice or in the heart . The words " yet once more " refer to the shaking as final and to the standard of truth as being perfect , ne plus ultra , and as therefore consisting only of things unshakable . <p> It is the voice calling to this holiness standard of the new covenant that produces the mighty shaking , causing both earth and heaven to tremble . Whenever this voice is heard , whether in the beginning of Christianity or in a movement that effects the reestablishment of the new covenant in the hearts of Gods people today , the shaking occurs . Both sinners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he who would obey the divine appeal must suffer the shaking loose and consequent loss of all things contrary to the divine will , however dear they may be in the selfish affections . God has through grace made it possible for one and all to measure to this standard , so that for him who refuses the voice that speaks thus from high heaven there is positively no escape . <p> Our quotation from Hebrews leads us back to the prophet Haggai , whose words in chapter 2 , verse 6 , are what the apostle doubtless refers to . This introduces us to that field of prophecies relating to the captivity and the return , so typical of the apostasy and of the final restoration of the true church in these last days . It should not be a thing incredible that the great spiritual events of these epoch-making times should be in accordance with prophetic utterance , nor that the Holy Spirit should lead Brother Warner , as he testifies to having been led , into these things as prophetic truth . Indeed the reader , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised to find the Holy Spirit confirming to his own mind that these things have a prophetic illumination . Brother Warners reference to these prophesies , and his comments , are here given . Of Hebrews 12:25-29 he thus speaks : <p> On the 30th of August 1879 , the Holy Spirit in a special manner gave me the foregoing scripture . I had never clearly comprehended its meaning and I felt impressed that the Lord was about to lead me into a new vein of truth . I shut myself up with God and the Bible , when " the Comforter , which is the Holy Ghost , " * ( John 14:26 ) took most of the things that are contained in what follows and showed them to me . Being fully assured that my mind had been led into the pure light of truth , we published it from the pulpit , much to the edification of the holy brethren . We feel confident that the following chain of Scriptures , correlative with our text , will conduct every meek and candid reader into the same light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foregoing words of the inspired apostle a key to the prophetic description of the great work of holiness . <p> Let us examine the same declaration elsewhere in the Holy Book . " According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt , so my spirit remaineth among you : fear ye not . For thus saith the and the dry land ; and I will shake all nations , and the desire of all nations shall come : and I will fill this house with glory , saith the Lord of hosts . " * ( Haggai 2:5-7 ) The rebuilding of the temple is the subject under consideration . This ancient abode of the great Shekinah was such a marked figure of the church of God that it is seldom spoken of by the holy seers but what the spirit of prophecy flashes forth in interspersed references to the " spiritual house . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house shall be greater than of the former , saith the Lord of hosts : and in this place will I give peace , saith the Lord of hosts . " * ( Haggai 2:9 ) Is it not in the midst of His church where God speaks peace to thousands who seek His face ? Let us also thank God for the gracious intimation that the glory of the restored , latter-day church shall exceed that which preceded the dark-age captivity . <p> It is quite evident that the words in verses 5-7 were in the mind of the apostle when he wrote the words of our text . And we find here additional evidence that the " once more shaking " relates to the triumphs of the gospel , because it is associated with the coming of Christ , not as Judge , but the " desire or Savior of all nations . " <p> God never designed that we should <p> " Roam through weary years Of inbred sin and doubts and fears , A bleak and toilsome wilderness . " <p> If you have not passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man " of sin , to the Canaan rest , it is because you have either ignorantly or willfully " refused him that speaketh , " * ( Hebrews 12:25 ) and " entered not in because of unbelief . " * ( Hebrews 4:6 ) <p> " I will fill this house with glory . " Here is the glory that Christ gives : " The Spirit of glory and of God , " * ( 1 Peter 4:14 ) that fills and rests upon the church when inbred sin and all weights are shaken out . What is here associated with the " once more " shaking corresponds with entire sanctification . <p> The prophet Ezekiel gives us a very interesting chain of concurring prophecy . Who with his spiritual eyes open can fail to see the application of the 34th chapter of Ezekiel to the ministry , in general , of this age ? They " eat up the good pasture " * ( Ezekiel 34:18 ) fare sumptuously on fat salaries . " Ye tread down the residue of your pastures " * ( Ezekiel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " * ( Ezekiel 34:18 ) They are the real cause of spiritual famine instead of the means of refreshing the flock . " Ye eat the fat , and ye clothe you with the wool . " * ( Ezekiel 34:3 ) Make a lucrative merchandise of your Christless sermons , instead of administering the free gospel of salvation . " Ye kill them that are fed : but ye feed not the flock . " * ( Ezekiel 34:3 ) When any find their way to the true Shepherd and receive food , life , and holy fire in their souls , they annoy the dead and sleeping , who proceed at once to kill them . This is no idle fancy . It is an undeniable fact that in most of our present-day churches a real convert can scarcely maintain spiritual life . The few that are not killed are usually driven or thrown out . O ye shepherds , a crisis from the Almighty is coming upon you . As the Lord liveth , the fires from heaven shall sweep away your craft . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourselves in the ashes , ye principal of the flock : for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished . " * ( Jeremiah 25:34 ) Their time of feasting upon and dispersing the Lords flock will come to an end . <p> " I will deliver my flock from their mouth , " * ( Ezekiel 34:10 ) and " they shall no more be a prey . " * ( Ezekiel 34:22 ) " I will seek out my sheep , and will deliver them out of all places sectarian divisions where they have been scattered into several hundred parties in the cloudy and dark day . " * ( Ezekiel 34:12 ) We talk of the dark age as in the past ; but the seer of God declares that we are yet under its lingering fogs , and shall be until holy fire from heaven shall sweep away every partition-wall , human creed , and party name , and purge out that infamous god , the sectarian spirit ; the vile " image of jealousy " * ( Ezekiel 8:3,5 ) which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I will bring them out from the people , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them to their own land , and feed them . " * ( Ezekiel 34:13 ) Yea , " I will feed them in a good pasture , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be . " * ( Ezekiel 34:18 ) " And I will set up one shepherd over them , and he shall feed them , even my servant David ChristDavid was already dead four hundred years ; he shall feed them , and shall be their shepherd . " * ( Ezekiel 34:23 ) <p> The perfect reign of the Messiah , and His love in the soul , is to succeed the dark day of party confusion . The two are not compatible with each other . " And I will make with them a covenant of peace . " * ( Ezekiel 34:25 ) Their own land , and this covenant-union with God , is simply entire sanctification . See Jeremiah 23 . <p> In Ezekiel 35 we have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in the typical sense to denote the Catholic power . <p> It was inhabited by the Edomites , the descendants of Esau , who were therefore brothers with Israel , the descendants of Jacob ; but the Edomites had a deep-rooted and perpetual enmity against Israel , they harassed and distressed them by all possible means . ( See Adam Clarke . ) " Behold , O mount Seir , I am against thee , and I will stretch out mine hand against thee , and I will make thee most desolate . Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred , and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity , in the time that their iniquity had an end . " * ( Ezekiel 35:3-5 ) Does not this look like the record of the " beast that sits upon the seven hills " ? Martyrdom , it appears , is confined to such times when Gods people have reached an " end of sin . " <p> As the spirit of prophecy uses mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caucasian mountains Gog and Magog , see Bible dictionary to represent sectism in chapters 38 and 39 , so in chapter 36:1 the " mountains of Israel " are used to represent the true conscientious Christians . The Lord says , " Set thy face against Gog , the land of Magog and prophesy against him " * ( Ezekiel 38:2 ) ; but in reference to the mountains of Israel , the order is changed to " prophesy unto , " showing that the former were rejected , but the latter accepted of the Lord ; to these very precious promises are made . In the latter part of the chapter we have associated together salvation " from all uncleannesses , " * ( Ezekiel 36:29 ) the gift of the Holy Spirit , and " bringing into the land , " * ( Ezekiel 37:12 ) i.e. , the land of perfect holiness . <p> The spirit of prophecy now takes up another figure to set forth the holiness crisis , and the glorious effect in those that " abide the day " * ( Malachi 3:2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man , take thee one stick , and write upon it , For Judah , and for the children of Israel , his companions : then take another stick , and write upon it , For Joseph , the stick of Ephraim , and for all the house of Israel his companions : and join them one to another into one stick ; and they shall become one in thine hand . And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee , saying , Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these ? Say unto them , Thus saith stick of Judah , and make them one stick , and they shall be one in mine hand . " * ( Ezekiel 37:16-19 ) <p> Who does not know that this never was really fulfilled in the alienated sects of Jacobs literal seed ? While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of the reign of Christ , it was specially designed to typify the return of the church to God and the mount of holy union after the " falling away " * ( 2 Thessalonians 2:3 ) or " cloudy and dark day . " * ( Ezekiel 34:12 ) The figure does not properly suggest the formation of a new church state , hut the gathering again of a divided and starved-out church under the pastorate of corrupt and self-aggrandizing shepherds . " I will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land I will save them out of all their dwelling-places , wherein they have sinned , and will cleanse them , so shall they be my people and I will be their God . And David Christ , the root and offspring of David* ( Revelation 22:16 ) my servant shall be king over them ; and they all shall have one shepherd . " * ( Ezekiel 37:21-24 ) Nothing but entire sanctification can unite the saints under the direct control and headship of Christ , through the Comforter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have given unto Jacob my servant , wherein your fathers in the day of the churchs purity have dwelt ; and they shall dwell therein , even they , and their children , and their childrens children forever : and my servant David shall be their prince even Christ , for him hath God exalted to be a Prince and a Savior forever . Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them . And the heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel , when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forevermore. " * ( Ezekiel 37:25-28 ) Here is the solution of the whole matter . The reception of the Spirit , uniting into one , placing in the land , cleansing , and the " covenant of peace " under the glorious reign of the " Prince of peace , " * ( Isaiah 9:6 ) is all summed up and consummated in the sanctification of the church through the indwelling of the Holy Trinity . <p> Instead of exterminating the idols and " Canaanites in the house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the " shepherds of Israel " * ( Ezekiel 34:2 ) have catered to their unholy lusts . They have so long submitted to the world in the church , so long fawned and pampered sin under the cloak of religion , that a terrible conflict ensues whenever it is attacked by the sword of the Spirit . This crisis is described in the two following chapters , namely , Ezekiel 38 , and prophesy against him , and say , Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold , I am against thee , O Gog. " * ( Ezekiel 38:2-3 ) The Bible dictionary applies Gog and Magog to the Caucasian mountains , a chain that extends from the Black Sea to the Caspian . The Scythians of those regions were a fierce and warlike people . For many years they had made their name a terror to the whole Eastern world . They were finally conquered and driven out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ezekiels prophesy . These events being fresh in the mind of the ancient seer , the prophetic spirit employs Gog and Magog to represent the acrid and intolerable spirit of sectarianism and its final overthrow . <p> Meshech and Tubal , allies of Gog , are noticed in history as " the remotest and rudest nations of the world . " David , it is probable , spoke prophetically of the same contentious , unsanctified zeal : " Woe is me , that I sojourn in Meshech . My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace . I am for peace , but when I speak , they are for war . " * ( Psalm 120:5-7 ) <p> In applying the army of Gog and Magog to the false , deceived , and sectarian forces , the enemies of the Lords true and holy church , I am clearly sustained in Revelation 20:8-10 , where they are declared to have been deceived by the devil , therefore have a spurious religion-are professors .

" * ( Ezekiel 38:18-19 ) When the sword of the Almighty is unsheathed against self-righteous orthodox sinners , there is soon war in the camp , and a general commotion in the heavens and the earth . The two-edged sword of definite testimony is now wielded in every church , which has never been the case in any of the past holiness reforms . Amen !

Therefore it is the special work of sanctification , and the heavens and the earth are now shaken by the tread of Gods holy army , who are " severed out to continual employment , passing through the land to cleanse it . " * ( Ezekiel 39:14 ) <p> Let us now begin the gospel of God ? And if the righteous scarcely be saved , where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear ? " Here is a trying ordeal , a judgmental shaking of the church parallel with that described in Hebrews . It is the execution of Christs verdict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time is come . " Scriptures thus introduced almost invariably refer to some previous prediction . In the prophecies of Isaiah we find what is doubtless the antecedent of Peters words : " I will turn my hand upon thee , and purely purge away thy dross , and take away all thy tin afterwards thou shalt be called , The city of righteousness , the faithful city . Zion shall be redeemed with judgment , and her converts with righteousness . " * ( Isaiah 1:25-27 ) <p> The judgment of Zion , the house of God , is her full redemption . It is the hand of the Almighty " purely purging away the dross and all the tin " from His church , that it might be called " The city of righteousness . " This experience is not for the sinner , nor is it confined to the aged and dying ; but the " converts " in Zion , saith the Lord , shall be redeemed from sin , by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning . This purging is parallel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious i.e. , sanctified and cleansed , a glorious church* ( Ephesians 5:26-27 ) , and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel have escaped the corruption that is in the world* ( 2 Peter 1:4 ) . And it shall come to pass , that he that is left in Zion , and he that remaineth in Jerusalem , shall be called holy , even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem : when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion , and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment , and by the spirit of burning . " * ( Isaiah 4:2-4 ) This explains the words of Peter very clearly ; the judgment of the house of God is a divine washing and purging . The church , having passed through the spirit of judgment and of burning , all that are left therein " shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of Peter as having reference to the sin-consuming flames of the Sanctifier , the baptism of the Holy Ghost , which corresponds with the shaking of the church , of which Paul speaks in Hebrews ; for he concludes by saying , " Our God is a consuming fire . " * ( Hebrews 12:29 ) <p> If ever there was a time when Peters words were pertinent , it is now . The hand of the Almighty is upon His church , and He will smite and humble it with His judgments ; shake it with His voice from heaven , and consume it with the flames of His Spirit until every foul spirit is driven out and all the " works of the devil " * ( 1 John 3:8 ) destroyed ; that nothing may remain but the pure , unalloyed elements of the divine kingdom , " which can not be shaken . " * ( Hebrews 12:27 ) No wonder the churches so often fear and dread the coming of Gods holy bands ; yea , " a fire devoureth before them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting houses and every other place where the sects can defeat their access . It is because they know that they are but a collection of ecclesiastical stubble , which can not abide the fire which accompanies the Lords army of definite witnesses . Here we also see that the charge that insisting upon the definite experience of entire sanctification destroys the churches is true only so far as they are composed of " wood , hay , and stubble . " * ( ) Fire never destroys gold and silver . <p> In Joel we have the declaration : " The Lord also shall roar out of Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem the holy church ; and the heavens and the earth shall shake . " * ( Joel 3:16 ) A church that has no voice to shake sinners and professors , no voice that " turns the world upside down , " * ( Acts 17:6 ) that makes not the wicked flee , the devil howl , and persecution ragethat church may have " gods many , " * ( 1 Corinthians 8:5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for , following the foregoing the prophet says : " So shall ye know that I am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion , my holy mountain : then shall Jerusalem be holy , and there shall no strangers pass through her any more . " * ( Joel 3:17 ) The Lord wants His church so holy that no stranger to God will pass through her , much less dwell and carry on business in her . <p> Let us now trace the heaven- and earth-shaking hosts of the Almighty in the prophet Isaiah . " Cry out and shout , thou inhabitant of Zion : for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee . " * ( Isaiah 12:6 ) Here is the power that does the shaking . A church that has the great and Holy One in her midst always produces a commotion in the world . <p> But who are required to do these things ? Thus saith the Lord , " I have commanded my sanctified ones , I have also called my mighty ones for mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " * ( Isaiah 13:3 ) The sanctified soul rejoices only in the exaltation and glory of God ; there is no principle left in the heart that seeks self-aggrandizement . They even glory in being abased , if God is thereby honored . Glory to His name ! <p> Now observe the effect of lifting high the banner of holiness : " The noise of a multitude in the mountains , like as of a great people ; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together : the Lord of Hosts mustereth the host of the battle . " * ( Isaiah 13:4 ) A commotion soon follows the definite testimony and " lifting up of holy hands in the sanctuary " ( Psalm 134:2 ) of the Lord : an army springs into existence ; God Himself mustereth the host . Hallelujah ! <p> " Howl ye ; for the day of the Lord is at hand ; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty . Therefore shall all hands be faint , and every mans heart shall melt . Behold , thereof out of it . " * ( Isaiah 13:6-7,9 ) This conflagration from the Almighty sweeps , with a besom of destruction , all sinners from the landout of the church . If , therefore , the holiness movement lays waste some churches in its course , it is simply because they are composed , in general , of sinners . This fact also proves that it is the very crisis we are here tracing in the Bible . It does not destroy true Christians nor spiritual churches ; but , of the terrible . " * ( Isaiah 13:11 ) <h> Separation of the Wheat and Chaff <p> The great war for the extermination of sin out of the heart , or sinners out of the church is destined to sweep over all the nations of the earth . " The isles saw it , and feared ; the ends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " * ( Isaiah 41:5 ) Thus saith the Lord : " Fear not , thou worm Jacob , and ye men of Israel ; I will help thee , saith the Lord , and thy redeemer , the Holy One of Israel . " * ( Isaiah 41:14 ) When sin and self are all destroyed there is barely enough left of Jacob to constitute a small worm . But by thus reducing her to " naught , " God has prepared the church to exhibit His power in shaking the heavens and the earth and bringing " to nought the things that are " * ( 1 Corinthians 1:28 ) the great things of the world . <p> " Behold , I will make thee a new sharp threshing-instrument having teeth : thou shalt thresh the mountains , and beat them small , and shalt make the hills as chaff . Thou shalt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the whirlwind shall scatter them : and thou shalt rejoice in the Lord , and shalt glory in the Holy One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gods church here portrayed is nearly lost sight of at present . People think it is the business of the church to stand like a beggar at the door of the devils kingdom and politely coax his subjects over ; saying much about the duty and advantage of belonging to church and little about their sin and the duty of repentance , as though God were dependent , and the devil proprietor of the universe . Satan , having thus stolen the spikes out of the churchher power of executionhas distinguished himself in helping to run the empty machinery . But he that sitteth in the heavens will arise and bring to naught Satans devices . <p> " The time is seen coming , by the prophets foretold , When Zion in purity the world shall behold ; When Jesus pure testimony will gain the day Denomination selfishness vanish away .

But spikes are not the only essential to a first-class thresher . Anciently grain was threshed with flails or trodden out by cattle and horses . Then a great improvement was secured by the invention of what is called the " old open machine . " But , oh , the heaps of chaff that piled up , and filled the entire floor ! Then came the dreadful task of cleaning upof separating and removing the worthless heap . <p> Such have been the crafty open machines that have for years imposed heaps of trash upon the Lords threshing floor . They have not taken " forth the precious from the vile . " * profane , neither have they showed difference between the unclean and the clean . " * ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your words when ye say , Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord , and he delighteth in them . " * ( Malachi 2:17 ) <p> Is not this perfectly fulfilled at present by preachers who invite sinners into their folds without requiring a particle of saving grace , and who even flatter them that they are already pretty good and need but to come and join the church ? And how many of their poor , deluded victims remain in the church for years and never hear the gospel preached straight enough to convict them of their unregenerated hearts ! The policy of these teachers has been to " gather of all kinds , " but the next thing in orderto separate and " cast the bad away " * ( Matthew 13:48 ) has been wholly omitted . But as the Lord liveth , He is going to clear away this ecclesiastical rubbish . <p> " Whose fan is in his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ * ( Matthew 3:12 ) Who would accept as a gift a few bushels of wheat scattered through a great heap of chaff and dirt ? And think you that God will accept the church in her present condition ? No , indeed ; the gold must first be separated from the dross . The bride must dissolve her unholy friendship with the world , in which she is guilty of spiritual adultery in the sight of God ( James 4:4 ) . She must put away all her rival gods , and adorn herself in robes of spotless white , before prepared as a bride for her husband . The Bible most assuredly teaches that God will separate the chaff from the wheat before He comes to garner home His church . To accomplish this He is converting Jacob from an open machine to a separator . <p> When the " rushing mighty wind " * ( Acts 2:2 ) from heaven strikes the gathered heaps of stubble and chaff and begins to " scatter them , " * ( Isaiah 41:16 ) people think the church is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord Jesus , and it will not carry a grain of wheat off His floor , and why fret about that which is not meet for the Masters use ? " What is the chaff to the wheat ? saith the LORD . " * ( Jeremiah 23:28 ) Let the wind from heaven drive it , and the fire consume it , " and thou even in this scatterment shalt rejoice in the Lord , and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel . " * ( Isaiah 41:16 ) <p> In Micah 4:1-2 , we have the mountain of the house of the Lord ( the church ) established , and the law going " forth of Zion , and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem . " In the 10th verse we have recorded the captivity , or " falling away " of the church " Thou shalt go even to Babylon . " And , in order to restore her purity , the Lord commands the following severe measures in verse thirteen : " Arise and thresh , O daughter of Zion : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make thy hoofs brass : and thou shalt beat in pieces many people : and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord , and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth . " * ( Micah 4:13 ) <p> Threshing and separating , purging and consuming is the order of God , in the day of the Refiner . Many think we must so temper the gospel as to preserve peace in the church , notwithstanding her sin and idols . But , " Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth peace with sin ? I tell you , Nay ; but rather division . " * ( Luke 12:51 ) So answers the Lord . His " fan is in his hand , " * ( Matthew 3:12 ; Luke 3:17 ) and he would rather blow the church to atoms and secure a little clean wheat by itself than see it prosper in peace and multitudes and under mortgage to Satan , and bearing his brand mark , i.e. , spots of sin . For this purpose , says Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth ; and what will I , if it be already kindled ? But I have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am I straightened till it be accomplished ! " * ( Luke 12:49-50 ) Jesus intimates that the work of refining the church with the Holy Ghost fire could not begin until He Himself had passed through the ordeal of suffering and death . <p> " For , behold , the Lord will come with fire , and with his chariots like a whirlwind , to render his anger with fury , and his rebuke with flames of fire . For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh : and the slain of the Lord shall be many . " * ( Isaiah 66:15-16 ) Here is the fire , sword , and division that Christ came to send on earth . Its shaking and purifying power was first manifest on the day of Pentecost . This light makes Israel see her condition and cry out , " My leanness , my leanness , woe unto me ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord in the fires , even , the name of the Lord God of Israel in the isles of the sea . " * ( Isaiah 24:15 ) " When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people , there shall be as a shaking of an olive tree , and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done . " * ( Isaiah 24:13 ) " And it shall come to pass , that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit . " * ( Isaiah 24:18 ) There is no escape from the sweeping fire of holiness but into the pit of sin ; and all that can not " abide his coming " * ( Malachi 3:2 ) are " like chaff which the wind driveth away . " * ( Psalm 1:4 ) <p> But nowhere in the Bible is the line more clearly drawn between the wheat and the chaff , the gold and the dross , than in our keynote text to this entire subject . What shall remain after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Nothing but the divine elements of the " kingdom which can not be moved , " * ( Hebrews 12:28 ) and which Paul represents as " righteousness , and peace , and joy in the Holy Ghost . " * ( Romans 14:17 ) These only remain in the heart that has passed through the crisis . Hallelujah ! But what is thereby removed ? Answer : all " things that are shaken " and that " are made . " * ( Hebrews 12:27 ) By the first class we understand everything that flinches and shakes before the searching light and sin-exterminating gospel of Christ ; every vein of our nature , every motion of " flesh and spirit , " * ( 2 Corinthians 7:1 ) every temper of the mind and habit in life that does not perfectly harmonize with the " righteousness of God revealed " * ( Romans 1:17 ) in the Bible , will naturally shake beneath the voice of the Holy One , and must , therefore , be removed . The second classall " things that are made " denotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our moral being that is not implanted by the hand of God . Or , in other words , everything adhering to us that was produced by Satan , sin , or the perversion of our moral being . As the Lord says , " Every plant , which my heavenly Father hath not planted , shall be rooted up . " * ( Matthew 15:13 ) This includes inbred sin . We have all along assumed the existence of this besetting foe . Yet we are aware that a very few deny the fact . But we think David settles this matter in Psalm 51 , where he declares that , as fallen creatures , our very being is " conceived " and " shapen " in the mold of sin and iniquity . Paul also avers that we are " by nature the children of wrath " * ( Ephesians 2:3 ) ; and that we are " cut out of the olive tree Adamic root which is wild by nature . " * ( Romans 11:24 ) <p> But why multiply texts ? Observation must necessarily teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the knowledge of right and wrong is developed . Justified Christians almost uniformly confess this same inward trouble . The remaining question is , can we get rid of it in this life ? To decide this , we have but to ascertain whether it is original , or the result of the fall . That it formed no part of the likeness of God in the soul is very certain . It is therefore the " works of the devil , " and just what Christ " came to destroy . " * ( 1 John 3:8 ) It shakes , flashes out and roils up when pierced by the sword of the Lord , and must , therefore , be removed from the soul . <p> But the words of Paul apply to the church , as well as to the individual . It is designed to assay and remove the dross of the whole body of Christ . Before the great holiness reform had shed its benign influence upon the Christian world , and to some extent raised the church out of the narrow rut of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unselfish love for humanity , the idea of getting saved from " your church " would have been regarded as blasphemy . But , thanks to the Lord ! a purer light and higher standard of truth now compel the trumpeters of God all along the line of holiness to insist on salvation from all " our churches . " But it may be asked , " What is it that we must be saved from in our churches ? " Surely there must be some way to discriminate between that which is pernicious and that which is of God . Now , I know of no corner from which to run off this line but the one that Paul points out : " Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid , " * ( 1 Corinthians 3:11 of things that are made . " * ( Hebrews 12:27 ) God has founded one bodyone church , fold , or kingdom . In it He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its prosperity , and its perpetuity . His wisdom has adapted it to all ages of time and conditions of men . Its faith was delivered to the saints once for all . Its principles and precepts are the last testament , the final and immutable will of the eternal God . This divine organization is invested with such absolute symmetry and perfection that to attempt the slightest modification of its divine unity or polity is wicked presumption in the sight of its divine Founder , and incurs the curses and forfeits all the blessings of Gods Holy Book . Now , since the work of entire sanctification is designed to elevate the church to her normal and perfect condition in the sight of God , it must shake out and purge away every existing element that was not originally implanted by the hand of the Lord . This test , I think , is one in which all true Christians agree . Indeed , if we were to untie from this moorage we should soon be driven to sea without compass or chart we should virtually open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Starting , then , from this corner-stone of divine truth , established at Jerusalem nearly nineteen hundred years ago , and with the Bible as our compass and field notes , let us run off a line . <p> 1 . Between the true and false spirits in the churchlet us " try the spirits whether they are of God . " * ( 1 John 4:1 ) " Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ , he is none of his . " * ( Romans 8:9 ) But the party spirit , so prevalent in the churches , is not of Christ , hence must be removed , purged out of the heart . A zeal that springs from anything but pure , unmixed love for God and humanity , a spirit that would even promote holiness , or the conversion of sinners , partly to build up " our church , " is badly mixed , is soon shaken and can not survive the Refiners fire . It is only when the " eye is single " that the " whole body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly sanctified . <p> A spirit which , out of deference to its own creed , willfully disobeys the divine word , is not of God , and can not coexist with a pure heart . All these secondary motives , these mixed and unclean spirits , " shake " at the voice of the " mighty God , " and are " removed " in the thorough work of entire sanctification . <p> 2 . The next thing I am compelled in the fear of God to speak of , as included in the catalog of the devils shaky works , the foul grime and chaff of error , is the evil of sectarianism . This is the most destructive bane that God has ever suffered the devil to sow in His kingdom . It is the very mildew of hell , that spreads its blasting curse over nearly all the precious fruit of the Lords vineyard . Here the words of Paul are an all-sweeping besom ( Isaiah 14:23 ) . <p> Oft the enlightened Christians conscience inquires whether it is right for the church to be divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their respective human creeds and party names . In the light of truth we are compelled to answer , No . And for the simple reason that these parties are not of divine origin . Christ is the source of all true union among His disciples , and all divisions between them and the world ; while the devil is the instigation of divisions in the church , and of all union between it and the world . <p> I quote the following from an editorial in the Christian Harvester . <p> " God has a church on earth . It is one and indivisible . It is made up of all and singular who are born of the Spirit . <p> " Individual ( local ) churches , or congregations , are as Scriptural as they are necessary . <p> " There is not one word in the Bible favorable to denominations or sects . The only sect among Christians that is spoken of in termsthe Nicolaitanis severely condemned . There are indications of sectish belief , against which John is supposed to labor in the first chapter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in a brother apostle . Denominations are directly or indirectly the result of sin remaining in the great body of professors . Thorough and widespread holiness would soon destroy denominations . <p> " But the evangelical denominations of today contain the mass of true Christians , with a multitude of mere professors . Because of differences sects can not yet be abolished ; and an effort at abolition would result in a new one . Therefore sects are a present necessity , until holiness more generally prevails . <p> " The possessor of perfect love of necessity overleaps denominations in spirit , and so regards all the sanctified as perfectly his brethren . " <p> We are personally acquainted with the editor of the Harvester , and believe him a holy man of God . We admire the frankness with which he acknowledges that " there is not one word in the Bible favorable to denominations or sects , " and that " denominations are directly or indirectly the result of sin remaining in the great body of professors . " <p> Such must be the honest verdict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant thing , we know , to look upon and admit this monster evil , this fell destroyer of the purity , love , and power of the Lords Zion . Says William Starr , " My heart has groaned as , pen in hand , I have looked at this subject , arranged my thoughts to present them to you . " But for the love of truth I am constrained to differ with the position that sects are a present necessity . They originated from sin in the church ; and shall we admit that the fruit of sin is a necessity under any circumstances ? " Shall we do evil that good may come ? God forbid . " Where the causesin in the churchis removed by full salvation , should not its effects also disappear ? But it is thought that " because of differences sects can not yet be abolished . " We might say , with equal propriety , because of sects differences can not be removed . They coexist and mutually support each other . These divergent views , and party shibboleths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are stereotyped and perpetuated by sectarian parties and their man-made creeds . Therefore we have no more right to palliate the sin of sects because of differences , than to excuse the latter because of the former . One of the great evils of sectarian divisions is , they prevent the return of the church to the " faith once delivered to the saints " * ( Jude 1:3 ) and shall we let the baneful tree stand until it ceases to bear its legitimate fruit ? <p> Again , it is thought that " sects are a necessity until holiness more generally prevails . " " Thorough and widespread holiness would soon destroy denominations . " Sects and holiness are antagonistic to each other . This truth is clearly implied in the above remarks . The fire of true holiness burns up all the fences that Satan has placed between the saints . And shall we defeat this its real mission , by not lifting up the sword of the Lord against sects , and attempt to abolish the evil , until holiness prevails more extensively ? That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on unholiness until holiness gains a certain degree of ascendancy . Yea , it provides that we should give place to the devil in the church to destroy holiness , until the church becomes more holy . These are no trifling words . It is a solemn fact that adherence in different denominations is the devils wedge , whereby the unity of the Spirit , so perfectly procured in the grace of prefect love , is again destroyed . Party names , party creeds , and party spirits almost of necessity go together ; and the natural return of this spirit , because of membership in a fragmentary church , takes more souls off of Gods altar than do everything else together . <p> Let sects alone until holiness prevails ! What a device of the enemy ! How can we expect to bring forth permanent fruits into holiness , if we allow the plowshare of Gods truth to slip over this fallow ground of sin ? Sects are the devils " high places " in the land , the groves of his own planting , and gods that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . " How many of the kings Jehovah complains of because they did not , like Josiah , " purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places , and the groves " * ( 2 Chronicles 34:3 ) ! Beware that we partake not of their sins . Of Azariah it is said that " he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD save that the high places were not removed . And the LORD smote the king Azariah so that he was a leper unto the day of his death . " * ( 2 Kings 15:3-5 ) <p> It would seem as if no man could read these words of the great apostle without vividly seeing that party divisions among the people of Christ were , in his view , a most astounding evil . " Is Christ divided , " * ( 1 Corinthians 1:13 ) he says , that ye who are all His , and who have been baptized " by one Spirit " * ( 1 Corinthians 12:13 ) should be sundered one from the other by party names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , he beseeches them by an appeal the most sacred that words could utter , even by the name of Christ , as it were for His sake , and for His bleeding cause , to forsake these pernicious ways , and to be perfectly joined together in the same mind . <p> Hear what this author thinks of promoting holiness over these " high places , " or sect walls . <p> The divisions of the Christian church , as they now exist , are a prominent cause of the low state of piety among believers ; the greatest single obstacle which now exists to the spread and triumph of our religion in the world . <p> The moment you separate the church of Christ into distinct divisions , you set up the idol of party . Success or adversity will no longer affect the mind simply as they touch the cause of Christ , but they will be felt , also , as affecting " our side , " or " our church . " It is not Christ and His cause to which their whole thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now been set up , and it claims , and receives , part of their regard . The man , I think , is almost more than human that can wholly avoid this influence , at least after he has been long identified with any branch of the church . It is an influence which is all the time at work . The idol has been set up to divide the heart from the blessed Savior and His holy service ; and its influence is as ceaseless as the existence of the cause . And this party feeling is , as we have seen , the essence of all sin , so that sinful desire is blended continually in the heart with its love to Christ , and pollutes the worship which it offers Him . <p> This is an honest and faithful description of this monster evil . The party feeling is very sin . Yea , says this God-fearing man , <p> It casts a millstone round the neck of those who are struggling upwards to the image of their Redeemer . It mingles poison with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , and casts a blight upon its budding fruit . <p> Again : <p> Sectarianism is the greatest foe to the exhibition of love which God has ever suffered Satan to beget . It hinders brotherly love among Christians , and regard for the souls of men . It is vain for brethren in Christ to talk about the duty of loving one another , and to try to feel love for one another , while they refuse to act as love dictates by separating into parties . Their actions will control their hearts , as mens acts always do in the end . The fences which they set up between them in fact will become fences in feeling . And that is now even so , every Christian knows . The divisions of Christs people beget and stimulate continually that opposite spirit of rivalry and contention , which is the spirit of the world . Yes , I charge all this mischief , the existence of which you all know , upon the sectarian divisions of the people of Christ ; and let him deny it who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The division of the church into parties not only destroys the power and holiness thereof , but is the greatest impediment to the conversion of the world to God . Again we will hear Brother Starr , and the blessed Redeemer Himself : <p> Would that the church of Christ might pause long enough from its sectarian strife to hear the voice of its Redeemer and Lord pleading with God in prayer on that sorrowful night , as we are . Neither pray I for these alone , but for them also which shall believe on me may be one in us ; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. " * ( John 17:11-21 ) The prayers of Christ were not offered for a light matter , least of all that memorable petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all ages to wonder and weep over , the prayer of its dying Lord . The desirableness of that visible union of His people for which Christ prayed as the means of impressing His truth on the world , and the evils of those divisions against which the apostle so earnestly exhorts , need to be better understood by the church . May God grant you a disposition to look the evil fairly in the face . <p> Oh , the thousands of souls that are being lost to all eternity through the selfish , wicked , and carnal spirit of our churchism ! God is dishonored , yea , robbed of the purchase of His Sons death , and infidelity stalks abroadthe result of a divided house . <p> It is said that " the possessor of perfect love of necessity overleaps denominations in spirit . " Does not this love prove that they are in the way of the Spirit of Christ ? And shall we compel the Lord to drag His children together over these cursed walls , only to have walls rise up again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true that " thorough holiness destroys denominations , " then it follows that where they yet exist this genuine degree of holiness has not been attained by the people . But I have not quoted correctly : it is " thorough and widespread holiness . " Ah ! here is the sticking pointa condition put in by the enemy of souls . It implies the following : " Though entire sanctification removes all sectarianism out of my heart , I will still adhere to my sect until people generally abandon their schismatic parties and creeds . " The devil is perfectly easy over these principles . Now , if this evil is to be done away by popular sentiment , then it is not through holiness ; but if by the latter it does not depend upon any foreign influence . The condition of the church in one state does not rob the Word and Spirit of God of their virtue in another . The power of holiness to destroy denominations in one community does not depend in the least upon another . Judah can burn down his groves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it or not . Therefore , we repeat , where the professed followers of Christ are divided into a plurality of sects , they have not yet become thoroughly sanctified to God . <p> Can it be said of professors of holiness that they have " one heart " and " one mind , " while some have a mind to be Presbyterian , others Baptists , others United Brethren , and others have a mind to adhere to the several different sects of Methodism ? Have they " one heart , and one way " * ( Jeremiah 32:39 ) when they rise from the solemn altar in the holiness meeting and go , each one in his own way , to the synagogue of his own sect ? <p> Now , I must confess that I can not see the necessity of this , unless it be to please the devil , break the unity of the Spirit and grieve away the heavenly Dove , bring to naught the divided house of the Lord , and destroy the work of holiness as fast as it can be built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But let us come still closer home . I would lay the responsibility of this enormous evil just where God places it and all other sin . We shall not be judged by sects , States , nor even by neighborhoods and towns , but " every one of us shall give account of himself to God . " * ( Romans 14:12 ) <p> A revival of holiness in a community is the result of personal consecration and faith ; and its relapse will be in proportion to the number of individuals that remove the sacrifice from the sanctifying altar . There is no such thing as thorough holiness , except as wrought by the Sanctifier in individual hearts ; and if , as has been said , and as I verily believe , thorough and widespread holiness destroys denominationsburns up sectarian distinctionsit must do it in your heart as an individual . And if this work is done , the fruits must exhibit the fact ; you will be saved by " the precious blood of Christ " from all " vain conversation received by tradition from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as " Your church , " " Our church " ; " Our preacher opened the doors of the church " ; " What branch of the church do you belong to ? " ; " You ought to join some branch " " and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine " * ( 1 Timothy 1:10 ) that grew out of a " perversion of the right ways of the Lord " * ( Acts 13:10 ) and the " gospel of Christ . " * ( Galatians 1:7 ) If the bitter root of sectism is entirely destroyed out of your heart , you will ignore all sectional lines and party fences , the dreadful curse of which Brother Starr has so honestly pointed out . If you are a true , intelligent Bible Christian , a holy , God-fearing man , you must cast off every human yoke , withdraw fellowship from and renounce every schismatic and humanly constituted party in the professed body of Christ . Instead of belonging to some branch you will simply belong to Christ and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead of remaining identified with any sect , i.e. , cut-off party , " directly or indirectly the result of sin , " you will claim membership in and fellowship with the " one and indivisible church that God has on earth , and that is made up of all and singular who are born of the Spirit . " On this broad and divinely established platform , and here only , can you stand clear of the sin of sectarianism and the blood of immortal souls that perish through its pernicious influence . Are you strictly loyal to God while you persist in adhering to a sect , notwithstanding He says " there should be no schism sects in the body " * ( 1 Corinthians 12:25 ) ? <p> I am not advocating the no-church theory that we hear of in the West , but the one , holy church of the Bible , not bound together by rigid articles of faith , but perfectly united in love under the primitive glory of the Sanctifier , " continuing stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Jesus . <p> But it is thought that we should not fight against sects nor attempt to abolish the evil at present , lest we thereby form another sect . This is virtually saying we should go on sinning , " lest a worse thing come unto us " * ( John 5:14 ) ! <p> An attempt to rally Israel under any of the many party names and creeds might indeed result in a new sect . But this is not what we contend for . Nay , but let us rather burn to ashes these high places of Israels corruption and , returning to Jerusalem , let us build " upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone . " * ( Ephesians 2:20 ) Let us abandon the nonsense of ecclesiastical succession ; cease to inflate our pride and vanity by parading the good and long-since departed , who innocently wore our party badgesthe piety of our fathers will not atone for the worldliness of the church at present . Let us also quit flourishing our church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wisdom of inspiration . Let us , we pray you , in the name of Jesus Christ , for the sake of our holy and divine religion and a world that is lost in sinoh , let us put away these childish things , and return to Jerusalem , not to form a new sect , but as the " servants of the God of heaven and earth , let us build the house that was builded these many years ago , which a great king of Israel Jesus Christ builded and set up . " * ( Ezra 5:11 ) <p> Many say we need more union of hearts , but think a visible organic union unnecessary ; but remember that it was a visible union that Jesus prayed for , such as the world could see and be thereby convinced and saved . We quote once more from W. H. Starr . <p> They will say to me : Can not we have union of feeling without external union that is , with external disunion ? I answer No , you can not , except in rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain to be beating off the leaves of the tree while you continually nourish its roots . And sectarianism is the " root of bitterness , " * ( Hebrews 12:15 ) whose acrid and legitimate fruit of divided hearts , and jealousy , and strife , doth continually grieve away the Spirit of our God and Savior , and leave our churches in a comparative poverty of grace and growth that methinks must make the very heavens groan with sorrow as they look down upon our dying world . Up , up ! my brother , my sister in Christ , inquire of the Lord concerning this thing ! Why slumber ye here while Satan has entered the fold of Christ , a wolf in sheeps clothing , and is rending the flock ? Oh , cry to God that He will direct you and all the children of His grace , till the church of His holy Son shall be purified and saved . Alas ! it is now " a house divided against itself . " * ( Matthew 3:25 ) Oh , pray that the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that He would show you your duty in the matter . The wants of the world require a holy and united Church . <p> From what has been said , and the uniform teaching of the Bible , the following facts are very evident : <p> The division of the church into sects is one of Satans most effectual , if not the very greatest , means of destroying human souls . <p> Its enormous sin must be answered for by individual adherents to , and supporters of , sects . <p> The only remedy for this dreadful plague is thorough sanctification , and this is wrought only by a personal , individual contact with the blood of Christ through faith . <p> The union required by the Word of God is both a spiritual and visible union . <p> The divisions of the church are caused by elements that are foreign to it as a divinely constituted body , by deposits of the enemy , which exist in the hearts and practices of individual members , involving their responsibility and requiring their personal purgation . <p> These facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear reader , is " thorough and widespread holiness " in our individual souls to destroy denominationalism there . Holiness , ever so thorough and widespread , around you , will not cleanse your heart ; neither can the sin of division in the hearts and lives of others attach to you , unless you drink in their spirit and also become a partisan . You need not waste time in planning general union movements , or praying the Lord to restore the unity of His church , until you go down under the blood and have every bone of contention and cause of division purged out of your own heart ; then you may do something to influence others to do the same . <p> You are praying and longing for the happy time when Gods children shall all be one , but are you willing that the " once more " shaking shall have its designed effect in your own case ? Do you , indeed , suffer the Holy Ghost fire to consume out of your own life , heart , religion , and conversation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to divide the children of God ? Do you , indeed , withdraw from and ignore all churches , so called , but the one Christ " purchased with his own blood " * ( Acts 20:28 ) and founded nearly nineteen hundred years ago , and to which the " Lord added " * ( Acts 2:47 ) you by regeneration ? Do you discard every church title but that " which the mouth of the Lord hath named , " * ( Isaiah 62:2 ) even the name of the Father , in which Christ and the apostles kept the church ( John 17:6,11-12 ; Acts 20:28 ; 1 Corinthians 1:2 ; 1 Timothy 3:15 ) ? Do you honor the divine head of the church by rejecting every creed but the one that " is given by inspiration of God " * ( 2 Timothy 3:16 ) ; every door that is opened and shut by men ; and every spirit but the Sanctifier ; and every motive but the love of God and humanity ? If you , by the grace of God , die to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , and not until then , will the Lord have thoroughly purged so much of his threshing floor ( Matthew 3:12 ; Luke 3:17 ) as you will have to answer for in the day of judgment . Where this is not accomplished , the grace of God is frustrated ; holiness is not permitted to reach the Bible standard of thoroughness , nor spread its healing virtue to every part of the soul . <p> It may look foolish to many thus to blow the trumpet of the Lord around the high and massy walls of sectarian glory and selfishness , but the power of God with the faith and shouts of the " holy people " will surely bring them down . Though the heaps of sectarian chaff have reached the magnitude of mountains , God has some wheat scattered through them , and He will have it separated for His garner . Therefore He says to Jacob , " Fear not thou shalt thresh the mountains , and beat them small , and thou shalt make the hills as chaff . Thou shalt fan them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whirlwind shall scatter them . " * ( Isaiah 41:14-16 ) <p> The pure elements of Gods church possess a wonderful inherent attraction and cohesion ; but the devil neutralizes the divine cement by mixing in his chaffy and miry trash , thereby effecting divisions ; therefore , the Lord restores union by the " removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that are made " * ( Hebrews 12:27 ) by the enemy , thus removing discord and schism . Glory to God ! Little Jacob has barely commenced threshing and separating . Soon we shall see clouds of chaff driven by the " rushing mighty wind " * ( Acts 2:2 ) from heaven . <p> Says Brother I. Reed , in his paper , The Highway : <p> The great holiness movement is shaking harder than ever . It is to be a real moral earthquake yet . We have nothing to fear in that direction . We have allied ourselves to the Power that does the shaking , and feel a kind of holy joy at the falling walls , reeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiness shock . In anticipation we enjoy the grand smash-up of things semi-religiousthis half and half , linsey-woolsey type of " Good God , Dear Mammon , " kind of fashionable moral froth , too often called " religion " that is coming some of these days . It is coming . We hear the tread of the mighty army . <p> Amen . Let the conflict come . God will have a pure church . He will shake the chaffy works of the devil out of His kingdom , though all hell be moved in rage ; though Gog and Magog surround the camp of the saints on the breadth of the whole earth . <p> Dear reader , I am aware that I have here written things that will be unwelcome to many , truths that will assail and stir up many prejudices ; but in doing so I have determined to cast from me the fear of man , and clear my conscience in the sight of God . <p> It is , indeed , my honest conviction that the great holiness reform can not go forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should until the gospel be so preached and consecration become so thorough that the blood of Christ may reach and wash away every vestige of denominational distinction , and " perfect in one " * ( John 17:23 ) yea , one " in deed and in truth " * ( 1 John 3:18 ) all the sanctified . <p> I am aware that this will elicit storms of persecution , but in the name of the Lord it must come . God will be glorified in the escape of his holy children from all human enclosures into the " one " and identical " fold of Jesus Christ . " Oh ! let us he honest before God in this matter . <h> A Prophetic Time <p> That many events of the world are foreshadowed in the prophecies of the Bible is something which perhaps the average reader does not pause much to reflect upon . He rather inclines to regard the prophecies as a difficult portion of the Sacred Writings , and in consequence of their being passed by , ignorance generally prevails concerning them . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world occur in accordance with prophetic utterance . It does not necessarily give credence to the doctrine of fatalismthat everything which happens must happen . The affairs in mans life are largely subject to his control . He has a scope of freedom all his own . He can make his own choices and govern his own career . He may do an act or he may not do it . An accident occurs which may have been avoided had more care been exercised . Nevertheless , from this free volitionary scope which belongs to man we may not exclude Gods design ; for He does exercise a controlling hand in the affairs of man . <p> It may be said , however , of the greater things that occur in the worldthe trend of public thought , the drift of conditions , the great political upheavals , things which are rather beyond mans individual control , and which involve mankind as a body and their destiny as a racethese more particularly belong to God and are made the subject of prophetic forecast . God did not create the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to design , and we may be assured that He has design in the progress of things as well as in their first creation . Nor will the grand play of the worlds events reach its conclusion without the decree of Him whose prerogative it is to say , " It is enough ; time shall no longer be . " <p> Christs coming into the world was freely prophesied hundreds of years in advance of that event . This is so plain that no student of the Bible , unless he means purposely to be infidelic , will dispute the fact . Likewise , the fulfillment of prophecies that went before concerning the Jews and their city Jerusalem is much in evidence . <p> The events of the world naturally group themselves into periods , or epochs . They are like panoramic scenes that unfold in the theater of the universe . Thus we have the two dispensations separated by the incarnation of Christ , the grandest event in all history . And thus we have , as divisions of the latter dispensation , the event of paganism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of apostasy , known in history as the Dark Ages ; and the Renaissance and the Reformation of the Sixteenth Century , ushering in a period of Protestantism , which is also an age of letters and invention . <p> In the interests of His church and the progress of His truth God has shown in advance in prophetic vision the periods and epochal events covering not only the Christian dispensation , but also a considerable time previous to it . These are for the Bible student , the minister of God , and for all Christians , to know and understand . <p> There is a prophecy in the 7th chapter of Daniel foreshadowing the four successive world empiresthe Babylonian , Medo-Persian , Grecian , and Romanand the papal power that grew out of the Roman . The book of Revelation is but a series of panoramic displays of the events of the entire Christian dispensation and the end of the world . <p> And so we may expect that , inasmuch as the prophecies served primarily the interests of the church , or the New Testament kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deliverance of the saints from spiritual Babylon , should have its foregleam in the utterance of the seer . In our preceding chapter , Brother Warner has already given quotations from the prophets relating to bringing out a pure church through the preaching of holiness . We wish to show by several other lines of prophecy that this state of the church , as being free from the bondage of human ecclesiasticism and enjoying her primitive glory , marks a distinct prophetic time or period in this evening of the dispensation . <p> Referring again to the 7th chapter of Daniel , where four successive world kingdoms are represented by the four beasts , we note that special attention is given to the description of the fourth beast , which is the Roman power in its pagan phase . mouth speaking great things . " * ( Daniel 7:7-8 ) <p> Daniel wished to know the truth respecting the little horn that had eyes like the eyes of a man , and a mouth speaking great things . He beheld that the " same horn made war with the saints , and prevailed against them ; until the Ancient of days came , and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High ; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom . " * ( Daniel 7:21-22 ) Now this horn that came up from among the other ten horns was nothing other than the elements of Roman Catholicism , developing into popery . It was the " man of sin , " * ( 2 Thessalonians 2:3 ) the product of the substitution of man rule for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fixed at about the year 270 A.D. This horn was to " speak great words against the Most High , and to wear out saints of the Most High , whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and all dominions shall serve and obey him . " * ( Daniel 7:25-27 ) <p> The " time and times and the dividing of time , " marking the period during which the elements of the papacy should have full sway and should wear out the saints of the Most High , etc. , are interpreted as three and one half years ; a time in prophetic reckoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividing of time one half year . Three and one half years would be forty-two months , or , if reduced to days according to the Jewish reckoning of thirty days to the month , twelve hundred and sixty days . Taking each day for a year , which is proper prophetic counting , we have twelve hundred and sixty years , and this added to the year 270 brings us to the year 1530 , the date of the beginning of organized Protestantism , and the end of the universal sway of the papacy it unto the end . " Since her universal spiritual supremacy ended , the judgment against Roman Catholicism has gradually proceeded and her political power has waned . " And the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom . " * ( Daniel 7:22 ) The saints possessing the kingdom is the culminating point in this line of prophecy , and means nothing other than the victory over human ecclesiasticism which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Revelation we have the wearing out of the saints expressed as treading under foot the holy city , and the time-period of " a time and times and the dividing of time " expressed as " forty and two months . " * ( Revelation 11:2 ) In verse 3 the same time period is expressed as twelve hundred and sixty days . During this time the two witnesses , the Word and the Spirit , prophesy in sackcloth , which represents the low estate to which they were relegated during the dark age of popery . It will be remembered that the twelve hundred and sixty days ( years ) end with the year 1530 . Following this comes three days and a half ( three centuries and a half ) of Protestantism during which the two witnesses ( Word and Spirit ) are , in the governmental sense , operatively dead , the organized systems of man rule having usurped the place of divine government and authority which these witnesses originally held . At the end of the three days and a half , three hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to the year 1880 ) " the Spirit of life from God entered into them , and they stood upon their feet . " * ( Revelation 11:11 ) They ascended to their place in the ecclesiastical heaven , to the true church , and were thus victorious . This brings us to the present reformation . This is soon followed by the sounding of the seventh angel , which represents the end of time when the " kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ ; and he shall reign forever and ever . " * ( Revelation 11:15 ) The curtain drops . <p> Another scene is presented in the 13th chapter , where the rise of the papacy , or Roman Catholic power , is represented by a leopard beast having the same " mouth speaking great things " * ( Revelation 13:5 ) that appeared in the " little horn " * ( Daniel 7:8 ) of Daniel seven . " And power was given unto him to continue forty and two months , " * ( Revelation 13:5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twelve hundred and sixty years . Following this the period of Protestantism is spake as a dragon . " * ( Revelation 13:11 ) The length of the time period of this second beast is here omitted , but the sphere of its activity is succeeded ( in chapter 14 ) by a victorious church , the fall of Babylon , and the present reformation work in which the everlasting gospel , the gospel that really saves , is once more preached " unto them that dwell on the earth . " * ( Revelation 14:6 ) In connection with this also is the judgment which Daniel says is " given to the saints of the Most High " * ( Daniel 7:22 ) ; that is , the judgment against the false religions of spiritual Babylon . <p> In the 18th chapter , in connection with Babylons fall , we have Gods people fill to her double . " * ( Revelation 18:4-6 ) Thus the time is come that " judgment is given to the saints and the saints possess the kingdom . " * ( Daniel 7:22 ) <p> Spiritual Babylon represents Rome first , and Protestantism second . In the Critical Commentary by Jamieson , Fausset , and Brown , in the comments on Revelation 18:4 , we have the following quoted from Hahn in Auberlen : " The harlot is not Rome alone ( though she is preeminently so ) , but every Church that has not Christs mind and spirit . False Christendom , divided into very many sects , is truly Babylon , i.e. , confusion . " The literal Babylon was an ancient city situated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held captive for seventy years , or until liberated by the Persian king Cyrus . This is used as a figure of the captivity of Gods spiritual Israel in spiritual Babylon . The word Babylon means confusion , and it is fittingly applied to the confused religion as represented by the whole picture of Roman Catholicism and the Protestant sects . <p> In the 34th chapter of Ezekiel the gathering of Gods people and their deliverance from false relations is represented by a shepherd seeking out his flock and delivering them . " As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered ; so will I seek out my sheep , and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day . And I will bring them out from the people , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them to their own land and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers , and in all the inhabited places of the country . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high mountains of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel . " * ( Ezekiel 34:12-14 ) <p> The cloudy and dark day of Protestantism , when the light of truth shines , not in its entire brightness , nor yet as entirely obscured , is also referred to in it shall be light . " * ( Zechariah 14:6-7 ) Thank God , the day of mingled light is past , and we are in the full light of the evening , when the whole truth is once more preached in its fullness , without hypocrisy and without reserve . <p> Thus we see that the present movement among Gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is prophetically represented as a new epoch for the church . <h> The Gospel Trumpet <p> After the Board of Publication of the Northern Indiana Eldership had passed the resolution in November 1880 , that they were willing to consolidate the Herald of Gospel Freedom with any other paper that advocated the same gospel principles , a consolidation was effected with a small paper called The Pilgrim , published in Indianapolis , by G. Haines . The Pilgrim was a monthly and had been issued but about eight times . The Herald equipment , it should be remarked , had been donated to Brothers Warner and Haines by the Churches of God in Indiana for the new paper.9 The decision to effect this consolidation was made in a joint meeting of the Board of Publication and the Standing Committee held in Yellow Lake Bethel , Kosciusko County , Indiana , December 23 , 1880 . In an old memorandum tablet of Brother Warners is recorded what is apparently a report of this meeting , in his own handwriting . One paragraph , which reads as follows , is of special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevailed within the Eldership that " every member should be under the control of Christ alone in the performance of work appointed him . " They said , " We believe that the Lord wishes not His church burthened and perplexed with financial cares . Therefore , Resolved That it is not good that she should own and control a printing office . " They said further , " We are willing to assist and support these two brethren in the joint publication of the Gospel Trumpet provided they are permitted to have full control of the same and so long as they keep themselves and the paper wholly in the Lords hands and to His glory . " <p> They , of course , did not understand that by means of a corporation , board of trustees , or other legalized body , the church could control its printing business and yet not be " burthened and perplexed with financial cares . " <p> On motion it was agreed to consolidate the Herald of Gospel Freedom with the Pilgrim , at Indianapolis , Indiana , and call the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say so , it was Brother Warner himself who suggested the name Gospel Trumpet . He felt impressed that the new paper should be called by that name , the idea being associated with such scriptures as the following : <p> " The great trumpet shall be blown , and they shall come and shall worship the Lord in the holy mount . " * ( Isaiah 27:13 ) " The Lord God shall blow the trumpet , and shall go with whirlwinds. " * ( Zechariah 9:14 ) <p> A scripture containing the word " trumpet " always appeared in the heading of the paper . After a few years the heading contained the design of a flying angel blowing a trumpet from which was suspended a scroll containing this inscription , taken from Zechariah 5:2-4 : " He said unto me , What seest thou ? And I answered , I see a flying roll . Then said he unto me Every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it ; and everyone that sweareth shall be cut off as on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saith the Lord of hosts . " <p> At a later date the design was changed , the angel was reversed , and the following was substituted as an inscription on the scroll : " All ye inhabitants of the world , and dwellers on the earth , see ye , when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains ; and when he bloweth a trumpet , hear ye . " * ( Isaiah 18:3 ) For many years the heading design contained one or more angels blowing the trumpet . <p> Brother Warner was a man wonderfully anointed of God for a special work . Since he had received the experience of sanctification in 1877 the Lord had been gradually revealing to him that the true and divinely intended state of the people of God was not that of being scattered in a multiplicity of sectarian divisions but of being perfectly one in Christ , not only in spirit , but in name and invisible aspect . He felt that the teaching of genuine holiness would , in connection with the light of the prophecies bearing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , undivided state . For such a reformation he was indeed a chosen instrument of the Lord . It was Gods truth he was preaching . It led , of course , to a crisis in which he received much persecution and was deserted by many . The Trumpet , he realized , was a very effectual instrument God had placed in his hands for accomplishing the great reformation work in this evening time of the Christian era . The time was ripe . True saints of God in various places , in whom was the Spirit of the Lord , were desiring and anticipating a oneness for Gods people , and when The Trumpet appeared it was just what they were wanting . The fact that it was considered insignificant and ignored in popular religious circles proved its mission none the less divine . Gods work is frequently accomplished by insignificant instruments . The Trumpet shared Brother Warners difficulties and deprivations . The description of these in the spiritual phase will be reserved for the next chapter . What we shall note here are some of the mere facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospel Trumpet now in the files of the Publishing Office is of the issue of March 1 , 1881 . The paper began with January 1 of that year , at Rome City , Indiana. * Two issues were printed there , then the equipment was moved to Indianapolis . The removal occasioned some delay , so that there was no paper printed during the month of February . The new location was over N. 70 North Illinois Street . The paper started as a semimonthly , at a subscription price of seventy-five cents a year . Agents were allowed a commission of fifteen cents on each subscription in clubs of five or upwards . Its object was stated as being , " The glory of God in the salvation of men from all sin , and the union of all saints upon the Bible . " It was a four-page , five-column paper of about 13 by 19 inches in size . It at first contained considerable matter on prohibition ; but the thing that brought it persecution and isolated it from the fellowship and sympathy of nominal professors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the handicaps that had to be contended with from the start . On the moving of the equipment to Indianapolis , new type to the amount of $147 had to be purchased . At this time also a new Prouty power press costing $590 was contemplated , the old press being a Washington hand press . It was some years , however , until a power press was installed . In the issue of May 15 , 1881 , appears the following editorial : <p> We are experiencing that it takes a man wonderfully burned out for God to publish a paper that is simply true to Jesus and up to the Bible standard of salvation from all sin . A thousand points of expediency and policy must be disregarded , and the eye fixed on God alone . O reader , you that love God and the truth , do not forget to pray for us . We are here in the city with a family to support , and publishing expenses to meet , and many are withdrawing from us because we will not sanction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we fear no evil . Thus far , since the paper is all on Gods altar , He has supplied our needs . Glory to His name ! <p> Another difficulty that had to be contended with almost from the start was the unfaithfulness of some of those associated with him . He was scarcely settled in Indianapolis when the partnership with Haines had to be dissolved , and the latter then started an opposition paper . The following editorial from the June 1 number will explain : <h> The Opposition Paper <p> No person that has the real cause of God at heart can fail to deplore the fact that in this city two papers are now being published , both claiming to be holiness papers , having of course conflicting interests . <p> That this state of affairs must weaken and wound this sacred cause , and hedge up its way by destroying the confidence of the people in the great truth of holiness , is very apparent to all thinking minds . This being true , fearful responsibilities rest somewhere , and the people have a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refer to the reproach that is brought upon the pure cause of holiness ; but it is largely known , and can be remedied only by a statement of the causes and terms of the dissolution of The Trumpet firm . Two papers in the same place with rival interests can not both be of Godthere is no use trying to smuggle the fact . <p> The blame must be located , and though its location exposes personal character , it must be done . Paul wrote even with tears of some whom he pronounced enemies of the cross of Christ . Alas , how often the blessed Son of God is sacrificed at the shrine of selfishness , and sold for a few pieces of money ! <p> The office having been donated by the Church of God in northern Indiana , for the use of The Trumpet , we entered into a consolidation and partnership , agreeing that " each should do one half of the labor , pay one half of the expenses , and receive one half of the income . " <p> We went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome City , and then shipped the office to this city . <p> But before it arrived we found our self bound to a chilling iceberg , an austere , worldly , complaining , and mere money policy . Though rather uncongenial to our feelings , we thought it probably all for the better and were willing to go ahead ; but ere long the Spirit of God clearly indicated to us that we should not work with this man . We gave the matter all into the hands of God , and told the Lord that if He wished a dissolution , He should bring it about in His own time and His own way . <p> We had made no note of labors at Rome City , but thought when we set up here we should be under the necessity of doing so ; but wishing to avoid every shadow of blame for the separation that we knew was coming , we continued to waive our right in the agreement , and went on working for the Lord , while partner gave His time to the Cincinnati Times-Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes at the office . <p> It pleased God to withhold a competent income from the paper . This soon wrought a divine purpose , and partner proposed to dissolveoffered to give or take one hundred dollars , and the party taking the office pay all the debts on the firm . Having the will of God clearly revealed to us , we could not , without disloyalty to God and infidelity to the brethren who donated the office , abandon it . We also had one hundred and seventy dollars in the office that partner did not , having released notes to that amount against those churches when they kindly donated the office . <p> We remarked , however , that as the office had been given for the use of The Trumpet , it was not right that , withdrawing from the paper , he should ask that amount of money . But the answer was that The Pilgrim field which had been merged into The Trumpet was worth that to him . We therefore consented to pay the one hundred dollars to satisfy him for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would feel himself under obligations not to start another paper here , both because of the amount received for the field , and for shames sake , as it could only expose the cause to reproach , we were surprised that he would not make a fair promise . We insisted upon it as our right , and he remarked finally that he did not think he would start another . Just then the Spirit said , " Trust it in the hands of the Lord , God will Himself manage the matter . " From that time we said no more about it . <p> We feel that our skirts are clear from the harm that holiness must suffer from this bad example to the world . And if God can bless the little opposition sheet ( for such is the spirit of its first issue ) we shall be thankful . <p> Bless the Lord ! We have nothing to fear , because we have nothing to lose . The Trumpet is indeed all burned up for God : but out of its ashes shall continue to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy pilgrims " who rejoice in unrighteous gain . God is now on trial . He is our only resource . On the other hand , a crafty policy slyly gets up a little paper , changes the association meeting from home to Terre Haute , presents it to the congregation , gets four votes in its favor , then himself pronounces it adopted ; is elated that he was " sharp " enough to get the one hundred dollars and the field also , and now boasts that he will take away The Trumpet subscribers . O Lord , pity and save such a one for Christs sake ! <p> Just now we feel a deeper concern for his salvation than for all we may suffer through his competition . Though doubtless we shall lose some readers through this assumed organ of the State association , a thing that lives only in name , and whose head , professing to be called to labor in the vineyard of the Lord as a gospel minister , prefers the vineyard of the worldly paper as more lucrative , we are thankful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own merits . <p> Our Father in heaven still owns the universe . Truth has not lost its power ; neither have the four votes cast at Terre Haute dethroned the Almighty . Hallelujah ! Jesus reigns . <p> After dissolution of partnership with Haines , Brother Warner was supplied with a colaborer in J. C. Fisher , who took a half interest , and was very effectual in starting the work in Michigan , where he resided.10 <p> Illustrative of the poverty of The Trumpet in its infancy , as well as the construction of the first publishing offices , another editorial from the June 1 number here given . The location of this new office was on Brother Warners lot at 625 West Vermont Street adjoining his residence . <h> An Office for the Trumpet <p> As we have over a mile to walk to our office and have to pay $5 a month for rent , we felt led of the Lord to build an office on our lot . We had a small stable that would afford some material , and , trusting that God would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the Lord . So the other day a dear old saint who is a carpenter came to inquire what we had to build with . We told him , when he said he had some lumber to add , also door and plenty of windows , which he would give very cheap , and give work also . <p> We are now looking to God for some means , perhaps thirty dollars , to buy shingles and some other material . Now , dearly beloved reader , as both our family duties and the necessity of curtailing expenses , as well as saving time , require us to build this office , it may be that on account thereof we shall not be able to issue a paper for the 15th of June . Please remember this and do not be disappointed if no paper reaches you . There are two other reasons why it will be somewhat difficult to issue the next number . First , we have a tabernacle in operation and we desire to work all we can in these direct efforts to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking charge of the office and doing most of the work on the paper ourself hereafter ; and having but a slight experience in compository work , we shall need to have more time on the first paper . But withal we shall issue a paper if possible . If the Lord has given you a few dollars for the office , send it on . Amen . <p> In explanation of why he was not able to issue the paper regularly he writes as follows for August 15 of that same year : <p> The announcement that the paper would be on time would have been carried out so far as the work on the paper is concerned , but it did not please the Lord to send us the means to purchase the paper , hence the delay . Well , we are willing that God should stop the Trumpet altogether if He will . It belongs wholly to Him , and so do we , and , bless God , we have nothing to say about it . Oh , how perfectly dead to all self in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Trumpet shall only be issued as the Lord furnishes the means every two weeks if possible , if not , let all know that it was not in our power to do so , and that all our subscribers shall have the worth of the money paid . Owing to the past delays and the fact that we are led to attend some camp meetings , we skip one number with the present issue . <p> In the November 1 number we notice more privation . <p> We did not move , neither were we able to plaster our office . How then do you think we managed to get out this paper ? We will tell you . Dear Wife tendered her kitchen to the Lord for the use of publishing salvation . Praise the Lord ! By thus crowding in a sufficient amount of the office to get along for the winter we shall save fuel , and the expense of finishing the office until next fall . Thank God , we are willing to get along any way for Christs sake , so that we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not at all mortified at these humble facilities from which The Trumpet goes forth to its readers . Christ started His earthly mission from a manger . Oh , no , we are not ashamed to let all men know that the Trumpet is published in the rear of a small cottage . Gods presence makes the whole domicile sacred . Oh , how wonderfully He pours out his glory on our souls in this work ! <p> On the other hand , there were others in whom God had planted a love for the truth . Among these was Brother Warners faithful printer . God had preserved a few who should contribute sufficient to the paper to keep it going . <h> How It Looks to Others <p> We know that many think it big to be an editor , hence before and ever since we entered upon this work we have feared and dreaded being actuated by such motives . When we go out to work in the field and we just tell God to let The Trumpet stop if it is His will and we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to return to this sacred charge . <p> Once when we had the office up in the city , God tried us thoroughly . We had no money to pay the printer , and he was out of meal tickets , which must be paid in advance . We were sent for to come to a meeting in Terre Haute . A brother wrote that he would pay our fare , so we borrowed the money and went down on Saturday morning . We told the Lord that if He did not want the paper to continue , to let the printer leave and get work somewhere else . As we walked from the depot to the office on our return , Monday eve , we said , If that young man is in the office , it is the wonderful dealing of God . We entered and found him cheerfully working away . On Saturday he ran the press all day without a bite to eat . As he told us this our heart was melted . We entered our little sanctum and poured out our soul to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heaven upon our heart . <p> When we started for the Camargo camp meeting , we had a few dimes . Having been provided with a free pass , through the kindness of Brother , who wrote that for months he had not thought of the camp meeting without seeing us on the program and that we must be there without fail , we left with Wife all our change but two nickels . Told our printer that as we had no money to give him he might quit if he saw fit and hunt a position where he could get his pay . We remarked that as The Trumpet was not ours we had no choice whether it lived or died . Well , it cost us five cents to reach the depot by streetcar , and the other nickel to carry us and baggage from the train to campground , so we just had enough . Praise God from whom all blessings flow ! Though we were brought there by the direction of Gods Spirit through Brother , the high priest in charge , probably out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But God gave us a field to work in , and the hearts of the " people who do know their God , " * ( ) and , blessed be His name , in that meeting He gave us over sixty-one dollars . So The Trumpet still sends out the certain sound . Here is a sample of many letters received the last few months . It will show how others see The Trumpet in relation to Gods will and Satans dread : <p> " Ah yes , Brother Warner , it is The Trumpet the devil wants stopped . You may evangelize all you please , so The Trumpet goes under , and the devil does n't  care . Do stand by The Trumpet at all hazards . " <p> Of course we know that all such expressions relate to the awful and offensive truth of God that we give place to in The Trumpet , and not to any ability we possess to write or conduct a paper . We are too sorely and constantly pinched by a sense of our own ignorance to think anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading , " The Trumpet Will Go On , " we have the following : <p> God has blessed us with excellent health and strength . Praise His holy name ! We can work without apparent fatigue from 5 A.M. to 11 P.M. , and we propose doing so , by the continued help of God . We feel that the gates of hell can not stop the truth . And if we can not issue the paper regularly every two weeks , we will issue as often as we can , and give everybody his or her full number of papers . The Lord holds us to this work , and He can not forsake us in the work whereunto He has called us . Let all the readers of The Trumpet obey the voice of the Spirit of God , and there will be means both to enlarge and carry on the paper for the glory of God . Oh , if the God of salvation could but reach some who are blessed with means and draw out about two hundred dollars it would pay all The Trumpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a good little stock of paper to start with . We will work , and pray , and trust , and God and the dear people will provide the means . <p> At the beginning of the second year the price of The Trumpet was raised to one dollar . <p> For some time before The Trumpet raised to one dollar , nearly everybody sent us one dollar instead of seventy-five cents . Thus the Lord has fixed the price , and He will provide for its enlargement . <p> The enlargement came with the first issue in February . It was made a six-column , four pages15 by 22 . In the first issue of the new size we find the following editorial : <p> We printed two thousand papers this issue . It is quite a task on our hand press ; but , praise God , He gives us blessed health and strength , and we are perfectly satisfied to work on with the means the Lord has furnished , until He sees proper to give us others . <p> Early in the autumn of 1882 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here was a congregation of saints among whom the publishing work could be better supported . A very pleasant office , warm and well lighted , was rented for thirty dollars a year . Brother Warner acknowledges his enjoyment of the great kindness , love , and cooperation of the true saints there . It seems , however , that even there the work did not make much progress . The old press had by this time become very unsatisfactory . Brother Warner sought to hire his printing work done elsewhere , but his effort resulted in his having to print the first issue of 1883 on a job press , with the paper reduced in size to a four-column 11 by 15 . The price was dropped to seventy-five cents , then to fifty cents . The following editorial will give an insight to his situation : <h> This Little Trumpet <p> Having had our last issue printed on our neighbors steam press , we concluded it would pay us to trade our old press on a jobber and have them print the paper regularly . <p> Our chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would take us to print them on the slow old press , we could make more on job-work than would pay the printing . But , behold , when our neighbors learned that we were getting a job-press , they seemed to think we were intruding on their territory , and not having the utmost confidence in their typographical ability they thought to make us pay a sort of royalty for the privilege of doing job-work here , by raising the price of printing The Trumpet from four dollars to eight dollars an issue ; and while we conceded the perfect right to charge that price , we were happy for the privilege of saving that amount and printing on our job-press . <p> Of course , we can print but one page at a time , which makes four impressions for a folio ; and if we print as large as The Trumpet has been , it will take eight times running through the press , which , after all , can be done in about the same time it took to print it in two impressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of three . <p> When the paper comes to you only half the old size we will call it but a half number , so we will not defraud our subscribers in the least . But we desire to send you eight pages every two weeks if we possibly can . When we can not , please bear with us until the kind providence of God and the liberality of the saints help us to get a paper-press . <p> The eight-page proposition did not then materialize . About this time was adopted the motto , which was carried for many years : " First pure , then valiant for the truth . " The home of the Gospel Trumpet was not long at Cardington . Brother Warner was desirous of having a permanent home for the Trumpet , where he would not have to pay rent . When he moved to Cardington , he did not feel that that would be the permanent place for the paper . Kind brethren in Michigan made very liberal offers and asked him to come there ; but a place was opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While he was in prayer pleading earnestly for Gods direction , three teams drove up . It was the brethren from Bucyrus , who had come to move the office to that place and also help it out of financial difficulties . There was great joy in Brother Warners heart as he realized that God had answered prayer and sent help . One of these brethren , D. D. Johnston , assisted in the matter of finances . He purchased a lot and furnished material with which to erect a building . His name appeared as publisher in August 1883 . <p> Brother Warner proceeded to build a small office on the lot at Bucyrus . In the last number printed at Cardington he writes as follows : <p> While you read this paper , the editor will be personally at work erecting a house in which to carry on the work of the Lord . If we were building a house for ourself we should want to count the cost before commencing ; but we are building this house unto the Lord , and the earth and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop to count since He says go forward . The undertaking is wholly by faith . While at work with our hands we shall pray without ceasing to our heavenly Father to send us the means . <p> We have had experience enough in our business to know that we never can carry on the paper and pay rent . It is claimed that a paper is not self-supporting with most any number of subscribers without receiving advertisements . Just yesterday in the office of a temperance paper we were told by an editor and publisher that we ought to take in one thousand dollars every year for advertisements , and he could not see how the paper could be carried otherwise . But , beloved , it must be carried otherwise or not at all . Neither do we wish to do any secular job-work if we can help it . We shall dispose of our job-press and material as soon as possible . Now , beloved , when we shall have obtained a good paper-press ( and it is already bought , thank God ) and a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be able to send you a paper 22 by 32 every two weeks . <p> Some of our dear brethren have in love censured us occasionally . We find generally these two points , sometimes in the same letter , namely , " Why do you not send your paper out more frequently and more regularly ? " And the other , " I think you have not been on your guard enough to keep out of debt . " Well , there it is . We could have kept entirely out of debt if we had issued fewer papers , and we might have issued every two weeks had we gone more in debt . But no one of our experience could possibly have issued more frequently , with our income and slow facilities . Our dear brethren are without a knowledge of what they are talking about . But now , beloved , as we are in this desperate effort to get entirely out of debt and to get situated so as to cut off much of our past expense , we hope that all will send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bucyrus was made in May 1883 . About that time the first good press was purchased . It was a rebuilt Country Campbell , allowing either belt or hand power to be used , and costing perhaps six hundred dollars . <p> The trying times through which The Trumpet had to pass in its early years are known only to God . It was perhaps His design that it should be tried as gold is tried . There were always a few consecrated hearts who contributed of their means . Some put everything they had into the work . Thus the work was kept alive . Little did Brother Warner realize , when he was located at Bucyrus and the prospects looked good , that there he should go through the bitterest trial of his life . The light of The Trumpet came very near being snuffed out entirely . Bucyrus was the narrows in The Trumpets voyage , through which it barely passed . This will be described in our next chapter . <p> The office of The Trumpet remained at Bucyrus nearly a year . Some brethren in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Progress had been made at Bucyrus , but it was through the furnace of trial rather than any extension of influence . But doubtless all this experience was necessary as an equipment for greater usefulness . <p> The move to Williamston , Ingham County , Michigan , was made in April 1884 . A Mr. Horton , a businessman of Williamston , in whom the Lord had planted a love for the truth , went to Bucyrus and had the office equipment shipped . The saints in Michigan had in the meantime obtained possession of a two-story building 28 x 84 feet , and they had it partitioned , or remodeled , to suit the need , the upper story to he used for a hall or assembly room , the rear of the lower floor to be used for living rooms and the front for an office . Brother Warner rejoiced with tears when the work got started in its new and enlarged quarters in Williamston . The first number of the paper published there was dated April 15 . From its columns we quote the following greetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , beloved , with the sound of the trump of God . The devil has spent all his infernal powers in vain to crush this work of God . We have thoroughly learned his attitude toward us . In his hellish clamor about us for many days , saying , " You must give up The Trumpet , " he has clearly committed himself against this cause , and all who are against this dissemination of the light of God we know are on the devils side , either willfully or ignorantly . Oh , how hell has poured forth upon us ! Night after night we had to leave our bed at two , three , and four oclock , and go to the office and cry unto God to drive away the hosts of hell that had encamped against us . And every time the power of God dispersed these infernal spirits of darkness , the Lord re-commissioned us to blow the Trumpet in Zion , and sound an alarm on His holy mountain , and we were made joyfully conscious of his approving smile for not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil having drawn to his side the best agents he could ever expect to use against us , was fierce and determined to hush the Trumpet sound of freedom from all sin and Babylon yokes . Oh , hallelujah ! <p> During this terrible combat with the powers of darkness , we had to do more fighting than working , hence the work went on slowly . We were ready to print about the first of February , then the Lord called us by telegram to Kalamazoo , Michigan . The next day our printer accidentally spoiled the rollers , so that he could not print . So the work lay until our return . After looking to the Lord until He assured us that the office would be cleared from the mortgage , we ordered new rollers , and went to work again in the name of the Lord . About the time we were ready to print , God sent Brother Thomas Horton , from Williamston , Michigan , who paid off the five-hundred-dollar mortgage , some other debts , chartered a car , loaded us up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ourself to this place , Wife and child having remained behind to visit with friends . Moving just at the time caused a few days delay in this issue , but now we expect to greet you regularly . Praise the Lord ! " The LORD gave , and the LORD hath taken away ; blessed be the name of the LORD " * ( Job 1:21 ) ! So said Job . If it was the devil that took it away , but he had to get a permit from God before he could do it , therefore it was of the Lord , and " blessed be the name of the LORD " ; for when He permits the devil to take anything away He has given to His children , He always returns fourfold . We have understood this principle long ago , and have thrown it in the face of the devil every time he has shown his teeth at us . Blessed be God forever and ever ! And thus hath God done unto us again . We left an office where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here has God furnished a building two stories high , 28 x 84 feet , all of which is dedicated to the Lord . It contains a large meeting hall , and plenty of room for office and all families connected with it . It is , however , under repairs , and we have taken temporary quarters for a few weeks . <p> Every change that was made gave occasion for new hopes for the advancement of the publishing work . Accordingly we read in the first issue at Williamston : " After one more issue we expect steam power , and there is no telling what God will yet do for The Trumpet if the devil does n't  quit his hellish opposition . " An engine was purchased during the first year at Williamston . It was of three horsepower and cost two hundred dollars . Thus , after the trying times of the first four years of its life , the Trumpet work began to make substantial progress and the reformation cause to expand and become permanent . <p> The next move for The Gospel Trumpet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VanBuren County , was a yearly camp meeting . There were many saints in the vicinity and near Grand Junction , seven miles north . At the Bangor camp meeting in June 1866 , the subject of moving the Trumpet Office* to that part of the state was considered . It seemed to be the mind of the Spirit and of all the saints that the removal should be made . A commodious and substantial building in the town of Grand Junction was offered for eight hundred dollars , or about half its worth . The saints agreed to purchase the property , and money was raised to pay moving expenses . An encumbrance of five hundred dollars on the machinery was also paid off . Accordingly it was decided to move . One freight car held the entire outfit of office material , machinery , and household goods . <p> Grand Junction , " where two lightning tracks lay crossing , " was a small town of a few hundred inhabitants , the junction of the Chicago and West Michigan ( now the Pere Marquette ) and a branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haven on the lake and thirty miles west of Kalamazoo . This became the permanent home of the Gospel Trumpet during twelve years of its history . <p> Before the move to Grand Junction , Brother S. Michels , of South Haven , assumed with his means a portion of the financial responsibility . Being thus directly connected with the publishing work , his name appeared as publisher , which position he held till relieved by N. H. Byrum , in 1895 . <p> About a year after the publishing office was located at Grand Junction , the publishing work , and the church as well , suffered the defection of J. C. Fisher , who had been on the editorial staff and had been useful in the ministry.11 He was succeeded as assistant editor by E. E. Byrum , who remained on the staff for many years , and after Brother Warners death became editor . <p> The Gospel Trumpet was a mighty factor in the reformation work , a very effectual means of spreading the truth . At Grand Junction the Office grew to a substantial printing plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a childrens paper was started , and The Trumpet became a weekly . It was here that Brother Warners death occurred in 1895 . We close this chapter with the publishing work located at Grand Junction . Brief reference to its present status will be made in another chapter . <h> The Crisis <p> Desiring to trace the earlier history of The Gospel Trumpet , I have permitted the preceding chapter to overlap this one a few years . <p> True to prophetic fulfillment , the time was at hand for the restoration of the church to her normal state of unity and holiness . The scattered condition of Gods people in the various sectarian denominations was not always to continue , for such could not be the ideal state of the church ; it could not be her final state in which Christ could expect to receive her as His bride . For her there was a better day at hand . From Romish night to the light of justification by faith , possessed among Protestant sects generally since the sixteenth century reformation , had been a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of perfect holiness as a Christian attainment subsequent to regeneration , marked an advance for the truth in its progress by stages unto the end of time . There needed to be yet another step , another reformation , which should bring the church to her fullness of glory , and visualize her unity and solidarity . <p> It would seem that the holiness movement that arose in the sixties and seventies should have accomplished this , but it served only as an approach to it . True holiness indeed destroys the elements of sectarianism , and forbids a continued state of division among Christians . But the holiness movement , as such , came to have holiness only nominally for its object . It undertook no antagonism to sectarian divisions , though it deplored them . It stood for nothing more than holiness as a subject to be taught and experienced , and satisfied itself as best it could to remain within the denominations . It drew back when the real issue came , and in consequence it has long been dissipated in the sects , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people into unity . <p> Christian unity can never be brought about within the sects , nor in connection with any recognition of allegiance to them . It absolutely can be effected only out of and away from the sects , by obedience to God and a severance of sectarian ties . Since true Christian unity is incompatible with sects , and since coming out of sects is opposed by the sect spirit and invites persecution by the sects , the only course for the people of God to take who have received the light on the true church is to cut loose from human institutions and abide in Christ alone , even though it places them in a relation hostile to the so-called churches . For those first leaving the sects there was no body of saints already called out to which they could be added . What could it mean to them but a crisis ? And what would it constitute in the progress of events but a reformation ? But the Spirit of the Lord was thus leading . Since sects are hostile to the movement out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostile to them ; for He indeed leads His people out of sects . But the time had come . Gods spiritual ones were looking and longing for some development or other by which they would cease to be divided in sectarian bodies . No one had put it into their minds ; their anticipation of it was prompted by the Spirit of God , which was in them . There needed someone to sound the trumpet of the Lord , someone to take the lead and make a positive declaration against the sin of division , some one through whom God could of her plagues . " * ( Revelation 18:4 ) <p> God had in Brother Warner prepared just such an instrument . His was the spirit of a reformer . He shunned not to declare Gods judgments . His ministry had a definite message , and represented the burden of God for the purity and unity of His church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the writer has already intimated , that his connection with the Church of God ( Winebrennerian ) , which assumed to have no creed but the Bible and to be indeed the true church of God , had doubtless served to emphasize to him the true church ideal and to shape his course along right lines . And his rejection by the Ohio Eldership for the preaching of holiness awakened him to see that that body was not what it claimed to be , but was , after all , only a humanly ruled institution , only one sect among the many . The light he already had on the church was sufficient to forbid his reuniting with them . Thus the so-called Church of God had contributed to him the right idea of the church , and the holiness movement had brought to his understanding the line on which God would bring out a pure church , namely , the line of holiness ; and thus was the divine Hand leading him and fitting him for the work to which he was called . <p> We can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preach the divine judgments against the apostate religions of the day , to decry the evils of denominationalism , and to undertake on that same line the publication of a paper . That his work was despised and that Satan undertook to crush it in its very beginning can not be wondered at . Its humbleness and apparent insignificance looked uninviting to the worldly-minded ; but the deep spirituality and divine manifestations that characterized it were a sufficient vindication to those who were capable of spiritually discerning the truth . There was something that said , " This work is of God . " There was a sense of spiritual freedom and of love and Christian fellowship that bore convincing testimony to those who would but listen to the dictation of the Spirit that this is indeed the truth . <p> But Brother Warner was not alone . God had reserved his thousands who no longer were bowing the knee to Baal . From them he received encouragement and support , though for a few years it seemed his work had to go through the crucible of trial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his victories , until the cause becomes fully established in the earth . <p> From what we learn of Brother Warners earlier views and attitude , he never had a party spirit ; he never was a sectarian . Even from his early ministry the love and fellowship that exists among the people of God he recognized as the paramount bond of Christian union . After his conversion , when dealing with the question of what church he should join , he is found casting about to determine which one represented the real church of God . As the followers of Winebrenner had the right name , and seemed to him to be correct in doctrine , he was led into that denomination . With the insufficient light he then possessed he probably failed to see the man rule that prevailed , instead of the Holy Spirit rule that characterizes the divine , theocratic government in the true church of God . He discovered , of course , the clash of this man rule with the free , independent inclination of the Holy Spirit , by which he preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believing that he was in the true church ; and it took years to discover to him that the body to which he belonged was but a sect . <p> It was through the attainment of the Bible standard of holiness that he was gradually led into the truth respecting the church and sects . Early in 1878 he wrote : " The Lord showed me that holiness could never prosper upon sectarian soil encumbered by human creeds and party names , and He gave me a new commission to join holiness and all truth together and build up the apostolic church of the living God . " He soon began to receive light on the Scriptures , which revealed to him that the church was to be restored to her primitive glory in the evening of the dispensation . The chapter on " A Spiritual Shaking , " taken from his book , clearly shows that when the chapter was written ( 1879 ) he understood that God was going to bring out a pure church . He published this in 1880 , which became the date from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It should be remembered that during this time he was connected with the Northern Indiana Eldership ; but as this was a body already separated from the old Eldership because of their purpose to keep on the Scriptural basis , he really believed that this body was the true church , for that was its claim . Thus he was really out of sectism in heart and was associated with a body claiming to be the church of God . During the last year ( 1880 ) of the Herald of Gospel Freedom , when it was fully under his editorial charge , its columns , while teaching holiness , breathed the principles of the one true church . One of its stated objects was " the union of all true believers in the Spirit of God and upon the inspired Word . " Because of insufficient light on the governmental aspect of the true church , he was slow to discover that even the new Eldership was only a body ruled by men . As light came on the Holy Spirit government , he looked upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal . It was human machinery that he thought needed to be dispensed with . We must concede , therefore , that in the meantime he was , to all intents and purposes , out of sects . <p> We speak of this period as the crisis because he took such a bold , uncompromising stand against sects and taught holiness and the principles of the church with such thoroughness that it seemed to awaken every satanic element that had been slumbering under the guise of false profession . People had either to accept the truth or go into darkness . To him it meant the breakup of old relations , the drawing of new lines of fellowship , exposure to persecution , and everything that might befall the career of a reformer . As the teaching of the resurrection and the repudiation of circumcision constituted the offence of the cross in Pauls day , so the preaching of the Bible standard of holiness and the renouncement of all sects became the offence of the cross at this time . We shall give several selections from the earlier issues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue of March 1 , 1881 , we have the following : <h> Branches <p> Where in the Bible do we find the idea of sects being branches , as people talk about ? " What branch of the church do you belong to ? " is a common expression in these times of antiscriptural language and practice . Why do not people read their Bibles better and learn that every individual believer is a branch in ChristJohn 15 ? <p> If a whole sect is a branch , then the individual must be a sub-branch ; but this would make each one dependent upon the sect for his union with , and life from , Christ . This would be secondhand salvation . We should not like to risk the couplingI prefer a direct union with Christ . <p> Taking Christs parable of the Vine and Branches , there is but one way to represent branch sects ; that is , imagine the branches adhering directly to the vine but pressed together and tightly bound into several bunches . Thus drawn together each bundle would have the appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found to consist of many branches each adhering to the vine , except a good many dead sticks , that had been killed by the unnatural confinement , and had rotted loose from the trunk . <p> We think it is the great business of the pure gospel sword of holiness to cut those soul-killing chords , that the Father may purge the several branches , and that they may all straighten out in natural positionlive , grow , and bear fruit unto holiness . <p> His account of how he was led to sever his connection with the holiness association , which he began to see was but a milder form of sectism , is given in an editorial for June 1 , 1881 : <h> That Ye Break Every Yoke <p> Saturday , April 22 , the hand of the Lord was heavily upon our soul , had no relish to converse with anyone but God . Finally in company with two brethren we went into the house of God at Hardinsburg , Indiana , and placed ourselves under the searching eye of God , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sects and yet belonging to an association that is based upon sect recognition . We promised God to withdraw from all such compacts . But being dearly attached to the holiness work , we attended the Association at Terre Haute , and tried to have the sect-endorsing clause removed from the constitution . Its substance is as follows , speaking of local associations : <p> " It shall consist of members of various Christian organizations and seek to work in harmony with all these societies . " <p> We had supposed that fellowship and cooperation should not exclude any person or truth that is in Christ Jesus , and that we should not be compelled to bow down to anything not in , nor of , Christ Jesus . <p> We were positively denied membership on the ground of not adhering to any sect . And now we wish to announce to all that we wish to cooperate with all Christians , as such , in saving souls but forever withdraw from all organisms that uphold and endorse sects and denominations in the body of Christ . <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken by T. K. Doty , the editor of the Christian Harvester . We present this article , and also two others , in order to show his argument on the question of the church and sects . <h> Square Come-Outism <p> " Probably this means the doctrine of coming out of all the sects , and giving the church of Christ no visible organization . " Christian Harvester <p> I wish to ask the editor of the Harvester if human sects are essential to the visible organization of Christ ? The above language so implies . <p> Then , according to this statement , the church of Christ was without a visible organization hundreds of years , until the present-day sects arose . And if the visible organization thus provided is a necessary adjunct to the church , then the apostle Peter made a mistake when he said that God had already " given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness. " * ( 2 Peter 1:3 ) <p> Again , if the formation of sects gives the church of Christ a visible organization , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the church , when that important event occurred ? <p> Was it when the first sect was formed , namely , the Roman Catholic sect , in the beginning of the apostasy ? Did she give the church of Christ a visible organization ? If so , what need of subsequent efforts at organization ? <p> We presume that the Harvester does not admit that this corrupt hierarchy is the church of Christ . So there was one sect formed , and Christs church still not visibly organized . <p> Out of her came the Church of England . She claims to be the identical church of Christ . Does the Harvester admit the assumption ? If not , then he must admit that a second sect failed to organize and represent the Church of Christ . <p> Again , from the old mother of sects came forth the Lutheran sect and her daughtersgranddaughters of Rome . Did any of them organize the visible church of Christ ? If so , which one ? <p> Or was it left for John Wesley to organize the church of Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sect is really the identical church of Christ , then the editor of the Harvester is in a hopeless condition , since severed from that body ; but we presume that he still felt that he was in the church of Christ after dismembered from that great sect , therefore it is not identical with the church of Christ , and her organization was not the organization of Christs church at all . <p> Having now followed two branches of Rome to the second generation without finding in any of these sister denominations the identical church of Christ , we must pass on to the third generation . <p> Is any of the sects that have branched out from the Methodist Episcopal sect the church of Christ ? If so , will the Harvester point out the one ? Will he assume that the one he represents is the church of Christ ? If so , then he has been without Christs church until recently . If not , then the founding of the Wesleyan Methodist sect was not the organization of the body of Christ . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one sect on earth is the identical church of God . <p> But it may be claimed by some that all the sects taken together constitute the true church in her visible organization . This is also a great mistake . How can all these bodies sum up the one organic visible church of God , when they have no organic relation to each other ? In what a disgraceful light sectism presents the church ! Does that look like a divine and heaven-born family , that is composed of numerous , rival , jealous , independent , and conflicting organisms ? Oh , I beseech you for Christs sake , do not dishonor God by confounding His church with Babylon confusion ! <p> Instead of sects giving the church of Christ a visible organization they mar and destroy the visible organization and unity of the church of Christ . A striking want of identity in the membership of Gods church and human sects also proves conclusively that no sect , nor yet all sects together , constitutes the divine fold . Their walls are not the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thresholds " his threshold . Many are in them who never entered Gods church , and , thank God , many have entered by Christ the door who have never attached themselves to any of the factions that are not of God , but the result of sin . If , then , the constituent elements of sects are not identical with the elements of Gods church , sects themselves are not identical with her , and consequently their organization is not her organization . <h> Questions Answered <p> ( August 15 , 1881 ) <p> First : " Does the come-out element constitute the true church of God ? " <p> Answer : All true Christians in heaven and earth constitute the true church of God ( Ephesians 3:15 ) . <p> Second : " In what particular is the separationist , or come-out church , better than the Wesleyan Methodist Church ? " <p> Answer : This language places antisect Christians in a false light . They never teach such a thing as a new sect , whose distinguishing characteristic is simply the coming out of all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is a false one . The Christians branded " come-outers " have founded no church or sect , nor do they intend to ; but , on the contrary , they have abandoned all sects to live in the one church that Christ founded , and into which we were inducted by regeneration . This fact is known by hundreds who nevertheless misrepresent them continually : this goes with them . Gods church is composed altogether of " come-outers . " The word church ( ecclesia ) means the " called out , " they are called out of the world , out of heathen religions , and all corrupt and bogus Christianity . But while the come-out element is embodied in the very word church , she is not to be called " Come-out " church . She embodies water baptism , but is not a Baptist church . She teaches the Sabbath , and the second advent , but is not a Sabbatarian nor Adventist church . Her members are all brethren , and united , but she is not the United Brethren church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subordinate elements of the system the center , and not God in Christ Jesus . But to the question . The Wesleyan Methodist sect is an organized party in Christendom , a schismatic , or cut-off party , all of which is condemned in the Bible . " There should be no schism in the body . " * ( 1 Corinthians 12:25 ) The origin of all such disintegrating factions , whether for Paul , Peter , or Wesley , is carnality , as the Word of God teaches , " the result of sin , " says the Harvester . The Wesleyan Methodist sect is human , fragmentary , and earthly , and will be utterly annihilated at the coming of Christ , with every other schismatic party . The church of the living God , in which " come-outers " inhere , to the exclusion of all human organisms , was purchased , built , and sanctified by Christ Jesus , who is its head , door , and foundation . It is the " pillar and ground of the truth , " and will stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Wherein does the come-out church excel the Wesleyan , and manifest its divine origin ? " <p> Answer : This is virtually a repetition of the question above answered . We have often said , Why do not opposers of holiness go to the standards of the doctrine and controvert what they say ? They never do . Again , we ask , Why do not sect apologists attack what " come-outers " teach ? They teach the one true and catholic church of the Biblethis can not be overthrown , therefore sect worshipers seek to hide their sin in misrepresenting all who abandon sects . Come out of Babylon , brother , then you can see much clearer . <h> The Shafting Giving Way <p> ( November 1 , 1881 ) <p> If it were not such a solemn thing , it would be really amusing to see how many are floundering about on the question of organized divisions in Christendom . They admit them evil , predict their downfall , and then , shrinking from the result of their own admissions , they fly to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the gospel of God to bear upon these ramparts of sin . <p> L. Hawkins , of the Banner of Holiness , admits the design of Christ is the spiritual and organic unity of all believers , and that an advanced degree of holiness would demolish these walls of separation , and then , as if alarmed at their fall , he pleads for their toleration at present . <p> The Harvester adds , " Then let us hail every sign of real unity as from the Lord , and , as holiness laborers , not be afraid when the temporary shafting of denominationalism begins to give way . " <p> So it is admitted that denominationalism is bolstered up with temporary shafting . This reminds us of a pamphlet we read some years ago , in defense of sect organizations . The writer confessed that the denominations were not the real " house of God , which is the church of the living God , " * ( 1 Timothy 3:15 ) but that they were necessary scaffolds for the erection of the house , and that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all be taken down . Well , in view of the prospects of Christs speedy coming we prefer to keep off of these old rickety , rotten-timbered scaffolds that are destined so soon to tumble down and be consumed with all the rubbish of Satans invention . For our part we are ready for the sect shafting to give way any day ; for we are builded into the house of God itself , and have nothing to lose or to fear . But many are not ready for the catastrophe . While fearing and even predicting the fall of those Dark Age structures , they are unwilling to abandon them . They sit trembling upon their lofty but narrow Methodist , Baptist , United Brethren , or Presbyterian plank , while with one hand they try to hold onto the walls of Gods church . We can always tell whether a man is resting upon one of these scaffolds or whether he is building only on Christ , the sure foundation . If on the latter , he has nothing to fear ; if on the former , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true priests of God blowing the trumpets about these walls . Such always think the time has not yet come to abolish sects and denominations . " Oh ! no ! Do not push against our scaffold poles yet ; be careful down there ! Please do n't  lean against that shafting , there is danger of its falling ! " <p> One dear minister took us aside at the Alvan ( Illinois ) camp meeting last summer and inquired of our views . We told him , of course , that we believed in no church but the body of Christ , etc . He conceded about all we contended for , but , unwilling to abandon his elevated plank , he humbly besought us not to be so hard on them . Poor fellow ! We think all had better climb down from these shaky concerns ; for God has announced of her plagues . " * ( Revelation 18:2,4 ) <p> " Then let us hail every sign of real unity as from the Lord , and not be afraid when the temporary shafting of denominationalism begins to give way . " This is good advice , but does Brother Doty walk in it ? Does he hail as from the Lord those whom the Spirit of God has led out of those cut-off parties , which divide the people of God , and who stand in the " one fold " * ( John 10:16 ) and body of Christ ? Or has he not done his best to represent them as teaching " no church , " " no organization , " and as building another sect , etc. ? Is it consistent to admit that sects are without a warrant in Gods Word , and that they are the " result of sin in the body of believers , " and express a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join with all the popular holiness journals in opposing those who have abandoned all those unscriptural schisms ? Is it consistent to say , " We do n't  want an ism gospel , " and yet adhere to and stuff the Harvester full of the gospel of Wesleyan Methodist-ism ? <p> An event that had to occur sooner or later was Brother Warners separation from the Northern Indiana Eldership . At the Eldership meeting which convened at Beaver Dam , Kosciusko County , Indiana , in October 1881 , he proposed some measures by which that body might be made to conform more perfectly to the Bible standard with reference to government . In this he would not be heard , and on their rejection of his reform measures he realized , probably for the first time , that the new Eldership , bent on continuing their human organization , was a sect with which he must sever his connection , and he then and there did so. * This event does not properly mark his coming out of spiritual Babylon , as some have supposed . In heart he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he ignorantly supposed that the Northern Indiana Eldership of the Church of God was not a sect and therefore that he was keeping clear of sects . Thus his act at Beaver Dam was a keeping out of Babylon as much as a coming out . It was the latter only in the outward sense , but of course it emphasized and gave more definite character to the anti-sectarian stand he had previously taken . <p> There were others in attendance at the Eldership meeting who had heard his preaching against spiritual Babylon and who also took the same step with him . They were David Leininger , William Ballenger and wife , and F. Krause and wife. * We give their names as being of those originals who declared themselves free from all outward forms of Babylon . <p> A similar thing occurred in Michigan . About the same time the Northern Indiana Eldership was formed , there originated near Pompeii , Gratiot County , Michigan , the Northern Michigan Eldership of the Church of God . This body was formed because its members had been isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctioned secrecy and was steeped in tobacco . About the fall of 1878 there joined this new Eldership J. C. Fisher and his wife , Allie R.* They had never heard of Brother Warner at that time . In the spring of 1880 , J. C. Fisher had occasion to visit Indiana on business , and it happened that while there he heard Brother Warner preach , and he accepted the doctrine of holiness and received the experience . The following autumn the Fishers sent for Brother Warner to come up to that part of Michigan and preach holiness . It was then that Allie R. consecrated for and also received the experience of sanctification.12 <p> 12 : <p> She relates that her consecration occurred in the house of an Elder Walker , and that so great was the power and manifestation of God in Brother Warner while he was praying for her that Walker and his wife through fright fled into another room , where he was found squatted in a corner . In Brother Warners report of this trip he speaks of a meeting near Laceys Lake ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was happy at this place to meet a people who have come out of various denominations , ignoring human creeds and sects and endeavoring to walk in the oneness of the Spirit . " <p> A year later , just before the annual meeting of the Eldership ( October 1881 ) , the Fishers and others , thinking to get the Eldership to accept holiness and thus make good the claim of being the true church , started a holiness meeting at Carson City , where the Fishers lived , and again had Brother Warner present . This was right after the meeting in Indiana where Brother Warner had declared his separation from the Northern Indiana Eldership . The situation was similar to what it had been in Indiana . Brother Warner had been preaching on the true church and setting forth its divine government , and the hope of these Michigan saints was that if they could get the Eldership to accept holiness they might get them to do away with the human machinery and fill the true church requirement . In this they were disappointed . Before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon this the Fishers and a good number of others , nearly twenty in all , withdrew from the Eldership. * <p> Thus there were two centers where a stand of independence with regard to the Eldership and human ecclesiasticism had been taken . These two congregations of saintsat Beaver Dam , Indiana , and Carson City , Michiganwere the earliest in the United States ( so far as the author knows ) who had stepped completely out of Babylon and had taken for their basis that of the New Testament church alone . An annual camp meeting was established at each place . <p> The Michigan saints in order to express in definite form their position and intentions drew up the following resolutions : <p> Whereas we recognize ourselves in the perilous times of the last days , the time in which Michael is standing up for the deliverance of Gods true saints ( Daniel 12:1 ) , the troublesome times in which the true house of God is being built again , therefore , <p> Resolved , That we will endeavor by all the grace of God to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " looking for , and hastening unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ , " who we believe is nigh , even at the door . <p> Resolved , That we adhere to no body or organization but the church of God , bought by the blood of Christ , organized by the Holy Spirit , and governed by the Bible . And if the Lord will , we will hold an annual assembly of all saints who in the providence of God shall be permitted to come together for the worship of God , the instruction and edification of one another , and the transaction of such business as the Holy Spirit may lead us to see and direct in its performance . <p> Resolved , That we ignore and abandon the practice of preachers license as without precept or example in the Word of God , and that we wish to be " known by our fruits " instead of by papers . <p> Resolved , That we do not recognize or fellowship any who come unto us assuming the character of a minister whose life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the Word of God . <p> Resolved also , That we recognize and fellowship , as members with us in the one body of Christ , all truly regenerated and sincere saints who worship God in all the light they possess , and that we urge all the dear children of God to forsake the snares and yokes of human parties and stand alone in the " one fold " * ( John 10:16 ) of Christ upon the Bible , and in the unity of the Spirit . <p> It should he noted that even at this time , while they could see the evils of human machinery in the church , they had not as yet a perfect knowledge of how the divine government would be . They wondered whether they should form a new Eldership or whether they had anything at all to do in the new procedure , cut loose as they were from all human organizations . At this time Sister Fisher was given a vision . It was of a tower which she and others were constructing with stones that were piled about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were engaged on the superstructure , their work being to polish the stones and fit them for the tower . When polished , the stones were clear as crystal . They were asked where they got such beautiful stones . She replied that they were simply such stones as could be found anywhere . Their beauty was brought out through the work that was put upon them . The capstone , or headstone , was also perfectly clear , but it had a blood-red spot in the center which shone and which shed rays of light like streaks of blood down through all the tower . <p> The vision seemed to her so wonderful . She awoke to a full consciousness and said , " Lord , what is it ? " He answered , " This is My church . " Immediately the Scriptures in 1 Corinthians 3:11-18 ; Ephesians 2:20-22 ; and 1 Corinthians 3:9 came to her mind . She then understood that the church was organized by God , and that it was mans part to work with Him and let Him be Leader and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body.13 <p> 13 : <p> This vision is very similar to the one recorded in The Shepherd of Hermas , in the second century . It was a remarkable coincidence that while Sister Fisher had never heard of the vision of The Shepherd of Hermas , she and her husband had ordered the set of books known as The Apostolic Fathers ( in which The Shepherd of Hermas is included ) , and on the same day of her vision the books were received and unpacked , and on looking into them her husband opened right at the vision in The Shepherd of Hermas . They were astonished to find that her vision was there recorded and explained as the church . <p> They soon learned to be led of the Spirit and that they were complete in Christ in matters of government as well as everything else . Conscious of their freedom from the bondage in which they had been held and that they had taken their stand on God alone , they were blessed with the Spirit of God upon them and their assemblies in a remarkable manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were satisfied . Thus the reformation had taken complete form . The light began to spread and the work became established in various places . A sister Harris , living near Bangor , in the southwestern part of Michigan , was called up to Gratiot County in July 1882 to attend the funeral of a niece . While there she heard J. C. Fisher preach and she invited him down to her part of the State . He went the following October and held meetings there , which were very successful , resulting in a number getting saved . An annual camp meeting was started there the next year . This camp meeting has been continued ever since , though it was taken to Grand Junction seven miles north in 1892 . Thus this part of the State was one of the first sections where the work of the reformation was established , and Grand Junction became , at a later date , the home of the publishing plant for a number of years . <p> That God was working on a similar line in other parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quoted in The Gospel Trumpet from The Christian Harvester . <h> Soul Prosperity Without the Pens <p> We extract the following from a letter in The Christian Harvester from E. Morgan , Maidstone , England : <p> " We have a number of people who enjoy holiness , men and women , old and young , who do not belong to any sect . They have the presence of the Holy Spirit with them in a much richer and more powerful way than the friends in the churches . This seems to indicate that the Lord will raise up an army to do His work , and perfect love will be the uniting power that will keep them one . " <p> It is not at all to be wondered at that those who have obeyed God and come out of all human sects should have a superior degree of Gods grace and Spirit with them , who are free from the oppression and interdiction that we hear so much of in all our holiness papers . Yes , God is now raising up that holy army who stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love of God . From the above , we see , as well as from the testimony of hundreds in this country , that the assertion that coming out of sectism results in spiritual death is a groundless falsehood . The result is always the opposite , unless it be in some instances where souls have been overwhelmed with the hellish rage and deceitful , persecuting spirit of the sects , which has induced a super indignation . <p> Brother Warners separation from the Northern Indiana Eldership was the subject of comment by his contemporary editors and others . His reply to a letter on the subject of his leaving the church is here given . <p> A dear brother writes to us as follows : " I think you have erred in leaving the Church of God , and yet God is blessing you and The Trumpet . " <p> To talk about " leaving the church of God and yet receiving the blessing of God , " is Babylon confusion . There is absolutely no way given under heaven and among men whereby we can leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and obedience to Jesus Christ , or falling into and continuing in sin ; in which case God does not and can not continue His blessings upon that soul as before . Therefore , when certain preachers in Ohio published that I had left the church ( which was false , for they themselves cast me out of their synagogue for the crime of preaching real experimental holiness ) , they declared the fact that what they worship in the name of the " Church of God " is only a " creature " of men , to which they invite members and report " accessions " through a different process than that of regeneration , which is the only means of accession to Gods church . And when people talk of our having left the church , because we withdrew last fall from a human corporation called the " Northern Indiana Eldership of the Church of God , " they simply show that the devils counterfeits still pass current with them ; they call that the church which does not answer the Bible description of the church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marks of the beast , and the number of his name ! <p> The Bible speaks of churches of God in Galatia , in Achaia , in Asia , etc. , but we do not read of any northern , southern , eastern or western Galatian , Achaian , or Asiatic Elderships of the church of God . You see this thingNorthern Indiana Eldership of the Church of Godis too long for any use , so we just take the broad ax of Gods Word and chop it in two between " of " and " the " and throw the first part to the moles and bats , according to the sayings of the prophet ( Isaiah 2:20 ) . Then we have the church of God left , which is the body of Christ , " the fulness of him that filleth all in all . " * ( Ephesians 1:23 ) Glory to God and the Lamb , we are " complete in him " * ( Colossians 2:10 ) ! <p> If some more would suffer the excision of this useless appendage , there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fulness . " The term " Eldership " as used in this case , is both contradictory in itself and a perversion of Gods Word . Where the apostle Paul speaks of " laying on of the hands of the presbytery , " * ( 1 Timothy 4:14 ) the Bible Union and some other versions render " hands of the eldership , " and I think correctly , too . So I accept the word " eldership " as a Biblical term . But what is its obvious meaning ? Simply the elders of the church in one locality , or in a district , or country , as the case may be . To apply it therefore to an organized corporation is a misapplication , a perversion of one of the words of Gods Holy Book . It is contradictory , and asserts a falsehood , because the corporate " body " to which it is applied is not composed of elders , but of brothers and sisters , a few elders , and without doubt some sinners and backsliders ; so this use of the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " * ( Romans 1:25 ) Like every other body that is not identical with the body of Christ , this " new Eldership , " as it is often called , is a rival of the body of Christ , and is used by the devil to generate party spirit and sectish bigotry . Nothing is more natural than the disposition of carnality to want to get up something besides the glorious church of the Firstborn . <p> The reason is obvious . Christ built His own church , adds the members , and spews out the unworthy ; " He is the head of the body , the church , " * ( Colossians 1:18 ) the only real ruling power , except as He chooses to execute His will through some of the members . Hence this gives no place to aspirants who wish to work up something that men can build , so as to receive the glory , and become lords over the work of their hands . As Sister MCreery says in her history of the origin of the Free Methodistsduring the six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let God build up His own church , and receive all the glory , the Spirit was with them in mighty power to save souls , because they had no craft to look after ; but after they set up the Free Methodist idol , it was all , " He o he , go up Free Methodism ! " And ceasing to work exclusively for Gods kingdom of righteousness , peace , and joy in the Holy Spirit , and founding another sect , that they call " Our Church , " they necessarily became double-eyed , and lost the real power of God . So after our meeting last fall we heard the call to rally up the party spirit ; and to apologize for the addition of this sect corporation to the several hundred already in the mazes of Babylon , it was called the " Northern Indiana Eldership of the Church of God , opposed to Secret Societies . " Just as though the church that Christ himself founded did not oppose secret societies , therefore it is necessary to form another " body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an insult to God ; even their formation implies that we are not complete in Christ , hence the " necessity , " as B. T. Roberts said , of our organizing another sect . <p> The Trumpets New Years greeting , at the dawn of its second year , has an interesting tone . <h> New Years Greeting <p> To all who may read this Trumpet , and especially to all who love the truth , we send you our brotherly greeting , a " Happy New Year , " and a heartfelt " God bless you . " Our heart overflows with love and gratitude to God , and all His loving saints , for all the benefits and mercies that filled the expiring year . Dearly beloved friends and patrons of The Trumpet , and lovers of its hated truth , we are happy to report from this watchtower of Zion that we see nothing but success , victory , and glory . A beloved father in Israel in New York on first seeing The Trumpet recently wrote us of his inexpressible gratitude , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago , but says he , " There was no one interested in the truth , that seemed to have sufficient means to undertake the project . " Well , glory to God . He has chosen the weak things , and the moneyless , to carry on a work which to all human appearances , in this sect-loving and idolatrous age , could not be accomplished without considerable capital , and on a free basisthe wonderful work of God . How has he " surprised the hypocrites , " * ( Isaiah 33:14 ) and confounded the prophets of Babylon ! G. D. Watson but uttered the predictions and carnal prayers of thousands when he said through an antichrist sheet in this place , " Brother Warner can not succeed in that line . " What is this but a thrust at Jesus Christ ! It virtually says to the Son of God : " In the prosperity of our churches , there can be nothing but failure in the attempt to build up Gods Church. " Oh , these devotees of Babylon would blot out of existence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen hundred years ago , to augment the glory of our " great Methodist Church " founded less than a hundred and fifty years ago ! <p> Well , Brother Warner may have failed in many respects , but no man that reads The Trumpet can deny the fact that God and truth have most gloriously triumphed . And The Trumpet , too , through the God-approved truth it holds forth , has proved a glorious success , notwithstanding the different measures Satan has devised to hedge up its way . One poor whited sepulcher had the impudence to say with a satanic chuckle , " We will crush The Trumpet " and " take all Brother Warners subscribers . " A gentleman in this city when asked to take the chaff , and baby soap , sheet , remarked , " If you succeed with this paper will it not break down The Trumpet ? " and received the following reply : " Thats just what we want to do . " He told a brother this , and said he did not think there was much holiness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , M. L. Haney , who was canonized at the Jacksonville convention as " the Patriarch of Holiness in the West " and everywhere else , is so blind that he has twice presumed to intimate that that enterprise might be of God , saying , " If your paper is of God . " Nearly all the professed holiness periodicals have been hauling barrels of water and pouring on the altar of Gods truth and filling up the trench round about : but God is all the more glorified in this test between The Trumpet and the prophets of sects . Praise His name ! <p> The Gospel Trumpet has proved Satan false in more than one way . In all love , we suggest to all those papers and preachers that have been in the habit of telling the people that " separation from the sects invariably results in spiritual death " to read The Trumpet , then shut their mouths , and cease their lying against the truth . There is not a sect-endorsing paper in the land that presents as strong array of testimony to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fruitful lives . And we have abundance of live , glowing reports and experiences that we have not had space to use , and nearly all have spared us the necessity of telling you that the writers are without the camp of creed factions . We have published numerous expressions of appreciation , because , by their strong relish for the truths of The Trumpet coupled with their vigorous spiritual health and usefulness in Christ , they condemn all who reject the food we issue , as perverted and spiritually diseased . To the former class The Trumpet is heavenly music ; but to the latter , it is an annoying sound , because their hearts and ears are not sufficiently circumcised to endure sound doctrine . The Trumpet has demonstrated the fact that God is able to carry a war against the devil in his strongest , last , and most desperate fortress . <p> God has in a remarkable manner heard and answered our prayers ; not always however in the way we expected , but far better than we imagined . Last spring we prayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnace of trial through which He brought us was better for our soul than a hundred presses and ten thousand subscribers . Glory to the God of Daniel , and the Hebrews ! Oh , what lessons we have learned in the salt and fire school of Christ ! We would gladly pull the lever of the Lords good old hand press for forty years to come , rather than have missed those furnace-wrought visions of God , of His church , and of the great sect abomination . To all the patrons of The Trumpet , we would return many thanks for the means you have furnished the Lords cause , and the many appreciated contributions you have sent us by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit . You have largely made the paper what it is , and by your continued labor of love and sacrifice for Christs sake you will continue to improve and enlarge the paper and extend its sphere of usefulness . We regard the real testing point in The Trumpet as past ; God has established the work of our hands . Our circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers each issue , sixteen fifty this time , and we do not have fifty papers left when we get through mailing . The demand for canvassing and sample copies continually increases . <p> To Babylon and all her concomitants , we promise nothing but fire , sword and hammer , and confounding blasts from the armory of Gods Word . We have scarcely begun the bombardment of the wicked harlot city . By the grace of God , we expect to deal with sin and sinners as we never yet have done . Some have intimated to us that we have been too personal in rebuking Church sinners : but , before God , we are ashamed of and repent for our mildness and want of personality in the past . And now we give fair warning to hypocrites , and all whose walk has not been upright before God , that if you do n't  repent and publish your confession of sin , the Lord has made it our duty , so far as we know , to expose and rebuke you before all . We know no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no man . If God can not carry on the paper by us seeking only to please Him , The Trumpet will surely be discontinued . But God is our sufficiency . " I shall not want . " * ( Psalm 23:1 ) " For the Lord God will help me ; therefore shall I not be confounded : therefore have I set my face like a flint , and I know that I shall not be ashamed . " * ( Isaiah 50:7 ) <p> While it is our duty to reprove all outward sin , we must keep the fact prominent that all reform must begin at the heart , which God only can change ; inward transformation is only upon the condition of faith , and , therefore , must be definitely presented in the Scriptural order of pardon and adoption to the sinner , and entire sanctification to the believer . We regret that some attempt to beat down the ice mountain of sect by the hammer of the Word , without the melting fire of the Holy Spirit . Getting people out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for heart purity and the reception of the Comforter , which leads the soul from all sects and into all truth , is but enlisting men into carnal crusade against Babylon , and can result in little good , and has , in some instances , hedged up the way and turned back the tide of Gods truth more than it will be are to advance it . Because the Bible experience of entire sanctification is the true objective of Christs atonement and shed blood , and because thorough holiness destroys sects and denominations , as frost would disappear under the beams of the June sun , and as the promotion of true holiness is the only remedy for schisms and every other form of sin in the body of professed Christians , therefore The Gospel Trumpet shall continue to " praise the beauty of holiness " * ( 2 Chronicles 20:21 ) and proclaim the power of the blood of Christ on the gospel line of definite holiness and perfect heart purity . We ask the cooperation and prayers of all true saints of God , who love the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reformation were disseminated largely by The Gospel Trumpet , and in many parts of the country there were those with whom its teachings found a hearty welcome . A few bits of correspondence addressed to Brother Warner and taken from The Trumpet of early in 1882 are here presented . <p> I like The Trumpet very well ; hope it may sound out long , loud , and clear to call the people back to the old paths , the good way . Yes , truly it is the good way , the strait and narrow way , the new and living way , and the high and holy way . You may count me a subscriber as long as The Trumpet sticks to the Bible . <p> Your brother purified and being tried , E. B. B. <p> He keeps them that put their trust in him .

K. <p> In the issue of January 16 , 1882 , Brother Warner answers a number of criticisms by contemporary editors . <h> To Our Contemporaries <p> " Modern come-outism , or , better said , no-churchism . We hold that uniting with the people of God in church fellowship , even of our own choice , does not necessarily constitute us sectarians . " <p> Gospel Banner <p> In all love we would ask our kind Brother Brenneman to inform us of those modern " no-church " men of whom he speaks ; give us the address of any man professing godliness who believes in and claims membership in no church . <p> Second . Is the body of Christ no church ? <p> Third . If there is any way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Spiritif the church is something that men open the door of and admit members intoplease give us " thus saith the Lord " for it . <p> Fourth . If uniting with one party or sect of the professed people of God does not constitute one a sectarian , then why should union with a Masonic Lodge constitute a man a Freemason ? <p> Fifth . If a person is in Christ Jesus , is he not in the church , and is he not already joined to all others that are joined to the Lord ? <p> Pure Religion very smartly , as she supposes , ranks " come-outers " with " all other sects , " by which she virtually admits that they are as good as the others , and then says that it takes the following elements to make a good " come-outer " : <p> 1 . It is necessary that the person be " turned out of some church , " meaning of course one of those " other sects , " for a little sober , candid reflection upon the Bible will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true church at all ; for " the Lord added to the church daily such as should be or , were being saved , " * ( Acts 2:47 ) " and no man or ecclesiastical court is able to pluck them out of his hand . " * ( John 10:29 ) <p> If the Editress of Pure Religion were half as zealous to know what the Bible teaches as she is to exhibit her wit , she would doubtless have learned that the church is not something that men organize and admit members into , but that it is " a holy temple in the Lord , " * ( Ephesians 2:21 ) " Gods husbandry Gods building . " * ( 1 Corinthians 3:9 ) <p> 2 . The Editress thinks that to be a good " come-outer " the person should have a small stock of religion and " quite a good stock of ignorance . " We presume that she did not consider that in those words she condemned as nearly graceless and very ignorant such men as Luther , Melancthon , Fox , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood out of and condemned all sects and did not contemplate joining or forming any , wielded their greatest power for God . <p> The Good Way recently informed us that Wesley never contemplated the forming of a sect . What was he then but a " come-outer " ? It is an undeniable fact upon record that he deplored the unhappy divisions and parties of Christendom . <p> It is the uniform testimony of the history of the Reformation that every reform effort was attended by a much greater power and demonstration of the Spirit of God before it culminated in a new sect than ever was manifest in that sect afterward . I think I can safely challenge a single exception to this fact . During ten years labor in the denomination that grew out of the labors of J. Winebrenner and his coworkers , it was the constant admission of the old fathers and mothers that no such power of God had been witnessed in that body as was before they assumed and received the name of another religious denomination . The same is true of early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Free Methodists . Let me give you a few extracts from the History of the Origin of Free Methodism , by Sister Sidney MCreery , who with her husband , Joseph MCreery , was associated with B. T. Roberts and William Kendall from the beginning of the great holiness revival that resulted in their separation from the Methodist Episcopal sect . Hence she testifies what she knows and declares what she has seen . <p> The record is that for six years they worked and prospered wonderfully under the power of God and freedom from all sect yokes , and that from the formation of a new sect by B. T. Roberts the glory departed from the Nazarites , as they had been called . She says : <p> B. T. Roberts in his discipline says the Free Methodist organization was a necessity . Was it ? Let the hundreds testify who were wonderfully and lovingly united together in the Holy Ghost . The truth is this : Gods heritage and work were spoiled by the laying on of mans hands . <p> While enjoying this spiritual fellowship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on , the saints rejoiced , and the sectarian devil was mad , sinners in Zion were afraid and trembled as they saw the weakest saint upon his knees . <p> B. T. Roberts started out with a trap in hand , making a new test of fellowship . He visited far and wide among the live pilgrims , preaching sect fellowship as the one thing needful , and that they could go no further without it . <p> In most cases it took them by surprise . They examined themselves and reasoned thus : We are already in fellowship with the Father , Son , and Holy Ghost , and in holy spiritual fellowship with the saints , and God has given us the victory again and again while fighting against the unholy sects . What can the sect yoke do for us ? We are now free to go everywhere preaching and teaching in the name of Jesus . Thus many stood out for a while . Oh , what robbery , what treachery , to pervert and use this work of God , which began so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfish organism ! At every gathering , large or small , the sect yoke was presented and held forth as " the cross . " <p> My husband was satisfied with Gods way of ordering the battle ; yea , more than satisfied , he rejoiced and was exceeding glad to see the prosperity of Zion in our midst . While B. T. R. said in action by the formation of his sect , " I have suffered enough reproach and shame ; I will number Israel and become as other nations , " then the work of building up " our church " commenced . How the enemy triumphed ! At all the gatherings the spirit of sectarian zeal was worked up to the highest pitch , and so fulfilling is blessed for ever . " * ( Romans 1:25 ) <p> And today he ( B. T. R. ) has no more influence than any other sect bishop , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them who did well . From this time the battle of the Lord ceased and the enemies rejoiced . Some who remember the former days of liberty and power ask B. T. R. why the same power is not manifested now as formerly . He answers on this wise : God then gave the people a special blessing for a special work . Very good ; but why not continue under these special blessings and in this special work ? What an absurdity , what inconsistency to build another sect in order to go through the same variations and evolutions of its predecessors ! Was it pleasing in the sight of God to manufacture another class of backsliders ? Was it a necessity ? Wherever I go I find the burden of Free Methodist preaching is to backslidden membership , whereas before its formationwhile they remained in Gods order , where He placed themevery man , woman , and child was able to do a full days work . In visiting many places I find them ( the F. M.s ) nearly , if not quite , extinct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when they begin proselyting and making it a " necessity " to gather them into their peck measure , then the Lord leaves them to themselves . As I am passing through the land I often meet with those with whom I was acquainted during the war of the Lord , and immediately they refer to the former days of power and salvation and say , " We do n't  have such meetings nowadays ; I would go a long distance to enjoy such privilege . " <p> We might multiply quotations , but these will suffice to show the fact that the formation of sects is the destruction of Christianity . Thus it is an undeniable fact , that when men enjoyed the stigmatized " come-out " " stock of ignorance , " they have been used of God far more than after they suddenly became " wise " in building up a wall about themselves or entering a sect pen built by some one else . <p> The Vanguard calls coming out of Babylon " a kind of spiritual rash " ; and Pure Religion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up to their readers . May the Lord forgive this lightness . Had we not better look into the Word of God and see what the Lord saith , than to indulge in mere witticisms ? Does the Word of God teach that it is a " spiritual rash " to belong to Christ alone and hold only to Him , " the head over all things to the church , Which is his body , the fulness of him that filleth all in all " * ( Ephesians 1:22-23 ) ? Was Christ afflicted with a spiritual rash when he said , " There shall be one fold and one shepherd " * ( John 10:16 ) ? Was that the infirmity that Paul had when he said " there should be no schism in the body " * ( 1 Corinthians 12:25 ) no Methodist schism , no Wesleyan schism , no Free Methodist bond schism , nor United Brethren ; yea , no schism ? <p> Now , brethren , if you dare drop the scales from your eyes and look squarely at the Holy Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations which you call churches are schisms , just what God condemns and forbids . Unless you are shamefully blind , you know it to be the truth and nothing but the truth , and your slurs and sarcasms can not revoke that truth nor enable you to stand when you are judged by it . <p> There are other exchanges that have uttered hard things against the Rock on which I stand . Now , I simply want you to know what you are doing , then if you wish to continue kicking against the goads , you may do so . Do you believe that Christ purchased and founded one church of the living God ? Do you believe that the " body of Christ " is the church ? Do you believe that Christ is the only door to the church , and that by him " if any man enter he shall be saved " * ( John 10:9 ) ? Do you believe that the Holy Spirit sets the members in the body , the church ? Do you believe there should be " no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believers are " made perfect in one " * ( John 17:23 ) and that " thorough holiness destroys sects and denominations " ? Do you believe that " divisions and offences are contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned " * ( Romans 16:17 ) of Christ ? Do you believe that Christians should not be " unequally yoked together with unbelievers " * ( 2 Corinthians 6:14 ) ? <p> In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I ask any paper to speak out and tell me which of these points you dispute . And if you say you believe them all , as some of you have , then I ask , Why do you object to my believing the same ? For that is just what I believe . The only difference is , I act consistently with my faith , while you say and do not . <p> You admit there is but one church of God , still you think hard of me for not allowing that all your " churches " are of God . This is Gods truth and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , but advise Gods children to continue in the wrong . I claim that sects are wrong , and therefore say , " Come out from among them , " * ( 2 Corinthians 6:17 ) as saith the Lord . Men professing godliness should act consistently with their belief . <p> If you believe that Christ is divided and there are many folds , many bodies , many Lords , many faiths , instead of " one fold , " " one body , " " one Lord , " and " one faith , " then you may consistently with your faith antagonize The Gospel Trumpet ; but you must abide the consequences of fighting against Gods Word . And remember this , that in the day of judgment it will do you no good to have put false colors on the truth you are opposing . You will not plead before the bar of God that I taught " no-churchism , " " no organization , " etc . <p> If you are ignorant of The Trumpets teaching , you will be condemned before God for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . You should hold your peace until you know what you are talking about . <p> If you do know what wemyself and contributorsteach , you know that every paper insists on organization , the very organization set forth in the New Testament , and you do know that we all advocate the church , and never have encouraged anybody to leave her ; but we chose to learn from the simple Word of God what the church is , and not from your Dark Age creeds and confused tongues . Now , all you who have lifted up your heel against Christ and His body , the only true church in heaven and earth , have done so because you have some sect idol in your heart and can not receive the truth or endure sound doctrine , or else you have not the moral courage to assault the devil in his stronghold of divisions . What does Satan care for your clamor against the " sin in the sects " so long as you give him the best means of bringing Gods house or kingdom to naughtthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May God give you all repentance to the acknowledging of the truth . <p> An editorial in the July 25 number answers an objection by the editor of The Sword . <h> Thats Right <p> Brother Dolan makes a sweeping cut with his Sword like this : " Sectism is of the devil , and no-sectism is of the devil . " <p> Amen . That 's true . An ism spirit may attach itself to any principle , false or true . <p> As many sects have been developed by making a center of some subordinate point of the Christian system as by rallying upon some mere human tradition . <p> Whether men worship the moon or an idol of their own make , it is an equal insult to God ; and whether men worship a gospel principle , or a doctrine of devils , is of little if any difference in the sight of God . Either case is idolatry ; because Christ is supplanted as the center by something else either subordinate or foreign . When men get a chronic lopsidedness , so that they will scan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they see nothing on their hobby , whether it be sect or anti-sect , Sabbath or anti-sabbath , or anything else , notwithstanding it may contain much good , pure food , many blessed thoughts about Jesus , they have put something else in the place of Christ , and their religion runs about like a grindstone with its axis near the outer circumference and passing diagonally through the stone . <p> We once heard a Disciple preacher say that every sect that holds some truth that no other sect holds , has a right to its existence . This provides for as many sects as there are truths in the religion of Christ , but God allows " no schism in the body . " * ( 1 Corinthians 12:25 ) Nothing but the exclusive " holding the Head , " " seeing Jesus only , " and the full enjoyment and constant " praising of the beauty of holiness , " * ( 2 Chronicles 20:21 ) can keep us from all isms . <p> A selection from The Vanguard , copied in The Trumpet shows the spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this time drifted because of a failure to follow as God was leading . <h> Backslidden <p> Brother Brooks in the last number of The Banner ( and his authority as the oldest holiness editor in the country can not be doubted ) says that the aggressiveness has gone out of the holiness movement , and ceasing to be aggressive it is a dying thing . In most places its numbers are decreasing , only a few accessions . <p> Well , he tells the truth . The holiness people as a general thing through the country are backslidden from God . A large percentage of them never had anything but a reclaimed backslidden experience to leave . They got back to God and called it by the new name of holiness , taught to do so by superficial teachers that wanted to swell The Banner reports . <p> The chief cause of this awful declension that has rolled back the tide of the salvation of the world a decade is that the editors and evangelists , failing to become more and more aggressive at every point against sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have backslidden as a class . <p> Brother Brooks told me he could not put radical truth into The Banner without Brother Haney and Brother Kent and other such temporizers writing and denouncing him ; so Brother Brooks would yield and backslide from Holy Ghost power . <p> Brother Isaiah Reid told Brother Sherman he did not want anything in his paper that would indicate that the holiness people were not all right ; he was planning to have The Highway as a support for his old age . A year ago he called for a thousand " firemen " in the holiness work as the only thing needed . He has spent his energies this year in regulating the fiery come-outers from wrecking the train , and evidently wants the oaks of Bashan slashed down with a little hatchet , and not with a broadax . Rams horns , goad sticks , and the un-sectarian " jaw-bone of an ass " Philistine-killer , he evidently does not take much stock in . Brothers Inskip and Macdonald are not square on the Freemason question and are churchy . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only is the real thing , much of the spirit is gone . You may call it fault-finding , sour godliness , or whatever you please , these are Gods facts about your case . You know the whole batch of you are afraid to throw red-hot truth uncompromisingly everywhere . We except from this catalog Baker and Arnold of The Free Methodist , Warner of The Trumpet , Johnson of The Stumbling Stone ( if he had the Holy Ghost ) , and The Sword , and some others . <p> Now Brother editors and evangelists , suffer the word of exhortation from a " jaw-bone , " break up your fallow ground , do your first works , burn up Haneys chapter on dress , not resolve against it ; pay your debts , or go and acknowledge them at least ; cease to print such dawdle as Brother Bryants church holiness writings ; seek for and get the Holy Ghost again ; and lead the people up into the land . <p> Vanguard <p> Satanic forces were arrayed against the reformation work in every conceivable way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though this form of attack was usually instigated by the sectarian element ) , but also by deceptionby teachers and editors who were apparently right on some main question in order to deceive , but wrong on some other vital points . A writer in The Trumpet points out one of these destructive agencies . <h> A Destructive Heresy <p> By D. W. MLaughlin <p> There is an eternal antagonism between true holiness and fanaticism in all its phases , and the individual possessed of the fullness of the Holy Ghost will be able to detect fanaticism in others , whether it be in outward act or deportment or in the more subtle form of heretical teaching . The Spirit and the Word agree , and the Holy Spirit moves and works in harmony with the written Word and never contrary thereto . <p> The writer has been receiving from time to time during the last four years copies of The Stumbling Stone , and while much truth is found in its columns as to the evils of sect divisions , the destructive heresy of Count Zinzendorf that sanctification is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gospel order . Consequently , from this standpoint , the holiness movement is of the devil , and the second-grace Christians are in need of the first grace . The Stumbling Stone seems to attack every movement extant , even to the Salvation Army , as well as all holiness associations and bands for the promotion of entire sanctification . Even the position of The Gospel Trumpet he calls a holiness schism , because the editor makes a distinction between justified and sanctified believers . And he proposes to " kick Brother Warners justification cobhouse into pi , " by which he exhibits his ignorance of the real plan of salvation He might as well talk of kicking Gods Word into pi as to overthrow the two distinct works of grace , justification and sanctification . <p> By the above and similar remarks The Stumbling Stone editor reveals the antagonism in his heart to the " second grace " in the Bible economy of salvation . Now , my honest conviction is that a come-outism that sets itself squarely against holiness as a definite experience subsequent to pardon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wholly saved souls who are spiritual and discerning men detect at once the carnality in such persons , and , quite naturally , are led to conclude that " if such spirits are the fruits of come-outism I will have nothing to do with it . " Thus , this spurious anti-holiness come-outism is a snare of Satan to deter honest souls from separating from sectism , leaving them under the pressure of unholy corporations , which often results in compromise and the loss of the Spirit of God . A come-outism that sets itself to fighting the sects in a vindictive spirit , condemning and unchristianizing all who do not at once come out , can not be of God . Let us lead the children of God to the true apostolic unity , but never attempt to drive them out of Babylon ; and , above all things , let us keep sweet and deal kindly with persons who , under the blinding influence of sectarian education , can not yet see the sin of sects , and the true church of God . <p> Sound teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utmost importance . False doctrinal theories and extravagant notions cause untold disaster to the cause we represent . <p> In the issue of May 1 , 1883 , when The Trumpet was yet printed at Cardington , Ohio , Brother Warner speaks of how the cause was sifted at that place . <h> Salt in Cardington <p> Gods cause has passed through a terrible sifting in this place . All the powers of darkness and of Satans hellish rage have been let loose upon the few loyal , holy little ones here . Wicked sect members have boasted that this cause was crushed out . One Methodist son of Belial , steeped in tobacco and the poison smoke of his torment , has even boasted through the secular press that he had succeeded in putting down holiness . A Quaker preacher and family have let their tongues run with the base , vulgar , and profane of the place in speaking against this way . But bless God , the devil is sadly mistaken . Several souls have recently become established , unblameable in holiness . The Lord is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings every week , and God is wonderfully blessing us . <p> In the chapter on " The Gospel Trumpet " we have already referred to the trying ordeal through which Brother Warner had to pass while the Publishing Office was in Bucyrus , Ohio , in 1883 . A general assembly of the saints in Ohio was announced to be held on Friday , November 9 . The place was Annapolis ( now called Sulphur Springs ) , seven miles northeast of Bucyrus . In Brother Warners call to this first general assembly in Ohio he wrote as follows : <p> We expect to see a large turnout of the saints of the living God from Van Wert , Paulding , and Wood Counties , and some from eastern Ohio ; and come ye , dear ones , from Pennsylvania . Come , O ye sanctified hosts of the Lord ! Let us eat together in the name of our Chief Shepherd and only Head and Leader . Come in the power of the Spirit ; come to have the spiritual gifts stirred up and strengthened ; come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the faith once delivered to the saints developed in us up to the Bible standard ; come to make a more perfect consecration . Come , O ye lame and halt and blind and deaf , for the power of the Lord will be present to heal all who believe on Him . Come , O ye sufferers , and give yourselves up to the mighty God and be made whole . Come , poor sinners , and be saved in the day of His power . Come , O ye poor and wayward Christians , and have your hearts established unblameable in holiness . Come , ye who are in bondage of sect captivity , and learn your way out of the wilderness unto the city that is set upon a hill , which hath foundations , and whose builder and maker is God . Come from far and near , whoever seeks the old paths and the peace of Jerusalem . Come , for the little ones will make you of life freely . " * ( Revelation 22:17 ) <p> Little did he realize , when giving this invitation and bold promise of such benefit to all who should have any need of the divine favor , that Satan would come also with various forms of deception , and attempt to divert the reformation movement into false channels and to so confuse the truth with clouds of error and fanaticism that men may not see it . <p> The meeting began on Friday evening at Conlay Bethel , some distance in the country from Bucyrus . Saturday , the second day , was appointed a fast day . The first conflict came with some elements of fanaticism manifested by three men from Van Wert and Paulding Counties , who believed it wrong to wear collars , collar buttons , lace , eye-glasses , etc. , and confessed that they came to the meeting purposely to make Brother Warner and the other saints take off these things . They were a great interruption of the meeting until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great humility . They prostrated themselves on three sides of the table behind which Brother Warner was preaching , and would moan and groan during his discourse . <p> On Saturday evening the meeting was moved to the hall at Annapolis . Here another element was met . L. H. Johnson , who published in Toledo a paper called The Stumbling Stone , had arrived , and even before the evening service began had mounted a wagon and begun to teach his false doctrine . He rejected the New Testament ordinances and also opposed sanctification as a second work of grace , though he was also on the anti-sectarian line . He was very bold to break in on the meeting with his harangue against the true way , which he did particularly on Sunday . On Sunday evening the saints , wishing to get away from the confusing and delusive elements , withdrew to a private house where they felt they had escaped from the atmosphere impregnated with devils , and where the meeting continued victoriously all nightuntil 5 A.M. On the next day , Monday , at 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time the deceiving elements appeared and undertook to get the upper hand . The saints , being forbidden in the Scriptures to have any fellowship with devils withdrew to another room , where the meeting progressed peacefully . One sister ventured to stay in the room occupied by the false teachers . She was suddenly seized by the awful powers of darkness and she felt she was lost . To a sister who came to her she said , " Oh , I feel so bad ; take me to the altar ! " She was led to the saints apartment , where she bowed at the altar and soon began to manifest a frightful appearance . She jerked and cried , " I have a devil ; stay away from me ! " Her face blackened and twitched with frightful contortions , her eyes glared , her tongue darted out like a serpents , and when anyone approached her , she would spit and claw furiously . Hands were laid on her and she was instantly delivered and clothed in her right mind . <p> This was but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Tuesday evening , and on the whole with victory on Gods side , but it had been a trying time indeed . Brother Warner devoted a whole page of The Trumpet to the report of this Assembly . We quote the beginning of the report : <p> We have never been called upon to portray any meeting that so transcends our powers of description . We can now better understand the language of John when he said that " if that should be written . " * ( John 21:25 ) A full account of the meeting would make quite a volume . For some time we felt that the meeting would be one of unusual interest . As we received intelligence of the saints coming from time to time , the Spirit of God was poured upon our soul , insomuch that we could not restrain the praises of God as we walked the streets . And their coming was as the heavens bowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day on Friday , and in the evening we all went to the Conlay Bethel , where the meeting began . Since the first assembly in Michigan , where Satan was also loosed and a terrible conflict ensued , resulting in his being cast out , all the meetings of the sanctified and free saints of God that we have attended have been blessed with great unity and peace ; and as there were such a host coming to this assembly , all of which we knew were of one mind and one heart in the truth and Spirit of Christ , and most of whom had never met before , we looked for a meeting that would be a sample of the reign of heaven . How apt we are to forget that we are still in the field of battle , and that Satan is now loosed for a little season , having great wrath because he knows his time is short ! In the very first meeting we felt that Satan had also gathered his angels together where the sons of God came to worship the God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the brethren and sisters had been previously shown by visions some of the things that occurred at this meeting . The Lord was on the side of His saints and vindicated the righteousness of His cause by manifesting Himself in their meetings as well as to their spiritual consciousness . Outwardly , of course , the meeting bore an aspect of confusion ; but Brother Warner learned to see the good in everything . Referring , at a later date , to this assembly , he said : <p> This providential bringing together of the children of light and the powers of darkness has proved a great blessing to the saints in that it has clearly brought to light which side men occupy . <p> The Bucyrus assembly was but one engagement with the forces that at this time had gathered to oppose and overthrow the reformation work which Brother Warner and The Trumpet had begun . Other instruments were to figure in the struggle , and another terrific battle was soon to follow . There were two prominent holiness teachers who were not in sympathy with Brother Warners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denominationalism . R. S. Stockwell was a young minister who had helped in the meetings , and who had been loved and respected by both Brother Warner and Sister Warner , but had become exalted in himself and deceived , and had sprung a very pernicious doctrine , the doctrine of marital celibacy . He held that the sex relation was carnal ; that when a person was fully cleansed , the love for a husband or wife was no more than the love for anyone else ; especially , that if a husband and wife were not in harmony it would be wrong for them to maintain the conjugal relation or be to each other anything more than to anyone else ; and that they would have more love for others with whom they were in harmony than for their own companion , etc . The attainment along this line was an advanced experience , a sort of third work of grace . <p> Sister Warner was a splendid woman and had been a faithful companion to her husband . She had borne her part well in the arduous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some disorder that had begun to affect their fellowship . Brother Warner mentions it thus in his " Meditations " : <p> First there appeared mysteriously withal , Some leprous spots on our domestic wall . Though plague soon marred our holy fellowship , Then ate like moth the threads of love that knit Our hearts and souls in sweet connubial bliss , And made us one in sympathetic flesh . <p> It is probable that this would have been but temporary had not deceiving forces combined to turn her mind and estrange her from her husband . She came from a well-to-do family , and it is possible that the contrast of a life more or less destitute of physical comfort had some weight with her at this time and made her susceptible to the suggestion that perhaps The Trumpet could be more successfully managed in the hands of someone else . There were those who were desirous of taking it over and had the means to invest in it . Under Stockwells instruction she endeavored to consecrate for the " third work , " and under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , and she came into affinity with spirits that antagonized the work that the Lord had been accomplishing through her and her husband . Once in the hands of these enemies , the " flying roll , " which had begun to carry messages of salvation to thousands , would of course have to cease its mission . A league of babel spirits , though dissimilar in character , comprising free-love , anti-ordinance , anti-second-work , and anti-come-out elements , had united against Brother Warner . <p> In a meeting at a private house in Bucyrus , Stockwell , who had begun to assume a papal-like authority , gave those assembled about an hours harangue , which was like a gathering storm about to break on Brother Warner . There were peculiar manifestations at this meeting . On a lounge lay a woman of frightful appearance , her face drawn , her eyes sunken , and she was uttering moans . Another , a man with distorted limbs and scowling countenance , also gave evidence of an attack upon his body by some supernatural power . It was claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be set right ; just who , the Lord would make known . Each began to say , " Lord , is it I ? " Brother Warner had been asking the Lord for wisdom and had been shown that after some trial of suffering he would be able to take God Himself for his wisdom . Now , since his wife had taken sides with others who held that he was not right , and since he was ready to suspect himself as being in error rather than his wife , he felt that possibly they were right in their contention that the error lay with him . In his intense eagerness to be right with God and have the blessing of fellowship restored in his family , he became a victim . He bowed before them <p> A suppliant in that infernal maze , To evil spirits much elated gaze . <p> His critics gathered around him and waited with agonizing groans while Stockwell pried into his consecration and asked whether he was willing to sell The Gospel Trumpet . They said they felt that such was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it he should be wise and act upon their judgment , and that his soul would be blessed in so doing . Brother Warner consented , but reserved one conditionthat should God , ere the transfer be made , interdict the order and show him differently , he of course would obey God . They said , " No , but that if you must leave out . " Finally he was persuaded to drop the if . Then the agonies of those who , it was claimed , were groaning for him , ceased and gave place to fiendish laughter , as they supposed Gods " flying roll " * ( Zechariah 5:1 ) was taken . This was the crisis that had come upon his soul ; this the price he had to pay for a decision to preach uncompromisingly the truth that should create a shudder in the ranks of hell and work a reformation in the world . Opposing forces had succeeded in getting him to consent to give up The Trumpet and yield to the suggestion that he was not right . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the contrary he was plunged into spiritual darkness . He had weakened and given over his sacred trust . What a night of suffering followed ! Only with the morning that swept away the horrors of night came a spiritual illumination and consequent victory . His very disappointment had brought reason to its throne and changed the aspect of the situation . And the Lord broke the satanic spell , filled his soul with peace , and enlightened his understanding as to the devilish powers that had been seeking to crush his soul . He went to the little publishing office , bowed in thankfulness , renewed his covenant , and was swallowed up completely in God once more . He then felt that he could henceforth take the Lord for his wisdom against all the suggestions of men or devils transformed as angels of light . <p> But now he began to realize that his trueness to God would mean the sacrifice of his own bosom companion . This , then , should be the lingering phase of his sorrow . For about one week the battle alternated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring apparent release , and Satans hosts would flee , only to renew the conflict when the shadows of evening gathered around him . His strength wore away . He prayed that he might be comforted by some friend , if one were left . <p> There was a brother , a John N. Slagle , * whom God had reserved and who had expressed to Brother Warner a forewarning of some trouble . This brother came to him and took him to his home , seven miles in the country , where was enjoyed a sweet sleep and a respite from the storms rage . The poem " Meditations on the Prairie " is very touching in its description of these experiences . What this humble servant of God had to pass through in this trying ordeal only One can know . In one long sleepless night of parching fever and inward pain a portion of his hair suddenly turned grey . What that The Trumpet during this period was sometimes late in reaching its readers or that for four months it failed to appear at all ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien wife . They had one child , a boy of three years . He had fears that he should have to be separated from the child also ; but it seemed the mothers affection for both husband and child had forever flown . She wrote her husband that he could come and get the child for aught she cared . <p> The train that bore us onward to that son Seemed slow that day , so very slow to run . We met , and lo , upon his little face A famine of parental love we trace . Three days we tarried there in strong appeal That God would make that womans heart to feel One touch of love , yea , but one precious beam Of fond affection where a living stream Once issued forth to bless our happy home , But now , alas , congealed in icy zone . <p> In vain was wished one moments private talk ; At last t was begged that we together walk Outside the city , where repose the dead , In silence slumbring in their narrow bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mound more dear than any seems : The grave of our Levilla Modest child , On whose sweet brow but three bright summers smiled . She was her mothers idol and firstborn , Her childish virtues memory still adorn . But this request she coolly yet declined , As if no love to living or dead remained . Then , taking that one warm and little hand , We slowly walked to where cold marbles stand . Dear Sidney chatted merrily on the way Not knowing what within our bosom lay : T was hard to answer to his prattling words With but the tearful tribute grief affords . Poor child ! God bless him ! We devoutly pray He neer may feel what father felt that day . <p> We came to where there had been laid to rest The form , now cold , that we had known was blessed To hold a pure and lovely spirit-bud That went to blossom in the home of God . And there beside the foot of that small mound We knelt in prayer upon the turfy ground . Dear Sidneybless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Close to our side in sweet becoming grace , He gently came and now resumed his place . His tender heart beat with devotion there As soft his name was breathed in fervent prayer . <p> But , oh , that hour ! what deep emotions rose ! No earthly language could our heart disclose . For our childs dear sake some feeble words were used , But they failed to carry what was inward used . Oh ! how our heart longed for the poets flight Oh ! sing relief to deep affections blight . When touched emotions rise like a swelling flood And merge the soul , oh ! it is then we would That some kind angel could but lend his harp To start the flowing of a surcharged heart . But mundane language gave no wings to thought ; Our feelings could in tears alone flow out . <p> Brother Warner endeavored to regard this alienation of his wife as Providential . He took it all for good and felt that by it he would experience all the more of Heavens riches in his soul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a copy of The Christian Harvester of May 1 , 1884 , we are able to give to the readers the article by Mrs. Warner in which she renounced the movement which she brands Come-Outism . <h> Come-Outism Renounced <p> The following communication pretty fully explains itself . It was written by Sister Warner , the wife of D. S. Warner , the Come-out leader , and editor of The Gospel Trumpet . Those who know Sister W. generally , among the straight holiness people , have confidence in her integrity , God bless her , and may she save her husband from his strong delusions . She desires the holiness papers to copy her article : <p> Dear Brother Doty : <p> My soul praises God today for a perfect salvation in Jesus . He sweetly abides in my heart , and I do know that His Word is true . His promises to save from all sin and keep in perfect peace are most wonderfully verified in my case ; praise His name ! Salvation is sweeter to my soul every day I live . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou needst not fear , For I 've trod this way before thee , " And the glory lingers near. * <p> Yea , praise God for the cross , and the glory that always follows . <p> I feel it my duty to say to all Gods children , that He has opened my eyes to see the evils of come-outism . I am free from it , and forever renounce it and praise God that He has so completely delivered me from the spirit of it . I am thoroughly convinced that this effort to unite Gods people by calling them out of the churches is not Gods plan of unity . It simply cuts off a few members by themselves , who get an idea that none are clearly sanctified unless they see as " we " do ; and , then , they have a harsh grating that is the very opposite of love . I have found that the predominant spirit of the come-out movement is the same self-righteous , pharisaical spirit that Christ rebuked when He was here on earth . They hold and teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " sect . " <p> It is not necessary for me to speak of the fanaticism and absurdities connected with this movement ; but I am not at all surprised to hear of men losing their minds after passing through such a meeting as the assembly at Sulphur Springs last November . I have seen more Babylon confusion outside the churches than in . I know whereof I speak , for I have been connected with the movement from its beginning , and , as you all know , at the very head of it . And while I believe it my duty before God to renounce it , and stand aloof from it , I have all charity for those connected with it . I am confident that I have nothing in my heart but love toward them all , and love to my husband ; nor do I reject him , but I can not endorse either the movement or its organ , The Gospel Trumpet . I must obey God , and walk in the light He has given me , or forfeit salvation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of all things , but rejoice to know that I am counted worthy to suffer for Jesus sake . <p> In taking this step for God I have not been hasty . I have been convicted of this duty for some time . Circumstances and the manifestations of the spirit of this movement have been such for several months past that I fear further delay on my part would be disastrous to the cause of Christ and my own soul . I humbly ask the prayers of all Gods children that He will keep me firm and sweet while passing through the furnace . <p> Mrs. S. A. Warner . Upper Sandusky , Ohio , April 22 , 1884 . <p> Brother Warner deplored his wifes going into print with their trouble . A number of the so-called holiness papers made remarks that were reflective on Brother Warner and the cause of truth . On account of this , he felt it necessary to make some reply in The Trumpet and set forth the facts concerning his wife . In the issue of July 15 , 1884 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He showed the sad deception into which his wife had fallen , how it had affected her conduct , and hardened her conscience to do things she was never known to do before , even to being untruthful , and yet publish her testimony abroad that she was more sweetly saved than ever . Near the close he says : <p> And this is the kind of holiness the sectarian sheets have such a jubilee over . This work of the devil which has at present broken up a family , brought a reproach upon the cause of holiness , robbed us of our sweet child for over three months past , and which has filled all hell with a jubilee , The Highway of Holiness says " should be received with thankfulness . " Yes , it is received in hell with thankfulness , and just to the extent that Babylon glories in the same she proves that she is in league with hell . <p> While our heart is sad for the sake of our dear companion , we have great reason to give everlasting thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , how our weaknesses have been searched out and our patience perfected ! <p> We would not cast away the gold Weve gathered in the furnace flame , Nor would we wish again the dross Here purged in our Redeemers name. * <p> In The Trumpet of July 1 , 1884 , a quotation is made from the writings of John Bunyan in which are recalled the persecutions that culminated in his imprisonment . He tells of how Satan , failing in one plan to overthrow his work and make it ineffectual , tries another , which was to stir up the minds of the ignorant and malicious to load him with slanders and reproaches , and finally to have him arraigned and put in jail . With this quotation Brother Warner makes the following comparison : <p> In all these sufferings Bunyan had , besides the grace of God , the consolations of a true wife to sustain and comfort him . With his great heart glowing with love for the truth , and deep affection for her that had been such a true friend in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of his greatest persecution from sectarian idolaters , overthrown his faithful Elizabeth , and so blinded and deceived her as to make it appear her duty to renounce him and the truth he was devoted to , in all the papers of that day . Suppose he had found her all at once fellowshipping his persecutors and slanderers , and receiving the friendship and applause of the popular sects of that time , rather than suffering persecution with her husband for Christs sake ; do you not believe that such a trial would have more cruelly " pulled the flesh from his bones " than twelve years imprisonment with a good and faithful wife at home sharing his reproach and offering her daily prayers to God on his behalf ? <p> Of course the woman could not have published any sin of the man of God , nor would it have been necessary . All that she would have needed to do would have been to renounce him and the " come-out movement " that he was engaged in under God , and remind them that she " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you all know , and at the very head of it , " and then throw out a few hints that she had " suffered " a great many things , and that " circumstances and the manifestation of the spirit of this movement have been such for several months past that I fear further delay on my part would be disastrous to the cause of Christ and my own soul . " This were sufficient to confirm all the vile slanders that Satan bad sent out against her husband , with all who hated the truth he taught . Oh , yes , that would settle the matter . Yes , yes , you know all the terrible things that are reported of this awfully deluded man , and now his wife comes out against him , which proves that these things are true . And if the devil were as smart then as he is now , he would have led the poor apostate guilty woman to put on a very lovely aspect in her public comforters , to the idolaters of those times , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while selling her husband to the devil for the friendship of his enemies , and selling Christ , whose truth he dared to speak , she would have hypocritically said , " I love my husband , " and " Jesus sweetly abides in my heart . " Oh , what a record the day of judgment will unfold ! But God be praised that Bunyan was blessed with a true companion but let him whose lot is otherwise " bind this to him as an ornament , " as Bunyan did the vile slanders heaped upon him . <p> After a few years there appeared in The Trumpet , in the issue of January 7 , 1892 , the following statement , from a person who knew Mrs. Warner from her youth and who here speaks of her divorce and remarriage : <p> Nothing has ever been more surprising to me than the steps she has taken . It may not be generally known that she got a bill through the court at Upper Sandusky , Ohio . The grounds upon which she filed her complaint betray a dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had " been a faithful wife to him ever since married , " and that " he had been willfully absent from her for over three years " ; when the facts are , she had willfully abandoned him over six years before , during which time he twice visited her and wrote many letters kindly urging her to return and that without any conditions . And she was so far from being a faithful wife that she did not even answer his letters . <p> Brother Warner did not feel led to appear against her , but faithfully admonished her for her souls sake not to put on record in the county court and the high court of heaven statements she knew to be so directly opposite to the truth . And , worse yet , the woman has recently shown her disregard for the counsel of the Bible by marrying another man.14 We insisted that these few words of explanation be published to cut off all occasion for unreasonable men to speak against the cause of Christ and against his servant . <p> 14 : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she wrote a letter to her boy , Sidney , who was in the care of his father . Brother Warner had been to visit her twice since their separation , and he was constrained to go again . So he took the boy and went to the city address as given in her letter . She happened not to be at the house just then . So the two walked about leisurely until she should return . While on the opposite side of the street from her house they saw her returning . She reached the house first and entered the hall and stood waiting for them . When they reached the door she railed out in terrible abuse on her former husband . That was his only reception . He had on his former visits to her felt the Spirit dictating that there was no hope of a reconciliation ; and likewise on this occasion , as his child clung the closer to him , the Spirit said , " It is enough ; leave off thy fond pursuit . " <p> E. J. Hill <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks of her death , as follows : <p> While holding meetings in Portland , Indiana , on Wednesday , May 24 , we were informed that there was a telegram at the office for us . On going there we were startled with this brief dispatch : " Sarah died this morning in Cincinnati . Signed , L. F. Keller . " <p> He is a brother of the one we ought to be able to call our wife , and this fact rendered the familiar name " Sarah " all sufficient in the dispatch . O my Lord , is it possible that she is cut off in the midst of her days ! She who seemed so fresh and well is suddenly called to be the first to break the circle of six children , all of whom were early instructed in the fear of the Lord . Ah , we can not help the conviction that had the dear woman never been alienated by the adversary to break her solemn vows , and held by a blind and erring influence from returning to the obligations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been by that influence led to obtain a bill , and that on absolutely false grounds , she would be alive , well , and happy today . But alas , all is past now . <p> We wrote immediately to our friend who had kindly informed us of the departure of the one who once so filled the vision of our heart , for the particulars of her death , and received a prompt reply that she died with acute typhoid fever , to which was added peritonitis , and that she did not express herself about the future . <p> Out of a full heart we would love to say much , but we have space only for these thoughts . May God comfort the sorrowing mother , brothers , and sisters . <p> The unhappy woman , having forsaken her God , her husband , and child , became married over a year ago to another man . But alas , how often the path that leads from God is cut short ! <p> As to what became of Stockwell , the author has found no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the terrible conflict at Bucyrus , he renounced Stockwell , and the latter at once dropped all profession . <p> An incident that occurred at Medina , Ohio , before Stockwells defection , gave Brother Warner some trouble . A Mrs. Booth had had a vision in which she saw herself caught up with a thousand-dollar note . Stockwell , who was at that time apparently in sympathy with The Trumpet , interpreted her vision to her as meaning that she should give the one thousand dollars to The Trumpet . She then decided to do so and threw the money into the lap of Sister Warner , who refused to accept it . Stockwell then said he would take it , which he did , and with it paid off the debt against The Trumpet office . After this was done , Mrs. Booth came to Brother Warner one day in company with an attorney for the purpose of recovering the money , whereupon Brother Warner adjusted the matter by mortgaging The Trumpet equipment for one half the amount and giving a note for the balance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken the money from Mrs. Booth . In explanation he speaks of the matter as follows : <p> We feel rather like treating with silent contempt the wicked aspersions that have gone through many papers , secular and religious , against our character ; but as friends demand it of us we will just say that the report that we fraudulently took from a Mrs. Booth a thousand dollars by mesmeric influences is wholly and basely false . If we have been correctly informed , it was fabricated by a lying infidel in Bucyrus and furnished to a Cincinnati Enquirer reporter by him . That paper , after consulting more reliable parties in Bucyrus , on the 15th of last February published an article refuting all the reflections that had been cast upon us . The Church Advocate , having published the Enquirers slanders , also took back the charges against us . The fact is , we never had any hand in obtaining that money . We were at our home and knew not that the woman had a thousand dollars or any money at all , until a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We also have letters from her stating that she had cheerfully and deliberately given the money ; that God had called her to do so and that she did not regret the step she had taken . But subsequently she fell through the opposition of her husband and Satan , and we gave security for the money because it was demanded , though we were under no legal or moral obligation to do so . <p> One can imagine that during his severe trial at Bucyrus Brother Warner felt very much forsaken . But God had many others who were ready to stand with him . There were those who were solicitous with reference to his welfare . In one of the issues of The Trumpet we find this little note : <p> A brother writes thus , inquiring of us , " 0 Daniel ! is thy God continually able to deliver thee ? " Through the amazing grace of God we are able to answer from the lions den and from the seven-times-heated furnace , Yes . Glory to the God of our salvation , he keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil , and from all sin . He keeps us from these two opposite regions of death , namely , the cold , hard-hearted , grating , fruitless spirit of carnal sect-hatred on one side ; and from the soft , spurious , self-soothing , carnality-pleasing , and sect-compromising all-bogus love delusion on the other . God helping us we shall never move out of Micah 3:8 and Psalm 149:6-9 . <p> He received many letters from those who were sympathetic and who were thankful for The Trumpet . The following are a few : <p> I am so glad to get The Gospel Trumpet . I think it is the best paper I ever read . It speaks the Bible truth . May the Lord bless you in the good work , and give you grace and strength to withstand all the fiery darts that Satan and his hosts can hurl at you . God and Christ shall be for walls of salvation about you . Whom shall we fear when God is our friend ? I am trusting in Jesus for a full and free salvation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does my soul good to read the testimonies of how God is healing both soul and body , I believe He is willing to manifest as much power on earth today as He did when Christ was here in the flesh . <p> Your sister , saved through the blood , L. B. <p> We are continually praising God for the way He is keeping you through every severe trial . When we understood the reality of your trials we all wept as if we had been at a funeral . How our hearts go out in sympathy for you ! O dear brother , hold on to God ; He will not forsake those that trust in Him . You must come to our camp meeting without fail , for we know God wants you here ; but the sect people are hoping you will not come . <p> Your sister , M. J. F. <p> May God reward you in your great work . Some good friend is sending me The Trumpet , and I do love to read it , because it has the right ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Ghost and with fire . I never saw , until I was baptized with the Holy Ghost , the corruption of sectism . I am so glad that there are a few that do stand for Christ and Him alone . <p> Your brother , H. B. C. <p> My prayer is that you may continue blowing The Trumpet , and that it may always give a clear and certain sound . I had a pretty sharp discussion with a minister today on the subject of sanctification . By the grace of God I was under the necessity of telling him that he was not a competent witness on the subject , having never received the experience . Oh , why will men attempt to explain and preach that of which they know nothing ! May the God of all grace be continually your refuge and your exceeding great reward . <p> M. M. <p> That The Trumpet had the right ring was a fact recognized wherever there were spiritual Christians who had felt the oppression and seen the evils of human control in the so-called churches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . There were many ready to fall in line with its teachings . Besides Beaver Dam , in Kosciusko County , Indiana , and Carson City , in Michigan , as original centers , there had come to be congregations in other parts of the states named , and in Ohio , Pennsylvania , Missouri , Iowa , Kansas , and others . The reformation was in all places marked with spiritual vigor , enthusiasm , joy , love , fellowship , confidence , and activity . People who came in contact with it and who were not already prejudiced by sectarianism , were made to feel , by a spiritual discernment , that " this is the way " and " these people have the truth . " A spirit of victory pervaded the work everywhere . God manifested Himself by the outpouring of His Spirit and by miraculous healings and answers to prayer . <p> A remarkable instance of healing occurred at the first camp meeting held near Bangor , in southwestern Michigan in June , 1883 . Emma Miller , who lived in Battle Creek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes had become affected and she had to be led about . For nearly the whole period of three years ( or , lacking one month ) she had not read a line of print . After her conversion , which occurred nine months previously to her healing , she was plainly shown by the Lord that she would be healed . On being invited to the camp meeting she was again shown , in answer to her prayer , that she would be healed . She requested her friends to provide her with paper and envelopes , promising to write to them . In this confidence she went to the meeting . <p> On the fourth morning of the meeting , after continued prayer had been offered , she was impressed she would be healed that day . Brother Warner had been called away from the meeting , but J. C. Fisher and others were present . Here was a case of blindness . Her eyes were covered with a film and the lids were closed through paralysis and she could not open them . But nothing daunted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importunity characterized the earnest prayer . About 5 P.M. of the day mentioned , while Sister Miller was seated on the rostrum , where she had been requested to sit that all might see , suddenly her eyes were opened and she gazed upon the audience and praised the Lord . The people were amazed . Some fell to shouting , which was heard two miles away . Others trembled and cried . After praising God for an hour or more Sister Miller went out into the bright sunlight without any unpleasant sensation , the first time for nearly three years , and wrote two postal cards . Her eyes became bright and strong . Sister Miller ( now Mrs. A. B. Palmer ) is still living and has had her sight ever since . <p> Marvelous healings were common , but as this one was a healing of complete blindness and was one of the earliest cases , it is here mentioned . Another divine manifestation was the power given to the ministry over devils . Since the early centuries it has not been characteristic of any spiritual movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has learned , that devils were in such subjection and had to come out of those possessed . <p> By this time quite a force of ministers had been raised up in various portions of the country . Over in Missouri was a man named Jeremiah Cole , who had been led into the light independent of any human instrumentality . He had suffered from dyspepsia for twelve years ; he had been so bad he could eat only specially prepared articles of food . He was instantaneously and wonderfully healed in answer to his own importuning prayer , so that he could eat all ordinary foods without discomfort . His own healing led to the healing of his sister , Mary , who had been an invalid all her life . She began to have spasms at two years of age , and later dyspepsia and other ailments , until her life was one of continual suffering . Through her own prayer and that of her brother , she also was led to claim her healing , and the work was done . Both of these persons became effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had raised up several persons ( among whom were A. J. Kilpatrick , William N. Smith , J. N. Howard , and Sarah Smith ) who also became prominent workers . In western Pennsylvania was G. T. Clayton , and in yet other parts of the country , far and near , were those who had received light on the church , in some cases without any teaching from anyone , and who were by the Spirit of God added to the ministry . <p> A sad defection from the ranks of those who had been active in the reformation work was that of J. C. Fisher , which has been already referred to . He was a very effectual preacher . It was through his efforts that the original company was raised up at Carson City , Michigan , where he lived at the time . Also it was through his instrumentality that the work was started in southwestern Michigan and in some other parts of the country . Through a lack of his consecration , sad to say , he became unfaithful in his marriage relation and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Brother Warner and others , and after it became evident that he was rejecting all admonitions , and in fact had married another woman , he had to be renounced and cut off from the fellowship of the saints . This was a distinct loss to the cause , for Fisher had been a very successful evangelist , and had a great influence . His error , however , was plain , and there were scarcely any who were sufficiently in sympathy with his actions to be to any extent drawn away with him . <p> As a part of this chapter , we wish to include an article from one of the earlier Trumpets , written by a contributor , which touches the central principle of the reformation , the principle which distinguishes it from all other movements . It is on this line , the ruling authority of the Holy Ghost , that the reformation proceeds . <h> Ruling Authority of the Holy Ghost <p> By D. W. MLaughlin <p> Notwithstanding the apostasy of the Romish Church , her utter departure from the faith because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence and authority of the Holy Ghost , Protestants have not profited ( but in part ) by her fall ; they have very generally fallen into a like snare . <p> The apostolic church fully recognized the personal presence and authority of the Holy Ghost . He was fully accepted as their teacher and guide . They fully embraced the words of Jesus : " When he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth " * ( John 16:13 ) yea , " teach you all things , " * ( John 14:26 ) even the " deep things " * ( 1 Corinthians 2:10 ) of God . Hence , we hear Peter saying unto Ananias , " Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost ? " * ( Acts 5:3 ) The presence of the divine Spirit was to them a certainty . <p> In Acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority of the Holy Ghost is recognized . Thus we see that the early needed no man-made system ; being filled with the Holy Ghost they fully accepted Him as their teacher and guide . But in process of time the church lost her primitive power ; the presence of the Holy Ghost seemed less real . The necessity of a teacher and guide was felt ; hence the absence of the Holy Ghost necessitated the substitution of another teacher and guide , a " dead ecclesiasticism , " called the " Holy Catholic Church , " with the prerogative of the divine Spiritthus priesthood was exalted and invested with power to forgive sins ; and the pope made the " visible head of the church , " or the vicar of Jesus Christ upon earth . But the church felt the need of an " infallible teacher " ; the loss of the divine Paraclete necessitated a substitution , if the resemblance of the apostolic church be maintained ; hence the system must supply the lack . Thus the dogma of infallibility was conceived , ending in the exaltation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called God , or that is worshipped " * ( 2 Thessalonians 4:2 ) the " man of sin sitting in the temple of God , shewing himself that he is God . " * ( 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4 ) <p> Any man-made system of ecclesiasticism must necessarily be lifeless and powerless , just in proportion as it fails to recognize the personal presence and authority of the Holy Ghost , and sets up its own order and authority . <p> Indeed the modern church has so far lost sight of the veritable presence and authority of the personal Holy Ghost , that everything seems reduced to man-ordered systemyea , an endless treadmill of works . The form of religion takes the place of vital godliness , and the people seem to have forgotten that there is any Holy Ghost . <p> It is said history repeats itself ; let us consider what meaneth the cry of " fanatic " now so prevalent in the sects as used against the holiness movement . Perhaps we may learn a lesson from Romewhy did the Romish hierarchy persecute the Reformers ? Simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man-made system ) for the presence and authority of the personal Holy Ghost ; a lifeless systemyea , a dead ecclesiasticism was thought to be the one holy catholic church . It was not allowed that any could be loyal to God unless loyal to the system , hence the cry of " heretic , " which today finds its counterpart in the term " holiness fanatic " as used by the dominant sects against holiness men . In their devotion to churchism they lose sight of the personal Holy Ghost , and exalt the system . We must go back to apostolic ground ; the presence and power of the Holy Ghost must mark ( or make manifest ) the church . The blinding power of churchism will deceive nominal professors in the Protestant sects just as effectually as it did in the Roman Church . It is eternally true that the natural man perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God . The great Sanhedrin judged it right that Jesus Christ , the Lord of glory , judged to be a vile deceiver , should be crucified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to burn " heretics " ; and in all ages the mystic Babylon of Revelation has persecuted the true saints of God . <p> Through the night of doubt and sorrow Onward goes the pilgrim band , Singing songs of expectation , Marching to the promised land . Clear before us through the darkness Gleams and burns the guiding light : Brother clasps the hand of brother , Stepping fearless through the night . <p> One the light of Gods own presence , Oer His ransomed people shed , Chasing far the gloom and terror , Brightening all the path we tread . One the object of our journey , One the faith which never tires , One the earnest looking forward , One the hope our God inspires . <p> One the strain that lips of thousands Lift as from the heart of one ; One the conflict , one the peril One the march in God begun . One the gladness of rejoicing On the far eternal shore , Where the one almighty Father Reigns in love for evermore . <p> Onward , therefore , pilgrim brothers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame , and fight its battle , Till we rest beneath its shade . Soon shall come the great awaking , Soon the rending of the tomb ; Then the scattring of all shadows , And the end of toil and gloom . <h> Evangelistic Tours <p> The responsibility of publishing The Trumpet required , of course , that the editor spend a good portion of his time at the Publishing Office . But Brother Warners zeal for the evangelistic work , as well as the demand for his services here and there in the field , took him forth a good deal on various tours . An account of the principal tours he made , and the events in connection therewith , is sufficient for a chapter by itself . <p> For the first few years after The Trumpet started , he made frequent trips . Of these we shall give no account , but shall begin the chapter with a trip into western Pennsylvania in the summer of 1884 . A camp meeting was to be held two miles south of Sandy Lake , in Mercer County , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that place , as one had been held there the previous year . He planned to attend this meeting after holding a grove meeting in Medina County , Ohio , and he accordingly announced there would be no Trumpet issued for August 15 , since he expected to make this tour . Portions of his report of the Sandy Lake meeting are here given . Quotations direct from Brother Warner will enable the reader the better to comprehend the man and to feel the touch of his saintliness ; for there breathes out from his words such a spirituality and devotion as is possessed only by those who are thoroughly abandoned to God . <p> Glory be to the God of salvation-power ! These words seem best fitted to begin our report of this heavenly convocation . We were met by conveyance at Stonesboro , and the very instant we entered the precious grove of the saints encampment we felt the presence of God . Indeed it was wonderful . We were engaged in conversation as we drove in and were not thinking of or expecting such a glorious manifestation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness of His holy presence , impressing heart and lips in praises to His holy name . <p> We had been unwell some days in the city , and felt half sick on the train , but as soon as we breathed the God-pervaded atmosphere of that beautiful pine grove , all our infirmities fled away and we could shout the praises of God in a sound body . How hallowed and sweet the recollections of Gods blessings upon that ground one year ago ! How dear to our heart the precious chambers in Brother and Sister Carmichaels tent , where we often spent much of the brief interval between the three daily services , in nearly all of which the Lord used us to read and teach His Holy Word to the dear saints . In that precious retreat He daily filled our soul and recuperated the wasted energies of our body and mind so that we could stand and feed the Lords sheep . Praise God , we found the same little sanctum prepared for us again . Thank God , there were plenty to share the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Spirit wrought in the hearts of the people from the first service to the close of the meeting . On Tuesday we went to the stream a mile from the camp and immersed fourteen of the dear , happy saints of God . It was a glorious and wonderful time . The Spirit of the living God was poured out in mighty power . Some went down into the water shouting the high praises of God , and nearly all leaped and shouted as they came forth from the symbolic grave . What glory shone in the faces of those blood-washed ones ! The place was one of beautiful scenery . On either side the stream stood the dense and lofty pines . As this blood-washed company faced the stream , with their eyes lifted toward God and their faces all lit up with heavens glow , and sang the sweet songs of redemption , we were reminded of Bunyans company of pilgrims that stood in white robes awaiting their invitation to cross to the celestial paradise . <p> Do we astonish you when we say that while sinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baptism , and said , " This is the right way . This is the right way , " an apostate and hypocrite preacher by the name of stood back and spake against " this way " of the Lord ? Woe unto such empty clouds , wandering stars , wells without water ! <p> Brother Fisher was quite sick when we reached the grove , and after having been strengthened several times to preach the word he was finally and instantaneously healed by faith and the laying on of hands . The next evening the healing power was mightily upon him , and four of the dear saints were healed of various diseases and old complaints . In the early part of the meeting Brother and Sister Frosts little girl was healed of a very bad case of catarrh . The morning Brother and Sister Fisher left , the Lord woke us between three and four oclock in the morning and led us forth into the woods to commune with Him . Our mind was led to ask for a more perfect faith . Praise God , He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where we found Sister Clayton very sick with sick-headache . In the name of the Lord we laid hands on her head , and she was immediately healed by faith in Jesus . Several others of the saints were healed that day . <p> One evening in company with Brother and Sister Fisher we went home with Brother and Sister Frost . Sister Owen lives a close neighbor to them . Her daughter had two days before been taken sick . That night she was taken very bad , and she suffered extremely . Mr. Owen wished to go for the doctor , but Lula begged her pa to send for us . Though he had been extremely prejudiced against us by some ungodly sectarian neighbors , he could not refuse the wish of his suffering child . He gave his consent , and at two oclock we were called up , and went to the house in the name of the Lord . Lula had been praying the Lord to forgive her sins , and seemed to have found pardon , but she was in great suffering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in less than a minute her intense suffering ceased , and she rested until morning . Her body gradually recovered strength , and two days later she was out to the meeting . Praise the Lord , O my soul ! The power of God since then so softened the heart of Brother Owen that he has turned to serve the Lord . His heart is so changed that he not only loves God but us also . May God bless the dear brother . <p> Praise the Lord for the wonderful bond of love that binds our hearts together in the Son of God ! Blind sectarians ask us , " What have you got to bind you together ? " We reply by asking them , " What have you got to part us asunder ? " Oh , bless God for the balm in this union ! We never know the strength of the divine bonds of love until all the sect bonds of the devil are cast away and we are led to suffer together for the gospel of God and the name of Jesus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the pure in heart to God and to each other ! <p> After the close of the Sandy Lake meeting he went by invitation to Greenville , in the same county . He first held an evening service on the streets , in which he spoke to a large audience . This was on Friday evening , September 5 . The rest of the services at Greenville were in a grove in the country . In his report he tells of his being mercilessly beaten by a drunken man and of his wonderful escape from injury because of divine protection . <p> We praise God for having sent us here . We are confident that much good was done . One brother , who had been wonderfully converted and blessed , had actually made an appointment at a schoolhouse and talked to the people by the Holy Spirit . People were moved , and asked the man to speak again . But he consulted his Methodist priest , who told him it would never do in the world for him to attempt to speak and exhort without license , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and tried . The poor man was scared down and was on back ground ; but he promised us to rededicate himself to God and go straight forward in Gods will . May God bless and help him . Such is the pernicious work of the devil under the mask of what he calls " our church . " We hope in the providence of God to return to Greenville again . A sister told us that we would receive persecution for pay . Well , praise God , we were well remunerated in that kind of currency for Christs sake . It has brought the " leap and rejoice " with " the spirit of glory and of God " * ( 1 Peter 4:14 ) in our soul . After the grove meeting we spoke again on the streets of Greenville to a very large crowd of attentive hearers . <p> After preaching in the grove Saturday night , we walked a mile and a half to find rest for the night . The mother and two of the family are fully saved . But the husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay with the family , as the little home belongs to one of the sons , who , with his brothers , affords protection to their mother against the fathers abuse . The wretched man had been drinking liquor through the day , and was also well filled with the wine of Babylons wrath received from his sectarian neighbors , who hate any child of God that lives godly in Christ Jesus outside of her pales . He seems to have come liquored up on purpose for a row . After entering the house , the frenzied man assaulted us with shocking oaths and threats . He was desperate , just in that state of intoxication in which he had more than his usual strength , and maddened beyond all reason . He soon struck me with all force in the forehead , but through God his blow was not more than a ball of cotton . We praised the Lord . Feeling a deep concern for the wicked mans soul , we dropped upon our knees in the middle of the room , raised our hands , and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever . He seized a large rocking chair and slammed it down on us with all vengeance , but through the Lord Jesus Christ our uplifted hands turned it off with ease . The storms of oaths and slamming of furniture was terrific . It looked as though there would not be a whole piece left in the room . The infuriated man grabbed a common wood-bottom chair by the back and struck down twice or three times at our head , which was safely shielded by the hand of the Lord . Glory to God in the highest ! Our soul was filled with great peace in the midst of the storm ; we had not the slightest fear of suffering harm . <p> The kind wife and a daughter , who were gloriously sanctified at the Sandy Lake meeting , tried to protect us , when the latter received a heavy blow on the shoulder from the chair , the legs having been threshed off by previous blows , making it all the better to maul with . Seeing that they were in danger of being hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The savage monster followed us out of the yard and some rods on the road with awful curses and open threats that he would kill us . Glory to the God of our salvation ! There was not a hair of our head hurt , not a scratch or mark upon our body . The next morning we felt our right wrist was slightly sprained by stopping the terrible blows , but it soon disappeared . The man soon left , shortly after which his large son came , whose delay furnished the intoxicated man his opportunity for an onslaught . <p> Praise God , the Lord led me to do just as I had preached what a holy man should do when thus assaultedcommit our life to God , fear no evil , and let Him be glorified in our death or deliverance , as He shall choose . Fearing the man might return that night and our presence excite to deeds of violence upon the family , one of the boys and I went to the barn to sleep , but I spent the night in thanksgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe to trust God always . <p> It was while he was in western Pennsylvania that he received word from his wife that he could come and get their boy , Sidney , * then a little more than three years of age . Accordingly he returned home by way of Upper Sandusky , Ohio , and got the boy . He then made a visit to the saints at Jerry City , Wood County , of which he thus speaks : <p> Then , following the apostolic example , we " declared what miracles and wonders God had wrought " * ( Acts 15:12 ) where we have gone about preaching the kingdom of Gods grace , and assured the dear saints as he did " we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God . " * ( Acts 14:22 ) And the hearing of all the gracious dealing of God with our soul and in many hearts " caused great joy unto all the brethren . " * ( Acts 15:3 ) Many tears of sympathy and holy love flowed from the eyes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the annual assembly ; for which the large hall , 28 x 84 , on the second floor of the Office building afforded a splendid place . It was a wonderful gathering of the saints . A number were ordained to the ministry , and among these he included himself , as where so many were assembled he probably decided that his call to the work should be solemnly recognized and confirmed by the laying on of hands of the elders present . As was evidenced by the success of this assembly , the work of the reformation seemed by this time to be taking a forward move . Since the Ohio assembly at Bucyrus , one year before , Brother Warner had learned to take a more fearless , unyielding attitude against deceiving elements such as had encompassed him there . <p> We shall ever have reasons to thank God for the benefit derived from the Ohio assembly last fall . Though much of the good anticipated was not realized because of the evil powers that were permitted to " encompass the beloved saints , " yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil in all subsequent meetings . The fact is , we were delivered from priestcraft and had a solemn abhorrence of everything that savored of lordism . Hence we declared the meetings free ; yes , free for heretics , false prophets , and virtually for the devil himself . In our zeal to avoid all dragon authority we had also lost sight of the divine authority , and God had to permit that victorious conflict with the powers of hell to teach us the necessity of using , not lordism , but , the double-edged sword of the Almighty upon everything that is not clean and straight before God . <p> Since " we know that we are of the truth , and shall assure our hearts before God , " * ( 1 John 3:19 ) " we know that we are of God , and he that heareth us not is not of God . " And the only sense in which we give place to such as are deformed and darkened by antichrist traditions and " doctrines of devils , " * ( 1 Timothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at the altar , where , by entire consecration , and faith in the blood of Christ they may be cleansed from sin and all foolish " conversation received by tradition from the fathers . " * ( 1 Peter 1:18 ) Glory be to God , there is now a flaming sword in the assembly of His saints , that can be endured only by those who know and do the truth , and such as honestly wish to know and obey the truth as it is in Christ Jesus . We believe that all future time and eternity will not erase the glory of this Williamston assembly from the memory of the redeemed . <p> After the assembly he held a meeting in Battle Creek , Michigan . The following is a portion of his account of a womans deliverance from devil-possession , which occurred while he was there . Such instances were found from time to time . For an example we give but this one : <p> For some months past Mrs. Samuel Worden , of Battle Creek , Michigan , has created quite an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a supernatural power of healing . People have come from a considerable distance to be treated , and letters have poured in from every direction . Some cases of healing were actually performed . <p> The woman and her husband , hearing of our meetings , came to hear the gospel and seemed willing to receive the truth . She confessed that they were not fully saved and filled with the Spirit as they should be , although she claimed to heal in the name of Christ and by the power of God . She soon came to the altar . God enabled us to see her condition pretty correctly . We told her she was " in the gall of bitterness , and in the bond of iniquity. " * ( Acts 8:23 ) She acknowledged the fact and desired deliverance . In the course of a few days she professed to have found salvation . There seemed to be a change ; but still there was something in her from which the Spirit of God in our heart recoiled . She tried to consecrate for sanctification , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , October 26 , the power of God was upon our little meeting . There were four cases of healing by the laying on of hands . Sister Worden said that she had suffered for many years in an awful manner with what she called a confused headache . She had hands laid on her for the healing . The Spirit came on us and her in mighty power . She claimed what had been prayed for , a complete healing of her body . Presently there were strange manifestations , which the most of us at once recognized as the writhing of evil spirits in her . We asked God to show her just what it was . Presently she said , " Brother Warner , pray for me . " We asked her what she wanted . She replied , " That the devil might be cast out . " This was the confession we desired to draw out of her . Hands were laid on her head , and the demons were commanded to come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits , which had to come out by the power of God . She obtained relief , sat up , but did not look clear . We all kept looking to God to complete the work . Hands were laid on again in the name of Jesus . Another struggle ensued . Then we perceived that to get complete deliverance there had to be a more perfect consecration , confession , and mortification . We proceeded to use the sword of the Spirit in every possible manner . But a miserable dont-care devil answered to every point of consecration . <p> Oh , what an awful condition the poor woman was in ! How discouraging ! The devils had so long held possession of her that they had almost taken possession of her own will and thoughts . And this awful enemy had so tortured her head that she had had a hard struggle to keep out of the asylum ; so when he was pressed by the power of God he caused such distress and confusion in her head that he could use her mind and organs of speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached her conscience . The poor woman made some humiliating confessions , was humbled down , and wept . She confessed her association with Spiritualists , which Satan had tried to conceal before . Glory to God , his chief nest was now revealed . The Spiritualism devil was commanded to come out of her in the name of Christ . Oh , how he tortured the poor woman ! Her throat became greatly swollen . How the legions of hell struggled against the power of God ! She was pretty thoroughly decided for God ; declared she would have every last evil spirit cast out if it killed her . Glory to God for the mighty Deliverer ! Relief came by the hand of Jesus . A great measure of peace filled her soul . She sat up in the rocking-chair and her hands were raised while we sang songs of victory for the space of an hour . <p> Two days later she discovered that there was still in her heart something that was not right , and a close examination discovered that she had some lingering love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that more evil spirits were revealed . By the laying on of hands and the power of God she was fully delivered , after which she consecrated wholly and entered the sacred rest of entire sanctification.15 On Saturday hands were laid upon her for healing . The mighty power of God came upon her and filled her soul and body , and she was perfectly healed from the awful tortures Satan had inflicted upon her for many years . Praise God for His wonderful mercy to the oppressed children of men ! For years this poor woman had struggled hard to keep out of the insane asylum ; now she says , " I am clothed , and in my right mind.* ( Mark 5:15 ; Luke 8:35 ) " Her neighbors see the great change in her countenance . One woman looked upon her with astonishment , and said , " Why , how your face and voice are changed ! Surely these meetings are the true work of God . " <p> 15 : <p> In reference to this apparent instance of a persons being in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil spirits it can be said , without attempting an explanation of whether such might be possible , that Brother Warner was always very particular to insist on justification as an essential condition to sanctification , and that if we knew all the circumstances in this case ( allowing that the account may not be full ) there probably would be no question in our minds . <p> The months of February and March 1885 he spent in a tour to southeastern Iowa , and northeastern Missouri . He refers to his leaving home as follows : <p> In the kind providence of God we were permitted to start forth on this long-expected tour January 28 . God bless the beloved ones we left behind in The Trumpet Office . Oh , how our hearts are knit together in the pure love of Jesus ! Bless God for those He has given to be with us in the glorious work of the Lord ! But the hardest of all was to leave my precious little Sidney , not expecting to see the dear child again for some three months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for the poor boy in the devout family of Brother and Sister William Crandall , residing at the edge of our town . Here he is taught to pray daily , and his little heart is developed only in the pure spirit of love and obedience . He is my only living child , three years old the 24th of last June . Though he has a happy home and two little playmates , still , as may be imagined under the circumstances , his dear little heart clings to his father with the most fervent love that a child is capable of possessing , as ours also does to him . But since God so lovingly cares for him , we must leave the blessed little angel in His charge and go forth to win to Christ souls that are lost in sin . <p> He was gone nearly three months . The meetings in Iowa and Missouri resulted in good , yet nothing of unusual interest attended them . Early in June he made a trip to Daviess County , Indiana . He had found in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectual way of reaching the people . When he lived in Indianapolis , a few years previously , he and the saints in that place engaged frequently in preaching on the streets and in the parks . One Sunday afternoon , while preaching in Central Park , a man came to him and gave the names of persons in southern Indiana to whom he requested The Trumpet sent . Thus The Trumpet became the forerunner of his visit to Daviess County . <p> As we passed through the village of Odon , we notified the people that we would preach the gospel on their streets the next afternoon . Not being accustomed to such services , there was quite an interest . The people began to collect some time before the hour arrived . Store-boxes , sidewalks , etc. , were converted into pews , and we had one of the best hearings we ever had on the streets . God mightily helped us by His Spirit to testify the gospel of His perfect salvation for an hour and thirty-eight minutes . Bless God , the truth swept all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though real Bible holiness had scarcely ever been preached in that place , and no holiness meetings ever held there , so far as we learned , yet every hearer , even lawyers , doctors , and preachers , acknowledged the practicability of perfect salvation and preservation from all sin through Christ Jesus . A Baptist preacher by the name of W , who had been preaching to the people that no one can or does live without sinning in this world , and that all men sin day and night , sat close by us , and was convinced of the truth of the gospel and convicted of his sins . He sanctioned the word and acknowledged to others that it was all truth . We saw the tears in his eyes , and hoped he would become saved and qualified to preach for Jesus , instead of for sin and the sect . <p> Sabbath , the seventh , we held services in a grove near old Shiloh Bethel , south of Odon . As the appointment was circulated only after our arrival , there was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while preaching in the forenoon , and looking into his face during the discourse , our soul was pained to see that he had shut his heart against the truth and salvation of God . Instead of coming down to an equality with Christ , he chose to have a reputation among men , to indulge the lusts of the flesh and enjoy the friendship of the world . From that moment his " face gathered blackness . " During the afternoon preaching he showed every disposition to avoid listening to the gospel of God . He came to some of the meetings afterward , just as the ungodly Pharisees followed Christ , to " catch something out of his mouth . " * ( Luke 11:54 ) On Wednesday evening Brother O. Allen met and spoke to this priest of Baal , standing in a public place of the village , burning incense to the devil in gratification of the filthy lust for tobacco . <p> He later made another trip into Pennsylvania and attended the third annual campmeeting at Sandy Lake . At the close of this meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles to attend a Church of God ( Winebrennerian ) camp meeting , held near Barkeyville . His description under the title " A Night in Babylon , " is here given in part . <p> On the way we met a good many people returning from the camp , and we were no little astonished to see so many of them smoking cigars . Finally the thought forced itself on our mind , " Can it be possible that they are selling such things on the campground ? " But considering that it was the Sabbath day and the people holding the camp meeting professed to be the " Church of God , " such a thing surely could not be . The very thought was shocking and preposterous . When a half mile away we saw a smoke ascending at the camp . As we entered the ground we observed a crowd of sinners standing about a building with a sign , Boarding Tent , and the smoke from their many cigars blended into a cloud , that we had seen from a distance . Soon after landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk up and see what they have to sell there . " We did so , and adventuring into the poison-fog we walked the whole length of the long building , all opened in front , displaying a large stock of every variety of ware that would be necessary to satisfy the pride , vanity , and lust of the horse-race or any vanity-fair throng of this world . <p> We were shocked and amazed at this horrible traffic . The chief sale was tobacco . There the nasty , filthy stuff was piled up from one end of the building to the other . The vile curse of the earth , in every form and shape the devil ever invented , freely sold on aoh , the blasphemy ! " Church of God " campground ! <p> It was all licensed by the preachers in control of the meetings . And such men have the wicked presumption to call themselves ministers of Christ ! One of the " merchants of these things , which were made rich " * ( Revelation 18:15 ) by the " abundance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand he makes no profession of Christ , was ashamed of the unhallowed traffic , and though his contract included another year , he said he would never come back again . He confessed that if he were to open up such traffic on Sabbath at his place of business in town he would be prosecuted ; but the superabundance of " righteousness " of these tobacco-soaked preachers , it would appear , was to atone for the same sins on their campground . Surely it has come to pass what is written in the prophets , " They overpass the deeds of the wicked . " * ( Jeremiah 5:28 ) <p> After taking some refreshment and having obtained permission to praise God , we engaged in our evening devotion , with singing and prayer , to the God of our salvation . Our doors were soon crowded with young folks to hear the singing . <p> The tobacco smoke was so dense that we could scarcely endure it without getting sick . But after a few songs and prayers were offered , everyone cast his cigar away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said by any of us . <p> The meeting had been in progress four days , and no soul had been saved . Not a seeker . Not even a place for a penitent to kneel , no straw on the ground . The pulpit was the only place to kneel in the congregation ; as though they did not expect a poor penitent to seek God , and that the preacher should do all the praying . <p> On Monday morning , the services were made later than the usual hour . The preachers were doubtless perplexed how to perform in the deadness of their souls . " The sinners in Zion are afraid ; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. " * ( Isaiah 33:14 ) Not one of them would venture to preach . The services were confined to one hour . After reading a psalm , the preacher announced that all should be free to serve God by prayer , and testimony , and song , requesting brevity of each . So , as our heart was " springing up " * ( John 4:14 ) full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to praise the Lord in singing a verse occasionally . After several had spoken we arose and testified to the great " salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory . " * ( 1 Peter 5:10 ) We aimed to be very brief , but occupied seven minutes by the watch , when they began to sing . But they being but a few and " feeble folk , " their song would not have interfered materially with our remarks . However , we struck in to sing until they stopped , and then sat down . the services were dismissed we were ordered to leave the ground as soon as we could pack up and depart ; and forbidden to sing , pray , or preach , within one mile of their tobacco-soaked camp . <p> When asked why they would not allow us to worship God there , the president said it was because we held a second work of grace , which they did not believe . Why should they fear to hear the testimony ? If they really believed that there is no " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their flock would obtain it . According to their position , they were afraid of the thing that does not exist . What brave soldiers ! <p> One of the preachers arose in the speaking meeting and said , " According to the little bit of information I have received concerning Christs salvation , it is all received at once . " Certainly a man that has only " a little bit of information concerning Christs salvation " has only a little bit of salvation , and that little bit of salvation was doubtless all obtained at once , for it was so little it could not have been divided . And when that very " little bit " is analyzed it is seen to consist in a mere " name to live , " a " form of godliness , " * ( 2 Timothy 3:5 ) anointed by love of self and love of sect . <p> The preacher who led the meeting is saturated with tobacco and addicted to horse trading and worldly foolish jesting . In his remarks he said we should " exemplify Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His . The Lord led us to ask him if he regarded himself an example of Christs character ; whether he could consistently say to boys and men generally , " Follow the example I set before you . " Not having " sanctified the Lord God in his heart , " * ( ) he was not ready to give an answer . He paced the pulpit , being speechless . We repeated the question , including both him and the president . Neither answered . We then told the latter something about their being of the same spirit the old Jews and pagans were of , who forbade the apostles preaching any more in their towns . We also called their attention to the abominable and wicked traffic we saw on their ground on the Lords day , which was licensed by them and sanctioned by their filthy habit . They could allow that corrupting bane of society ; but of a few little children of God who have obtained pure hearts and desired to " worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness , " * ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Away with them " ! <p> Well , we are compelled to give the manifestations at that camp the credit of being the filthiest and vilest form of Babylon we have ever met . An unconverted man who was there and witnessed the scene said to them , " God deliver me from such a sect . " They are destitute of Gods grace . " For the grace of godly in this present world . " * ( Titus 2:11-12 ) But these live in the filth of the world , " walking after their own ungodly lusts. " * ( Jude 1:18 ) <p> In a report written from this part of Pennsylvania three years later , he refers to his visit to the Winebrennerian camp , as just described , and says , " Well , that was the last camp meeting held on that ground . Their doleful tents are rotting to the ground , and are the habitation of owls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed , and that the Lord was going to provide , a company of singers to go with him in the evangelistic field . It was about this time that the company who should travel with him for more than five years began to be formed . It was at the Williamston assembly that summer that Brother Warner said to Nannie Kigar , of Payne , Ohio , and to Frances Miller , of Battle Creek , who attended the meeting , that he felt impressed they would form a part of his company to help in singing and other gospel work . Their voices were soprano and alto respectively . They , with a number of other saints , accompanied Brother Warner to the Beaver Dam assembly . On their way , as they changed cars at Fort Wayne , they met and were joined by Sarah Smith , of Jerry City , Ohio . While they were at Beaver Dam the Lord added Sister Smith to the company . Her voice furnished a high tenor . She was an elderly lady and she was called the " mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother D. Leininger , from the Beaver Dam neighborhood , also traveled in the company for a time. * <p> After the Beaver Dam meeting , Brother Warner made a short visit to Illinois and Iowa , while the rest of the company remained at Beaver Dam and were soon engaged in a protracted meeting at the Hans Schoolhouse , where about fifty souls were saved and a great interest was created.16 While on this trip he was healed of an affliction of the eyes . He thus speaks of it : <p> 16 : <p> Brother Leininger relates that at this meeting a Dunkard minister drew his fist to strike him . A daughter of this preacher was a hired helper in Brother Leiningers family . She had obtained the experience of sanctification , which angered her father . As Brother Leininger was going out of the meeting-house , this man stood at the door ready to do violence to him . He drew back his fist to strike , but it seems his blow was rather misdirected , as his thumbnail grazed his own nose and tore loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleeding and discomfited . <p> During the Williamston assembly in September , Satan began to afflict our eyes . At the beginning we were impressed that it was an attack of the enemy . They grew worse until we were scarcely able to read or write . The next morning after our arriving in Iowa , the Spirit impressed a sister that it was Satan who had afflicted our eyes to prevent our labors in writing , etc . Instantly recollecting the same impression in our mind at the beginning of the attack , we knew it was of God . <p> Our vehement faith in God and indignation against the devil were instantly aroused . We fell upon our knees and asked God to deliver us , rebuking Satan in the name of Jesus Christ . Praise God , the pain all ceased , and we were able to do a pretty good days work . And our eyes have been well ever since . God suffered the attack doubtless to teach us a lesson concerning the origin of much of the suffering of the afflicted . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singers and coworkers went to Deerfield , Randolph County , Indiana , arriving on a Saturday evening . The next morning they attended a meeting where a nominal Christian preacher had the service . They sang some of the sweet songs of victory ; but this so confounded the preacher that he could not find anything in his Bible to preach , and after he had taken the pulpit he invited Brother Warner to preach . The latter preached a burning message . He had hoped for the use of the house , but it could be seen that the preacher intended to control the house that week , for he proposed that he and these people use it alternately . He was soon told that they were out on the blood and fire line , that they could not yoke up with the dead priests of Babel and would go elsewhere . <p> They went over into the edge of Jay County and began meetings in a United Brethren house called Prospect . Here the preaching created a furor among those who were joined to their sectarian institution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thunderbolt in the community . The singing drew the crowds . The trustees became fearful . One of them went into the woods to pray to know what to do to get rid of these people who seemed to be taking things . The heavenly songs seemed to follow him . He felt he should attend all the meetings to see what occurred . He soon found that these people had something more than the United Brethren had . He was one of two trustees who embraced the truth , and of course desired that the meetings continue . Threats were made . A woman was heard to say , " They ought to be driven out of the country with shotguns . " A Baptist preacher who came into the neighborhood said that they ought to be put in jail , and offered his service as one to help in the matter . <p> The United Brethren minister had been holding meetings , with but little success . A Mrs. R , one of their number , had been praying the Lord to send somebody who would preach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto Himself a people who would serve Him . She and a Mrs. W went to the altar together , with others . Brother Warner asked them whether they would be willing to separate themselves from denominationalism if the Lord should show them that duty . Sister W said in her heart , yes . Sister R turned over to her and said , " Now , they are trying to tear down the church , so let us just stick . " There she turned bitter , and the very thing she had prayed for she was rejecting . She walked up and down the aisle wringing her hands and crying , " My church ! my church ! " Another woman said , " These people are either awfully good people or else they are desperately wicked . " Once during the meeting flying missiles crashed through the windows . Glass flew across the room , striking a woman on the head and drawing blood.17 Said Brother Warner : <p> 17 : <p> A man who lived in the neighborhood said in one of the meetings that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was among the last to pass out of the building , this man lingered at the door , while the crowd was waiting to see him do the deed . As Brother Warner passed out he raised his foot to kick , but he did not kick . He was asked why he did not . His reply was , " I was afraid the Lord would kick me . " This man accepted the truth and became one of the permanent fixtures in the church in that place . <p> People have dealt in cheap , shoddy religions so long that they feel like stoning us when we state the cost of that we are commissioned of Christ to offer the people ; nevertheless , when men consent to pay the price they are always highly pleased with the results . <p> Such a display of sectarian idolatry was a good exhibition for some who had come out of Babylon , for they saw what they had been yoked up with . About eight persons made their escape in this meeting . <p> There were in attendance , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hearing the sects spoken against . Such people , of course , while adding force in the start , were no substantial credit to the movement , as they were not genuine representatives . <p> During the winter the evangelists went to Marshall County , into a neighborhood that seemed very dark spiritually . After one of the evening meetings there , in which he had preached with marvelous power , Brother Warner was passing out the door when a young rough gave him a kick . He turned and thanked the fellow and said he always praised God when he received such treatment . As he started on he received another kick , for which he also praised God aloud . At the house where he was stopping the sister had two very wicked sons . On the night the kicking occurred one of these young men , instead of retiring to bed , sat in his chair at the fireplace , his face in his hands , groaning . When asked what was the matter , he referred to what had happened that evening and said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a godly man , etc . When he saw how Brother Warner received such abuse , his heart was touched , and he was much pained . He and his brother had both mistreated Brother Warner and those with him and had in their presence cursed his mother for feeding them . When they saw the love manifested their hearts melted , and they became warm friends to the saints of God . <p> From Marshall County the company went up into Michigan , into Van Buren County . Here , at Geneva Center lived a young man whom the Lord had saved and was calling into the gospel work , Brother Barney E. Warren. * The fact that he was under twenty-one years of age and that his father was unsaved and was opposed to his going into the ministry was an obstacle . But his father , who was a very wicked man , became very much convicted during the meetings held in a schoolhouse in the vicinity . He was seized with such trembling that in his attempt to steady himself by holding to the seats he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a consecration meeting in Brother Joseph Smiths house , near Lacota , he rebelled against the Lord and started to leave the room . Before he reached the door the strength of his legs gave way and he sank instantly to the floor , and was unable to go farther . He then yielded . Brother Warner asked him if he was willing to let Barney go into the gospel work . His reply was , " Barney is the Lords . " The way was then opened for the young Brother Warren , and in the following April he became a part of the little singing company that should travel with Brother Warner for the next five years , and should consist of , besides Brother Warren , who was a bass singer , Sisters Nannie Kigar , Frances Miller , and Mother Smith . This constituted a complete quartet , with Brother Warner often reinforcing the tenor . <p> There had come to be many saints gathered in the one fold in this part of Michigan . Brothers A. B. Palmer , S. Michels , W. B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God was using in this vicinity . At this time Brother Warner was called to Williamston to help get out the second edition of the Songs of Victory , the first songbook published at The Gospel Trumpet Office . Of the first edition there were over fifteen hundred copies sold in less than three weeks . Holy song exerted a wonderful influence in the reformation . With reference to his return to Williamston we include a paragraph from his report . <p> The day we arrived at home a good steam engine was brought into the Trumpet Office by the kind blessing of God , Brother Fisher having previously engaged it . Thank God that we live to see this day . The glorious work is spreading like fire in the earth . Glory to God and the Lamb ! Oh , what hosts of fire-baptized saints we have met ! With the increase of numbers there is a continual advancement in clearness and power . <p> Thus there was a long day of waiting before a steam engine was used in the Trumpet Office . Every improvement of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warner . <p> By this time the truths of the reformation were being extensively scattered . Besides the workers named in southwestern Michigan , there were G. T. Clayton in western Pennsylvania , C. Z. Lindley in Iowa , J. P. Haner in Kansas , and W. N. Smith and others in Ohio . The Lord was raising up ministers in various places , and many people were accepting the truth . <p> The first engagement for Brother Warner and his company , after the latter had been definitely formed , was at Walkerton , Indiana , in April 1886 . They remained two weeks , and a few souls came out on the clear Bible line . There was a little persecution here , as was usual . They found the place dark with prejudice . Over forty of the professors in the place were joined in a holiness band . They professed sanctification , but most of them were connected with sects . <p> We went to their meeting on Tuesday night before we began operations in the hall . Being held in the United Brethren house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God powerfully baptized our soul , and we praised Him in prayer and testimony , which made the sect priest grow black in the face . He afterward tried to make out that we had come there and interrupted their meeting , and actually caused a report of that kind to go out . He spared no pains to fill the place with all manner of evil against us . Like Demetrius , the silversmith , his craft was in danger . <p> The Methodist priest delivered a lecture on Monday night in favor of secret societies ; he labored especially to make a good character for the Odd Fellows . The Holy Spirit put it upon us to rebuke such agents of the devil . This the class leader of that sect said made his blood boil . So he went about the town breathing out his venom against us and enlisting as many as possible in an effort to induce the proprietor of the hall to break his contract and close the hall . They succeeded in so influencing him ; but the power of God turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall cheerfully to the extent of the time , but offered it as much longer as we wanted it or at any time we might return . <p> Threats were made , eggs were thrown , and there was considerable disturbance . But the effect of such abuse was the raising up of many friends for the truth and the salvation of a few souls . Brother Warner was again called home , and the company returned to Beaver Dam . <p> The next trip for the company was to the Prospect neighborhood , in Jay County , where the truth had been planted the previous winter . This was in May . Brother Warner and Brother and Sister Fisher went directly to Portland by train , while the company , including S. L. Speck and Clara Morrison , were conveyed from Beaver Dam in a wagon . Of this trip across the country in a wagon , Sister Frances Miller wrote an account in her diary . It is interesting reading in these days of automobiles , when such a trip can be made in a few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The brethren from Beaver Dam carried our little company from that place to Sweetser , Grant County , by lumber-wagon . We started at 5 A.M. , and reached our destination about 9 P.M. We had a glorious time by the way , praising God and singing those beautiful songs . About two miles beyond Roann we drove in at the edge of a beautiful piece of woods and stopped for dinner . We placed the seats in a circle and spread our dinner upon Fathers green carpet , then thought we would praise Him with a song , supposing we were alone in the woods . <p> In a few moments we were surrounded with cattle . There must have been at least twenty-five or thirty , with their eyes wide open , gazing at us . We felt that God had put the love of music in these dumb animals , and we sang two or three songs for their benefit . <p> Mother Smith then asked God to bless the food , and we all thanked Him for it , in our hearts . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rejoicing because we had Jesus in our souls , and He made melody through us to the Father . <p> The next morning the Beaver Dam brethren returned home , and brethren at Sweetser brought us to Prospect , Jay County . We started at 7 A.M. It was a beautiful morning . The recent rains had laid the dust , and we had pike roads most of the way , making traveling delightful . In the afternoon the clouds began to gather blackness , and in a short time a terrible storm was upon us . The rain came down in torrents , drenching us through and through . The wind was furious . It seemed almost every moment as though it would take us up . Then the hailstones came down so thickly the horses refused to go . We were seemingly in the midst of an ocean of water . The recent heavy rains had flooded the country , washing away several bridges . <p> We had quite an adventurous trip ; forded one river , and the horses , while pulling us through a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the water . We were able to get to land , however . This was about two hours after the storm , and while the brethren were repairing the wagon we gathered hailstones by the handful in the fence corners . <p> Well , I am satisfied that none but the pure in heart could relish such a storm . We did enjoy it ; and God so filled our hearts that we praised Him through it all . And when the wind was blowing the thickest , the calmness in our souls was indescribable . We knew God had power to prevent the storm ; but in His wisdom he saw it was just what we needed , and His will being ours , we thanked Him for it and left the consequences of our becoming wet in His hands , knowing all would work out for our good . <p> After the storm , it turned quite cold . We had thirty miles yet to drive ; but we had the holy fire burning within us . We reached Brother Keys about twelve oclock that night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , t was love , t was love that found out me ! " * The next morning , Saturday , May 15 , we arose feeling refreshed after a few hours rest , not one of us feeling any the worse after our exposure of the previous day . <p> Oh , what a wonderful God ! Let us praise Him for His goodness and for His wonderful works to the children of men . We drove out to Prospect that morning , six miles , and to our surprise and joy met Brother and Sister Fisher , who had come with Brother Warner . Our hearts were made to rejoice to meet the dear saints at Prospect , with whom we had labored in the Lord last January . We had a glorious time and witnessed the salvation of many precious souls . <p> This second meeting at Prospect was to be held in a grove ; but on account of the weather being cold and damp , and the meeting house being refused , the meetings were held most of the time in a granary building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given the land on which the Prospect meeting house stood , and had contributed largely to its erection , with the understanding that the house should be open to all true worshipers of God . But here the sect refused the house , the preaching of the truth on the former occasion having been too much for them.18 <p> 18 : <p> On the second Sunday the meeting was held in the grove . After the people had assembled a very frightful storm threatened , and people began to leave . Brother Warner stopped in the midst of his preaching , and , with his hand lifted to heaven prayed God to scatter the storm and not let it hinder the meeting . He assured the people that they need not leave , that it would not rain . Some had begun to depart but stopped to see whether his prayer would be answered . It did not rain . There were other instances of this kind in Brother Warners career . <p> In August of this year ( 1886 ) was held the first of the annual grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in W. W. Ballengers grove . For the next five years the annual camp meeting was held in J. Kuhns woods ; and then , beginning in 1892 , it was held for five years in D. Leiningers woods . Beginning with 1897 this meeting has since been held on the beautiful ground overlooking Yellow Lake . <p> Before attending the Indiana grove meeting in August , Brother Warner felt impressed that from that meeting he should labor on a line eastward from that place . In conjunction with this came urgent calls from that direction , and brethren even made preparation for his coming before asking him . The first place was Arcola , Indiana . We quote from his report in which he speaks of this part of his trip : <p> On Friday morning , August 13 , with our heart melting with pure parental love for our child , we kissed his innocent cheek and left him in silent slumber , not daring to wake him lest his little heart should break with grief at our departure , and our soul also be filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowest the abundance of Thy grace that enables us to tear away from this affectionate child ! The poor boy has recently been sick insomuch that many of the saints despaired of his life . O Lord , only Thou knowest the great trial of our soul when we felt the awful sickness of our boy , by the Spirit of God , while we were making up the last Trumpet at Williamston , and packing the Office , which none of our company had any experience in ! Our presence was much needed , so that we did not feel permitted to go , though we keenly felt his sickness and told some of the saints that we felt he was sick . After suffering those feelings a week , we received a letter stating that he had been very low but was better . This took a great load off our heart , and a few days later a second , letter stated that through the laying on of hands in prayer the Lord had gloriously healed the poor little fellow . <p> Oh , praise our God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spared our soul the great sorrow of such a bereavement as would have been the departure of this last and dear beloved friend in the flesh ! And yet we know that had the blessed Lord seen fit to take him , as in all the trials of the past we would have been " exceeding joyful in all our tribulation . " * ( 2 Corinthians 7:4 ) This trial of our faith was a great blessing to us . It gave us a sure evidence that notwithstanding our intense love for the child we could leave him in the hands of God , and feel sweetly resigned to His will who had worked for us elsewhere . We found the precious boy feeling well , but still so slim and poor that it touched our heart to look upon his lean face . The Lord bless Brother Leiningers family , with whom the child was staying during his sickness , and all the beloved saints who did all they could for the comfort and help of the dear boy . <p> We started at three oclock in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to cool the air and put away the dust . As the day began to break , we were blessed in looking at the sublime and beautiful clouds which Father piled up in the heavens , of every shape , tint , and hue . Looking to the north we saw the perfect form of a great hand pointing to the East , and the Spirit of God filled our heart as we acknowledged it the hand of our Father , and that we were going in the direction Father was pointing . We felt something like Ezra must have felt when he said , " The hand of the LORD my God was upon me. " * ( Ezra 7:28 ) <p> We sang the praises of God much of the way , and the gentle breezes carried the sweet sound over the surrounding country . Once we finished a hymn just as we were ascending a hill . At the top of the hill , to our right , stood a house . The song had sounded on ahead of us and found an echo in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clapping her hands and shouting the praises of God , and who waved her hand and nodded her head toward us as we came opposite the house , as good as to say , " I felt the Spirit of God in the song and it has set my soul on fire . " Oh , how it stirred our soul as we saw the joyful demonstrations of the dear old sister ! We reached our destination in good time and had a blessed meeting that night . <p> That his frail body should endure the strenuous evangelistic workthe much travel , loss of sleep , and the strain of preaching and laboring for soulsas well as editing and writing for The Trumpet , is in itself a miracle . On more than one occasion , when he was exhausted , he was miraculously strengthened by the power of the Spirit . The following is a portion of his account of the meeting at Antwerp , Ohio , held while on this tour : <p> Having labored hard all day in the Lord , our body was so worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so closed the meeting about dark . But finding some unsaved souls had just come who seemed concerned about salvation , we asked God to touch our body with renewed strength . Praise God , He did as we asked . We called the people to order and renewed the battle of the Lord for the rescue of perishing souls at stake . Praise God , a rich harvest of souls followed . We labored on until after ten oclock . Two or three times we announced the meeting closed , when other souls were found under conviction and were constrained by the Spirit of God to yield . About eight were converted and a few sanctified through the blood . The work was wrought in mighty power . Strong men shouted in their new-born joys sent down from heaven by the sweet Spirit of adoption . Oh , what a heavenly sight ! Even little boys , who had just found the Lord , were so powerfully blessed of God that they clapped their hands and leaped with the glory . In twenty years of labor for God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their little bodies must burst asunder by the power of the Spirit . <p> Every meeting is getting richer and more wonderful . O my Lord , whereunto will this great kingdom yet grow ? Truly the saints of the Most High have taken the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven . <p> Leaving his company at Jerry City , Ohio , he returned to Van Buren County , Michigan , long enough to attend the assembly at Geneva Center where saints from over an extensive territory were gathered . He makes the following reference to this meeting : <p> Tuesday afternoon , the great day of the feast , near the beginning of the service , we sang , " Perishing Souls at Stake " when the Holy Spirit overwhelmed all our souls with the awful condition of this dark world and the worth of millions of souls who would receive the pure gospel and be saved if it were brought to them . Oh , how all our hearts were melted in sympathy for " perishing souls at stake today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for one of the dear ministerial brethren to work with us ; but then we said , O Lord , send them everywhere , and we will trust Thee to " make all grace abound toward us ; that we , always having all sufficiency in all things , may abound to every good work . " * ( 2 Corinthians 9:8 ) Through the Lord Jesus Christ we feel abundantly able to do as much preaching and laboring with souls as one man would be supposed to perform , and also one mans work with the pen . <p> How beautiful the sight of Gods host , all mustered to the battle by the Lord Himself ! No jealousy , strife , and selfish manipulation for the best places and fattest fields . Every soul feels that he has the very best place while he abides in Christ and Christ abides in us . Oh , what fools the devil has made of poor blind Babylonians whose backs are galded by the sect harness and whose hearts are often crushed beneath the sect machinery ! We speak from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartless heel of selfish oppression . More than once we wet our pillow with the tears that the accursed Baal idol pressed from our wounded heart . By the grace of God we shall render " unto her double , " * ( Revelation 18:6 ) as God hath commanded us . <p> Instead of wire-pulling and ungodly plotting against one another , and each one greedily looking for his meat from his quarter , each worker in the Lords vineyard is looking to the Lord to guide his feet in the paths of His own will . And all go out in perfect freedom whither the Lord will and yet all work in perfect harmony , under the sweet and heavenly management of the Holy Spirit . <p> Of his return to Ohio and of an attempt by a mob to capture and mistreat him we have his account in The Trumpet of November 1 . <p> After the assembly of the saints in Michigan , we returned to our little company of fellow workers in Ohio ; found them all together at dear Brother and Sister Millers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our souls to meet all well again . How all hearts praised God for the tidings of His wonderful works in the assembly ! Of course dear Brother Barney began to bound like a rubber ball , almost to the ceiling , when he learned of the salvation of his brother William . Doubtless angels in heaven took a part in the celebration of Gods holy praises . <p> October 1 we came to Brother S. Phillips near Rising Sun . We held some meetings in a house on his place . We enjoyed preaching the glorious gospel of Christ to the people that came together there . <p> October 7 , we moved a few miles farther east and one mile north , to the house of dear Brother Daniel Roush , where we invited the neighbors together to hear the word of the Lord . The room soon proved too small , and the weather being pleasant , we obtained a tent from Brother Phillips , that covered about 18 x 20 feet , which we attached to one end of a large porch ; these together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to preach the glorious gospel of Christ , and we poured out the vials of Gods wrath upon every evil way . The Lord worked , and souls were saved almost every day . <p> Thursday , October 14 , the Lord sent a very strong wind and we had to take the tent down . That night we held the meeting in the house . The night being dark and rainy , the congregation was not very large . While we were preaching the word , suddenly in rushed <h> A Black Mob <p> About fifteen or more of the baser sort , who were drunk and mad on the wine of Babylon , with their faces blackened , sprang into the room and seized upon us and started to take us out . Brethren quickly saw the situation and were not slow in our help . But the room being seated with backed seats , and the space between us and the door being all occupied by the sons of Belial , not many saints could get near us . The enemies of the Lord all having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , we were pretty rapidly drawn to the door . But a few of the little ones were pulling back with all their might . Brother Barney and Sister Frankie Miller were in the hottest of the fight ! Mother and Nan could not get to us . <p> Hallelujah ! We praised God every step and felt the perfect peace of God in our souls , Brother George Roush had hold on our left arm and was our principal stay . The black clan , knowing him as a very strong man , thought to beat him loose from his hold on us ; but he received the blows on his face without slacking his hold . God bless that brother . The Lord did not suffer him to be hurt to amount to anything . One of the black clan brought with him a pretty wieldy little cudgel , which Brother Jacob Roush grabbed and wrested out of his hands . And being an officer of the law , of whom the Word of the Lord says , " He beareth not the sword or club in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apply it vigorously on the black heads . Up to this second the contest stood in breathless uncertainty . We were hauled to the very threshold , and all the desperadoes were determined to have their victim . Once the threshold crossed , we were to be dragged out into the dark night to suffer all that Satan might dictate in the hearts of fiendish Catholic sect idolaters and wicked sinners . But all at once the Spirit said to our soul , " I will not leave thee in the hands of the wicked . " Almost immediately every black hand let go and fled . Glory be to our God , He always causes us to triumph through Christ Jesus . <p> The little ones said it looked as though we should be pulled to pieces , but , praise God , not a hair of our head was harmed , not a muscle strained , and not a thread of our clothes torn . Glory to Jesus for His precious deliverance of us out of the jaws of the fierce beasts ! It was reported that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good lashing with whips and then serve us with a dessert of rotten eggs . We praised God for their defeat , but believe we should have praised Him and leaped still more with the glory in our soul had he seen fit to let the wicked accomplish their end . After the struggle we sang a hymn of praise to God and resumed our discourse in the Spirit of the Lord . <p> Before we came to the place , our eyes rested on 1 Thessalonians 2:1-2 and as we read , the Spirit gave us the words as descriptive of what we should meet . Praise God , we were willing to be shamefully entreated for Christs sake and were none the less " bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention , " " knowing that our entrance in unto you , that it was not in vain . " * ( ) <p> The night before the black mob came we dreamed of fighting black dogs , which finally fled from before our face . Some were apprehensive they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " rumours of wars . " * ( Matthew 24:6 ; Mark 13:7 ) Had we not been saved above all fears we should have escaped out of that place as soon as possible , but we remained over the following Sabbath . <p> From Ohio the course of our little company of evangelists turned westward again . While they were holding meeting at Payne , Ohio , Brothers Williams and Yoder , from LaGrange County , Indiana , arrived to convey them seventy-two miles back to Brushy Prairie , Indiana . On their return they reached a point near Antwerp , Ohio , the first evening . As soon as they came into the neighborhood the news was sounded out , and the house where they were stopping was quickly filled with people who had come to hear the words of eternal life . <p> When we landed there , we began to think of our bodies , and felt sorry the word had gone out announcing a meeting . We had been up , some until twelve , and 1others until two oclock , the night before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile drive the next day , it seemed that the rest was a matter of necessity . But as the people came together , our hearts , burdened for lost souls , soon forgot circumstances , and the meeting continued till eleven oclock . All glory to our God , who is " able to make all grace abound toward us ; that we , always having all sufficiency in all things , may abound to every good work . " * ( 2 Corinthians 9:8 ) <p> Meetings were held in LaGrange County , Indiana , after which the company were conveyed in a two-days journey by lumber-wagon to Beaver Dam.19 While engaged in meetings in this part of the State he was called home to the Office again , to assist with the third edition of the song book . The Publishing Office by this time had been moved to Grand Junction , Van Buren County , Michigan . <p> 19 : <p> An interesting episode in connection with this trip is related by Brother D. Leininger , of Beaver Dam , whose mother , known as Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mother Krause had for some cause held a slight grievance against Brother Warner . Early in December , on the night before she died , she declared she must see Brother Warner and begged to have him sent for . She was told that Brother Warner was over in La Grange County , quite a distance away , and that if the Lord wanted her to see him he would spare her life until she should have that opportunity . Scarcely had this been said when Brother Warner arrived , to the surprise of all . <p> Two days before , where he had been holding meetings , he expressed the conviction that the Spirit bade him go to Beaver Dam . Accordingly it was decided to go , and he resumed his writing , at which he had been engaged , until the time to start . Perceiving that no preparations were being made he dropped his pen and asked the cause . He was told that the weather was inclement and that traveling would be disagreeable . He said , " Never mind the weather ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Go to Beaver Dam. " Thus it was that he and his company were prompted to make the trip . Landing at Brother William Ballengers , they stayed over night . In the latter part of the night Brother Warner awoke Brother Ballenger and said he must go to see Mother Krause immediately . <p> Mother Krause died the following evening , but not before she was comforted by the presence of Brother Warner . <p> Brother Fisher , having gone to the Office , wrote for us to come also , as we were needed . The interest of the meeting was such that we thought we should by no means leave . But as we fasted and prayed , the Spirit of God bade us go immediately , assuring us that he would put His Spirit on dear Brother Barney Warren and cause him to preach the word to the people . <p> Though the little ones were loath to have us leave so suddenly , the grace of God enabled all to say , " Amen , " and in a few moments we were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Fathers swift chariots landed us at The Trumpet Office once more , after an absence of five months . <p> Oh , praise God for His glorious blessings upon our soul and body ! Having had no ministerial help , preaching nearly all the time twice a day , with much altar-work , singing , etc. , besides doing one mans writing keeping The Trumpet filled and attending to a large correspondence , hymn writing , etc. , it is wonderful , a constant miracle , how God can do so much through a poor , naturally frail body . We scarcely get six hours sleep out of twenty-four . Glory to God , we do love this holy war for our God against the powers of hell and for the rescue of perishing souls . If the Lord saw fit to keep us working the whole time day and night , and sustained us , we should say , " Amen . " <p> Oh , how glad we were to see the beloved little ones at home once more ! God bless their souls . How grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear ones . Truly they endure all things for the elects sake , that their fingers may send forth the bread of heaven to the hungry souls . Dear brethren , when you read The Trumpet so eagerly do not forget to pray for those blessed children who are so devoted to this great work . We were in hopes that God would give us the sweet luxury of some nights rest with the little ones at home . But lo , here came the dear saints from every direction wishing Brother Joseph and us to come here and there to preach for them . <p> When we left our little company we expected to return soon again , but as the second edition of Songs of Victory is nearly exhausted we have to remain here to help print the third edition soon . <p> Praise God , nearly thirty-five hundred books have gone forth singing the praises of God . May God speed all His flying angels with the everlasting gospel to this dark and wretched world , so near its awful doom . Amen . <p> Brother Warner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by agreement , he met his little company again at Walkerton , Indiana , where they had held meetings almost a year before . Frankie Miller refers in her diary to their meeting in Walkerton on the night of their arrival there . <p> That night we all met at Brother Bardens to worship God . After the meeting had nicely begun , in walked Brother Warner . Well , it is needless to say we were all very thankful to see his dear face again . He said that this was the second time he had been mobbed . The first time was by the black mob near Rising Sun , Ohio , and the second time was this time by the White Horse Cavalry ( Revelation 19:11-14 ) . <p> Sister Miller also relates an instance of healing that occurred before they left Walkerton . <p> Wednesday morning , the 13th , Brother Wolfenberger came out to Brother Bardens , where we were , before breakfast . His little boy , five years old , was very sick with spinal disease and had high fever . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We all went over about nine oclock . The doctor was there . The little fellow was crying , and burning up with fever . He had not eaten anything but a little scraped apple since Saturday . The doctor tried to open his eyes , and wanted to put a fly blister on his spine . Brother Warner told the parents that if they wanted to put the case in Gods hands they must drop the doctor and his medicines and take Christ alone for their physician . They were both willing , and said they believed God would heal the child . After looking to God in prayer , Brother Warner anointed the child in the name of Jesus , and we laid on hands , and God healed the little sufferer . Oh , praise God for His goodness ! The fever was broken , and he sweat freely and opened his eyes very bright and asked for a cookie . He ate two cookies and some bologna very greedily , and teased to be dressed and go to the depot with his papa after his sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auburn , and they telegraphed for her , thinking the child could not live . Before we reached the place , the daughter had gone to God in prayer asking Him to pardon her sins and to save her little brother . After the child was healed , a young woman working in the family , who had been bitter against the power of God and against us , fell on her knees and cried to God for mercy , and she received the spirit of adoption . She was a member of the United Brethren without a spark of salvation . <p> We present extracts from Brother Warners report of this second meeting at Walkerton . <p> Here we set the battle in array last April in a two weeks siege . Hell was moved to the bottomless pit . Babylon foamed and howled , and , like the ancient Pharisees , stirred up the people to " shamefully entreat us , " as they did Paul at Philippi . But , thank God , in the fires of persecution and storms of opposition God saved a few souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few others the Lord has added to His own church , who are praising God for the great salvation . We soon found that the gospel of Christ had grown much in the favor of the people . The Lord God of power had greatly turned the minds and hearts of the people to endorse and love the truth . Men of principle gave all to understand that if they attempted to disturb our meetings again as they had before they must suffer the application of the law . Praise God , the people heeded the warning , and God also inclined them to give good attention . <p> We occupied a very large hall for two weeks and had it well filled with hearers . Multitudes were under deep conviction , but were unwilling to pay the price of real salvation . Several , however , were saved by the power and grace of God , converted and sanctified , and a few made their escape fully out of Babylon and were wonderfully blessed of the Lord . Were it not for shoddy holiness and stagnant pools of sectish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvest of souls could be brought to Jesus . But the corrupt preachers in this place will have to answer for the awful influence that is damning multitudes of poor sinners , both in and out of their sect enclosures . On the last two nights of our meeting , there was also meeting in the Methodist house in the town . Some of that sect were greatly convicted to escape out of her ; but we could feel the influence of those meetings as sensibly as if the Holy Spirit were incarnate and were being literally crucified in the town , as the Spirit and Word were killed " in the streets of the great city , which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt . " * ( Revelation 11:8 ) Oh , how sensibly we felt the " fellowship of the suffering " * ( Philippians 3:10 ) of Jesus Christ ! While the sweet peace of God flows a deep , everlasting undercurrent in our souls , we often feel the slaughter of immortal spirits in the streets of Babylon until our heart sickens and we long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the apostle , we always conclude that " for us to live is Christ " * ( Philippians 1:21 ) ; and the rescue of perishing souls from the brink of hell fires us with a willingness to expose our soul to the hatred and jeers , violence and murder in hearts that are drunk on the wine of beast religion . The United Brethren preacher at this place , whom Satan used with such diligence against the work when we were here last year , was much tormented by our return . " The wine of the wrath of her fornication " * ( Revelation 14:8 ; 18:3 ) so foamed in his heart that , we were told by good authority , he said that he wished we were stripped , tarred and feathered , and then set on fire , and added that he would like to touch the match himself . And this wretched priest of Baal professes sanctification , and frequently leads the Babylon holiness bands meetings . Today we were told that he regretted much that his words came to our ears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his theft , but that he was caught in the deed . <p> A sister came in from the country and received full salvation . There being a union meeting house in the community , she and others desired us to come there and preach the gospel . We agreed to do so on Sabbath evening if the house could be obtained . She thought there would be no difficulty . But as soon as the matter became known , a Methodist local preacher of the vicinity began to rage . He came to Walkerton on Saturday and , " foaming out his shame " * ( Jude 1:13 ) before the people , declared that if we attempted to enter that pulpit he would " break our head , " " break our neck , " " kill us , " etc . <p> Bishop Foster speaks of his M. E. sect as follows : " Oh , how changed ! A hireling ministry will be a feeble , a timid , a truckling , a time serving ministry , without faith , endurance , and holy power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festivals , concerts , and such like , have taken the place of the religious gatherings , revival meetings , class- and prayer-meetings of the past . Oh , how changed ! " Yes , saith the prophet , " How is the faithful city become an harlot ! it was full of judgment ; righteousness lodged in it : but now murderers . Thy silver is become dross , thy wine mixed with water : thy princes are rebellious , and companions of thieves : every one loveth gifts , and followeth after rewards . " * ( Isaiah 1:21-23 ) <p> Surely we have come to the last days , traitors , heady , highminded , lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereof : from such turn away . " * ( 2 Timothy unclean and hateful bird . " * ( Revelation 18:2 ) <p> Oh , the rottenness , fierce hatred , and soul murdering wickedness of sect Babylon ! If there were only one hundred professors of Christ in the United States , and they all holy men and women of God , filled with faith and the Holy Spirit , walking unto all pleasing before God and exemplifying the pure life of Christ before men , and this generation had never known any other kind of professors of Christ , the masses of the people could be rapidly reached by the gospel of Jesus and saved from sin . But the devil has the world piled up with corrupt , proud , filthy , sectish religionists , " professing that they know God ; but in works they deny him , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " * ( Titus 1:16 ) <p> And because God has given us an honest heart to confess the sins of the professed Christendom and show the people that Christ is not the author of this mass of spiritual whoredom and abominable wickedness , which has filled hell with lost souls and covered the earth with blackness and infidelity , the devil howls and rages in his sectish priests , who are ready to murder us as the Jews did Christ , Stephen , and thousands of other martyrs who testified against them and their evil deeds . <p> As we shall have to meet the people of Walkerton and surroundings face to face in the day of judgment , God holds us responsible to tell them that the greatest obstruction to the salvation of souls is their shoddy , sectish holiness and their abominable , worldly religion . <p> Up to the summer of 1887 the evangelistic efforts of Brother Warner and his company were confined to the States of the Middle West . But now came a more extensive tour , that should take them as far West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Office and after a few meetings in LaGrange and Jay Counties , Indiana , departed for the West . They stopped at Gilman and Onarga , Illinois , and Hayesville , Iowa . From Keokuk , Iowa , they traveled by steamboat to St. Louis , where the following report was written : <p> " O magnify the LORD with me , and let us exalt his name together " * ( Psalm 34:3 ) ! We have just landed here from the steamboat Sidney , having bad a very delightful trip down the Mississippi from Keokuk . We made the trip of two hundred miles in twenty hours . The river being very low at this time , much caution was necessary to avoid running aground . Doubtless one hundred miles were traveled in passing from one side of the river to the other to keep the deepest channel . We were a day and a night at Keokuk , waiting the coming of the boat . The Gem City was to have reached Keokuk the first day and then return down the river ; but being late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to wait until the next day . Praise God , we confessed His all-wise hand in the matter and thanked Him for the prolonged wait , believing it was all ordered of Him . This morning about daybreak we passed the Gem City , she having stuck fast in the sand . So the Lord was good to His little ones and gave us a safe and very joyful voyage . Oh , the goodness and wisdom of God our heavenly Father for placing the great rivers and lakes in the earth as a beautiful means of travel ! It is so much more pleasant than by railroad . Though the speed is not more than half so great , we can very pleasantly improve the time reading and writing . However , this trip was so wonderfully enjoyed by us that we could do no more than feast upon the beauties of nature and praise the Lord . The river abounds in beautiful green islands , and all her verdant banks are delightful . Just below the mouth of the Illinois River , for a few miles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high rocky shore very beautiful scallops and great piers and towers , and even some appearances of partly ruined mansions and rustic stone buildings . <p> No one else on board the vessel seemed to be delighted with these vast and beautiful works as were our company , because unacquainted with our dear Father , whose hand of love has formed them all . Oh , how blessed the pure in heart who see God all along the voyage of life ! What a vastly different aspect everything wears when looked at in the light of God ! Oh , how poor and meager the pleasures of the children of this world ! How utterly tasteless and empty their thoughts and conversation ! No place on earth serves better to call out the glories of a life hid with Christ in God in its striking contrast with the dark minds and almost senseless twaddle of the aliens than the deck of a steamboat . Even the more elevated seldom have a worthy thought on immortal mind ; while every object our eyes lighted upon in the passing panorama of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved our hearts and lips to praise His name . Oh , what a rapturous and heavenly kingdom we live in , all flashing with glory and yet hidden from the blinded sinners ! Having lost our lives for Christs sake we are raised to the heavenly joys of the life of God in us , a life of bliss , that already transcends the sinners loftiest ideal of heaven itself . Oh , the beauties of holiness ! " Out of Zion , the perfection of beauty , God hath shined. " * ( Psalm 50:2 ) Never in all past experience has our heart flowed out more in gratitude to God for the inexpressible bliss of a pure conscience , a pure heart through the blood of Christ , an innocent life through grace divine , a conversation in heaven flowing from a good treasure in the heart , and , above all , a soul illuminated and inspired to see and enjoy God in every bright sunbeam that gleams on earth and sparkles in the silvery stream and every object upon the footstool of God . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord willing , where we expect to meet once more our dear Brother J. Cole , and many others dear to our hearts by the fellowship of the Spirit whose faces we have never seen . And best of all , we are expecting a glorious harvest of souls turned to righteousness by the mighty power and love of God . <p> The next report was written from St. James , Crawford County , one hundred miles west of St. Louis . Brother B. E. Warren says that after buying their tickets for St. James they had but seven cents left , and that after arriving at the latter place Brother Warner went to the post office and received a letter containing five dollars from S. L. Speck , who felt led of the Lord to send that amount . Brother Warners account of their reception in St. James , as follows , is interesting : <p> The night following our last report , which was from St. Louis , Missouri , we landed at St. James , at 12:30 A.M. The Lord directed us to a friendly inn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat at the breakfast table our grateful hearts flowed out in our sweet little table thanksgiving song . The Lord wonderfully blessed that sweet offering of praise . It rang out and greeted the ears of all in hearing as the music of heaven . After meal , requests soon came in for songs . The Holy Spirit gloriously inspired our voices to sing His praises . Many people soon collected in front of the room and some came in . After a few hymns , we had family worship . We invited all that would come to come in and bow with us in prayer . Some did so . The Lord blessed our souls . Soon Brother J. H. Morrison came into town , and seeing the throng in front of the hotel he asked the cause , and was told that " your people have come to town . " He came into the waiting room and introduced himself , and the Spirit of God gave us a joyful meeting . Sinners looked on with wonder and amazement , and were led to say , " These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the right way , " according to the one to another . " * ( John 13:35 ) Many seemed quite serious . Had we tried to respond to the requests of the people we should have kept singing all day without cessation . <p> The people desired Brother Morrison to keep us right there and have a meeting that night in town , saying they would see that all our expenses there should be paid . The landlady and family were also very anxious we should stay , and treated us with much kindness . The Lord reward them . The Methodist preacher also came to see what this Pentecost fire was that had come to town . When asked if we could have their meeting house that night he replied that he was going to " begin a protracted meeting tonight . " Suddenly the preacher concluded a protracted meeting was needed in his charge . Whoever heard of a Methodist minister commencing a protracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central Missouri , especially since that sect has gone spiritually to the frigid zone where , as their oldest living bishop says , " spirituality is frozen to death " ? Quite a capacious hall was procured and well filled , and we enjoyed preaching the precious gospel to the people . About all received the word . The M. E. meeting consisted of three or four women , and was not further protracted . <p> The day of our arrival here came also dear Brother C. C. Knight , from Fulton , Illinois , with tent and equipment to accompany us on our Western campaign . He is full of faith and the Holy Ghost and is a good help in the work . <p> The next day we moved out to the campground , which is about ten miles from St. James and near the Merrimac River . Here we met our dearly beloved Brother Cole , who spent a year with us in Michigan a few years ago ; also his sister Mary , a chosen and anointed instrument of God to preach and testify the gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little company were to encounter a new problem . As soon as they arrived at the place of meeting they were accorded a strange reception . Those who were supposed to be saints at that place came to meet them , some dancing on one leg , some roiling their eyes in their head , others gibbering in tongues , or jerking , or falling stiff , etc . At first they did not know what to make of the strange performance . At this place also was another attempt by a mob to capture Brother Warner . His report continues : <p> We met also a much larger host of saints than we had expected to find in this country . Praise God for this ! But , oh , how soon we saw and felt that Satan , the deceiver , had passed a dreadful network of deception over them , or nearly all of them ! Unseemly and even hideous operations and contortions were carried on and called the manifestations of the Spirit and power of God . We began at once to rebuke it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our souls in preaching His word and assured us that He had much people there who were honest and sincere at heart and who would be delivered by the presentation of his word . The supposed gift of tongues was alarmingly increasing . Indian war dances , etc. , had turned the church of God into something quite different , a disgusting maze of confusion . We were helped of God in teaching them " how they oughtest to behave themselves in the house of God , which is the church of the living God . " * ( 1 Timothy 3:15 ) <p> A terrible nervous jerking had seized upon many in the meetings , which in some cases resembled much St. Vitas dance . We speak of these things in order to give the saints of God everywhere the benefit of what these precious souls have learned in the dear school of experience . We had never seen such manifestation except in persons possessed with devils , and yet the Spirit of God showed us these were not so possessed , but were , for the most part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corinthians 12 , 13 , 14 , and showed the beautiful harmony of the church under the control of the Spirit of God ; that love " doth not behave itself unseemly " * ( 1 Corinthians 13:5 ) ; that the gift of tongues was not of general usefulness , and was a sign to the Jews , not generally edifying to the church ; that other gifts should be sought in preference , and unless he or some one else interpret , the person having the gift should keep silent or speak to himself ; that " five words with the understanding is better than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue " * ( 1 Corinthians 14:19 ) ; that spasmodic jerking is not mentioned in the Bible as a manifestation of Gods Spirit , but is ascribed to a malignant spirit . <p> We renounced that working as of the devil . It seems that one brother who had been powerfully charged by the Holy Spirit had become puffed up , which gave place to this satanic working . Then Satan made it the standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore many earnestly prayed for it . They forgot that the Holy Spirit makes intercession for us only according to the will of God , and whatsoever one prays for outside the will of God must be suggested by some other spirit . And as God has not promised to answer such a prayer , the devil steps in and answers it . And now , since delivered , the dear saints see and confess that the incoming of this power dimmed their faith , joy , and peace . It was nothing less than Satan touching and playing upon their nerves and upon their imaginations . Their motives having been good , namely , to seek the real power of God , their consciences were not defiledat least , with most of them . But some were much blinded and puffed up of the devil . Satan had free access to their minds under the cloak of the Spirit of God . Those who were not affected by the foolish jerking of the devil were judged by the devil and made to believe they did not have the Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were under depression and more or less bewildered . Oh , how our souls were saddened at the sight ! O dear saints of God everywhere , do not ascribe to the Spirit of God ludicrous and unbecoming conduct , such as chattering like a coon or barking like a dog , and all hideous looks ! <p> Well , praise God , the word of God was received . Some at first resented , but God soon convicted them and they became teachable . Nearly all the foolish stuff was rid out of the camp after one discourse explaining and renouncing it . Intelligent sinners respected the truth of God that exposed the devils counterfeit , and some who loved the true church wept for joy to see the abomination put away . From that time God led one after another to confess that spiritual joy and true faith began to depart out of their hearts from the time of receiving the jerks . Many came bowing at the altar , and the glorious work of cleansing went forward . <p> The truth of God was published against all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Spirit . Some sect preachers , filled with the beast spirit and the very devil himself , were very much enraged against the word of the Lord , which had laid open the rottenness of their hearts . Hence they spewed out their shame and foamed exceedingly . On Tuesday night , after meeting , we all lay down to rest , being wearied with the arduous labors of the day . A masked mob aroused us from our much needed sleep and ordered all to pack up and leave the grounds in half an hour . They were armed with staves and rocks . Well , the saints arose and packed up , praising God for peace and comfort in their souls , not fearing the poor set of sinners who knew not that they were persecuting the Savior . They made diligent inquiry for us all about the camp . We were doubtless the special victim marked by their rankling hatred ; but the Lord delivered us out of their hands . Oh , praise the Lord with me and let us exalt His name together ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground to get some things that had been left , and there came the preachers who had been bowling with torment and sorrow because of the sword of the Lord , and even gnawing their tongues for pain , and who were generally believed to have been in the clan the night before , and one of them even recognized . They asked with much affected surprise what had happened , and began to declare and even to swear in the presence of God that they knew nothing of the movement and were not in it , though one of them confessed he was glad of it . This they did without having been accused . One brother said , " A guilty conscience needs no accuser ; you plead guilty before accused . " <p> Well , praise God , the next morning , after a few hours sleep , we were called up to join some little ones in asking God to heal a child that was suffering with the croup . The good Lord instantly did the work . Others followed , some for healing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God Himself gathered the saints at that place , and the day was devoted to salvation work . Probably twenty-five or thirty souls were delivered from all the works of the devil and filled with the Spirit of God . Oh , what a mighty change has taken place here ! Instead of gloomy and hideous looks , now shines the glory and beauties of holiness upon the joyful faces of the redeemed , and clear , ringing shouts of praises are pleasing to God . <p> No meeting was announced for the next day , but the Lord gathered quite a number together again , and salvation work was resumed . On both days God so filled and possessed the meetings that there was not time for the slightest allusion to the mob workers of the devil . A stranger might have sat in the meeting the whole day and not received the faintest information of what had happened two nights ago . Praise God , these two days after driven out of camp were the most glorious and fruitful of all that we spent in these wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruffians could do , hissed on by wicked Babylonians , we are filled with joy unspeakable and full of glory . <p> We are now holding meetings a few days in the village of St. James . A large hall is crowded with attentive hearers , and the truth is mightily prevailing . Let all the saints of God pray for us . We will continue to preach the whole truth and rebuke the works of the devil , even if this tour should end in heaven . Hallelujah ! <p> Of these strange manifestations Brother T. E. Ellis , who was one of those living in the vicinity and affected by the peculiar power that possessed the saints there , says : <p> We were under an influence similar to what the modern tongues people are under . We had different manifestations . Some would jerk spasmodically , some would fall and become stiff , some would dance , some would seem to have a kind of trance and a vision . Healing was claimed and the work seemed to be done . We had what we called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked similarly to the way modern tongues people talk nowadays . <p> From St. James the company continued their tour to Carthage , in the southwestern part of the State . They also held meetings at a number of different points in southern Kansas and in southeastern Nebraska . The first paragraph of his report from Chanute , Kansas , was written while he was sick . We quote the first two paragraphs : <p> It seems as distance stretches out between us and the dear loved ones with whom we have so often and joyfully worshiped God , that the love of God in our hearts is drawing us nearer together . I have never before felt the blessed , pure love of God burning so intensely in my heart for the dear household of God as lately . I can scarcely write to the beloved saints without tears dimming my eyes . O dearly beloved , we can feel your daily fervent prayers in our behalf , and all our company desire to thank you for them . <p> We want to testify to the goodness of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , but now we continue writing , a well man . Oh , praise the Lord with me and let us exalt His name together ! From early morn until 3 P.M. today we were very sick , unable to eat . Tried to write , but had to take the bed . Finally the Lord impressed us with earnest prayer . We called the little company and kneeled before God , and , oh , our dear heavenly Father instantly healed our body , took away all bad feeling , raised our voice from the faint tones of a person just beginning to rise from a hard sick spell to clear loud shouts of praise ! He also sent through our entire system the strength of high leaps , as well as the high praises of God . <p> In a later report he shows how his health was maintained by faith . <p> For some time we have felt called of God to devote ourself more especially to the great duty of writing some works of present truth , and we expect to do so after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , we began unconsciously to relax our faith by which in our natural frailty we kept up sufficient strength for field labor . The presence of the ministerial brethren with us for some time also helped ease up our mind and drop our shield of faith by our side . The result was the devil had afflicted our poor weak body for several weeks . But , praise God , the Lord having in answer to prayer shown us what the trouble was , last Sabbath we rebuked the devil in the name the Lord Jesus with a holy vehemence , and our soul and body sprang forth with a shout of victory , and , glory to our God , we have been wonderfully well and spiritually glorious ever since . <p> From Waco , Nebraska , the company traveled westward to Denver . The following are extracts from his report at that place : <p> We stopped over a few hours in Lincoln , the capital of the State . We viewed with surprise the young city . Fourteen years ago when we visited the place it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than double the size of Lansing , Michigan . <p> That night , for the first time in all our travels , an accident occurred to our train , a slight collision with a freight train several miles out of Lincoln . The engine being injured , we had to wait some hours until another was brought from the city . During this time there was a very violent wind . The car rocked on its springs like a load of hay passing over a rough road . But we lay down and slept sweetly , committing ourselves unto the Lord . That evening dear Brother E. E. Byrum , at the office , had a great burden for our safety , as he wrote us the next day . But he prayed for us until the Lord by the Spirit answered him that we should be delivered from all harm . Oh , praise the Lord for His goodness and mercy toward us ! For our safety he placed a burden on one nearly a thousand miles away , but allowed not the slightest anxiety on our minds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took train for Denver , five hundred miles more toward the setting sun . That night we stopped over and had a good nights rest at McCook , Nebraska . Took train again at 7 A.M. and went flying over the prairie at a swift rate . Oh , what vast expanse of the broad prairie ! Some parts are rough and broken , but the larger portion is beautiful and even and wanting only showers or irrigation to make a beautiful farming-country . <p> When about fifty miles from Denver , we observed strange blue banks to the west , which we first took to be dark clouds , but which we soon perceived were distant foothills of the Rocky Mountains . Plainer and higher they loomed up before our eyes as our swift train kept darting like an arrow toward the base . How beautiful and sublime the sight ! Here , at Denver we are twelve miles from the foot mountains . They seem but a very short distance , especially when the morning sun shines brightly against their eastern sides . It seems impossible that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A person would surely suppose that he could walk over and back before breakfast . The foothills , rather mountains , are of a dark color , being covered by timber , and to all appearance just beyond them rise up the beautiful snow-covered range . To our astonishment we are told that fifty miles stretch out between them and that there is a fertile valley there with towns , etc . The snowy range being so much farther off seems to be but a little higher than the foot mountains , and both ranges seem to stand together . In the morning they all seem so close that one would surely suppose a man could be seen if standing there in the snow . <p> It was quite a novelty to the company to see the many sod houses we passed and dugouts in the hillsides . Sometimes there was scarcely anything to attract attention but a window door in a steep little hill . Sometimes we saw upon the level ground a roof about eight by ten covering a little underground house . Most of such were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work here . Let all the saints pray earnestly for the work of salvation . <p> The company remained in Denver ten weeks , holding meeting in various places . When they went to that city there were only four persons who were in the light of the truth , but they left a congregation of about forty who had taken their stand for the truth . Returning eastward they stopped in York County , Nebraska , where Brother Warner had labored in his Nebraska mission in 1873-4 . A portion of his report from Wayland reads as follows : <p> We preached and lived in this community thirteen and fourteen years ago , then a member of the sect wearing the stolen name of Church of God . The Lord blessed our labors in the salvation of some souls from their sins , and we had good meetings . There were very dear brethren and sisters here . But since our departure the work has retrograded . Some of their preachers became horse jockeys , others jealous-hearted , dead formalists , too cold and dry to keep men awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on the work up to the time of our coming here has preached here four years without the conversion of a single soul . During our meeting he resigned his charge , and we are told he has now hired himself to preach for the Christian sect at Wayland , some of the members of which were the most malignant enemies and opposers of the work of grace . An unsaved citizen declared the other evening that about all the bad behavior and interruption he had seen during our meetings was by the sinners of the sects . <p> From Wayland the company went by way of Meriden and Atchinson , Kansas , to Whiteside County , Illinois , where they held meetings near Albany and also near Fulton . The following is the report , in part , from Albany : <p> We were happy to meet our dear beloved Brother Knight at his prairie home , four miles east of Fulton , and he leaped and skipped like a lamb to see us . The next day we all came eleven miles south to Brother A. Byers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrims . The people are receiving the word with much interest . After several days work here and as long at Brother Knights neighborhood we go on homeward , for there is a great deal to do at home , some small works to print and the new songbook , Anthems from the Throne . Praise God for the precious and glorious songs He is sending us ! The music is nearly all written by Brother Barney , whose inspiration in this gift is a marvel . <p> O beloved , will you help us ? A great responsibility rests upon us . While we are praising God for the precious light of heaven let us not forget others in darkness and exposed to the numerous pitfalls now threatening souls for whom Jesus died . Let no spirit of the devil nor any of his children tell you that we have any selfish motive in enlisting all willing and obedient hearts and hands in doing our duty in the rescuing of souls from Satan in every possible way . In the name of Jesus we spurn such meanness . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but " for to me to live is Christ . " * ( Philippians 1:21 ) Are we seeking self-interests , as wicked men have belied us ? Where can any facts be cited upon which to base such an unkind assertion ? On the present tour of nearly a year we have used about every cent we have received from the sale of books to supply the needs of ourself and little company . So we go forth preaching night and day , exposing this poor frail body to the cruel , biting frosts and beating storms , and toiling about every moment with the pen except when in meetings or going to and from , and in about six hours sleep , asking nothing for our labors either from God or man but the salvation of souls and the glory of God . <p> Life will soon be over . You must leave your earthly treasures in the hands of others . Whether they will leave it to serve God or the devil is not yet known . Therefore , had you not better put a little of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in heaven , where thieves do not break through and steal and where moth and rust do not corrupt ? As we return home from this long tour we feel impressed of the Lord to devote ourself more fully to the preparation of matter for the press : and we shall pray God with all our soul to move men and women to provide the means to purchase paper and other supplies to send it forth . There should be some works sent forth by the million , free of cost . We feel sure that God will find willing hearts to help in the work , and shall toil on in full assurance that when we breathe our last we shall have this consolation , that we have done what we could to enlighten and save souls , for whom Jesus died upon the cross . <p> The company arrived at Grand Junction , Michigan , on April 25 . Thus ended their Western tour , in which seed was sown in many hearts to spring up and bear fruit for God . <p> Sister Frankie Miller said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer for rain . It seemed that wherever the company stopped on their way West in Illinois , Iowa , and the other States the country was suffering on account of drought . At every place their visit was either attended or followed by copious showers . At one public service Mother Smith prayed earnestly for rain . There was not a single indication of rain , but before the service was over the heavens blackened and rain fell in abundance . Thus all along their course the drought was broken . <p> The summer of 1888 was spent in attending campmeetings and visiting the churches in various places in Michigan , Indiana , Ohio , and Pennsylvania . Early in the winter a tour was made into Ontario . They found a good many souls in that country who had come out for the truth . Their labors there were blessed in the salvation of others and in the sowing of the good seed . Of the country and people Brother Warner had this to say : <p> We can say that we find a moderately fair farming country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people here and in the States . More than ever we have learned that so long as governments allow a free , conscientious worship of God , their form is quite immaterial . We do not see that people have any special advantages by living in the States over what are enjoyed here . If any difference , farmers do not pay as heavy taxes here as in the States . Local option temperance laws are given to the people , and some counties have no saloons . And one blessed thing Canada has reason to thank God for is the fact that all liquor selling establishments are strictly compelled to close early Saturday evening and not open until Monday morning . This law enforced cuts off nearly one half the mischief of the nefarious business . Sabbath observance is also far more complete here than in the States . We were blessed with good order and find the way open for the gospel freely . <p> In August of the year 1889 , the company again made their way Westward , going as far as Nebraska and returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. James , Missouri , where a mob had given trouble two years before . Some of those who were guilty of that disturbance had become friends to the truth . One old preacher , however , continued to abuse the saints in his preaching until one Sunday evening , after expressing his usual opposition to the saints , he went home and dropped dead near his gate . Before this second visit of Brother Warner to this place one of the Baptist Church members made it known that he intended to break up this meeting also . It was reported that he actually began to work up a mob ; but his child had a bean to lodge in its windpipe and died , and this put a stop to the carrying out of his evil design . <p> Brother Warner intended to spend the winter in Missouri , but he felt drawn back to Indiana . Having a great desire to settle down for a while , he wrote as follows , in December , 1889 : <p> For a long time we have felt the call of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let Him teach us the deep things of God , that we may be able more perfectly to follow out the glorious lines of present truth . We have a great desire to do so , and yet when hungry souls in every direction are calling for the saving truth of God it is hard for us to keep from running ; but if the Lord will , we shall pass the calls around to the many able-bodied and warm-hearted soldiers of the " white horse " cavalry , who are ready to rush to the battle wherever He leads . We began preaching , a poor , frail invalid , over twenty-two years ago , and God has sustained us in a most remarkable manner during all these years of intense labor and great exposure . Oh , how grateful we feel to our heavenly Father that we are blessed with such good health ! But nevertheless we feel that more regular diet , sleep , etc. , for a season will prove a great blessing , and increase and prolong our usefulness on earth . We shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By the close of the year 1889 , it was seen that the work had been almost doubling itself annually . That year there had been held twenty-five grove meetings , fourteen camp meetings , besides several general assemblies . Quite a strong working force was by this time in the field , and evangelists were scattered out in the more distant parts of the country . <p> The next tour of any considerable extent was one that took them into the Southland . This trip was made in November 1890 . They intended to make the trip by boat down the Mississippi , but found the water at a low ebb and traveling very slow . They took a steamer at Cincinnati , but had to wait two days before it started ; and then it took them four days to reach Cairo . After waiting three days for a boat overdue from St. Louis , they made the rest of the journey by rail , and landed at Meridian , Mississippi . In this part of the country Brothers Bradley and Bozeman and others had opened up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preaching of the word . Brother Warner and the company spent several weeks in the eastern part of the State . His bold manner in uncovering sin and false religion occasioned considerable opposition from various sectarian sources . The country was cursed with a false holiness element called " Straight Holiness , " representing the Good Way , a paper then published at Fort Scott , Kansas . Its teachers failed in the South to be uncompromising against tobacco and other evils and they incited no little opposition and prejudice against the New Testament standard held by Brother Warner . At Beech Springs , Mississippi , the mob element was encountered , as is shown by the portion of Brother Warners report here given : <p> At that place there are a few Babylon hearts of the most pernicious hue , men steeped and dyed in tobacco and drunk on Babylons worst wine , the wrath of which they infuse into the baser sort . Brothers Bradley and Bozeman have both been threatened in that place with violence and , we believe , even with murder , and we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second night several pieces of brick and clubs came crashing through the window , all doubtless hurled in wrath at us . Nearly half of the sash was broken in and the glass flew over the house . The unsaved were much frightened , and the whole house was thrown into confusion . The glory of God was greatly upon us through all the evening , and with the cowardly onslaught the heavenly tides so wondrously swelled in our soul that we had to leap for joy in the midst of the uproar . Oh , the mighty river of peace and joy ! The excellent tide of glory only subsided into sleep at a late hour , and it arose again with our waking in the morning . We stood only about seven feet from the window and nearly opposite ; but the hand of God protected us from serious harm . However , the Lord saw He could overrule a slight glancing wound on the side of our face and nose for His glory , and so permitted the same . It was very evident in the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake or else his children were more wicked than he wanted them to be , so that he could not restrain them from their wicked deed , which proved a great blessing to the cause of Christ . All the saints were able to see more clearly than ever before the track that Christ and His early saints had trod . And about all testified that they had reached a clearer experience , stronger faith , and more joy in the Lord through the last nights meeting than ever before . The meeting that day was indeed very glorious . <p> The spiritual condition of the people as countenanced by the " Straight Holiness " teachers in that part of the South is set forth in the report written from Spring Hill , near Meridian : <p> Our last report was from Oak Grove neighborhood . When we entered there we found the powers of darkness and wickedness fierce and black . Threats were breathed about and written notices deposited in the dark . After one nights meeting in the old meeting house , which is a neighborhood building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolhouse near by and the Lord most wonderfully blessed our souls . Satan then had the schoolhouse locked , and though certain citizens had jerked the staples out of the old meeting house and the doors stood wide open , and the Methodist class-leader , being in favor of the right and truth , invited us to enter , yet because others were raging we preferred to hold a little service in the public road , in the bright moonlight . God blessed the songs , prayer , and a few words of exhortation , and all the people seemed touched . Nearly every person present kneeled during prayer . <p> All these circumstances God overruled to the good of the people and the cause of Christ . The schoolhouse was again opened , and we went on a few nights longer , with glorious victory . Only a few sought the Lord ; but there was a general blessing effected on the community in the removal of prejudice and hatred out of many hearts that had been influenced through lies and slanders , such as of promiscuous kissing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott-creed sect.20 <p> 20 : <p> In addition to this a letter had been received in the community , from Carthage , Missouri , written by an opposer who misrepresented the saints as believers in amalgamation with the colored people , the purpose of the letter being , of course , to stir up prejudice . <p> It is a bad and fallacious cause that depends upon defamation of others . The course these schismatics resort to occasions some persecution and no little hatred , and even danger of violent treatment , which they will have to answer for in the day of judgment . But the cause thus bolstered up can not stand , and truth crushed down by foul means is sure to rise again ; and just in proportion as there has been evil-speaking against the truth will it enlist the hearts of the honest , and at the same time forfeit all confidence in and elicit contempt for such as have defamed it and its lovers . In accordance with these principles truth rose triumphant at Oak Grove . The people saw we had been slandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised up many friends for the whole truth in that place , and could we have remained long enough to make a thorough effort , doubtless a number of souls would have been saved . But the way is opened for the true work of God to prosper there . Some who were much prejudiced when we went there , seeing that the truth of God is in us , had their minds changed , and their countenances were divested of the sour and took on the pleasant . God bless the people of that community . <p> From that place we came to Spring Hill , several miles east . Here were a few pure children of God , whom we found yoked up with a majority who were professing salvation and yet " walking after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness. " * ( 2 Peter 2:10 ) In our lifting the standard of Gods Word against such inconsistencies , the wicked spirits were stirred in the baser sort , so that many threats of violence were blown about in the neighborhood . But the hand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Oh , how our soul longs to be excused of this most unpleasant task of lifting the gospel standard of holiness where profession has been countenanced in lives of filth and idolatry ! The preacher that simply tells the people he could not use tobacco , and even earnestly admonishes men to quit , and yet receives the testimonies of men who use it , sets at naught the Word of God , pampers men in their sins , and prepares a storm of persecution to fall on the head of the man who comes after him showing the real Bible line between the works of God and the works of the devil , between real holiness of heart , soul , spirit , and body on the one side , and all filthiness of the flesh and spirit on the other . If holiness teachers , on going into a new field where people know nothing about the doctrine and experience , would faithfully tell them at once that entire sanctification , the second work of grace , cleanses out of man all filthiness of the flesh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it can be obtained only by abandoning every sinful and unclean habit and giving the whole mansoul , body , and spiritup to God for perfect purity of life and being , no person is prepared to contradict him , and such as conclude to seek that grace will expect to pay the full price . <p> But when men are allowed to profess holiness without contradiction and yet practice the sin of tobacco using or anything else contrary to godliness , they , in imagining themselves holy while living in unholiness , as well as sinners in general , learn to associate holiness and filth , and the difficulties in rooting out the abomination are many times increased . Men , by getting a degree of blessing of God upon their souls in consequence of abandoning some evils , or at least imagining themselves blessed , take the same as an endorsement from God upon the filth they yet continue in . The longer they continue in their delusion the more they are confirmed in it and the more they will fight for their idols . And their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to assault and abuse Gods ministers , who must declare the whole counsel of God . And so a lax preacher gives place for the devil and wrath of men to assault the faithful herald of God that follows him . So by the fruits of the devotees of rehashed Methodism in the Fort Scott creed , which has cursed the South and filled hearts with bitter hatred toward all who follow Christ , and by their strife and contentions having brought a general contempt upon the name of holiness , and also by their lack of radicalness against sin in every form , our work here is beset with dark mountains , which God alone can remove , but which , thank His holy name , have been much obliterated in all places where we have labored . <p> Later , at Spring Hill , the mob element was further encountered . Here , as was always the case where a mob gathered to do violence to Brother Warner , the chief instigators were sectarian preachers and professors who were incensed by the preaching of the truth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we last wrote , we went about seven miles to the southeast through a wild and almost mountainous woods , to the house of Brother and Sister Irby , in whose dwelling we remained and held meeting about one week . A goodly number of hearers came out through the wet weather , and the dear Lord was pleased to pour His Spirit upon us gloriously . It seemed that God had taken us up upon the Delectable Mountains . The leaps in our soul were too high for the height of the room , as the house had a ceiling , whereas , nearly all the country houses here have nothing overhead but the roof , and never has a whitewash brush touched the walls . Scarcely one out of ten of the houses in the country has a pane of glass in it . The sisters talked with some women who did not know what a carpet is . We have seen no such thing here . The people in the South seem contented with fewer domestic comforts than any people we ever before met . As one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in tobacco . " There is much truth in this statement . That weed deprives them of nearly all comforts and many actual necessities of life . Of course , there is not the same need of carpeted floors here as in the North ; but how people can live for years in a house without a window is a mystery . <p> Well , our stay at Brother and Sister Irbys seemed to my soul like old Brother Elijahs hiding place in the wilderness , where he dined on food brought by angels . We also feasted on heavenly manna , and shall never forget it . Some came to the altar , and a few cast away their filthy idol ; but we hope the day of judgment will reveal much more good done than was manifest . <p> Some of Gods little ones came over from Spring Hill , who informed us that some were anxious for our return to that place . Now , at that place is where Satans seat is . Before we left there we were much impressed that the mob spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented our going to the place , a disguised crowd was seen going there . But now , hearing that some souls were hungry for salvation , we ventured back in the name of Jesus . <p> When reaching the neighborhood , we were joyfully surprised by the coming of our dear young brother Andrew L. Byers , from Illinois , who has come to join our little company . Having had a great deal of trouble and several days ramble before he found us he was reminded of Stanley in search of Livingstone . Truly our hearts were mutually refreshed by his arrival.21 <p> 21 : <p> Those meetings in the vicinity of Spring Hill were almost the authors first experience in gospel work . I was asked to join the company to supply a missing part in song . Mother Smith having dropped out previously . After arriving at Meridian it was some time before I could locate Brother Warner . <p> The first night of meeting three souls came to the altar , two consecrated for entire sanctification and one was gloriously pardoned . The next night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief slumber occasioned by our absence . A couple of lead balls called buckshot were thrown through the open window by means of a rubber concern that we are told is even dangerous to life . These wicked wretches also threw stones with slings at some of Gods saints on their way home that night , even regardless of women and children in the crowd . One woman was hit . That was a little the lowest and most cowardly work we have ever yet met with . The next day four of Satans chief servants rode out in four directions five and seven miles to enlist by his lies and slanders such as were base enough in a great mob to assault us that night . During the day we learned all about the movement , and at a meeting at a brothers house we recalled the meeting for night , seeing no possible chance of doing good . <p> Hear O heavens , and be ashamed O Babylon , when we tell you that one of the four spirits that went forth to gather together Gog and Magog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Way sect , and the father of the only family of that sect in the neighborhood . And at his cotton gin was the appointed place for the mob to meet . Some five miles away he called on some young men who are reputed pretty wicked and invited them to join the mob , telling them base lies . But they , having more principle than he , said they would have nothing to do , with it . They also came and informed some friends of the Lord all about the plot . These told the Fort Scott man to his face what he was guilty of , and he said he did not deny it . We expected to meet that creed with the Word of God and had hopes of seeing some saved . But they shun Scripture investigation as a wolf shuns daylight . Brother Bradley invited the editor and two of the leading preachers to meet him in discussion , but they have failed to do so and now we have discovered their tactics . They seem to regard slandering and mobbing as better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While we are happy to think that most of them in person would not condescend to mobbing , it is only too true that many of them have given their tongues to slander whereby the other measures have been infused in the baser sort . May God forgive them for Christs sake . <p> There being no meeting at which the mob could assault us , they beset the house where we stayed until about twelve oclock at night . They reported their number between seventy-five and one hundred . They were armed with guns and revolvers . There were in the crowd a Methodist preacher , a class-leader with his axe , many old gray haired sectarians , men recently out of jail ; the basest men in the country mixed up with a majority of sectitesso we were informed by brethren that knew the majority that came up to the house , for a part kept in reserve with most of the guns . They stated that their object was only to give us orders to leave the country next day . A brave army , about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell a few little children of God to leave the next day , after we had announced in the meeting that we were going at that time ! There were a few fearless souls present who told them to their face that they were actuated to their dark work by the lies of Satan and the wickedness of their hearts , and shamed the Babylon professors there mixed up in common cause with base outlaws . <p> The mob hung around until about midnight , clamoring for us to come out , stating they would not hurt us , etc . But when men are low down enough to fling buckshot into a congregation and rocks into a mixed crowd , you might as well tell us that wolves and hyenas do not care for meat as to say that such did not want to hurt us . Doubtless some in the crowd did not , and for what we know such as said so did not ; but judging the mob by what we had seen in the past we had good sense enough to avoid such beasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great way off , they fired off their pieces , which , for a few seconds , mimicked the din of war.22 <p> 22 : <p> To one unaccustomed it was hard to realize that opposition to the truth would take the form of a mob . We were quartered at the house of a Brother Smith . When the mob first came , Brother Warner asked if I wished to join him in his escape from the house . I then accompanied him to the pine woods some distance from the dwelling , and we remained there until we could hear that the mob had left . Brother B. E. Warren had found a hiding place under the house . The first company of men that came proved to be only a detachment , and the mob afterward came in greater force . This second time I remained in the house with the women folks , while Brothers Warner and Warren took the hiding under the building . The men wanted Brother Warner and lingered at the gate for some time talking with Brother Smith , who would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Brother Warner was not in the house . Finally , after learning that I was present , they asked to see me , whereupon I went out and talked with them from the porch . They asked a number of questions and then left . <p> May God ever bless and keep the few pure children of God in that wicked region ; and may He reward their kindness to us and also that of the few non-professors , whom we shall not soon forget and for whom we shall pray that God may bless and reward them with His great salvation . <p> Following the campaign in eastern Mississippi , meetings were held in northern Alabama , near Hartselle and near Athens , after which the company returned northward , Brother Warner into Indiana and the others into Ohio . <p> In a report written from Markleville , Indiana , he tells of a visit to Indianapolis , where The Trumpet passed through the first year and a half of its existence . <p> We came on to Indianapolis , where we began the blasts of the Gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning walked out to the spot where we labored and prayed and trusted God nearly two years in great trials . Abandoned and hated of all the world , opposed by all of Babylon and rejected by the sectish associated holiness forces , we were forced out upon the promises of God and endured a great light of faith . All the earth seemed dark as midnight , and growling letters came thick and fast and friendly ones few and far between . We were wherea stranger in a city , without money , friends , or credit " Give us this day our daily bread " * ( Matthew 6:11 ) was not a mere formal prayer . Oh , the riches of the goodness and the wonders of the mercy of God ! Surely He hath never yet forsaken the righteous . Here we labored and prayed in intense poverty , while the word of the Lord tried us ; but His strong arm hath gotten Him the victory over all the powers of hell and earth . Here we had a temporary summer office on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 x 14 , in winter . Now a large two-story building is occupied with the business , and the circulation is rapidly enlarging . <p> We went back to the room we had occupied through the night and cast ourself down on the carpet in gratitude to God . Glory be to God for the triumph for His mighty present truth ! <p> The tour into the Southern States was the last tour Brother Warner made in company with his little band of singers and helpers . After holding a couple of grove meetings in Ohio and attending the Beaver Dam meeting in Indiana , during the summer of 1891 , the company did not travel together any longer . Brother Warner visited the churches in Pennsylvania and Ontario and then spent the following winter , or most of it , at the publishing office . In April 1892 came a visit to the churches in the West , including the one at Denver . Before leaving home for this trip he suffered from a severe attack of rheumatism , and recovered only by a constant fight of faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he frequently had to contend with afflictions and how he found his victory only in the Lord . <p> Through exposure in a cold rain at Kenesaw , Nebraska , I was taken with a bad lung trouble ; was quite poorly and had lost about all appetite . But , thank God , we held on by faith in Him and He raised me up . I was rapidly regaining strength when we left there . But an apparently congested state of my lungs seemed still to oppress my being . As the onward-flying train carried us higher and the air consequently became more and more light , the difficulty of breathing increased . I also found myself under a fever and lay one day very weak . <p> Oh , how my poor soul cried out all the day long for the blessing of health and strength once more to this frail temple that had been so long crushed down with one affliction after another ! But there was searching of the heart and consecration as well as prayer . I realized a sweet willingness to suffer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost more than a willingness to quit the theater of this life and of this dark world , which had pressed so many bitter cups of tribulation to my lips . I did not know , indeed , but that I had come here to join the dark train that moves silently and almost constantly out of this city to the large city of the dead , where thousands who come here to regain health are furnished a grave instead of health . But these thoughts brought no gloom to my redeemed soul . Three glorious things lit all up brightly : <p> First , I knew my soul was all arrayed in the pure righteousness of God , without spot , and that by the grace of God I had kept the faith , obeyed God , and done what I could to glorify His holy name on earth . <p> Second , whether we wakeremain in the bodyor sleepleave the bodywe shall live together with the Lord . I shall still have a conscious and joyful existence in a more near and blissful presence of the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortal body also shall put on immortality and be fashioned like Christs glorious body . Oh , bless God for the beautiful hope of a child of God ! <p> Before sundown I awoke from a short sleep , and instantly felt heavenly sweetness in my soul and comfort in body . Behold , the Lord had taken away all the fever ! That night some of the beloved came together and anointed me for complete healing . We believed the Lord granted the petition , and after much trial of my faith I am now feeling well in body once more and rapidly gaining strength . <p> His account of his visiting the natural wonders at Colorado Springs is interesting and shows his love for the handiwork of God . <p> Yesterday we all improved the time in visiting some of Gods wonderful works about Manitou , and what is called the Garden of the Gods . Here we praised and worshiped the true God and creator of all things in heaven and earth , when we beheld the wonderful works that His hands had wrought . Here rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the earth , yellow rocks to the height of over three hundred feet . Some of them look like a great castle , others are a few thin slabs standing side by side with very fine crevices , between which were doubtless at one time veins of rock more soft than the rest , and the stream of time has worn them out . Some of these majestic formations could be ascended to a considerable height from one side . On these elevations we shouted the praises of God , feeling His presence with us . Many smaller rocks of very peculiar shape are seen in this romantic region . <p> From here we proceeded to the town of Manitou , which is a small but very attractive town in a deep passage of the mountains . Here we found a family that was interested in full salvation . We talked with them and prayed with them , and perhaps they will find a door open for Jesus in that place . We then drove about one mile beyond up the Ute Pass to Rainbow Falls , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so highly charged with mineral substances that it is nearly as strong as hard cider ; and yet it has what most pronounce no unpleasant flavor . It tastes like strong soda water . It is very electrifying to the system , and the constant tide of visitors goes there to drink the healing waters . Near the upper springs is the beginning of the cog railroad that transports travelers up to the summit of Pikes Peak . The distance up the mountain is about nine miles . <p> Returning to Manitou we stopped and drank freely of the soda spring , of which soda water is a good imitation . Visitors may freely drink of all these springs and each may carry away one quart of the precious water . We brought some home , and by adding sugar and lemon juice the water foamed up and made a delicious drink . <p> Here we sit and write in Colorado Springs on a plain that rises nearly six thousand feet above the place of our home . How pure and light the atmosphere is ! And Pikes Peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet still higher in the skies . <p> His return to Michigan was in time to attend the general camp meeting , which this year was held on the new ground at Grand Junction . Before the summer was over he received an urgent call to go to the Pacific Coast and to attend the tabernacle meeting at Los Angeles , California , in October . Feeling it the will of the Lord that he go he started on this journey in August . After a few meetings in Missouri , Iowa , and Kansas , he proceeded to Los Angeles , which he reached in time to attend the meeting appointed there . His first report from the Coast , written at National City , is in part as follows : <p> We were three days and nights making the trip , with very little stopping . We came over the Santa Fe system . We passed over much wild and mountainous scenery , but the lofty peaks called The Needles we passed at night and failed to see . Our chariot brought us over one thousand miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional Indian camp or village , or a mining point . For perhaps a hundred miles or more the earth was as bare as the paved streets of a city , and for many hundred miles nothing but tumbleweed had ventured life upon the dry region . But it is believed that nearly all that lifeless desert would be productive if irrigated or blessed with summer showers . One thing that broke the awful monotony of the long , weary plains was the fact that we were seldom out of sight of mountain ranges . In Arizona we reached a very high altitude . The morning found the ground covered with snow and the temperature quite cold . In eastern California we traveled for hundreds of miles in the midst of a wild , mountainous scenery , much of the time running on or near the summit , giving us a grand and awful view of the mountains for a vast distance around . Finally , fertile nooks , little houses , and orchards made their welcomed appearance , which began to relieve the mind wearied with the long scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look as though we had returned to the land of the living . <p> A few hours more through almost perpetual vineyards , lemon , orange , and fig orchards , etc. , brought us into Los Angeles , and seeing our dear Brother J. W. Byers through the window , we felt like climbing over the slow moving people to reach the door . Oh , praise God for the privilege of greeting our dear fellow laborer in the gospel of God ! We found him and family well , and he and Sister Byers wonderfully devoted to their calling , laboring day and night with unwearied zeal for the salvation of lost men and women , who are on the brink of everlasting ruin . Praise God , we soon saw that their labors have been owned and blessed of God . We found a precious and very zealous church in Los Angeles . <p> Truly dear Brother and Sister Byers have been working the richest mine of gold ever opened in California . Their toils have known no moderation . They have indeed , according to apostolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ministry of the word . " * ( Acts 6:4 ) And , thank God , there are those in Los Angeles who labored with their hands for the direct object of saving lost men and women , using only enough to supply natures wants . Oh , that everybody who professes consecration of self and all to God would show it forth by a life wholly devoted to the spread of the pure gospel of Christ and the deliverance of the lost ! <p> His stay in California was confined to the southern part of the State , where he spent two and one half months laboring in various places . On his return he wrote from Denver and described some of the sublime scenery he witnessed on the line of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad . <p> Some of the most sublime scenery was passed in the night . At Glenwood Springs the train stopped an hour and a half , giving passengers a much appreciated relief from long confinement and a very much enjoyed ramble amid the beautiful scenery of the little city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains on all sides . Here , for the first time in our life , we saw hot springs . The weather was cold and snow was on the ground , and the many stony springs and the great hot-water reservoir caused a steam to arise that made a person feel as if the infernal fires were not far off . A stone wall separates between two large pools , in one of which arise many cold springs , and just over the wall the hot water boils up . At this place is the junction of the Grand River and the Roaring Fork . Our line followed up the Grand River , the canon of which was very delightful . The great red , stone mountains towered up on both sides in the form of large old castles , many of them nearly square and others oblong but with square corners like a building . Finally we left the Grand River and followed the winding course of a tributary . Now the scene became yet more wildly grand , which we greatly enjoyed . <p> At some time past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requested the porter to notify us , we lay down without undressing , and so , blessed with good starlight , we were enabled to behold one of the most sublime and awful scenes we ever witnessed in all our travels . Here the almighty hand of God had cleaved a narrow passage through the rocks , which tower up thousands of feet on either side . On our left we passed close to the base of the mighty wall ; on our right only a small stream lay between our track and the awful elevation . This indescribably awful gorge extended perhaps for two or three miles . We stood upon the platform of the car , at first turning our eyes right and left , beholding with solemn wonder the vertical cliffs that seem almost to touch the stars . Finally we had but to direct our eyes straight up between the two cars and behold , by one straight upward gaze , the cliffs on both sides as their proud summits seemed to draw together . As we stood on the platform nearest the rocks we frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We could not refrain from crying out , " Oh ! oh ! wonderful ! wonderful ! " Never shall we forget that impressive sight ! It seems to us that we would have but to make that trip by daylight to be satisfied that nothing more sublimely awful and inspiring need be looked for amid all the wonders of this creation of God . We would not have missed it for a great deal , and hope it may please God to let our eyes behold the same by daylight . <p> On the previous afternoon we passed a freight train that had the day before been wrecked by running upon a heap of earth and rocks that had broken loose perhaps a thousand feet up the sloping mountains and , rushing down , covered the track . The engine and tender were pitched down the hill and lay upside down , under which , alas , the fireman had met his death , or rather he lay with his limbs crushed beneath the engine for over four hours and expired a short time after being taken out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliffs and around the short , curving niches that were cut out of the solid rocks , sometimes at a height that made one feel giddy to look down , we thought how the strength of the everlasting hills is our Fathers , and that His wings overshadowed us by the way . We felt no fear of harm . <p> His poem " Goodbye , Old Rockies " was written at this time . He arrived home February 16 . With the portion of his report written after he had returned from his California tour we close this chapter . <p> Never in all our past journeyings did our soul seem so thankful and joyful before God for the privilege of greeting all the dearly beloved ones at home once more . Oh , bless the name of the Lord . We knew not how to thank God enough nor scarcely how to act for the great joy of our heart . Let all the dear saints help us bless the name of the Lord for His wonderful care over us during the travel of over ten thousand miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been in vain . All along the line of our tour God has been with us and saved souls at every stopping place , with perhaps two exceptions . Thank Heaven also for the blessing of good health ! How wonderfully He strengthened us to preach His everlasting gospel , often twice a day and sometimes on Sabbath three times , putting in as much as eight hours swift talk in one day , added to which was the earnest altar service and the care for immortal souls ! We feel especially thankful to God for the grace of our Lord and Savior that we find resting upon all the beloved family . <h> The Ministry of Song <p> Scarcely a spiritual movement in the history of Christianity has been without its service of song . The emotions , whether of victory or of devotion or of interest in the salvation of the lost , naturally flow out in singing . Far back in Biblical history we find songs of victory attending the triumphs of the people of God . <p> The Wesleyan reformation , through its gifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard spiritual hymns that are in use today . Witness also the immortal gospel hymns that originated with the Moody and Sankey revivals of the last century . Likewise the holiness movement of forty and fifty years ago was characterized by its holiness songs . And so in these last times , when we have come to the full standard of truth and the full development of the church independent of human creeds , when the " ransomed of the Lord " * ( Isaiah 35:10 ) are returning over the " highway " * ( Isaiah 35:8 ) prepared , what wonder is it that they should " come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads " * ( Isaiah 35:10 ) ? In no respect was the inception of the present reformation more marked than in its ministry of holy song . <p> For the writing of spiritual hymns Brother Warner had a wonderful endowment . It seems that the development of this gift came , however , only with his entrance upon the special work of the reformation . In his earliest writings we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few verses in his diary betray a lack of familiarity with the principles of prosody , or hymn writing . Considering the little time he had to devote to the study of those principles , it is marvelous that he produced so many useful , and we may say excellent , hymns during the few short years of his intensive ministerial labor . <p> His first effort appears to have been the adaptation of existing hymns either by rearrangement of the words or by composing new words to fit the tunes . Thus we have the " Glory , Glory , Hallelujah " song with new words appearing in an early copy of The Gospel Trumpet . The chorus is familiar to all and we omit it . <p> On the mountain top of vision what a glory we behold ! Eighteen hundred years of victory are tinging earth with gold ; For the saints are overcoming with their testimony bold , The truth is marching on . <p> For the glory of the Father Jesus taught in Galilee , And He preached the great salvation that delivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , " Redemptions full and free , " The truth is marching on . <p> From the cabin on the prairie , from the vaulted city dome ; From the dark and briny ocean where our sailor brothers roam , We now hear the glad rejoicing like a happy harvest home , Salvations rolling on . <p> Eighteen hundred years of marching , eighteen hundred years of song , While the Conqueror advanceslo , the time will not be long:He shall soon appear in glory and shall overthrow the wrong , Our God is marching on . <p> Nahums chariots are speeding as the lightning on their way , And their flying torches tell us t is the preparation day ; For the bride is getting ready and the Lord will not delay , The marriage feast is near . <p> Precious knowledge is increasing , evening light begins to glow , With the trump of full salvation many running to and fro ; And the song of glory echoes , " Christ has washed us white as snow , " All glory to His name ! <p> See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now flying from all nations to their ancient dwelling place ; And the sinful world is surely in its closing day of grace , The Lord is just at hand . <p> In the valley of decision there 's a battle drawing near , Sectish Gog and Magog powers round about the saints appear ; But our God is our munition and our hearts shall never fear , The victory is sure . <p> On the blissful heights of glory we will shout the battle oer , And in the golden city we will join the Conqueror , And when the war is over , with the saints forevermore Well crown Him with all praise. * <p> On the subject of the churcha prominent subject with himwe have Brother Warners arrangement of Frances Ridley Havergals poem , " Church of God . " We give but two stanzas : <p> Church of God , thou spotless virgin , Church of Christ , for whom He died , Thou hast known no human founder , Jesus bought thee for His bride . Sanctified by God the Father , Built by Jesus Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Three in One . <p> God Himself has set the members In His body all complete , Organized by Jesus only , Oh , the union , pure and sweet ! Church of God , the angels marvel At the music of thy song ; Earth and hell in terror tremble , As thy army moves along. * <p> Another of the class of adapted hymns was one on the exercise of faith for sanctification , sung to the tune of " Beulah Land " : <p> Why should a doubt or fear arise , As this poor little all of mine I lay a living sacrifice , All on the altar , Christ divine ? <p> Refrain : <p> I 'm fully Thine , yes , wholly Thine , All on the altar , Christ divine ; The word of Jesus I believe , The Sanctifier I receive ; All on the altar I abide , And Jesus says I 'm sanctified . <p> Ah , not a moment more Ill doubt , And not a moment longer wait ; He shed his blood to sanctify , He suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on His Word , My doubts are oer , the victry won ; He said the altar sanctifies , I just believe Him , and t is done . <p> Through all my soul I feel His powr , And in the precious , cleansing wave I wash my garments white this hour , And prove His utmost powr to save. * <p> See , the great king of Babel in these latter days of time Makes a feast that 's universal , all the nations drink her wine ; As they eat , drink , and revel in her lofty steepled hall , God proclaims her desolation by His hand upon the wall . <p> How the nations are drunken and are sporting in their shame ! Even scoffing at our Savior and profane His holy name ; Far more blind than Belshazzar , who so trembled with appall , They still riot on to judgment , with their doom upon the wall . <p> Brother Warner was not gifted in writing tunes . This necessary counterpart was supplied in J. C. Fisher and his wife , Allie R. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in northern Indiana . Fisher frequently wrote both words and music , as did also Jeffrey . One of the first hymns of which both words and music were original with this reformation was " The All-Cleansing Fountain , " by J. C. Fisher . The first stanza and chorus are as follows : <p> There 's a fountain opened in the house of God , Where the vilest of sinners may go , And all test the power of the crimson flood , Of the blood that makes whiter than snow . <p> Refrain : <p> Praise the Lord , I am washed , In the all-cleansing blood of the Lamb , And my robes are whiter than the driven snow , I am washed in the blood of the Lamb . <p> Another early one was H. R. Jeffreys " Songs of Victory , " of which the first stanza and chorus will also here suffice : <p> Songs of victory bringing Unto the Lord most high ; Victory , victory singing , Let all the saints draw nigh ; For there can be no failure While Jesus leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard on every hand . <p> Refrain : <p> Victory shall be the chorus , Victory our watchword and song ; Jesus is marching before us , Leading His army along . <p> A hymn that breathes a deep spirit of devotion was Brother Warners " I Ought to Love My Savior , " music by Fisher . There were five stanzas in all . <p> I ought to love my Savior , He loved me long ago ; Looked on my soul with favor , When deep in guilt and woe . And though my sin had grieved Him , His Fathers law had crossed , Love drew Him down from heaven , To seek and save the lost . <p> I ought to love my Savior , He bore my sin and shame ; From glory to the manger , On wings of love He came . He trod this earth in sorrow , Endured the pains of hell ; That I should not be banished , But in His glory dwell . <p> We shall refer , in what follows , only to Brother Warners hymns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled " Prophetic Truth " : <p> T was sung by the poets , foreseen in the spirit , A time of refreshing is near ; When creeds and divisions would fall to demerit , And saints in sweet union appear . <p> Refrain : <p> Oh , glory to Jesus ! we hail the bright day , And high on our banner salvation display , The mists of confusion are passing away . <p> We stand in the glory that Jesus has given , The moon , as the dayspring doth shine ; The light of the sun is now equal to seven , So bright is the glory divine . <p> Now filled with the Spirit and clad in the armorOf light and omnipotent truth ; Well testify ever , and Jesus well honorAnd stand from sin Babel aloof . <p> The prophets keen vision , transpiercing the ages , Beheld us to Zion return ; Well sing of our freedom , though Babylon rages , Well shout as her city doth burn . <p> The fig tree is budding , the " evening " is shining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savior , for time is declining , Eternitys looming in sight ! <p> As he saw the church of God emerge out of confusion into the brightness which should characterize the evening of time , he wrote the following : <p> Brighter days are sweetly dawning , Oh , the glory looms in sight ! For the cloudy day is waning , And the evening shall be light . <p> Misty fogs , so long concealingAll the hills of mingled night , Vanish , all their sin revealing , For the evening shall be light . <p> Lo , the ransomed are returning , Robed in shining crystal white , Leaping , shouting home to Zion , Happy in the evening light . <p> Free from Babel in the Spirit , Free to worship God aright , Joy and gladness were receiving , Oh , how sweet this evening light . <p> Hallelujah ! saints are singing , Victry in Jehovahs might ; Glory ! glory ! keep it ringing , We are saved in evening light. * <p> Another hymn of the return , and also embodying Sister Fishers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We are coming , hallelujah ! we are coming home to God ; Jesus only were beholding , who has washed us in His blood . We are marching back to Salem at the trumpets joyful sound , And were building Gods own temple on its ancient holy ground . <p> Refrain : <p> We are coming , oh , were coming , with the glory in the soul ! Grace were shouting as were bringing Christ , the headstone we extol . Though as captives long we 've suffered , we do feel the royal blood , And were rising to our freedom in the fullness of our God . <p> While were working , we are fighting all the mighty foes around ; Though in wrath they do oppose us we will not desert the ground . O my God , do Thou remember all those wicked , plotting crews , Hear them saying in derision , " Now what do these feeble Jews ? " <p> Thou art coming , mighty Jesus , in the power of Thy grace ; Now our souls break forth in singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mount of terror , Thou hast made an open plain , And the misty fogs of error all have vanished in Thy name . <p> Our foundation strong is Jesus , He the topmost , crowning stone ; Hallelujah ! we adore Him , king upon His living throne . And His crimson glory streaming through each crystal stone below Tints the whole ecstatic temple with the beauty of its glow . <p> Oh , the glory of this temple far exceeds the former one ! All its stones are bound together in loves dear eternal Son . In this building , what a wonder ? there 's a dwelling place for me ; Yes , Thy beauty , O my Savior ! I shall here forever see. * <p> Many of his hymns , as is usually the case with hymn writers , were prompted by some particular occasion or suggestion . Thus in connection with the terrific furnace trials at Bucyrus , Ohio , in 1883 , he wrote : <p> Why should a mortal man complain At his trials in this wicked world ? Nay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oer us unfurled . <p> Oh , why should anyone oppressed Forget the promise of our God ! To thee each providence is blessed If in love thou bear the chastning rod . <p> Oh , who would cast away the gold Weve gathered in the furnace flame ! And who would wish again the dross Here purged in our Redeemers name ? * <p> Once when a new printing press was installed in the office ( he always rejoiced when there was an increase of printing equipment ) , he wrote the following in anticipation of The Trumpets being raised to louder blasts : <p> Onward moves the great Eternal In the order of His plan ; Louder , nearer rolls the thunder Of His awful word to man . <p> Since by sin this earth was blighted , God has whispered of His love ; Dreams and visions by His prophets Breathed of mercy from above . <p> Louder speaks His love in Jesus ; Heaven sweetly chants His fame ; Earth receives its glorious Savior ; Hallelujah to His name ! <p> Yet the world is wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in mercy let it thunder Ere the day of mercys past . <p> In the cages of deception Souls are pining to be free ; Quickly sound the proclamation Of the glorious jubilee. * <p> The hymn " Perishing Souls at Stake " was one of the early productions . We quote this hymn and its history as it appeared in The Trumpet of December 15 , 1885 : <p> Perishing souls at stake today ! Says the banner of Christ unfurled ; Pleading in love for help to save Blood-bought sinners all oer the world . <p> Perishing souls at stake we see , Yet the Savior has died for all ; Go and invite them earnestly , Some will surely obey the call . <p> Perishing souls at stake today , Theres a famine in all the land ; Many are dying for the bread Freely given by Jesus hand . <p> Perishing souls at stake , go tell What the Savior has done for you ; How He redeemed thy soul from hell , And is able to save them , too . <p> Perishing souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinners fate ! Brother and sister , will you go , Give them warning before too late . <p> Perishing souls at stake today , Can you tarry for earthly dross ? Fly to the rescue , do n't  delay , Bring the needy to Jesus cross . <p> The foregoing song was suggested to our mind by a solemn vision given to Brother C. Ogan , of Latty , Ohio , on the night previous to September 19 . He saw Christ displaying a banner upon which was written these words : " Perishing Souls at Stake . " That day we had a very solemn meeting at Jerry City , Ohio . The Spirit of God was present , making imperative calls for workers in the vineyard . Our soul was burdened with an awful sense of perishing souls at stake . All hearts were melted before the Lord . A number acknowledged the solemn commission . Dear Brother Ogan was one of them , relating this solemn and beautiful vision . <p> We pray that all who that day confessed the call of God may go forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and perishing souls be lost for whom the blessed Savior died . In about all the meetings this fall the same great burden has come upon our soul for men and women of God to go forth and hold up the light of his saving truth . O ye that have the real fire of God in your souls , can you tarry at home to watch a few earthly effects , when there is such a sore famine in all the land ! And you who have found the true salvation of Christ Jesus are the only ones that can bring the living bread to others . College bread will not do . " Dumb dogs can not bark " * ( Isaiah 56:10 ) ; Babylon priests are full of darkness , and souls are dying all around . Oh ! if you have any gratitude in your hearts for what Christ has done for you , go and tell others , and some will surely receive the joyful tidings . Oh , how sad this world with no gospel but the wretched stuff given by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two honest souls who long for the light . Can you stay at home for the sordid dust of earth and let them perish ? Oh , fly to the rescue , do n't  delay ; bring the needy to Jesus Christ ! <p> After a few years both Fisher and Jeffrey dropped out of the ranks and ceased to contribute their melodies to Brother Warners hymns . In their place God provided Brother B. E. Warren . No sooner did this young brother become a part of Brother Warners company than he began to display a marvelous gift for writing melodies . In the years that followed he filled a large place as a writer of music , and he also learned to write the words as well . <p> When the company were on their Western trip in the autumn of 1887 , Brother Warner wrote the hymn " Sowing the Seed " in anticipation of their having to brave the chilling blasts of the winter which was before them . <p> Unheeding winters cruel blast , We venture heavens seed to east ; Both late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth . <p> Shall we be found with only leaves When Jesus comes to gather sheaves ? Nay , sowing daily oer the land , Well come with joyful sheaves in hand . <p> Nor is the precious labor hard , Its glory is its own reward ; We plant in hearts of grim despair A life that blooms as Eden fair . <p> Oh , were this life the utmost span , The closing destiny of man , No toil could half so blessed prove As sowing seeds of peace and love . <p> But heavens bright eternal years Have bottled up our sowing tears ; There we shall greet in holy bliss The souls we turned to righteousness . <p> The song " Who Will Suffer with the Savior ? " had its origin while the company were in the South in the winter of 1890-91 . It was written at the time a mob assaulted the house in which Brother Warner was preaching and a sharp , flying missile struck him on the side of the face , causing it to bleed . <p> Who will suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cup of tribulation Jesus drank in dying pains ? <p> Who will offer soul and body On the altar of our God ? Leaving self and worldly mammon , Take the path that Jesus trod ? <p> Who will suffer for the gospel , Follow Christ without the gate ? Take the martyrs for example , With them glory at the stake ? <p> Oh , for consecrated service Mid the din of Babel strife ; Who will dare the truth to herald At the peril of his life ? <p> Soon the conflict will be over , Crowns await the firm and pure ; Forward , brethren , work and suffer , Faithful to the end endure . <p> One of the prominent features of the reformation was the sweet , heavenly singing of the saints . Wherever Brother Warners company went the people were attracted by the singing . They were not what the world would call " trained singers " ; they were not even adept at reading music . But God blessed the singing , so that the songs , sung in the element of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company held the first meeting at Walkerton , Indiana , a theatrical troupe came to the town . So many people had flocked to Brother Warners meetings that the house was packed and there were not many left to attend the theatrical concert . The troupe , not having a sufficient audience , came to the place of meeting and gave some instrumental music just outside in order to attract the people . Of course it interfered with the preaching . Brother Warner said , " Sing a song . " Sister Nannie Kigar , who was the soprano of the company and always ready with a suitable selection , started a song . The people decided to remain . Many and powerful were the effects of these heaven-inspired songs . <p> Mention has been made already of the instance where the cattle listened and gazed with wonder when Brother Warners company were singing at a place where they had stopped in the edge of the woods for dinner . Brother Warren says that once when they were traveling on the road and singing they were passing a field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that all of these followed along inside the fence until they reached the corner of the field , seeming to be attracted by the wonderful charm of the singing . <p> At the time the company visited St. James , Missouri , on the second Western tour , Brother Warner wrote the hymn " Sing it Again " at a place where they were stopping in the country . Brother Warren then composed the music , and they began singing it . When the time came for them to be taken to the train to leave that part of the country , it was decided that they should be conveyed to Jefferson City in order to afford a little country ride for a change . They camped out the first night , and reached Jefferson City the second day , early in the afternoon . They decided to visit the State prison , and as the weather was warm they left their wraps in the baggage room of the railroad station until they should return . When they came back the baggage room was locked , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything was quiet around ; not a sound could be heard except the clicking of the telegraph instrument in the office . The train they were to take would not be due until in the night , and as the waiting room was open they gathered a little fuel and built a fire . When this was done Brother Warner gave a little jump ( he always seemed happy enough to jump at any time ) and said , " Let us have a song . " Naturally enough , they sang the new song , " Sing it Again . " Soon the door opened and in came the operator , and then shortly , almost before they were aware of it , a number of others had gathered and were listening intently . When the song was ended , the operator said , " This reminds me of my childhood days ; wo n't you sing that song again ? " They sang it again , and then Brother Warner , as his manner frequently was , took out his Bible and said , " Perhaps you would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The operator had to attend to his office duties , but the others listened . Next testimonies were proposed . And so they had a precious little meeting in the waiting room of the railroad station , and the new song had already begun to be useful . <p> I shall never forget the time when Brother Warner and his company first came to my fathers home in northwestern Illinois . I have always considered it the brightest event in my lifes career . Today , as memory carries me back to that time , and I imagine myself in that same situation , I have indescribable feelings . They arrived on a Saturday afternoon in the spring of 1888 . My father and I had gone to engage a schoolhouse for the meetings when the company arrived . My sister had been converted the previous year ; but during her attendance at school through the winter she had become somewhat cold spiritually and so had no particular pleasure in anticipating the coming of " Warners band , " as she had heard them called . When the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seemed particularly to enjoy the sense of home , and they sang the hymn , <p> Home , home , brightest and fairest , Hope , hope , sweetest and best . <p> My sister simply melted . That song introduction was enough . Then they had prayer , and their hearts welled up in thankfulness to God for His blessings and care over them . If there ever were men who could pray , Brother Warner was one of them . <p> After my father and I returned home , my sister and mother wanted me to hear the company sing , and of course another song was requested . They sang this time " The All-Cleansing Fountain " and it seemed to be the sweetest singing I had ever heard . During their stay in our home Brother Warren did some composing at the organ , and this seemed wonderful to me . I had never seen such people , whose countenances were aglow with the victory of salvation and who were so filled with praise and song . <p> While the company were at our home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them across the Mississippi to the city of Clinton , Iowa , then remarkable for its lumber trade , and for having eight large sawmills , one of them the largest sawmill in the world . As we were driving along the road and singing " The All-Cleansing Fountain , " a neighbor who was working in a field nearbybut who on account of an intervening ridge could not see usheard the song . Not knowing from whence the sound came he concluded it was angel music , and when he went to his house he declared to his wife that he had heard the angels sing . <p> A large class of songs that were used were such as expressed victory and worship . Another large class were those of invitation and warning to sinners . In the later books , about all topics that are useful in Christian work were represented . <p> Songs of Victory was the name of the first book published . It was issued in 1885 . This was followed in 1888 by Anthems from the Throne . The third book was Echoes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book of songs has been issued about every four to six years . <h> Poetic Inspirations <p> To reflect on Brother Warners career is to marvel at the accomplishment that was crowded into a few short years . He was active in several callings at one time . As a minister with the heavy burden of the gospel upon him he labored hard , preaching often and being everywhere in demand . On occasions he preached for three and even four hours in one discourse , the audience as well as the preacher forgetful of the passing time . Though in physical endurance he was weak , yet there were perhaps few speakers who could wear so well in the labor of the pulpit . His private work of instructing seekers , and his ministrations for the sick , requiring the exercise of prayer and faith , absorbed his strength and occupied much time . As editor of the paper , to which he contributed articles , many of them doctrinal and requiring study , and for which he had to edit articles written by others , it was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence also was considerable , and as stenographers were not so available then as now he had to do his writing with his own hand . Where would he get time for study and prayer , and for writing hymns or poetry ? And yet he accomplished all of these . <p> In the latter years of his life he apparently was declining to some extent in ministerial vigor ; but as a writer his productions seemed only to grow richer with his years . Had his life been prolonged to the full period of what is commonly expected of man , he would have given to the world some of the finest poetical productions . His poems are not at all inferior , though written during a strenuous career . <p> In 1890 he collected and published his poems in a book entitled Poems of Grace and Truth . It contained 343 pages . With the exception of a small book entitled Bible Readings , and the limp-cover binding of a songbook , this book of poems was the first cloth bound book ever made at The Gospel Trumpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor stereotyped plates from which it was printed . A number of beautiful poems were written since the publication of this book and therefore were not included in it . <p> His longest poem was his " Meditations on the Prairie . " It occupies eighty-four pages of the book mentioned and is written in ten-syllable iambic verse . It touchingly describes with beautiful imagery the authors acquaintance with and his subsequent marriage to Sarah A. Keller , and the circumstances that led to her deception and separation from him . His own description of its origin , as given in the preface to the poem , is as follows : <p> In the summer of 1873 , the author took a mission field in Nebraska , much of which had just been settled the previous year . My companion had died one year previously . Just before going West a correspondence was arranged with Sister Sarah A. Keller , which soon kindled into a glowing flame of love . A year later I returned and we were happily joined in marriage . With her precious company I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetened with the most transporting conjugal bliss . In 1875 we returned to Ohio , where life and labors flowed on in uninterrupted happiness , until in 1884 the dear object of our love was deceived by the wily foe and torn from our soul , a crisis that threatened our frail life , and which we survived only by the grace of God . <p> In the fall of 1887 , while on an extensive Western tour , we came into a new part of the great prairie , which strikingly reminded us of our travels on the new plains twelve and thirteen years before . There the Spirit touched our mind with vivid recollections of that cherished one , who made for us this prairie a blissful Eden . An inspired imagination also portrayed what dire wreck of our own life might have ensued from the crisis of broken love had not the grace of God averted the sad issue . This cast us on the sod beneath a load of gratitude , where the poem was inspired as our hearts humble tribute for Heavens pity and sustaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature as the handiwork of God , and several of his poems are on nature subjects . What we give here are in most cases but selections from the poems named , the omissions being indicated by stars . <h> Autumn <p> Gone is the spring with all its flowers , And gone the summers verdant show ; Now strewn beneath the autumn bowers , The yellow leaves await the snow . <p> Behold , this earth so cold and gray An emblem of our life appears ; Its blooming robes sink to decay , To rise again in round of years . <h> New Years GreetingJanuary 1 , 1890 <p> Another year has come and gone So swiftly flows unceasing time . Forever , on and on and on , With sorrows groan and merry chime Commingled in its surging tide , Time bears along upon its flood Poor human wrecks by sin destroyed ; Yet oer its stream the hand of God Still bends His bow of hope divine . Its hues of love in beauty shine . <p> Another year of hope and fear Has swept around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bliss or awful fate . God grant to us who yet survive A heart of fervent gratitude , And grace that we may wholly live To glorify the source of good ; Then , should this be our final year , Well sink to rest without a fear . <p> Another year hath brought its store In rich profusion at our feet , That we should , heart and soul adore Our Makers love so broad and deep . And have you cast your bread upon The waters of the passing year , In hope that what your hands have done Will in much future good appear ? Then as thy faith so shall it be ; In coming days thine eyes shall see . <p> * * * <p> The poem " To the Alien " is addressed to his wife , Sarah , who , early in the year 1884 , through the influence of a spiritual deceiver , as already stated , left her husband . <p> For ere the light of day had shone In thy unfolding eyes , We gave thee up to God alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a babe , To God our child was given ; And Jesus heard the vow we made , And wrote it down in heaven . <p> So , like a little Samuel , you Must answer " Here am I " ; Give all your heart to Jesus , too , For Him to live and die . <p> Like Samuel , serve the living God , His temple be thy home ; In love obey His holy Word , Thy gentle heart His throne . <p> The Lord is good , my darling boy ; He made thy body well , And He will bless thee evermore , If in His love you dwell . <p> A new edition may you be Of Fathers love and zeal , But yet enlarged so wondrously That earth thy tread may feel . <p> The poem " Throwing Ink at the Devil " refers to the printing and publishing of The Gospel Trumpet .

The pensive season of the year Now preaches in a muffled tone , From natures fast-decaying throne . Come to the woodlands cold retreat ; The leaves that rustle at thy feet , With all that linger oer thy head Commingling , yellow , green , and red And all that , trembling , leave their place And softly greet their mothers face , As sailing from their lofty top They in your presence mournful drop , Remind the thoughtful passerby , Thy falling autumn , too , is nigh . <p> Life has its gay and happy spring , When birds of every feather sing ; Its warm and verdant summer , brief , Which hastens to the yellow leaf , Soon winters icy hand will lie Upon our cold and lifeless clay . But , oh ! our soulwhere will it be Throughout the long eternity ?

Ho ! all ye men that know not God , Come seek Him in the shady wood ; And , all ye saints of feeble love , When will ye come and wisely prove The blessedness that crowns the hour Thats spent with God in leafy bower ! If only heard your prayers ye say , Then unto God ye never pray ; For did ye truly seek His face And pray to win His saving grace Youd pray when mortals are not near , Right in your heavenly Fathers ear . In public , too ; yea , everywhere , But most of all with secret prayer ; Where only silent leaves applaud , There would ye bow and worship God . <p> * * * <p> Then in the hush of solitude Come listen to the voice of God ; Come oft , and He shall teach thine ear His gentle words of love to hear . <p> There is no place on earth so sweet As forest shades , where streamlets meet And sing aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do not the lover and his maid , Delighted , walk the balmy shade , And there unlock , with words so blest , The pent-up love within their breast ! The crazy-quilt spread on the ground , Of beauty-tinted leaves around , Each bright sunbeam and fragrant flower , And natures music in the bower But , most of all , the cooing dove Lend inspiration to their love . And does not natures solitude Inspire a soul to worship God ! Behold , he framed her majesty , Cast up her hills , and carved the way For babbling brooks that flow between And tread the winding valleys green . The many lovely trees that spread Their sheltering wings above our head , Rose up by His supreme behest , With all their nuts and fruitage blest , He taught the vine their trunks to climb , Like cords of love their boughs entwine . <p> But we are not without a seed , From which anew there may proceed Our kind to grow and multiply , As round and round the seasons fly . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , immortal quest , That shall reanimate thy clay , And both , immortal , live for aye . Thou shalt from winters sleep arise , And meet thy Savior in the skies . With this blest hope so sure and bright All seasons beam with golden light , In winters storm and summers heat The pure in heart have joys complete ; And when the close of life appears , Their pleasures ripen with his years Unlike the sinner , dark and cold Who graceless , godless , hopeless , old , Sits lowly down in autumns vale , His life all fruitless to bewail . Each falling leaf his conscience stings And thoughts of future judgment brings ; Yea , warns him that the time is nigh When be in black despair must die . Unlike the life in folly spent , And now with sinful years is bent Low at the grave with dismal moan ; Nay , " for the righteous light is sown , " Yea , light that brightens in the vale Of falling leaves , where he can hail The glories of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel frosts can ever sting . There life begins another spring To flourish in eternal green , In heavens high celestial scene . <p> Far in the South thy bloom appeared , And all our journey northward cheered ; A thousand miles in sweet embrace , We northward held an even race ; Or if by starts we did outrun Thy even tenor from the sun , Ere long we blessed thy coming tread And quaffed the odors thou didst spread . <p> O brightest , sweetest of the year ! When all is vocal with thy cheer , Thy lily-cups and roses red With us some tear-drops also shed . The cherry-trees , in shrouds of white , Bring back to mind a mournful sight A coffined brother neath the bloom , Just ere they bore him to the tomb . <p> But what of him who walks alone , With past love fled and turned to stone ? Shall not the springtide musics roll Mock withered joys and sting the soul ? Not in the heart embalmed in love Transported from the worlds above , Nor seasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is king . <p> That soul an endless spring enjoys Where life the will of God employs . He mid the fields of bliss may tread , And feast on joys that long have fled , By sacred memories glowing trace More than the heart untouched by grace , Can drink from full fruitions stream , Or paint in fancys wildest dream . <p> O God ! Thou art the life of spring , The source of all the seasons bring , The soul of all the joys we know , The fountain whence our pleasures flow . While nature wakes from winters sleep , And gentle clouds effusive weep , We join creations grateful lays , And celebrate our Makers praise . <p> The deaths of individuals furnished inspiration for many a verse from Brother Warners pen . Celia Kilpatrick Byrum was one of the early workers in The Gospel Trumpet Office , when the paper was published at Grand Junction , Michigan . Her death occurred on the 11th of December , 1888 . <p> And is she gonedear Celia gone ?

So now we sing our mournful lay Another epoch , followed soon To thy poor soul , a brighter day Than that when blessed beside thy groom . <p> The Author of these feeling hearts Chides not affections flowing tears ; But with them soothing balm imparts , And in His arms of love He bears Poor natures heavy burden up : So when bereavements press our mind , Grace drops such sweetness in the cup That even then we comfort find . <p> Ah ! now invert the column rules , And dress The Trumpet sad with crape , That all who read may know it feels And weeps the loss of friend so great .

Oh ! could we near the pearly gate And listen to her ransomed song , Our souls would more felicitate The bliss of that immortal one . <p> The poem " The Marriage of a Mr. Hope " is a play on the word hope and has a slight touch of the humorous . <p> It appeared that Mr. Hope , Entertained the pleasing hope That some hopeless one among the fair Was seeking hope from lifes despair , And was pleased with Hope to share , The cheerful name of Hope to wear . And so good Hope went smiling round Till the object of his hope was found ; Then sitting by the fair ones side , Hope beamed with prospects of a bride .

The following is the first stanza . <p> Not a mere imaginary Object , borne on fancys wing , Is the city of this story , But a real historic thing . Though by troupes and proper figures We delineate her fame , Though she has some mystic features , Shes an entity the same . <p> He takes up the different denominations as particular brands of crutches on which people hobble . <p> But whereunto shall we liken , Or with what similitude , Paint this foolish generation !

But the clubs that they are vending , Are as hollow as a horn ; They that buy need no repenting , In cold water they are born . <p> * * * <p> All these bapto sociations Have a god of water made , Leaving fire and salvation And the blood without the trade , More than all the sects who clamor , Just to make the sinner wet , Who have swallowed down a Campbell , And are straining at a gnat . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Salvation Army , Russellism , and Lyman Johnson of The Stumbling Stone . The last of the poem is devoted to Gods call to His people to come out of Babylon .

Hallelujah ! we are free ! <p> * * * <p> Jesus is our head and ruler , And His Word our only guide , And His gentle Spirit leader , He our peace , a constant tide Flowing in our tranquil bosom , Where is reared the mystic throne Of the King of peace eternal , Where He dwells and reigns alone . <p> Oh , the glorious hope of Zion !

It shows how Satan attempted to destroy the church by martyrdom and , failing in that , next attempted counterfeiting the church by making false churches . <p> His poems " To the Ocean " and " Goodbye , Old Rockies " were written on his Pacific Coast trip in the autumn of 1892 . <p> T was a balmy evening in October , As our train sped on its time , That we came in sight of Gods great ocean , To the old Pacific brine . Swiftly gliding down its ancient orbit , The great monarch of the light Dropped his golden smiles upon the water Ere he bid us all goodnight . <p> * * * <p> Thou a preacher art to all the ages , And thy audience all the world ; Lo ! we read thy sermon on the pages Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy sand environs Thou dost thunder , yea , and show How the human heart in sins dominion Never , never peace can know . <p> As thy waves in ceaseless turmoil labor , And in fury bent the shore , As they writhe and moan and dash asunder , Rise and fall forevermore , So the blasting hopes and guilty terrors Of the sinners wretched heart , Restless , fearful , and despairing ever , From his bosom never part . <p> Only One has sailed upon the bosom Of the tempest-troubled sea , Who could hush the winds and calm the billows He who spoke to Galilee .

Old Rockies , now to you I bid adieu , adieu , But hope we part not here forever . <p> I leave you as I found you , covered With winters chilly shroud , Reaching toward the starry heavens , And mantled in the cloud .

Thenceforth my soul bath been The palace of a King ; The joyful place of royal banquet . <p> Lord Jesus , when I retrospect my life Down through the varied scenes of mortal strife , At every change I stand in wonder wrapt , How Thou hast saved and used and blessed and kept , And by Thy blood hast bought A thing of utter naught ; And well may all the angels marvel . <p> Besides the foregoing were a number of short poems , also a lengthy poem on Faith , which covers over sixty pages in his book . His poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Early Life . " <h> Last Years <p> During the last years of his life Brother Warners time was devoted in greater proportion to writing than during the preceding years of more active ministerial work in the field . Possessing a weak physical constitution he aged rapidly and seemed elderly at fifty . Due to an earnest desire to accomplish much for the cause of God he had , however , a hope that the Lord would " satisfy him with long life , " as the Psalmist expresses it ( Psalm 91:16 ) . Whether he had any idea that his life might soon draw to a close , it is not known , but at any rate he felt prompted , after the few years he spent in evangelistic tours , to devote more of his time to writing on specific lines of truth . He wished in particular to write a book on prophetic subjects . <p> He spent the winter of 1891-92 mostly at home writing , but he was not altogether satisfied to be out of the field entirely . He desired in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been very desirous that God should manage this poor frail temple so as to get the most effectual service and highest degree of glory . That He has enabled us to preach the gospel for twenty-six years through constant weakness and many infirmities has been a marvel of divine grace and a miracle of divine power . Should anyone ask why He did not heal us up soundly , we answer : Many years ago as we cried to God to remove this thorn from our flesh , He taught us that He had weighty responsibilities to lay upon us , and that our afflictions would contribute to that humility and utter dependence upon God that were necessary to fill our calling ; that in our weakness He would manifest His own power . So the Lord chose to display His power in upholding us in our afflictions rather than in utterly removing them . So with the apostle I " glory in my infirmities , that the power of Christ may rest upon me. " * ( 2 Corinthians 12:9 ) <p> Of late years our experience has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field and spending our time between meetings chiefly in conversation with the dear brethren , who are always eager to talk about the good Lord and His dealings , an uneasiness would arise in our heart , a conviction that could we be away quietly with the Lord writing the precious things he has given us to set forth , time would be better used and God more glorified . These feelings created a longing to retire to our editorial sanctuary . <p> But remaining at home this winter , our mind has not yet been exactly satisfied , owing to the many earnest calls to the field . Last fall in Wooster , Ohio , we were kindly provided with a room to ourself . It being only a few moments walk from the hall , we could retire in good time , arise about three in the morning , have a good long time to wait before God , and yet get an early start to work . During that time the Lord blessed us in preaching daily , and we got more writing done , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that arrangement has appeared to my mind as the best possible plan for effectual service to God . Since the Spirit seems to stir our heart to go forth and preach the word and at the same time requires our time uninterrupted by surrounding company and conversation , except when we can be a special help to some soul , we can see no way but to labor chiefly in towns and cities and have a retired place to spend the intervals between meetings before the Lord . This will enable us to make the best use of our time and also avoid the exposure and fatigue of going about from place to place . God knows it is not because we are not willing to endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ , but only for the glory of God , that we may do more good in this short life . <p> He never could remain long out of the gospel field . It was not his privilege , however , to carry out the plan of working in cities while engaging in writing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . To remain in one place very long and engage in writing he found to be weakening , due to the fact that he was likely not to take sufficient exercise . We have already noted his illness with rheumatism just before making the trip to Denver in the spring of 1892 , and his sickness he had during that trip . He was not at home long after this trip until he was called to the Pacific Coast . While on the latter tour he spent two weeks , during the holiday season , at Farmersville , California writing on his book on prophecy , The Cleansing of the Sanctuary . He returned in February and attended some of the camp and grove meetings during the summer . In the latter part of the following winter he spent some time in the home of Brother B. E. Warren , in Springfield , Ohio writing hymns for a new songbook he was helping to edit . This book , Echoes from Glory , was ready by the time of the June camp meeting at Grand Junction . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller. * This was his third marriage , his second wife having died in Cincinnati some time previously . During the summer Brother and Sister Warner made a tour to Illinois and Missouri , and later to Pennsylvania . <p> In the " New Years Greeting " in The Trumpet for 1894 he expressed a desire to make a world tour . He thought seriously of doing so , but concluded later that his health would not permit . His years were drawing to a close . At the end of the Greeting he wrote the following verses : <p> My years of time all flee away , And , swifter than an arrow , I glide along my pilgrim way , And hasten to the morrow . Away , away , see the moments fly , We can not hold them waiting ; Then on their pinions let us try To drop a future blessing . <p> My years of time , how fast they flee ! And yet the scribe of heaven Records whateer my actions be , The thoughts my life has given . Thanks be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Just ready , Lord , to see my face , And enter into glory . <p> My years of time are meted out , A moment of probation , Upon which hangs the awful weight Of endless destination . Press on , press on , O my soul , and seek Eternal lifes fruition , Since everlasting ages reap The fruits of short duration . <p> All seem a golden summer ; And each one , blessed with heavens grace , Shines brighter than the former . O God , Thou crownest the happy years With thy unbounded goodness , Thy wondrous love has changed my tears To songs of joy and gladness . <p> My years of time will close ere long Where blooms an endless spring , Where all the ransomed swell the song The angels can not sing . Roll on , sweet years , for I know my last Will end high up in glory , The toil I love will sweeten rest And gem my crown of duty . <p> In the meantime there had opened up a rather unique method of evangelistic work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Eastern field , had planned an Ohio River campaign . He had purchased a boat 26 x 80 and fitted it up for a dwelling and a meeting hall . The plan was to float down the Ohio and tie up at every town on each side of the river and hold meetings for a season . January and February of 1894 were spent on this Floating Bethel , * as it was called , with Brother and Sister Clayton . By this means he could do writing and at the same time hold meetings . <p> Late in May 1894 , he held a discussion with an Adventist leader . He attended during this summer , as usual , the general camp meetings and grove meetings . He began the erection of a house on the campground near Grand Junction and by the following winter it was sufficiently completed that it could be occupied . <p> We are making some quotations from his " New Years Greeting " for 1895 . Little did he know that this would be his last message of this kindhe died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and readers we devoutly wish a happy New Year . May each of you enter the year with a holy zeal to glorify God in your soul and body , which are the Lords . Nothing better can we wish you than the meekness of Christ in your heart and life and the omnipotence of faith in your work for Him . <p> How solemn and awful the place where we stand today ! We have been carried down the stream of time until we approach its very outlet into the boundless expanse of eternity . Upon us have fallen the ends of the world . We are called in the providence of God to take a part in the last great struggle against the principalities and wicked powers of this sin-stricken earth . Oh , how significant to us are the words of John , " Little children , it is the last time " * ( 1 John 2:18 ) ? The harmonious testimony of all truth and of current facts on earth show us that we are rapidly approaching the last day of the last days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God alone knows the awful day and hour , and we may err even in naming the approximate time . Yea , before another New Years bells ring on earth the trump of God may proclaim the death of time . One thing is sure , the Lords coming is not very far off , and men of all creeds and faiths seem to agree in this . <p> In great weakness of body we began the erection of a house last September . Bless God , He has in every way wonderfully blessed us in this work ; and now we expect in a couple of weeks to move into our house on the camp and take up the writing of prophetic truth with a physical and consequent mental energy we never before possessed . <p> We were consecrated to go to the foreign lands , and indeed thought the Lord would soon send us forth . But He showed us we were physically unfit . However , we may yet go . Our only wish is that God may get the greatest possible glory out of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to His omnipotent power and infinite wisdom . <p> At the close of the Grand Junction camp meeting of that year , the last year of his life , he wrote the poem " After the Battle . " <p> Lo , they are gone ; that armored host Whose feet have daily pressed These grounds have fled their several ways , And all is hushed to rest . But , hark ! the leaves upon the trees In echoes lisp their song , And on the wings of every breeze Salvation floats along . <p> Not with the cannons roar of death , Nor din of battle wild , But by the burning fuel of fire Salvation won the field . T was not a crown of earthly state , Nor freedoms empty boast , But souls upon an awful brink Called forth this mighty host . <p> The thrones of earth must crumble down , All nations fade away ; Dominions of antiquity Can not abide for aye : But spirits captured here from sin , And marshaled with the free , Shall live and reign and sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , those heralds strong , Who stand within the sun , And all that army dressed in white To other fields have run : And from this holy battlefield New waves of glory roll , And these , in turn , will others wake , To spread from pole to pole . <p> Amen ! amen ! let heaven shout , And earth break forth in song ! A thousand camps , ten thousand groves , In every city throng . Along the rivers , oer the sea , In Jesus mighty name , The present truth that set us free , To all aloud proclaim . <p> This was his last poem , so far as is known , excepting a few verses he wrote in connection with obituaries . He assisted in meetings in the northern part of the State during the summer . In this series of meetings he obtained very little rest or time for writing , which emphasized the desire to devote more time to pen preaching at home . It was always hard for him to deny himself the glory of the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must settle down to write . <p> Besides some other small works , he prepared a new tract showing the fallacy of the millennium tradition , revised the tract " Marriage and Divorce , " and wrote a book entitled Salvation : Present , Perfect , Now or Never . His major work , however , to which he had for some time given attention , was his book on prophecy , The Cleansing of the Sanctuary . Of this he had written nearly four hundred pages . <p> By this time a childrens school was started on the campground , near Grand Junction . He took quite an interest in the school . Among the last things that engaged his mind was the arranging of a system of Bible study . It is evident that he had in mind some sort of training school , for he had planned courses in history , music , penmanship , etc. , in addition to Bible study . <p> And now we come to the end of the journey of life for Brother Warner . That frail body which had often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be left in the grip of an affliction that should end his earthly career . His work was done . The purpose to which God had called him had been accomplished . He was to give place to others . This wonderful man of God , whose physical temple had so often by the Holy Spirit been quickened to new life when about to fall , and through whose touch the same divine power had many times brought help to the afflicted bodies of others , must himself now succumb to the hand of Death , for in this world all must die . His vitality , always weak , and now declining , had but slight resisting power against the forces of disease and decay that humanity is subject to in this life . An undermining affliction seemed to be at work in his body . On Sunday , December 1 , 1895 , he preached a sermon on Christian Growth in the schoolhouse ( also used for a chapel ) on the campground . That he should preach while physically weak was no uncommon thing and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That discourse was his last . <p> The following Sunday he suffered very much from an attack of lung trouble and was unable to speak above a whisper . But after prayer was offered he arose , walked across the room , and praised God aloud , also joining in singing . Thus he fought the fight of faith till the very last . His illness soon developed into pneumonia , and he went down rapidly . About midnight on the night of December 11 his watcher , noticing that he seemed to be resting easy , left the room to have his midnight lunch ; but ere he returned the spirit of Brother Warner silently took its flight to the glory world above . Thus he died in solitude , at about 12:30 A.M. Thursday , December 12 . <p> Our friend and brother dear , whose life Made bright this world of ours , Has passed away mid early snow , Soon after Autumns flowers . <p> No days of lingering sickness came To warn us of his death ; No vision from the silent land To tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarged heart but no trace of tuberculosis , which he had in his younger days and from which he was miraculously healed and preserved . <p> His spirit was very tenacious of life . As i 'll as he was , he arose every morning at his regular early hour , and through the day engaged to a slight extent in writing . Even the day before he died he was on his feet a part of the time . <p> The funeral was held on the campground on Sunday , the 15th . A brief notice of his death was inserted in The Gospel Trumpet of December 12 . In the succeeding issue the obituary appeared in full between draped column rules . <p> Of the last hymn he attempted he completed only the first stanza , one half of the chorus , and the first line of the second stanza , the hymn as he left it appearing thus : <p> Shall my soul ascend with rapture When the day of life is past ? While my house of clay shall slumber , Shall I then with Jesus rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by individuals who knew Brother Warner personally are of interest . <p> Our home was at Lindsey , Ohio , when we first met Brother Warner . We were then members of the Evangelical Association . We were both sanctified , but were dissatisfied with the formality of sectism . We attended the regular appointments faithfully ; but we craved for deeper spiritual devotion and felt the need of special services where we could talk freely of the glorious doctrine of sanctification . When the people throughout the country heard what we taught , many doors opened among the denominations and many were converted . This stirred the ministers with envy , and they tried to stop the work , but failed , because it was Gods work . <p> This continued for five years . We felt we should be better out of the Church than in it , and often wished to withdraw , but did not know where to go . We made this a subject of special prayer and meditation . We were assured God would bring us and lead us in a way we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but had heard that he was a deceiver and that everywhere he went he caused the most spiritual to believe his doctrine . We received a card from him stating that he had just closed a meeting and that the Lord was directing him north for the next meeting . He said if we could furnish a place for meeting , either public or private , he with his company should be glad to visit our place . <p> I asked husband what to do . He said , " Mother , do you know this is the man that we were warned against ? " <p> I said , " Yes , I know , but we are praying for God to send us a man who will preach and practice the whole truth . Now , if this man is of God we must receive him . " I went to the Lord with the matter and said , " Lord , if Thou dost want these people to come and hold a meeting and can use them here , send them right on , without my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At one oclock a load of six drove up to the gate . Brother Warner came to the door and knocked . When I opened he said , " Peace be unto this house . " I can not tell my feelings , but after I gave them a hearty welcome I was conscious they were of God and decided they should stay as long as God could use them . <p> While I was preparing the noon meal for my new guests and my family , they sang numbers 43* and 72* out of Songs of Victory . We never before heard such heavenly music . The tears streamed down husbands cheeks . My daughter was so affected she left the house ; it made such an impression on her she afterward gave her heart to God . <p> God used Brother Warner to help us discern the one body of Christ and the evils of sects . We rented a hall . Sometimes it was crowded with earnest listeners , and I am sure much good would have been done had it not been for the five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warner preached with such power one of the preachers said , " This is too strong for me , and went out . The hall was closed against us and we held our meetings in private homes . On occasions rotten eggs , gravel stones , and mud balls were thrown at us , and through it all Brother Warner praised God and manifested such a calm and gentle spirit one could not help but feel he was a man of God . During these meetings some walked thirty miles to hear the truth . <p> Brother Warner had been undergoing the great trial of his wifes separation from him , and many earnest prayers went up for her . He gave us some of his letters to read , which he wrote to her , and , oh ! the gentle spirit , and the kind pleadings which he wrote , were enough to break any heart of stone . <p> Later we moved to St. Louis , Michigan , and it was our privilege to have him in our home often . He always preached with power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitation . <p> Mrs. Elizabeth Walter St. Louis , Michigan <p> The first time I met Brother Warner was in February 1883 . He came to our home and assisted in cottage meetings . He was a very humble man of faith and one I dearly loved . At the first camp meeting at Bangor , Michigan , in 1883 , he was called away and I took him to the train . As he stepped from the vehicle I handed him eleven dollars . He raised both hands and praised God , as he had had no money for the fare . <p> I was with him one time in Chicago in search of a printing press . At the breakfast table in a restaurant he poured out his heart to God in deep , earnest prayer and thanked God for the food , which drew the attention of many listeners . At noon we bought a lunch , so as to save the Lords money . In an alley just off a busy street we found a dry goods box , which served as a place for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a deep sense of gratitude gave thanks to God . <p> S. Michels South Haven , Michigan <p> In October , 1881 , I was visiting in North Eagle , Michigan , at my fathers , Daniel B. Howe . A brother sent us a Trumpet , the first we had seen . In a few days J. C. Fisher and wife came there . Father asked him to come and hold a meeting , which he did in December , and was there all winter . Many received the light . In October 1882 , Brother Warner came and some others , and held a meeting lasting several days . That was a wonderful meeting to us . When Brother Warner came he seemed to be under a heavy trial on account of some difficulty that had come into his life , and was very sad , apparently unreconciled . <p> He stayed at our house , and while there God wonderfully blessed him and the clouds began to lift . When he was preaching on Sunday morning , the power of God came down on him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaped up a foot or more , turned completely around , and came down facing the audience . From that time the sorrow and sadness were gone . <p> I did not see him again until in 1894 at the June camp meeting at Grand Junction . I went to where he was staying at the Trumpet Family residence and met him at the breakfast table . He asked me how the people were at North Eagle . I told him all were well . He put his elbow on the table , his face in his hand , and wept like a child for a few moments . Then he said , " Pardon me , I have to think of how the Lord blessed me there . I never knew that the Lord could bless a mortal man as he blessed me at that meeting . " <p> In 1895 , in March , he came to preach my fathers funeral . While he was waiting for the train at Grand Ledge he wrote a poem and read it at the funeral . I next saw him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great sermon on the Church . He said nothing of other ministers or denominations , but his discourse when finished left no place for any other church , no possibility of there being another . I never saw him again , as he died the following December . <p> In my estimation , there never lived a more holy or godly man than he . I doubt whether any other reformer was any more devoted to the cause of Christ than he , or ever preached sermons that were more deep or soul-stirring than his . He lives , in the hearts of the people today , and in his writings will be heard until the end of time . <p> Julia M. Cheeseman Liberty Center , Ohio <p> Brother Warner was one of the most godly men I ever met ; he was so consecrated and devotional . He had great power with God and men ; was very humble , and all persons , regardless of rank or position , could approach him for help . <p> I was at a meeting at Carthage , Missouri , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we were in its path with a cloth tabernacle . At the roar of the wind people became alarmed and began to run . Brother Warner cried out , " Stay in the tent ; not one shall be hurt . " Lifting his eyes and raising his hand heavenward , he said , " Father , calm this storm so Thy word can be preached . " The storm ceased within a short distance , not more than a block , away . Much damage was done to buildings . The top was blown off the large woolen mill and boxcars were thrown from the track . I was amazed and said , " What manner of man is this that even the winds obey ? " <p> At another time some boys whose people opposed the truth gathered in a body and began to drink , and finally came to disturb the meeting . They did this on two nights . On the third night , when Brother Warner was preaching , he heard them coming . He said , " Father , rebuke the devil in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their disturbance . He was a man of faith and was always praising God , even in the deepest trials . He was a reformer indeed . <p> Lena L. Matthesen Moore , Oklahoma <p> My memory is poor and I now recall but a few instances . At one time while Brother Warner was preaching a terrible storm came up . The heavens were black . The congregation was becoming uneasy and fearful . He told them to remain seated ; that God had given him a message and would not let it rain . He asked God to hold the rain till he had delivered the message . I do not know how long he was preaching , but it was unusually long . God surely held the rain , for when he had finished and the people reached their homes the rain poured down tremendously . <p> Once when sectarians were framing all manner of falsehoods and sending them broadcast over the country , some of his friends came to him saying , " How can you stand all this ? " <p> He paused a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I died . " <p> William N. Smith North Star , Michigan <p> Once when he was away from home holding meeting , Brother Warner felt a strong impression that he should return home . Some one offered to take him to the train , though the time was short till the train was due . Brother Warner was praying the Lord to hold the train . When they came in sight of the station , the train was there and soon began to move off . He cried aloud , " My God , stop that train for me . " The train slowed down . The conductor signaled to back up and stop , and took him on . He expressed his gratefulness to God and to the railroad men and confessed God in it . <p> He told me that at one time he received a telegram from the West requesting him to come in haste . He went to his room and placed the matter before the Lord . He had no means ; but the Lord told him to go , doubting nothing , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grip and hastened to the depot . When he arrived there he continued in supplication to God . People began to gather to take the train . All at once his eye caught sight of a man hurrying toward the station . The man came in , and when he saw Brother Warner , rejoiced , and said , " Well , I see you are packed to go . " <p> " Yes , I received my orders from God to go on a Western trip . " <p> " Well , a man needs money to travel on , " the man replied , and then handed him a bunch of money . <p> After he had purchased his ticket he noticed he had plenty of change left to defray all necessary expenses , and he went on his way rejoicing . He arrived at his destination and had success . When he was ready to return and was in a conveyance to go to the depot , an old sister called to him to stop and said , " Here is a little budget ; take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just put it in his pocket . Later , when he opened it , he found one hundred dollars in gold . He came home rejoicing , like the disciples when they were sent out without purse or scrip . <p> A. J. Shelly Alma , Michigan <p> I was much impressed with Brother Warners remarkable patience under trying circumstances , and when his frail body was racked with pain . On one occasion he and I were on our way to a tent meeting on the north side of Denver . Being quite late on account of having gone to pray for the sick , we were waiting for a car at a transfer point , and it seemed to me the car never would arrive . I became anxious and paced up and down the sidewalk ( as though in so doing I could hurry up the car ) , because it was then time for meeting to begin . But to my astonishment , Brother Warner was humming a song and " making merry in his heart to the Lord . " I said , " Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Impatient ! " he replied , " I have not felt impatient for fifteen years . " <p> I believed it then and I believe it now and have ever since that evening . I was striving to overcome anxiety and restlessness because of pain , delay , or opposition , and have succeeded to a great extent in submitting all to the One who is able to cause all things to work together for our good . <p> John E. Roberts Denver , Colorado <h> A True Example of Humility <p> One of the most striking examples of true humility that I ever saw was on the day I first met and became acquainted with Brother Warner . With his company of workers , he came to the place where I was expected to preach that day . I was just beginning in the ministry , and had a very high ideal of a minister , to which I was trying hard to attain . When I arrived at this place , the company had already come , and we simply met and were introduced before the Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before time to begin preaching , Brother Warner came to me and said he understood that I was expected to preach that day . I answered yes , but not when a man of such reputation and ability as he was present . He insisted that I go ahead , as he was very tired from the labors he had been in and from the trip which they had just made from the West . I answered that I could not preach much yet , and if he would speak only a little while , it would be a treat to the congregation and me . He still insisted that I should preach , and did not seem to care to take the pulpit . I pled with him to do so , and said , " Brother Warner , I simply could not preach in the presence of such a great man as you are . " <p> He came up to me and placed his arm around my neck and his head on my shoulder , and said , " God bless you , my brother , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This action seemed very strange to me , as I was not acquainted with such a spirit in a man of such reputation ; but I kept insisting that he take the pulpit , if not for more than but a few minutes . He then said , " Well , then , if you feel that way , I will ; but I need your prayers . " He really did look weary , and seemed so frail in body that for a moment I feared I did wrong in urging him so hard . <p> Well , he began , and I felt that I should be prepared to follow him in case he should stop suddenly , and I would finish the sermon . He preached on the subject of sanctification , and I was so desirous that he might be able to give us a full sermon on this precious subject . Well , he had hardly begun when he seemed to change into another man , and my fears were soon gone that he might have a physical breakdown before the close . That weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wonderful words that he spoke were full of power and authority . I was soon lost in the glorious truths of the sermon and was unconscious of my surroundings . When he sat down , we were surprised to find that he had preached just three hours , which seemed such a short time to all of us . <p> The deep impression of the humility of this man of God and the divine power with which he preached had this effect upon my heart : If this is " but one of Gods little ones , " where will there ever be a place for such an ignorant beginner as I ? My ideal of a minister was wholly changed , and it was for some time that I had great difficulty to believe there was a place for me . But having the privilege of sitting at Brother Warners feet in a series of meetings following that day , I was greatly helped to try to sink into deeper humility , and through the grace of God find my place in the body , the church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and has often been a protection when at times there would be presented temptations to self-exaltation . <h> A Wise Answer <p> In one of the meetings that Brother Warner and his company held in our home neighborhood my older brother had become very much interested in the good singing of this company . He was passionately fond of good singing , and though working hard all day , could not stay away from the evening meetings . But he had become backward in his spiritual life , and knew he was living far below the standard that Brother Warner was holding up . At the close of one of the evening services Brother Warner met my brother and asked him how it was with his soul . The answer was this : " I simply confess to you that I do n't  have enough brains to understand sanctification . " These words were spoken in a spirit of resistance and self-justification . Brother Warner looked into his face with a kindly and humble smile and said , " God bless you , Brother John , it does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was characteristic of Brother Warner to give ready and wise response , and oftentimes to answer an objector on his own ground or in his own terms . It is related that in a certain meeting , after he had preached on holiness , an opposer arose and vociferously denounced the doctrine , saying in his closing remarks , " I pray God to scatter this old holiness doctrine to the four winds of the earth . " <p> Immediately Brother Warner responded with a shout of , " Amen ! " <p> The effect was terrific and the opposition was confounded . <h> How a Victory Was Won by Prayer <p> While Brother Warner was with us in San Diego , California , he gave a series of lessons on the Revelation , and preached hard against the errors of Millennialism . A man who had come amongst us , who was a preacher , and seemed to be accepting the truth very well , but had not received the light on this line , became very much offended at the sermon Brother Warner preached that evening . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He came forward to Brother Warner before the congregation had left the hall and in a loud voice and with a face expressing real bitterness said , " The Lord shows me that you are of the devil . " He had hardly finished his words when Brother Warner fell on his knees and began to pray , right at the feet of his accuser . <p> I never before heard such a pitiful prayer , as he poured out his heart to God for this dear man who had brought such a charge against the servant of the Lord . He prayed that the man might he able to see his wrong , that God would reveal the truth to his understanding , and also bless the people who were standing and looking on at this scene of Christian discourtesy , etc . We were all so shocked at the unusual act that it was hard to know just what to do but stand there , which we did , until the prayer was over . After finishing the outpouring of his soul in prayer , he quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The accuser was one of the most surprised people I ever saw . During the prayer he stood as though riveted to the floor , his deathly pale face turned down toward Brother Warner . His hands hung by his side , and he had the appearance of one paralyzed . For awhile after Brother Warner had risen from his knees , the man remained fastened to the spot . The congregation began going out , and finally the man also took his hat and left , without one word . <p> The next night , in the presence of a large audience , this man arose and came forward to Brother Warner , weeping and humbly asking that he might be forgiven for the great offence toward him and the people . He said the Lord had shown him that Brother Warner was right , and he did all that could be expected to right himself with God . From that time he was a strong advocate of the truths of the reformation . <p> The wisdom of God that was manifested in this moment of sudden surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . <p> J. W. Byers Fresno , California <p> Very early in my experience in the reformation I was staying at the home of Brother and Sister Fry in Michigan . I had been under accusation for some time . Brother Warner was coming to hold a tabernacle meeting right near their home . I determined that when he came I would go to him and tell him I was backslidden and ask him to pray with me . I did not go to see him until just before he arose to preach , hence said nothing to him regarding my condition ; but I shall never forget that sermon . He arose , and with his eyes filled with tears , he broke the bread of life , and my accusations were swept into oblivion , and my soul received a glorious refreshing . It made one think of the saying of Jesus , " Feed my sheep . " * ( John 21:16-17 ) <p> At another time , on the old Deerfield , Indiana , campground , I followed him to the meeting one morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worse that day , so that he almost reeled as he walked . After singing , we all knelt in prayer , and Brother Warner prayed , " Now , Lord , Thou hast laid this message upon me ; give me strength . " He sprang to his feet and leaped all over the floor . He preached for a long time . That made a lasting impression upon me , for I knew he received help directly from heaven . <p> J. W. Daugherty Glenville , Nebraska <p> It would require much more space than is at my disposal to narrate even half of the things that stand out prominently in my memory concerning the life of D. S. Warner and its influence upon me . As his last years were spent in my home community and he was often in the home of my parents , I was intimately acquainted with him from my childhoods earliest recollection until I was past fifteen years of age , when he died . This association being at the impressionable period of my life , multitudes of events were stamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these incidents . The first occurred in the autumn of 1890 . An assembly was being held at Geneva Center , a short distance southwest of Lacota , Michigan . One day while a special service for children was being held , I sat upon the front seat , listening to the kind , persuasive words of instruction and admonition being given by Brother Warner . At the close of a short talk he asked , " How many of you children want to give your hearts to the Lord ? " and then without waiting for a reply he turned to me , and with love and tenderness beaming from his kindly eyes , asked , " Do you not want to get saved now ? " Instantly my heart was stirred . I knelt at the altar and Brother Warner came and prayed for me . Laying his hands upon my head , he said , " Lord , give this boy a new heart ; take away from him the stony heart and give him a heart of flesh . " I felt immediately the touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My young heart was filled with holy joy . Can I ever forget that glad moment ? Not so long as I have a being . When time , as we know it , has ended , when old earth itself has grown weary and ceased to go round , and when all the stars of the heavens have forgotten to shine , I shall still praise God for the revelation of divine life that thrilled my soul on that glorious morning . And when I wander over the green fields of the heavenly paradise , or sit down with my Lord in the city of God , I want to renew that association with Brother Warner and thank him for what he did for me . <p> Brother Warners preaching always possessed for me an irresistible charm . His doctrinal sermons took hold upon me , especially those devoted to prophetic subjects . I remember distinctly one sermon on prophecy , delivered at the campground , near Grand Junction , Michigan . It created a lasting impression upon my mind . Although he preached for four hours and ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no doubt that my later interest in doctrinal themes is due , in a great measure at least , to those early impressions , when the Spirit of God stamped the truths of His Word upon my soul . <p> The third incident that I shall mention was a sermon preached by Brother Warner , just a short time before his death . It was delivered at the campground . The subject was Heaven . So inspiring was this message that it created in me an intense longing to go to that place of light and lifea longing that abides with me still . <p> F. G. Smith Anderson , Indiana <p> I can not find words to express the help and comfort Brother Warner was to me . I well remember the bitter persecutions he and his company met while here in the South . His pure , holy life and the radical preaching are still living in the South . I remember hearing him preach one night , in a private house , on the oneness of Gods people . He was so filled with the Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead was very low . He said the leaps in his soul were higher than the ceiling of that house . I thought every time he left the floor he would hit the ceiling . He and his company were in our house at Spring Hill when the angry mob came after him ; but the Lord took care of him . <p> Mrs. Demaris ( Smith ) Vance Meridian , Mississippi <p> Brother Warner was the man under whose preaching I was convicted for salvation . I had gone fifteen miles to hear him , and when I arrived on the ground I was met by an old friend of mine who had been one of the worst men I have ever known . He said to me , " Praise God , I am glad you are here . " This made me feel that after all there might be a chance for me to obtain freedom from the sins that held me . When I went to meeting that night and Brother Warner was pointed out to me , I thought to myself , " I fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang and Brother Warner began preaching . I never had heard a man preach as he did . After the meeting , several were prayed for and healed . Something came over me as I stood and seemed to go off the ends of my fingers , and I said to myself that this was the first campmeeting I ever attended that was not ruled by Satan , and that if I could get this religion I could keep out of hell . <p> One day someone arose and testified that he was still " chawing " tobacco and asked all to pray that he might hold out . Brother Warner remarked that all the saints were testifying for Jesus but this man got up and testified for his tobacco . This was a new kind of talk to many of us . Brother Warner was one of the greatest preachers I ever heard . God was with him in such power as no one else seemed to have in those days . <p> R. H. Owens Mt . Pleasant , Louisiana <p> At a grove meeting near Antwerp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They divided into two squads , one to pass to the one side of the congregation and the other to the other side . They were prepared to throw eggs , but the leaders of the two squads said , " Do n't  throw until something is said to justify . " They marched to their places and waited . Brother Warner was preaching with wonderful anointing , and shouting . Finally the leader on one side said , " There shall be nothing thrown at that man by my consent . He is preaching the truth ; he is a man of God . " So they started back . Strange to say , those on the other side did the same , and the two parties met . One said , " Why did n't  you throw ? " The other said , " Why did n't  you ? " The leader repeated as before remarked . Finally one big fellow said , " Well , I am going to take one shot , anyway , " and he threw an egg right into the congregation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sectarian ; the egg struck him directly in the face and broke over him . He made quite a splutter . <p> At a meeting at Rising Sun , Ohio , Brother Warner was praying in an opening service when someone threw a pack of cards over their heads . After the preaching the people were gathering up the cards . He said , " Amen , gather them up ; the devil has surrendered ; he has given up his testament . " <p> J. N. Howard Nappanee , Indiana <p> It was in the spring of 1891 , in southern Indiana , that I first met Brother Warner . I shall never forget the impression he made on me as he stepped into our home . I felt so sensibly the presence of God with the man . He held a two weeks meeting at our place at that time . A number of souls were saved . Opposition ran high . The meeting was held in the schoolhouse near to a sectarian meeting house . The preacher who preached at this place tried to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day on a Sunday trying to gather up a mob to drive the brother out of the country ; but the people so much enjoyed his preaching and were so won to the man by his gentleness and the clearness of his teaching that they would not rally to the opposers standard . <p> I had the pleasure of having him in our home at a later time for about three months . It was at this time that we learned more about his prayer life . My father-in-law once drove him out of the woods where he had gone for prayer . Those prayers , however , and his patience and calmness while being driven out of the woods resulted in my mother-in-laws salvation . <p> He had a great , sympathetic heart and consequently could comfort the sorrowing as few men could . He preached the funeral of my little boy , and his words of comfort were as a healing balm . He and I roomed together at one time , when he held a ten-nights debate with a Seventh-Day Adventist preacher . Here he again impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room he would wrestle long and earnestly with God in prayer before retiring . I have always felt much indebted to him for his example in prayer and holy living . <p> C. E. Orr Everett , Washington <p> For about seven years we traveled with Brother Warner in the ministry . Our work was incessant , winter and summer . My intimate association with him impressed me with his deep devotion and sterling Christian character . He was a student of rare ability and an efficient New Testament minister and writer . He was not given to lightness , sentimentality , or idle words . He was sober , serious , and impressive in both words and actions . No one could enjoy his presence and association unless he , like him , would live spiritual and close to God . His whole life and ambition were the spread of the pure gospel and the well-being of souls . He used no empty words in his manner of preaching . His messages were weighty and impressive . <p> I remember one time in Canada where Gods presence was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through preaching the entire congregation to an individual knelt in prayer and sought the Lord for pardon and peace . <p> He was a very busy man . He was up early in the morning and late at night studying , writing , preaching , or helping some needy soul . He was charitable , sympathetic , hospitable , and self-denying . His life was full of constant peace and victory .

He spent much time in his library with his books and translations of the Scriptures , and did much writing and correspondence , his wife assisting him much . The book Salvation : Present , Perfect , Now or Never , he wrote at this time and he read the manuscript to us before it was printed . <p> He loved to talk of Gods dealings with him ; how God led him step by step out of error and confusion and many deep difficulties , how he was violently persecuted by false brethren , how his wife became deceived and separated from him , etc . He would tell of how God revealed to him the sect Babylon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must cry out against her and expose her sins ; how Babylon loomed up before him as a great black mountain , and that God was taking him as a worm to thresh it , and how he shrunk back at the thought of being thrown against such a seemingly impregnable wall .

Verily he being dead yet speaketh ! <p> Curtis W. Montgomery Marcus Hook , Pennsylvania <p> In the winter of 1888-89 Brothers George T.

During that meeting quite a congregation was raised up for the truth . <p> A few weeks after the close of this meeting , Brother Warner and company came . They arrived in spring wagons from Blanco , Pennsylvania , a distance of about thirty miles . I was working with my father in the field when they passed down the road , singing " River of Peace , " and shouting , " Hallelujah ! " We never witnessed such a scene . Singing and shouting along the public road was characteristic of Brother Warners company in those days . At night people would rush to their windows to hear the singing , and remark , " The angels are coming . " <p> In this meeting Brother Warners preaching was all doctrinal . It was all new to us ; but I never was able to shake off the convictions that fastened on my heart that these people had the truth .

" and all the company joined with loud amens and , " Glory to God ! " <p> At this meeting also Brother Warners preaching was about all doctrinal . The great fundamental truths of full salvation , holiness , the church , unity , the downfall of sect Babylon , and the command to come out of her , the great apostasy , the last reformation , divine healing , etc. , were preached uncompromisingly . I will say , brethren , this kind of preaching confirmed the saints and brought out clearly the holy remnant from the folds of confusion and drew the line in the manner that people knew the way to Zion and rejoiced in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were not born dead .

When the train from South Haven stopped at the station I heard a great shout , and looking over near The Trumpet Office saw Brother Warner leaping and shouting , crying at the top of his voice as the saints were getting off the train , " The holy remnant is pouring in ! " That was a great meeting , the most powerful I ever attended . Miracles were wrought and devils " crying with a loud voice , came out of many that were possessed with them . " * ( Acts 8:7 ) <p> Brother Warner impressed me as a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tender-hearted . Many were the warm-hearted counsels and admonitions he gave to the younger ministers , and these were delivered in tears , with a , " God bless you , my dear brother . " He was a very able man in the Scriptures , and one of the deepest in prophecies I have ever heard . He was slow to see the faults of others ; but able to expose wrong-doing when he clearly discerned it in anyone . He was very definite and radical in his preaching , and eternity alone will reveal what he suffered because of his bold defense of what he believed to be the truth . We who knew him best would never question his sincerity . He was a reformer in every sense of the term . The influences of his life and ministry will sweep onward till time shall end .

He often exhorted the young ministers and workers to seek humility of heart , and often related an incident of his personal experience in talking with the Lord , when the Lord said to him , " Be humble , My child , be humble . " <p> He had a great burden for the gathering of Gods people , the prosperity of Zion , and the salvation of the lost . To this end he dedicated his time , talents , and means , and was so self-denying that he would share his last penny with those in need . He said , when he finished a Bible subject or outline for a sermon , " Theres the skeleton , I 'll trust the Lord to put the meat on it . " I heard him say , " Satan puts us in his sieve that he may sift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in His sieve that He may sift all the bad out of us . " <p> Brother Warner was a son of thunder in delivering truth against false religions , but as wise as a serpent and as harmless as a dove in dealing with the erring ones . <p> Nora Hunter San Diego , California <p> I also wish to bear personal testimony of Brother Warner . The first time I met him was on April 7 , 1888 , at our family home , near Albany , Illinois . He with his company were on their return from their Western tour . I had been teaching school in Iowa during the previous winter and had also engaged myself for the spring term , but had a two weeks intermission for vacation , which I decided to spend at my home . How wonderful that the course of life may turn on a mere decision , which at the time may seem to involve no particular consequence . It was during that two weeks interval that I met Brother Warner and came in contact with the reformation movement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evangelists arrived at our house . They were brought thither by Brothers Knight and Daniels from the formers home , near Fulton , where they had arrived the day before . My father and I had gone to engage a schoolhouse for meeting . When we returned two men were standing at our front gate conversing , one of whom was Brother Warner . My father made himself acquainted and then introduced me , informing Brother Warner that I had been converted only a short time before . As he reached to shake my hand he said , so appreciatingly , " Well , that 's good news , " and there beamed out of those soft blue eyes a Christian love and tenderness that made a lasting impression on me . That he should so rejoice in spirit at the knowledge of my conversion seemed to give me a spiritual uplift and to place my appreciation of things spiritual on a higher level . It seemed that during that week when Brother Warner and company were with us our home was a heavenly paradise . I regard that week as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my lifes history . There was something about the happy , victorious spirit of those dear saints that exalted Christianity in my conception and made it a thing very much to be desired . The impression made upon my young heart at that time can never be erased . <p> My mother had been reading The Trumpet and had formed the opinion of Brother Warner that he was a great and wonderful man . So when she met him she exclaimed , " And is this Brother Warner ! " <p> His reply was , " Yes , and he is the least man you ever saw . " <p> In the meeting that followed he instructed me in my consecration for sanctification . As I arose , ready to venture on Gods promise , he discerned my faith and broke the way before me by claiming the promise with me . <p> When my mother died in July 1894 , I was engaged in the publishing work at Grand Junction . The telegram notifying me of her death said also , " Bring Brother Warner . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warner had retired . I went to his room and informed him of the request . He was feeling bad physically and wondered if Brother could not go instead . I knew that no other person available could give the satisfaction Brother Warner could , and so expressed myself to him . Finally he consented . Although he was weak and tired he arose from his bed and prepared to go . It was never in him to shirk what might be interpreted as duty . He believed in taking the Lord for his sufficiency , and the Lord did not disappoint him . We had to take a night train for Chicago , and before we reached the city he said he felt stronger than when he started , and this in spite of his having been deprived of rest . He preached the funeral discourse , wrote quite a lengthy obituary and poem , and even responded to a request to preach in an evening service . It was wonderful how he could take God for his strength and his every need . His life seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slept with him , taken part in his meetings , and have been associated with him in editorial work , and thus have known him at close range , and he was always God-fearing , humble , loving , devoted , full of faith , and possessed of singleness of heart , to a degree rarely known among men . His life , so exemplary , was an object lesson of Christian attainment and of what God can do for and through weak humanity . It was an inspiration to feel the touch of his Christian spirit . And thus we exalt , not the manfor apart from the divine influence that ruled his life he would have been very commonplacebut we exalt the God who can take such humble instrumentality and by a transformation of being use it to accomplish His work in the earth .

And here , as in the first step , the enemy is very skilful in making difficulties and interposing obstacles . <p> The child of God , having had his eyes opened to see the fulness there is in Jesus for him , and having been made to long to appropriate that fulness to himself , is met with the assertion on the part of every teacher to whom he applies , that this fulness is only to be received by faith . But the subject of faith is involved in such a hopeless mystery in his mind , that this assertion , instead of throwing light upon the way of entrance , only seems to make it more difficult and involved than ever . <p> " Of course it is to be by faith , " he says , " for I know that everything in the Christian life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it so hard , for I have no faith , and I do not even know what it is , nor how to get it .

You have looked upon it as in some way a sort of thing , either a religious exercise of soul , or an inward gracious disposition of heart ; something tangible , in fact , which , when you have got , you can look at and rejoice over , and use as a passport to Gods favor , or a coin with which to purchase His gifts .

Now faith , in fact , is not in the least this sort of thing . It is nothing at all tangible . It is simply believing God , and , like sight , it is nothing apart from its object . You might as well shut your eyes and look inside to see whether you have sight , as to look inside to discover whether you have faith . You see something , and thus know that you have sight ; you believe something , and thus know that you have faith . For , as sight is only seeing , so faith is only believing . And as the only necessary thing about seeing is , that you see the thing as it is , so the only necessary thing about believing is , at you believe the thing as it is . The virtue does not lie in your believing , but in the thing you believe . If you believe the truth you are saved ; if you believe a lie you are lost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things believed in are exactly opposite , and it is this which makes the mighty difference . Your salvation comes , not because your faith saves you , but because it links you on to the Savior who saves ; and your believing is really nothing but the link . <p> I do beg of you to recognize , then , the extreme simplicity of faith ; that it is nothing more nor less than just believing God when He says He either has done something for us , or will do it ; and then trusting Him to do it . It is so simple that it is hard to explain . If any one asks me what it means to trust another to do a piece of work for me , I can only answer that it means letting that other one do it , and feeling it perfectly unnecessary for me to do it myself .

All this we do , and make no fuss about it . Upon the slightest acquaintance , often , we thus put our trust in people , requiring only the general knowledge of human nature , and the common rules of human intercourse ; and we never feel as if we were doing anything in the least remarkable . <p> You have done all this yourself , dear reader , and are doing it continually .

Suppose you should begin tomorrow with the notion in your head that you could not trust anybody , because you had no faith . When you sat down to breakfast you would say , " I can not eat anything on this table , for I have no faith , and I can not believe the cook has not put poison in the coffee , or that the butcher has not sent home diseased meat .

Then , when your friends met you with any statements , or your business agent with any accounts , you would say , " I am very sorry that I can not believe you , but I have no faith , and never can believe anybody . " If you opened a newspaper you would be forced to lay it down again , saying , " I really can not believe a word this paper says , for I have no faith ; I do not believe there is any such person as the queen , for I never saw her ; nor any such country as Ireland , for I was never there .

For when you say this , you mean of course that you have no faith in God , since you are not asked to have faith in yourself , and you would be in a very wrong condition of soul if you had . Let me beg of you then , when you think or say these things , always to complete the sentence and say , " I have no faith in God , I can not believe God " ; and this I am sure will soon become so dreadful to you , that you will not dare to continue it . <p> But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

For He is always ready to help our infirmities . We never have to wait for Him , He is always waiting for us .

If you have ever trusted a precious interest in the hands of any earthly friend , I conjure you , trust yourself now and all your spiritual interests in the hands of your Heavenly Friend , and never , never , never allow yourself to doubt again . <p> And remember , there are two things which are more utterly incompatible than even oil and water , and these two are trust and worry .

When a believer really trusts anything , he ceases to worry about that thing which he has trusted . And when he worries , it is a plain proof that he does not trust . Tested by this rule , how little real trust there is in the Church of Christ ! No wonder our Lord asked the pathetic question , " When the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ? " * ( Luke 18:8 ) He will find plenty of activity , a great deal of earnestness , and doubtless many consecrated hearts ; but shall he find faith , the one thing He values more than all the rest ?

And I remember my soul cried out with an eager longing that I might be called to walk in paths so dark , that an utter abandonment of trust might be my blessed and glorious privilege . <p> " Ye have not passed this way heretofore , " * ( Joshua 3:4 ) it may be ; but today it is your happy privilege to prove , as never before , your loyal confidence in the Lord by starting out with Him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment in absolute and childlike trust in Him . <p> You have trusted Him in a few things , and He has not failed you .

" <p> In that greatest event of this century , the emancipation of our slaves , there is a wonderful illustration of the way of faith . The slaves received their freedom by faith , just as we must receive ours . The good news was carried to them that the government had proclaimed their freedom . As a matter of fact they were free the moment the Proclamation was issued , but as a matter of experience they did not come into actual possession of their freedom until they had heard the good news and had believed it .

In a little out-of-the-way Southern town a Northern lady found , about two or three years after the war was over , some slaves who had not yet taken possession of their freedom . An assertion of hers , that the North had set them free , aroused the attention of an old colored auntie , who interrupted her with the eager question : <p> " O missus , is we free ?

Sometimes we 'd hope we was free , and then again we 'd think we was n't . But now , missus , if you is sure we is free , wo n't you tell me all about it ? " <p> Seeing that this was a case of real need , the lady took the pains to explain the whole thing to the poor woman ; all about the war , and the Northern army , and Abraham Lincoln , and his Proclamation of Emancipation , and the present freedom . <p> The poor slave listened with the most intense eagerness .

The good news had not profited her , not being " mixed with faith " * ( Hebrews 4:2 ) in the one who heard it . But now she believed , and believing , she dared to reckon herself to be free . And this , not because of any change in herself or her surroundings , not because of any feelings of emotions of her own heart , but because she had confidence in the word of another , who had come to her proclaiming the good news of her freedom . <p> Need I make the application ?

Hold on to your reckoning in the face of all opposition , and I can promise you , on the authority of our Lord , that according to your faith it shall be unto you . <p> Of all the worships we can bring our God , none is so sweet to Him as this utter self-abandoning trust , and none brings Him so much glory .

" * ( 2 Corinthians 2:14 ) ERV <p> When God placed Adam in Paradise that he should not only dress it but " keep it , " * ( Genesis 2:15 ) it is evident that there must have been some power of evil against which he had to watch and guard it . Since all that God created during the six days was very good , the evil must have already existed . Scripture does not reveal how and whence it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that it threatens the very center of the new creation , the garden of God and the dwelling of man , with danger and ruin . God seeks to rob this evil of its power , and purposes doing so through the medium of man . No doubt this was at least partly why God made manto conquer the evil that had existed before him . It is this that makes our world of such importance in the eyes of God and His angels : this is the battlefield where heaven and hell meet in deadly conflict . <h> The Enemy of the Cross <p> The terrible history of mankind can never be rightly understood until we allow Scripture to teach us that , even as God overrules all with a purpose , there is also an organized system of opposition , a kingdom that holds rule over men , keeping them in darkness , and using them in its war against the kingdom of Gods Son . On a scale beyond our small conception , through the slow length of ages which Gods patience bears , amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears nothing but a natural growth and development , there is an unceasing contest going on . Though the outcome is not in doubt , the struggle is long and destructive . In the history of that struggle the cross is the turning point . <p> In our text we have a wonderful lifting of the veil to show what the redemption of the cross implies . " Having put off from himself the principalities and the powers , he made a show of them openly , triumphing over them in the cross . " * ( Colossians 2:14-15 ) ERV In the darkness of the cross the powers of darkness had made their onslaught ; together they pressed on Him with everything that is terrible in their power , surrounding Him with the very darkness and misery of hell . They formed a cloud so thick and dark that the very light of Gods face forsook Him . But He put them off from Himself ; He beat back the enemies and overcame the temptation . He made a show of them openly ; in all the spirit world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He conquered . <p> The very grave gave up its dead . And so He triumphed over them . In the other world the cross is the symbol of victory .

The Prince of this world is now cast out . He no longer has power to hold in bondage those who long for deliverance . He now only rules over those who consent to be his slaves . There is now a perfect deliverance for all who yield themselves to Christ and His cross . <h> The Cross Is a Triumph <p> This is the great lesson of our text . The cross is a triumph , which began when Christ cried out , " It is finished .

" * ( 1 Corinthians 15:54,57 ) ERV <p> Without this , our understanding of the meaning and our experience of the power of the cross will be defective . We will find this both in our personal life and in our labors for others . In our personal life the cross will be counted a burden : the call to bear it , a law hard to obey ; the attempt to live the crucifixion life , a failure ; the thought of a daily death , a weariness .

Nothing less than His death can suffice us ; nothing less than His death is at our disposal . " Thanks be unto God , which always leadeth us in triumph in Christ . " <p> It is just as important in our service in this world that we believe in the triumph of the cross over the powers of darkness . Nothing less than an insight into this truth can teach us to know the supernatural strength , and the spiritual subtlety of our enemy .

Faith must learn to say in all its service and warfare , " Thanks be unto God , which always leadeth us in triumph in Christ . " The cross with its foolishness and weakness , its humiliation and shame , is the everlasting signal of the victory Christ has won by weapons not of fleshly warfare . Yes , and of the victory which and every servant of Christ in particular can continually win as he enters more deeply into the spirit of His crucified Lord , and so yields more fully to Him .

Would that every professing follower of Jesus were in this blessed state . It would produce a revo lution in Christendom . Does not this signify all that can possibly be comprehended in justification ? <p> Then , after the blood of Jesus had been shed and the ransom for sin paid , He " opened their understanding that they might understand the scriptures , " * ( Luke 24:45 ) how he should suffer and rise again from the dead . We see that they believed in Him the Redeemer , and now understood the object of His suffering and death ; but there was still a glorious work of grace awaiting them , to be inwrought by the Holy Ghost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this reason Jesus prayed for them as He did . He well knew that they could not be kept from the evil of the world in a manner that would prove satisfactory to themselves and the Father , unless there should be accomplished in them more than had yet been done .

" * ( Acts 2:1-4 ) <p> We will presently consider the testimony of the apostle Peter with reference to this experience at Pentecost , but will first notice the experience of <h> Cornelius and His Household <p> This brother was a devout man ; he feared God with all his house ; he prayed to God always and gave much alms , which were accepted of God and were had in remembrance in his sight ; he had a good report . God heard his prayers , accepted him , and answered his prayers ; and he and his household were all anxious to hear the preaching of Peter , testifying , " Now therefore are we all here present before God , to hear all things that are commanded thee of God . " * ( Acts 10:33 ) <p> This was not a company of sinners . Peter did not preach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have the privileges that many others had and were not acquainted with the apostles , they were acquainted with God . Peter expressed his surprise at this , saying , " Of a truth , I perceive that God is no respecter of persons : but in every nation he that feareth him , and worketh righteousness , is accepted with him . " * ( Acts 10:34-35 ) Here Peter testifies both to the righteousness and to the acceptance with God of this household . <p> From Peters testimony to the church concerning this event , a doubt might arise as to this company being saved in the full New Testament justification . He refers to the words of the angel in his message to Cornelius , instructing him to send for Peter , " Who shall teach thee words whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved . " * ( Acts 11:14 ) But this statement in itself can not be interpreted to mean that this company were not already justified . We have a parallel statement of Peter in his testimony to the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace of God to the Gentile , even as they . " * ( Acts 15:10-11 ) The term " saved " in both these instances signifies more than justification ; for truly Peter and the disciples to whom he was speaking in this last instance were justified . <p> The household of Cornelius were ready with open hearts to receive all that God had for them , and while Peter spoke the word of God to them " the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word . " * ( Acts 10:44 ) This experience was identical in character with that of the Jewish saints at Pentecost . <h> Peters Testimony <p> In rehearsing this wonderful event to the brethren and apostles at Jerusalem he testified to the unquestionable leading of the Spirit to this company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to speak , the Holy Ghost fell on them , as on us at the beginning . Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us , who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ ; what was I , that I could withstand God ? " * ( Acts 11:15,17 ) Upon another occasion at Jerusalem Peter again spoke of the same event , saying , " And God , which knoweth the hearts , bare them witness , giving them the Holy Ghost , even as he did unto us ; and put no difference between us and them , purifying their hearts by faith . " * ( Acts 15:8-9 ) But Peter testified to the fact that the Gentiles are placed upon a level with the Jews , not only in the reception of the Holy Spirit , but in the experience of cleansing . He testified to these two phases of sanctification , equally wrought in the hearts of the Jews and Gentiles , making " no difference between us and them " ; and in this same testimony he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience co-incident with the reception of the Holy Ghost " giving them the Holy Ghost , " " purifying their hearts , " " even as he did unto us . " Opposers of this truth have argued that Peters statement , " purifying their hearts , " in the Greek text reads , " having purified their hearts , " the word having signifying that their hearts were purified previous to the event of their reception of the Holy Ghost ; but this objection has no foundation in scripture , history , or experience . If there could be a shadow of meaning in this form of this word in the Greek text , to signify that the " purifying their hearts " occurred prior to the outpouring of the Holy Ghost , it simply has reference to the order of these two phases of sanctification , which were effected within them upon this occasion . <p> It is evident that in the divine order of sanctification purifying the heart by faith is preparatory to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit . He must have a pure heart in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no lapse of time perceptible between the negative and positive phase of sanctification . How easily this is understood by those who have truly received the Pentecostal experience . How the " anointing " teaches us and witnesses in our hearts to the testimony of Peter ; but to those who have not yet had their Pentecost , and especially such as are blinded by theory and the doctrines of men , there is likely to be discussion and argument of words . The apostles and brethren at Jerusalem had no argument to make when Peter rehearsed his experience . They simply " glorified God . " * ( Acts 11:18 ) <h> Pauls Testimony <p> " Nevertheless , brethren , I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is given to being sanctified by the Holy Ghost . " * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his account of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost upon the Gentile believers . It is not plainly stated that Paul has reference to this event in his testimony quoted , yet we can see clearly that he does have reference to the experience of sanctification , and that it is identical with that of all believers , being a specific work of the Holy Ghost . <h> Experiences of the Brethren at Samaria <p> " Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria , and preached Christ both men and women . " * ( Acts 8:5,12 ) About three years prior to this time there was at Samaria a greater One than Philip preaching the words of life , and many more than the woman at the well believed , and they said @ @ @ world . " * ( John 4:42 ) This was an effectual introduction of the gospel , and when Philip went to that city he found much good soil for the precious word in the name of Jesus Christ . There is no room for doubt as to the acceptable condition of these converts . They believed in the name of Jesus and were baptized . Some had doubtless remained firm believers since Jesus visit to that city ; others believed through the preaching of Philip . Certainly they were justified by faith in the name of Jesus , but like the disciples before Pentecost they were not yet sanctified , and when the apostles at Jerusalem heard of this work of grace at Samaria they sent down Peter and John , " who when they were come down , prayed for them , that they might name of the Lord Jesus ) then laid they their hands on them , and they received the Holy Ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inspired record here proves the second work of grace , and how beautifully this event harmonizes with the others relative to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit . And then , how glorious to have an experience like it in our own hearts .

At last I went to live in California . Life was rough in the mining country where I lived , with my husband and little boys . <p> While there I heard of a man who lived over the hills and was dying of consumption . The men said , " He is so vile that no one can stay with him ; so we place some food near him , and leave him for twenty-four hours . We will find him dead sometime , and the sooner the better . Never had a relative , I guess . " <p> This pitiful story haunted me as I went about my work . For three days I tried to get someone to go to see him and find out if he was in need of better care .

It was not the kind of work I wanted . <p> But at last one day I went over the hills to the little abode . It was a mud cabin , containing but one room . The door stood open . In one corner , on some straw and colored blankets , I found the dying man . Sin had left awful marks on his face , and if I had not heard that he could not move , I should have retreated . As my shadow fell over the floor , he looked up and greeted me with an oath . I stepped forward a little , and again he swore . <p> " Do n't  speak so , my friend , " I said . <p> " I ai n't  your friend .

I spoke of God , and he cursed Him . I tried to speak of Jesus and His death for us , but he stopped me with his oaths , and said , " That 's all a lie . Nobody ever died for others . " <p> I went away discouraged , saying to myself that I knew it was of no use . But the next day I went again , and every day for two weeks .

" <p> I could not sleep that night . I thought of the dying man , so vile , and with no one to care ! I rose and went away by myself to pray ; but the moment that I knelt , I was overpowered by the sense of how little meaning there had been to my prayers . I had had no faith , and I had not really cared , beyond a kind of half-hearted sentiment . I had not claimed his soul for God . Oh , the shame of such missionary zeal !

I thought the man might die . <p> As I passed on , a neighbor came out of her cabin , and said , " I will go over the hills with you . " <p> I did not want her to go , but it was another lesson for me . God could plan better than I could .

" Proverbs 22:28 says , " Remove not the ancient landmark , which thy fathers have set . " Proverbs 23:10 says again , " Remove not the old landmark ; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless . " Verse 11 continues , " For their redeemer is mighty ; he shall plead their cause with thee . " In all these Scriptures we see that the original landmarks which were set in the time of laying out and allotting the land to the children of Israel when they received their inheritance were very important all the way through in maintaining proper identification of each persons land as the inheritance passed down from one generation to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old time had set ( Deuteronomy 19:14 ) . The ancient landmarks which had been set by their fathers were not to be removed ( Proverbs 22:28 ) . A curse was pronounced upon anyone who tampered with any of the original landmarks ( Deuteronomy 27:17 ) . The rightful inheritance of each one of the children of Israel could only be identified by reference to those ancient landmarks . <p> It is the same in maintaining proper land lines and boundaries now . When a surveyor runs a land line he must locate corner stones and run the lines according to them . I have known them to dig up a considerable area in an effort to locate a corner stone , and if it could not be located , they could not proceed with the survey until one was established . Neither was this done by arbitrary means . The surveyor did not just look around and decide on an arbitrary location as being the most likely or pretty close and run from there . Rather he went to where he could clearly locate a corner stone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from those stones and established a corner that tied in with the other established corners in the area . Sometimes they would have to go maybe as much as a mile and perhaps in some cases even farther and measure in from each direction to locate a given corner . But the survey could not proceed until that corner had been definitely established to correspond with the other established corners in the area . <p> Also , in a survey , the line must be run according to where the original corner stones are found . If there are obstacles in the way and trees and brush , etc. , which hinder him from seeing through to the other corner , he does not decide that the line can not be established in that place and just move it over to another place . Instead he will carefully measure over a certain number of feet from the corner stone at each end of the line to clear the obstacle and set up his flag at that point to shoot to and run the line through from there , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shooting is so many feet off from the actual line . This becomes a matter of official record . When this is done and recorded legally the adjacent land owners can just wrangle and fuss all they want to and sue each other in court over the property line , but it will be always settled by the legal record of that surveyor who made the survey and established those corners . Everything in a given area must correspond with everything around it and must be tied in with the general area . <p> Now let us come down to apply this thought to us and to our spiritual standards , etc . In 1 Corinthians 10:18 we read , " Behold Israel after the flesh . " But why behold Israel after the flesh ? Because Israel after the flesh is a type of Israel after the spirit spiritual Israel or the Church of God in this New Testament age of time . Those literal landmarks referred to in the above texts which were so important to the children of Israel in their inheritance , etc. were typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been established by our fathers for the church . In the 5th chapter of Hosea , God was pronouncing judgment against the priests and princes and people of Israel for their rebellion against Him and their idolatry , etc. , and said , " The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound : therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water . " * ( Hosea 5:10 ) From this we see that God considers a departure from established standards set in the Scriptures and established for saints to go by as removing the ancient landmarks , and His judgment is pronounced against it , and His wrath poured out upon those who do such in this book . " * ( Revelation 22:18,19 ) We see here that it is no light thing to tamper with Gods Word and the standards and principles it sets forth , to change them or remove them in any way . <p> Now , returning to the thought that in a literal land line survey all must be definitely established to correspond with everything around it , and must be tied in with the general area , this is also true in the over-all picture of spiritual things and in establishing true standards for the church to go by . Each individual part of that standard must be scripturally and spiritually established and must tie in with the general over-all standard of teaching of the church . In other words , if we see evil in a particular thing and oppose it as being not compatible with a holy life because of the evil influence of it , then we should oppose all things related to that in principle and every projection of that thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As an illustration : if we oppose the movies in general as an element of evil influence , and I am sure that all of us do and the saints have stood against this thing from the time it first came in , then we should also oppose its offspring , the television , which projects that same evil influence from the theater right into our parlors and brings it right home to our children .

We accept , in their very fullest meaning , all the commands and promises concerning our being no more children , and our growing up into Christ in all things , until we come unto a perfect man , unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ . We rejoice that we need not continue always to be babes , needing milk ; but that we may , by reason of use and development become such as have need of strong meat , skilful in the word of righteousness , and able to discern both good and evil . And none would grieve more than we at the thought of any finality in the Christian life beyond which there could be no advance . <p> But then we believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a development that , as a fact , does bring forth ripe fruit . We expect to reach the aim set before us , and if we do not , we feel sure there must be some fault in our growing .

Growth , to be real , must be progressive , and the days and weeks and months must see a development and increase of maturity in the thing growing .

The children of Israel wandering in the wilderness are a perfect picture of this sort of growing . They were travelling about for forty years , taking many weary steps , and finding but little rest from their wanderings , and yet , at the end of it all , were no nearer the promised land than they were at the beginning .

For grace is a most fruitful soil , and the plants that grow therein are plants of a marvellous growth . They are tended by a Divine Husbandman , and are warmed by the Sun of Righteousness , and watered by the dew from Heaven .

I sometimes think we give a totally different meaning to the word " love " when it is associated with God , from that we so well understand in its human application . But if ever human love was tender and self-sacrificing and devoted ; if ever it could bear and forbear ; if ever it could suffer gladly for its loved ones ; if ever it was willing to pour itself out in a lavish abandonment for the comfort or pleasure of its objectsthen infinitely more is Divine love tender and self-sacrificing and devoted , and glad to bear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of gifts and blessings upon the objects of its love . Put together all the tenderest love you know of , dear reader , the deepest you have ever felt , and the strongest that has ever been poured out upon you , and heap upon it all the love of all the loving human hearts in the world , and then multiply it by infinity , and you will begin perhaps to have some faint glimpses of what the love of God in Christ Jesus is . And this is grace . And to be planted in grace is to live in the very heart of this love , to be enveloped by it , to be steeped in it , to revel in it , to know nothing else but love only and love always , to grow day by day in the knowledge of it , and in faith in it , to intrust everything to its care , and to have no shadow of a doubt but that it will surely order all things well . <p> To grow in grace is opposed to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every kind . It is to put our growing , as well as everything else , into the hands of the Lord , and leave it with Him . It is to be so satisfied with our Husbandman , and with His skill and wisdom , that not a question will cross our minds as to His modes of treatment or His plan of cultivation . It is to grow as the lilies grow , or as the babes grow , without a care and without anxiety ; to grow by the power of an inward life principle that can not help but grow ; to grow because we live and therefore must grow ; to grow because He who has planted us has planted a growing thing , and has made us to grow . <p> Surely this is what our one of these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says again , " Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature ? " * ( Matthew 6:27 ) There is no effort in the growing of a child or of a lily . They do not toil nor spin , they do not stretch nor strain , they do not make any effort of any kind to grow ; they are not conscious even that they are growing ; but by an inward life principle , and through the nurturing care of Gods providence , and the fostering of caretaker or gardener , by the heat of the sun and the falling of the rain , they grow and grow . <p> And the result is sure . Even Solomon , our Lord says , in all his glory , was not arrayed like one of these . Solomons array cost much toiling and spinning , and gold and silver in abundance , but the lilys array costs none of these . And though we may toil and spin to make for ourselves beautiful spiritual garments , and may strain and stretch in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for no man by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature ; and no array of ours can ever equal the beautiful dress with which the great Husbandman clothes the plants that grow in His garden of grace and under His fostering care . <p> If I could but make each one of my readers realize how utterly helpless we are in this matter of growing , I am convinced a large part of the strain would be taken out of many lives at once . Imagine a child possessed of the monomania that he would not grow unless he made some personal effort after it , and who should insist upon a combination of rope and pulleys whereby to stretch himself up to the desired height . He might , it is true , spend his days and years in a weary strain , but after all there would be no change in the inexorable fact , " No man by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature " ; and his years of labor would be only wasted , if they did not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clothe itself in beautiful colors and graceful lines , stretching its leaves and stems to make them grow , and seeking to manage the clouds and the sunshine , that its needs might be all judiciously supplied ! <p> And yet in these two pictures we have , I conceive , only too true a picture of what many Christians are trying to do ; who , knowing they ought to grow , and feeling within them an instinct that longs for growth , yet think to accomplish it by toiling , and spinning , and stretching , and straining , and pass their lives in such a round of self-effort as is a weariness to contemplate . <p> Grow , dear friends ; but grow , I beseech you , in Gods way , which is the only effectual way . See to it that you are planted in grace , and then let the Divine Husbandman cultivate you in His own way and by His own means . Put yourselves out in the sunshine of His presence , and let the dew of heaven come down upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaves and flowers and fruit must surely come in their season , for your Husbandman is a skilful one , and He never fails in His harvesting . Only see to it that you interpose no hindrance to the shining of the Sun of Righteousness or the falling of the dew from Heaven . A very thin covering may serve to keep off the heat or the moisture , and the plant may wither even in their midst ; and the slightest barrier between your soul and Christ may cause you to dwindle and fade as a plant in a cellar or under a bushel . Keep the sky clear . Open wide every avenue of your being to receive the blessed influences our Divine Husbandman may bring to bear upon you . Bask in the sunshine of His love . Drink in of the waters of His goodness . Keep your face up-turned to Him . Look , and your soul shall live . <p> You need make no efforts to grow ; but let your efforts instead be all concentrated on this , that you abide in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vine , will care for its branches also , and will so prune and purge and water and tend them that they will grow and bring forth fruit , and their fruit shall remain ; and , like the lily , they shall find themselves arrayed in apparel so glorious that that of Solomon will be as nothing to it . <p> What if you seem to yourselves to be planted at this moment in a desert soil where nothing can grow ! Put yourself absolutely into the hands of the great Husbandman , and He will at once make that desert blossom as the rose , and will cause springs and fountains of water to start up out of its sandy wastes ; for the promise is sure , that the man who cease from yielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great prerogative of our Divine Husbandman that He is able to turn any soil , whatever it may be like , into the soil of grace , the moment we put our growing into His hands . He does not need to transplant us into a different field , but right where we are , with just the circumstances that surround us , He makes His sun to shine and His dew to fall upon us , and transforms the very things that were before our greatest hindrances into the chiefest and most blessed means of our growth . I care not what the circumstances may be , His wonder-working power can accomplish this . And we must trust Him with it all . Surely He is a Husbandman we can trust . And if He sends storms , or winds , or rains , or sunshine , all must be accepted at His hands with the most unwavering confidence that He who has undertaken to cultivate us , and to bring us to maturity , knows the very best way of accomplishing His end , and regulates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a view to our most rapid growth . <p> Let me entreat of you , then , to give up all your efforts after growing , and simply to let yourselves grow . Leave it all to the Husbandman , whose care it is , and who alone is able to manage it . No difficulties in your case can baffle Him . No dwarfing of your growth in years that are past , no apparent dryness of your inward springs of life , no crookedness or deformity in any of your past development , can in the least mar the perfect work that He will accomplish , if you will only put yourselves absolutely into His hands , and let Him have His own way with you . His own gracious promise to His backsliding children assures you of this . " I will heal their backslidings , " He says : " I will love them freely : for mine anger is turned away from him .

Be glad then , ye children of Zion , and rejoice in the LORD in the first month . And the floors shall be full of wheat , and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil . And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten , the cankerworm , and the caterpiller , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . And ye shall eat in plenty , and be satisfied , and praise the name of the LORD your God , that hath dealt wondrously with you : and my people shall never be ashamed . " * ( Joel 2:22-26 ) <p> Oh ! that you could but know just what your Lord meant when He said , " Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they toil not , neither do they spin . " * ( Matthew 6:28 ) Surely these words give us a picture of a life and of a growth far different from the ordinary life and growth of Christians ; a life of rest , and a growth without effort ; and yet a life and a growth crowned with glorious results . And to every soul that will thus become a lily in the garden of the Lord , and will grow as the lilies grow , the same glorious array will be surely given as is given them ; and they will know the fulfilment of that wonderful mystical passage concerning their Beloved , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Song 2:16 ; 6:3 ) <p> This is the sort of growth in grace in which we who have entered into the life of full trust believe : a growth which brings the desired results , which blossoms out into flower and fruit , and becomes a tree planted by the rivers of water , that bringeth forth his fruit in his season ; whose leaf also does not wither , and who prospers in whatsoever he doeth ( Psalm 1:3 ) . And we rejoice to know that there are growing up now in the Lords heritage many such plants , who , as the lilies behold the face of the sun and grow thereby , are , by " beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord , being changed into the same image from glory to glory , even as by the Spirit of the Lord .

You will find that such souls are not engaged in watching self , but in looking unto Jesus . They do not toil nor spin for their spiritual garments , but leave themselves in the hands of the Lord to be arrayed as it may please Him . Self-effort and self-dependence are at an end with them . Their interest in self is gone , transferred over into the hands of another . Self has become really nothing , and Christ alone is all in all to such as these . And the blessed result is , that not even Solomon , in all his glory , was arrayed like these shall be . <p> Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that growing is not a thing of effort , but is the result of an inward life , a principle of growth .

And this life is the life hid with Christ in God ( Colossians 3:3 ) , the wonderful divine life of an indwelling Holy Ghost . Be filled with this , dear believer , and , whether you are conscious of it or not , you must grow , you can not help growing . Do not trouble about your growing , but see to it that you have the growing life . Abide in the Vine ( John 15:4 ) . Let the life from Him flow through all your spiritual veins .

Say a continual " Yes " to your Fathers will . <p> Heretofore you have perhaps tried , as so many do , to be both the lily and the gardener , both the vineyard and the husbandman . You have taken upon your shoulders the burdens and responsibilities that belong only to the Divine Husbandman , and which He alone is able to bear .

Be content with what the Divine Husbandman arranges for you , and with the care He gives . Let Him choose the sort of plants and fruits He sees best to cultivate , and grow a potato as gladly as a rose , if such be His will , and homely , everyday virtues as willingly as exalted fervors .

It was an awful trial for this young woman to have to face this . <p> When God chooses His trials to give to each of us , He knows what He s doing . I used to think that : Oh , here 's a trial , can I make it ? Will I fail ? That 's before I realized how carefully God measures them out . Every trial He measures to you and mewe cant handle it by ourselves . If we go at it that way , well fail all right ; well come short in some way . He measures them out with the provision that you and I get ahold of His grace through that trial . But He weighs it out so each trial is one that the Lord knows we can only go through with His grace . <p> In other words , a trial is one way of Gods votes of confidence in you and me . The Lord knew that Mary , by His grace and help , could go through this . A lot of people could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel with this trial to her . And it was a sore trial . Do you remember the proverbist who said that " a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches " * ( Proverbs 22:1 ) ? For this to happen to Mary in this way , outside of human experience , was going to completely take away her good name . And it did . How can you explain such a thing ? Who would believe you ? The man that she was planning to marry ; he loved her and she loved him ; he thought that the obvious had happened , too . In his mind he was deeply disappointed in her . He was a kind man , the Bible says , " not willing to make her a public example , " ( which he could of done ) , so he was minded " to put her away privily , " * ( Matthew 1:19 ) that is , secretly . And he wouldve done it , too , except for one thing . The One who gave Mary this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a dream and told him the truth . Joseph picked up his side of this trial . <p> All in all , by human reasoning , it does n't  look like an auspicious way for the Son of God to come into the world , does it ? With such a reproach hanging over it ; a reproach that was thrown at Him all His life . In the midst of one of the spiritual discussions in which He was telling others the truth and they were resisting it , they threw back this taunt in His face , " We be not one born of fornication . " * ( John 8:41 ) This was a trial . This ranks up there in the major ones . <p> Let 's look at how this sister reacted to this : " Then said Mary unto the angel , How shall this be , seeing I know not a man ? " * ( Luke 1:34 ) I am pure ; I who was called barren . " * ( Luke 1:36 ) Isnt it wonderful how the Lord knows exactly how much we can bear and just what we need to help us and support us at every step . This may have proved too much for Marys strength , her trust in God , her long sufferingand the Lord had put with it another miraculous thing to stand by it . And that was that her cousin Elisabeth had conceived and was six months with child . At that time , pretty soon , what do we find ? Mary visiting Elisabeth and Elisabeth testifying to this . <p> See , amid all , what we do n't  have mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridicule , the envy of others that was finally brought about : " Marys always been such a good girl , but see now .

And her cousin received her and believed the story she had to tell , and , indeed , she said the babe in her womb leaped for joy when she first heard her voice . All of these were what sustained this sister and helped her in this trial . <p> But there was more : " For with God nothing shall be impossible . And Mary said , Behold the handmaid of the Lord . " * ( Luke 1:37-38 ) <p> Oh , there 's depths in this ! She did n't  just say , " Lord , you sent this angel and I guess I do n't  have anything to say about it , I am just stuck .

Its not that she does great , big tasks all the time ; its the little thingsIm here ; I 'm ready for service ; I 'm at hand . The handmaid of the Lord . This speaks volumes about how this young woman walked with God . " Lord , I 'm yours ; I belong to you , my job is to just stay around you and do whatever you ask me to do at any given time . " <p> What a calling to be a handmaiden ! Little things , little errands , relatively unimportant things that the mistress could easily do for herself if she desired to .

Mary was . <p> " Behold the handmaid of the Lord ; be it unto me according to thy word . " * ( Luke 1:38 ) <p> " Lord , I accept the trial . I accept the reproach of the trial . I accept the consequences of doing what You want me to do . I am Yours ; I belong to You , Lord . Be it unto me according to Thy will . " <p> Let 's look a little farther , to the second custom of the law , Then took he him up in his arms , and blessed God , and said , Lord , now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace , according to thy word : For mine eyes have seen thy salvation , Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people ; A light to lighten the Gentiles , and the glory of thy people Israel . And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were of many hearts may be revealed . " * ( Luke 2:25-35 ) <p> It was so , was n't it ? Do you see this same young woman , now getting older steadily ? She was a mother many times overJesus had brothers and sisters . She had a many-pierced heart . Long before it ever came to His public ministry , the prophecy of Simeon came true . This was a trial that went on and on and on and on .

Both effectually destroy marriages , but the various groups of people that justify church divorce do not teach a formal dividing asunder of the marriage relationship .

However , in no way does it teach that the one who loves Christ must sever the relationship with the other in such way that it no longer exists . A man may be at variance against his father because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gospel justify him not honoring his father as his father . The gospel does not justify me treating my parents as if they were no longer my parents , or my son or daughter as if they were no longer my children . My loyalty must be to Him who died for me above all other loyalties , but those relationships still exist and I am scripturally required to take care of them . <p> The division that is caused by the gospel does not negate the family commitments . And the Bible is quite specific about those duties and responsibilities . With respect to the husband-wife relationship , the Bible plainly teaches that the husband should love the wife as his own body and as Christ did the church ; and it teaches that the wifes love for her husband should be characterized by reverence for him as her husband and subjection to him as her husband . " Husbands , love your wives , even as Christ also loved the church , subjection unto their own husbands . " * ( 1 Peter 3:1,5 ) <p> It should never be truthfully said of a child of God that they no longer love their husband/wife . No matter how reprehensibly the other acts , the regenerated child of God should and must be filled with the love of God for their companion . Only God can supply the needed love in many cases .

If he requires more subjection than that , she can not submit to him beyond her subjection as a wife and continue to be in subjection to Jesus . One husband went so far as to say that sin was no longer sin to the wife if the husband required her to do it , but such a position is not Biblical . That is going far beyond subjection as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife is only possible while the two dwell together . Nor could the husband " behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear " if the two are not living together .

" * ( 1 Corinthians 7:10 ) This is very plain . Departure is not condoned , whether the departing one is saved or not . God means for marriages to be preserved . The Lord says , " Let not the wife depart from her husband . " No matter how great the oppression , no matter how limiting the marriage yoke may become ; departure is forbidden . The next verse appears to contradict the one just quoted . It states , " But and if she depart , let her remain unmarried , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband put away his wife . " * ( 1 Corinthians 7:11 ) The tenth verse emphatically commands not to depart ; the eleventh states , " if she depart . " The Bible recognizes that people will do as they should n't do , i.e. , depart ; but so important is the need to preserve the marriage tie , that the Bible commands that if she should depart , she must remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband . Nor does her departure , grievous and destructive as it is , give allowance for the husband to dissolve the marriage by putting hath called us to peace .

" For what knowest thou , O wife , whether thou shalt save thy husband ? or how knowest thou , O man , whether thou shalt save thy wife ? " * ( 1 Corinthians 7:16 ) This is the hope of the believing companion on trial . ( Some would have us believe that the phrase , " a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases , " refers to the marriage bond , and that this bond no longer applies .

The young are even more vulnerable to the damage of departure else were your children unclean literally unatoned , that is , at supreme disadvantage ; but now are they holy atoned , that is , legally covered ( justified ) , with hopes for the future .

For God ( whom you profess to love ) instituted , values , and loves the relationship of marriage , and takes it personally when you sever asunder your marriage by departing from your lawfully-wedded companion . God knows very well how the happiness and prosperity of the human race is dependent on good marriages , and He abhors your dissolving of a lawful marriage by departing from your lawful companion in His name .

Even while the Christian is striving earnestly to follow Christ , and in some measure to take his cross , there is a secret power that resists and opposes and prevents . The very man who is praying and vowing and struggling to follow fully what desire and will and heart are apparently set on , in his inmost self refuses the cross his Lord has called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the controlling power , refuses to accept .

And why , if He died for me on the cross , and won life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , and daily take up my cross ? <h> Why the Cross ? <p> The answer is simple , and yet not easy to comprehend . Only to the soul that consents to obey Jesus before fully understanding , will the real spiritual answer be opened up . Through the sin of Adam the life of man fell out of its high estate , where it was a vessel in which God made His power and blessedness to work , and fell under the power of this world , in which the god of this world has his rule and his dominion . And so man has become a creature possessed of a strange , unnatural , worldly life . The will of God , and heaven , and holiness , for which he was created , have become darkened and lost to him .

" * ( John 17:21,23 ) <p> This soul-union was the glorious purpose in the heart of God for His people before the foundation of the world . It was the mystery hid from ages and generations . It was accomplished in the incarnation of Christ . It has been made known by the Scriptures . And it is realized as an actual experience by many of Gods dear children . <p> But not by all . It is true of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hard , but the eyes of many are too dim and their hearts too unbelieving , and they fail to grasp it . And it is for the very purpose of bringing them into the personal and actual realization of this , that the Lord is stirring up believers everywhere at the present time to abandon themselves to Him , that He may work in them all the good pleasure of His will . <p> All the previous steps in the Christian life lead up to this . The Lord has made us for it ; and until we have intelligently apprehended it , and have voluntarily consented to embrace it , the travail of His soul for us is not satisfied , nor have our hearts found their destined and final rest . <p> The usual course of Christian experience is pictured in the history of the disciples . First they were awakened to see their condition and their need , and they came to Christ and gave in their allegiance to Him . Then they followed Him , worked for Him , believed in Him ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up one above the other ; running away from the cross ; misunderstanding His mission and His words ; forsaking their Lord in time of danger ; but still sent out to preach , recognized by Him as His disciples , possessing power to work for Him . They knew Christ only " after the flesh , " as outside of them , their Lord and Master , but not yet their Life . <p> Then came Pentecost , and these disciples came to know Him as inwardly revealed ; as one with them in actual union , their very indwelling Life . Henceforth He was to them Christ within , working in them to will and to do of His good pleasure ; delivering them by the law of the Spirit of His life from the bondage to the law of sin and death , under which they had been held . No longer was it between themselves and Him , a war of wills and a clashing of interest . One will alone animated them , and that was His will . One interest alone was dear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with Him . <p> And surely all can recognize this picture , though perhaps as yet the final stage of it has not been fully reached . You may have left much to follow Christ , dear reader ; you may have believed on him , and worked for Him , and loved Him , and yet may not be like Him . Allegiance you know , and confidence you know , but not yet union . There are two wills , two interests , two lives . You have not yet lost your own life that you may live only in His . Once it was " I and not Christ " ; then it was " I and Christ " ; perhaps now it is even " Christ and I. " But has it come yet to be " Christ only , and not I at all " ? <p> Perhaps you do not understand what this oneness means . Some people think it consists in a great emotion or a wonderful feeling of oneness , and they turn inward to examine their emotions , thinking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of their interior union with God . But nowhere is the mistake of trusting to feelings greater than here . <p> Oneness with Christ must , in the very nature of things , consists in a Christ-like life and character . It is not what we feel , but what we are that settles the question . No matter how exalted or intense our emotions on the subject may be , if there is not a likeness of character with Christ , a unity of aim and purpose , a similarity of thought and of action , there can be no real oneness . <p> This is plain common-sense , and it is Scriptural as well . <p> We speak of two people being one , and we mean that their purposes , and actions , and thoughts , and desires are alike . A friend may pour out upon us enthusiastic expressions of love , and unity and oneness , but if that friends aims , and actions , and ways of looking at things are exactly opposite to ours , we can not feel there is any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another . To be truly one with another , we must have the same likes and dislikes , the same joys and sorrows , the same hopes and fears . As someone says , " We must look through one anothers eyes , and think with one anothers brains . " This is , as I said above , only plain commonsense . <p> And oneness with Christ can be judged by no other rule . It is out of the question to be one with Him in any other way than in the way of nature , and character , and life . Unless we are Christ-like in our thoughts and our ways , we are not one with Him , no matter how we feel . <p> I have seen Christians , with hardly one Christ-like attribute in their whole characters , who yet were so emotional and had such ecstatic feelings of love for Christ , as to think themselves justified in claiming the closest oneness with Him . I scarcely know a sadder sight . Surely our Lord meant to reach is in heaven . " * ( Matthew 7:21 ) He was not making here any arbitrary statement of Gods will , but a simple announcement of the nature of things . Of course it must be so . It is like saying , " No man can enter the ranks of astronomers who is not an astronomer . " Emotions will not make a man an astronomer , but life and action . He must be one , not merely feel that he is one . <p> There is no escape from this inexorable nature of things , and especially here . Unless we are one with Christ as to character and life and action , we can not be one with Him in any other way , for there is no other way . We must be " partakers of His nature " * ( 2 Peter 1:4 ) or we can not be partakers of His life , for His life and His nature are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . They feel so near Christ and so united to Him , that they think it must be real ; and overlooking the absolute necessity of Christ-likeness of character and walk , they are building their hopes and their confidence on their delightful emotions and exalted feelings , and think they must be one with Him , or they could not have such rich and holy experiences . <p> Now it is a psychological fact that these or similar emotions can be produced by other causes than a purely divine influence , and that they are largely dependent upon temperament and physical conditions . It is most dangerous , therefore , to make them a test of our spiritual union with Christ . It may result in just such a grievous self-deception as our Lord warns against in Luke 6:46-49 , " And why call ye me , Lord , Lord , and do not the things which I say ? " Our soul delights perhaps in calling Him , " Lord , Lord , " but are we doing the things which He said ? for this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . <p> If , therefore , led by our feelings , we are saying in meetings , or among our friends , or even in our own heart before the Lord , that we are abiding in Him , let us take home to ourselves in solemn consideration these words of the Holy Ghost , " He that saith he abideth in him ought himself so to walk , even as he walked . " * ( 1 John 2:6 ) <p> Unless we are thus walking , we can not possibly be abiding in Him , no matter how much we may feel as if we were . <p> If you are really one with Christ you will be sweet to those who are cross to you ; you will bear everything and make no complaints ; when you are reviled you will not revile again ; you will consent to be trampled on , as Christ was , and feel nothing but love in return ; you will seek the honor of others rather than your own ; you will take the lowest place , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will literally and truly love your enemies and do good to them that despitefully use you ; you will , in short , live a Christ-like life , and manifest outwardly as well as feel inwardly a Christ-like spirit , and will walk among men as He walked among them . This , dear friends , is what it is to be one with Christ . And if all this is not your life according to your measure , then you are not one with Him , no matter how ecstatic or exalted your feelings may be . <p> To be one with Christ is too wonderful and solemn and mighty an experience to be reached by any overflow or exaltation of mere feeling . He was holy , and those who are one with Him will be holy also . There is no escape from this simple and obvious fact . <p> When our Lord tried to make us understand His oneness with God , He expressed it in such words as these , " I do always those things that please him . " * ( John 8:29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The Son can do nothing of Himself , but what He seeth the Father do : for what things soever He doeth , these also doeth the Son likewise . " * the Father which hath sent me. " * ( John 5:30 ) " If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not . But if I do , though ye believe not me , believe the works : that ye may know , and believe , that the Father is in me , and I in him . " * ( John 10:37-38 ) <p> The test of oneness then , was the doing of the same works , and it is the test of oneness now . And if our Lord could say of Himself that if He did not the works of his Father , He did not ask to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might make , surely His disciples must do no less . <p> It is forever true in the nature of things that " A good tree can not bring forth evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit . " * ( Matthew 7:18 ) It is not that they will not , but they can not . And a soul that is one with Christ will just as surely bring forth a Christ-like life , as a grapevine will bring forth grapes and not thistles . <p> Not that I would be understood to object to emotions . On the contrary , I believe they are very precious gifts , when they are from God , and are to be greatly rejoiced in . But what I do object to is the making them a test or proof of spiritual states , either in ourselves or others , and depending on them as the foundation of our faith . Let them come or let them go , just as God pleases , and make no account of them either way . But always see to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the marks of likeness in character , and life , and walk , are ours , and all we are in him . " * ( 1 John 2:4-5 ) <p> It may be , my dear reader , that the grief of your life has been the fact that you have so few good feelings . You try your hardest to get up the feelings which you hear others talking about , but they will not come . You pray for them fervently , and are often tempted to upbraid God because He does not grant them to you . And you are filled with an almost unbearable anguish because you think your want of emotion is a sign that there is not any interior union of your soul with Christ . You judge altogether by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to judge . <p> Now my advice to you is to let your feelings go , and pay no regard to them whatever . They really have nothing to do with the matter . They are not the indicators of your spiritual state , but are merely the indicators of your temperament , or of your present physical condition . People in very low states of grace are often the subjects of very powerful emotional experiences . We all know this from the scenes we have heard of or witnessed at camp-meetings and revivals . I myself had a colored servant once who would become unconscious under the power of her wonderful experiences , whenever there was a revival meeting at their church , who yet had hardly a token of any spiritual life about her at other times , and who was , in fact , not even moral . Now surely , if the Bible teaches nothing else , it does teach this , that a Christ-like life and walk must accompany any experience which is really born of His Spirit . It could not be otherwise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians have separated the two things so entirely in their conceptions , as to have exalted their experiences at the expense of their walk , and have come to care far more about their emotions than about their character . <p> A certain colored congregation in one of the Southern states was a plague to the whole neighborhood by their open disregard of even the ordinary rules of morality ; stealing , and lying , and cheating , without apparently a single prick of conscience on the subject . And yet their nightly meetings were times of the greatest emotion and " power . " Someone finally spoke to the preacher about it , and begged him to preach a sermon on morality , which would lead his people to see their sins . " Ah , missus , " he replied , " I knows deys bad , but den it always brings a coldness like over de meetings when I preaches about dem things . " <p> You are helpless as to your emotions , but character you can have if you will . You can be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are Christ-like , then you are one with Him in the only vital and essential way , even though your feelings may tell you that it is an impossibility . <p> Having thus settled what oneness with Christ really is , the next point for us to consider is how to reach it for ourselves . <p> We must first of all find out what are the facts in the case , and what is our own relation to these facts . <p> If you read such dwelleth in you ? " and then look at the opening of the chapter to see to whom these wonderful words are spoken , even to " babes in Christ , " who were " yet carnal , " * ( 1 Corinthians 3:1-3 ) and walked according to man , you will see that this soul-union of which I speak , this unspeakably glorious mystery of an indwelling God is the possession of even the weakest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a new thing you are to ask for , but only to realize that which you already have . Of every believer in the Lord Jesus it is absolutely true , that his body is the temple of the Holy Ghost , which is in him , which he has of God ( 1 Corinthians 6:19 ) . <p> It seems to me just in this way ; as though Christ were living in a house , shut up in a far-off closet , unknown and unnoticed by the dwellers in the house , longing to make Himself known to them and be one with them in all their daily lives , and share in all their interests , but unwilling to force Himself upon their notice ; as nothing but a voluntary companionship could meet or satisfy the needs of His love . The days pass by over that favored household , and they remain in ignorance of their marvellous privilege . They come and go about all their daily affairs with no thought of their wonderful Guest . Their plans are laid without reference to Him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are all lost to them . Lonely days and weeks are spent in sadness , which might have been full of the sweetness of His presence . <p> But suddenly the announcement is made , " The Lord is in the house ! " <p> How will its owner receive the intelligence ? Will he call out an eager thanksgiving , and throw wide open every door for the entrance of his glorious Guest ? Or will he shrink and hesitate , afraid of His presence and seek to reserve some private corner for a refuge from His all-seeing eye ? <p> Dear friend , I make the glad announcement to thee that the Lord is in thy heart . Since the day of thy conversion He has been dwelling there , but thou hast lived on in ignorance of it .

Do you understand the words , " one with Christ " ? Do you catch the slightest glimpse of their marvellous meaning ? Does not your whole soul begin to exult over such a wondrous destiny ? For it is a reality . It means to have no life but His life , to have no will but His will , to have no interests but His interests , to share His riches , to enter into His joys , to partake of His sorrows , to manifest His life , to have the same mind as He had , to think , and feel , and act , and walk as He did .

Canst thou say a willing " Yes , " to thy Lord ? <p> It is such a simple transaction , and yet so real ! The steps are but three . First , be convinced that the Scriptures teach this glorious indwelling of thy God ; then surrender thy whole being to Him to be possessed by Him ; and finally believe that He has taken possession , and is dwelling in thee .

@@72205453 @905453/ <h> How , and gave himself for me. " * ( Galatians 2:20 ) <p> If we allow our faith to be molded by the words of Scripture , and by the illumination of the Holy Spirit , instead of a narrow human theology , we will be clearly convinced that there is need for a real death to self . There are many manifestations of the self life which are not clearly sinful , but neither are they truly Christlike . When the Spirit is given room to illuminate the heart , this middle zone of self activity will be seen as something which must be passed beyond or crucified in order to reach deep abiding union with God , where there is none of self and all of Christ Jesus . Those who deny that such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who demonstrate in many ways their need of being dead to self . I am writing this not for those who have any theory to maintain , but for the humble and simple-hearted saints who really hunger to sink out of self into God . <p> First I will caution against a few false notions as to how to die to self . <p> One false notion is the conceiving of a wrong hatred of ourselves . The more we are divinely illuminated , the more minutely and astonishingly do we realize the great blindness , foolishness , and meanness of our past lives . Unless we are kept very mellow and subdued , this sight of our meanness may tempt us to form a bitter , revengeful feeling toward ourselves . Under such an impression , we may feel like punishing ourselves in some way , or by making unscriptural and rash vows . This is the source of cruel and deceptive penances . <p> A similar false notion is the choosing of some line of mortification for ourselves , selecting some particular cross . This will defeat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of our will in all things . The very act of choosing a cross for ourselves keeps alive our own preferences and furnishes a secret nourishment to self-willa little place for self to live under the very pretext of dying to self . <p> Likewise , another erroneous view is that we can sink to a deeper death by overwork , throwing ourselves into a task beyond our ability . But even if the extra work be of the most religious kind , still it supplies a field for self-activity . It is in this respect that Paul speaks of persons under a false zeal , going to every extreme of self-imposed poverty , and even burning at the stake , yet all under the principle of self-action , rather than the complete relinquishment of self which is caused by being entirely possessed by divine love . <p> In the opposite direction we find another false notion which says that we are to calmly leave ourselves to the mere law of development . If we can only be kept from well-defined sins , we are not to tax ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a diligent attention to growth . I am afraid this is the danger that the majority drift into . And those with such views are the least likely to seek the sure way . <p> But now let us face the real questionhow to die to self , and let Christ be all and all in us . In the first place , do we really believe such a state is attainable ? Have we looked at the blessed Christ until we have obtained a clear conception of what it is to lose ourselves in union with Him ? Have our spiritual eyes surveyed this blessed possibility , until its attainability in this life has become a settled conviction with us ? Then have we calmly , deeply , irreversibly settled it that there shall be none of self and all of Christ ? Are we prepared to make that the motto of our lives ? Do we think it , dream it , pray it , breathe it , drink of it , bathe ourselves in it , until it becomes a subtle , steady , all-prevailing passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As we tread this golden shore , let us go slow and walk softly on these shining sands ; let us not launch out in those fathomless waters without duly counting the cost and without ample ballast in our ships . If we have determined to make this celestial excursion entirely out of self into the depths of the divine nature , let us remember that the first step toward this perfect death is to have a pure divine motive , and that motive must be nothing less than the ever-blessed triune God Himself . That is , it must be the seeking of God as our all and in all , our last end , our exceeding great reward , so that it will be for His glory , His beauty , and His praise , through us and by us , and that we have no desire to exist except as a channel for His outflow , a chosen vessel for the embodiment of His life , and the outbeaming of His glorious attributes through us . The deepest death to self lies in the motives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but a capacity for Christ to live in , lies at the foundation of the death of self , and the highest life of Christ . With this pure motive fixed in the heart , we are to habitually and willingly accept of every occasion for humiliation and self-abasement , which Gods providence brings to us . While on the one hand we are neither to make or seek a cross , on the other hand we are to sweetly and willingly accept of every blow , or mortification , or inconvenience , or painful annoyance , which comes to us in the order of Gods providential will . Humiliation is the very quintessence of the Christ-life , and we must appreciate every opportunity of sinking into humility . Hence , when reproaches , unkind treatment , poverty , loneliness , persecution , mental distresses , seeming failure in our work , disappointments , deep perplexities , or any disagreeable thing comes to us , if we are in a state of divine recollection , we will calmly face these things as appropriate occasions for losing our own will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In these humiliations we can thus be more delicately and firmly knit to the will of God . <p> Another effectual method of dying to self is to be exceedingly careful not to receive human honors or praise into our hearts . If we are worthy of having enemies , who will seek opportunities of humiliating us , we will also have some friends who will love and honor us . As a rule , the more bitter our enemies become , the stronger our friends will love us , and there will be times when we will be honored in spite of ourselves . But if we open our hearts to receive this honor and in our thoughts feed upon it as a social honey , or if we allow human praise to inflate our thoughts , it will instantly breed a human self-esteem , and this becomes a hotbed of the self-life . It requires great humiliation and divine reconciliation for evangelists , preachers , teachers , singers , and writers , not to lose the Christ-life at this point . <p> Another step in the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unsophisticated and unembellished . We should strive to be simple of manner , word , dress , taste , and experience . Self naturally feeds on complexity and things grand and large and loud , but Christ is the very embodiment of divine and eternal simplicity . The deeper we sink into the Christ-life , the more we become disappointing to the people ; our talents or learning will not show off to such fine advantage . We talk less , we live more quietly and privately , our labors are less ostentatious . We do more hard fighting with fewer dress-parades . We bring things to pass through prayers and faith in God more than by outward showy methods . We love to live like God , a profound hidden life , in which people think we do n't  amount to very much . This is one of the tests of sinking out of self . <p> Another step in the death of self is the living more keenly by pure faith , a faith that depends less on spiritual phenomena , but which clearly apprehends that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Realizing that every atom of our lives is in the grasp of His will , and that by a perpetual act of entire abandonment we are by the simple act of believing most blessedly united in the deep of our being to the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit . <p> Whenever we enter a new and higher region in the Christ-life , there will be some distinguished marks of grace , some memorable and blessed manifestations of the Holy Spirit , working within us . This may come in the shape of conscious fullness , or a flow of sweetness , or spoken words , or bright mental illuminations , or prophetic premonitions , or abounding joy ; some gracious phenomena , which will serve as a memorial , or a spiritual landmark . But to linger too much on these things , or to rest on them , will furnish a refined nourishment of the self-life . Hence the deepest conformity to Jesus will lead us to be weaned from ecstasies and bright inward lights . These are very essential in their place , but to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the path to the deepest death of self . <p> Another aspect of dying to self is to thoughtfully avoid making our religious life an unnecessary burden , or cross , or tax , to our families and loved ones . Sometimes those who want to be real Christ-like , for lack of wisdom , adopt some mode of life , or devotion , or theory of sanctity , which is a source of positive peevishness and disagreeableness to those with whom they live . This is exactly opposite to Christ , and feeds self instead of killing it . We should seek to be yielding and pliant , obliging and accommodating . In all non-essentials , where a well-defined principle of right is not involved , we must surrender our little choices and tastes and ease , for the well-pleasing and gratification of others . " Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love ; in honour preferring one another . " * ( Romans 12:10 ) To be rigid and stubborn on non-essentials is simply self-righteousness , a stronghold of self . <p> Lastly , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God . This is to become a daily habit of our motives and intentions , to distrust ourselves , to ignore our own wisdom , but to look to Christ for the most minute guidance that we may be one in all things . <p> Some may misunderstand this direction , thinking it leads beyond a Bible experience . Yes , it is possible to be led astray by other spirits , and Satan has traps to entice the souls that hunger for God . But if our eyes are upon Jesus , and our ears are open to the sound counsel of the Holy Spirit , He will not let us be satisfied with anything other than Himself . 
@@72205457 @905457/ <h> The Destruction of the Carnal Nature in Sanctification <p> We have seen the entrance of the sin nature into the world and have taken note of its devastating effect and influence in the lives of all . Realizing that the nature is born in the heart of all and it always leads us into sin and wrong and that it will continue to cause us difficulty even in our Christian life so long as it continues to live in our hearts , it must be evident unto all that mans nature must be changed before he can do the will of God as God wanted him to . That is exactly what takes place in sanctificationthe change of the inner nature . One who is sanctified is a partaker of His divine nature ( 2 Peter 1:4 ) . The old nature of sin is destroyed in the process of sanctification and the divine nature or likeness of God is reinstated in the heart . We read , " That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man carnal nature or sin principle . And put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is created in righteousness and true holiness . " * ( Ephesians 4:22-24 ) Again we read , " Ye have put off the old man with his deeds actual transgressions or committed sins and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him . " * ( Colossians 3:9-10 ) ( This is the image of God in which man was created and is now restored to him through sanctification . ) The words of David , " He restoreth my soul , " * ( Psalm 23:3 ) well sums up the glorious work of complete sanctification in restoring the soul to the image and likeness of God which was lost to all men by the transgression of changed into the same image the image of God from glory the first glory of justification in sins forgiven to glory the second glory of sanctification in the sin principle being destroyed and the divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of the Lord . " * ( 2 Corinthians 3:18 ) Note that all these texts set forth a change of condition and nature in the individual . <p> " And now also the ax is laid unto the root of the trees . " * ( Matthew 3:10 ) Just before this statement , John the Baptist had been telling some to bring forth " fruits meet for repentance , " * ( Matthew 3:5-9 ) etc . He then said , " And now also signifying something in addition to repentance and the things connected with it the ax is laid unto the root of the tree . " Up to the coming of Christ there was provision made according to the law for men to make certain sacrifices and their sins would be forgiven , but there was no power in these to reach the soul and effect any change there , so a remembrance of sins was made again every year ( Hebrews 10:3 ) . They had just been pruning off the branches , but the root which brought forth the fruit , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " * ( Hebrews 12:15 ) sin principle ) was not effected by this and continued to produce the fruits of sin and bitterness in their lives , and sacrifices had to be made again and again in order for them to be forgiven . Jesus came , striking right directly at the root ( the principle of sin in the heart ) . " That he might sanctify cleanse the heart from the sin nature the people with his own blood , he suffered without the gate . " * ( Hebrews 13:12 ) One can go out and cut sprouts all day , but if the roots are left they just produce another crop of sprouts and it must soon be done all over again . But if the roots are destroyed , it will not come with another crop of sprouts . So it is with the sin principle . If we must continually sin and repent , sin and repent , it is just the producing of more sprouts . But , thanks be unto God , there is a better and more victorious life than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world for the express purpose of destroying the root or sin principle out of mens hearts and giving them a new heart and a new spirit , and putting His spirit in them to cause them to walk in His statutes and keep His judgments and do them ( Ezekiel 36:25-27 ) so that not only are our sins forgiven , but the actual power of sin is destroyed out of the heart and life by the taking away of the carnal nature . Then " sin shall not have dominion over you the power is broken : for you are not under the law , but under grace . " * ( Romans 6:14 ) Paul says , " Knowing this , that our old man is crucified ( put to death ) with him , that the body of sin sin nature might be destroyed , that henceforth we should not serve sin . " * ( Romans 6:6 ) <p> Jesus " gave himself for us that he might redeem us. " * ( Titus 2:14 ) Now what does it mean to redeem a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy back " ; but when a thing is redeemed it is just as free from debt as it was before any debt was placed on it . Were you to borrow $500.00 on your home and give a mortgage to cover the amount , you could not have that mortgage released when you had only paid $450.00 or even $475.00 ; but the full $500.00 must be paid and the property just as free from debt as before the mortgage was placed on it . That is what it means to redeem . Paul said , " I am carnal , sold under sin . " * ( Romans 7:14 ) Why was he " sold under sin " ? His own answer was because " I am carnal . " In other words , he possessed from infancy and by inheritance a carnal nature which gave the devil an advantage and a mortgage on his soul . For this same reason the devil has a mortgage on every soul . The sin nature gives him that advantage . Then to merely forgive ones sins , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redemption , for the carnality that sold us under sin and placed us under mortgage to the devil is still in the heart . The good news that I bring to you is that Christ paid the full debt and fully redeems the souls of His people and so completely destroys the sin nature and restores the nature of God to the soul by His sanctifying grace that man is just as free from sin , not only in practice , but also in nature as he was when God first made him in His own image . That is complete redemption . <p> But , some question , if the carnal nature is actually removed , how could it ever get back into ones heart again ? They reason that it is not destroyed but merely subdued . The carnal nature is not destroyed out of the world , but only out of those hearts that are yielded to God . That principle still accompanies sin in every form and in every place it is found , and if one yields to sin again after they have been delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heart .

The branch , that it may not be detached from the vine , must feed upon the vine . The soul , to abide in Jesus , must feast upon His Word . Dear young man , if you value your souls spiritual welfare , and the highest enjoyment in the world to come , feed daily upon the living Word . Do not read it and believe it only as a matter of history , but hold it before your heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 : It is the secret of prayer . <p> Not many realize this . They are having difficulty to pray free and joyously as they would like , and they wonder what is the cause . Very probably they have not been feeding on the Word of Christ . The bringing of the Word into the heart kindles the spirit of prayer . A soul well-fed on the living words of Jesus will pray of itself . It walks , breathes , lives in a spirit of prayer . As you open your Bible in the stillness of the early morning and some gracious promise meets your eye , it awakens a prayer in your heart . Or it may be a word of command , and immediately your soul will rise to God imploring His grace . Or it may be a word of warning that is brought to your heart , which will stir the soul to seek a greater refuge in Christ . Or it may be a word bringing hope of a blessed immortality with Jesus , which will gladden the heart with the prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God as revealed in His Word is mighty in prayer . <h> 3 : It is the secret of peace . <p> The Word of God is a word of peace . Those who love His law have great peace . To hearken to the commands of the Lord is to have peace like a river . If your heart is troubled , turn in faith to some promise , and sweet peace will come stealing in , quieting every wave . When there is a raging storm on the sea of life , turn to the blessed Bible and you will hear a voice saying , " Peace , be still . " * ( Mark 4:39 ) <h> 4 : It is the purified seven times .

The life that flows from a heart in which the Word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that is well stored with the Word of God is not troubled with vain and impure thoughts . <h> 5 : It is the secret of strength . <p> Would you be strong , young man or young woman , to resist temptation and keep your soul a conqueror over sin , the world , Satan , and self ? Then feed your heart daily on the Word of God . Jesus met the tempter with the Word . There is power in the gospel of Christ . There is power to make you an overcomer in all the battles of life . Oh , how our heart has been made to weep at beholding the weakness of many of Gods children . Some are too weak to testify in public , or to pray , or teach a Sunday School class . A few good feedings upon the Word of God will put strength in them . Your power to do the work of God is in proportion to your feeding on the words of Christ . <h> 6 : It is the secret of perception . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path of life , read the Bible very much . It will be a light to guide your feet . In these days we need to keep a keen spiritual perception . Keep Christ in view . Keep heaven in view . Keep your title to a mansion in the skies where you can read it clearly . We are exhorted to have spiritual understanding ( Colossians 1:9 ) . The way to have it is to hide Gods Word in the heart . If you will give yourself to daily thought and prayerful meditation on the Word of Christ , you will have better understanding of spiritual things than many theologians . Never can man , with all his intellectual capacity , have spiritual understanding by judging from things natural . <h> 7 : It is the secret of guidance . <p> There are many by-paths and pitfalls lying close along the path of life . We need the guidance of the blessed Bible . A certain pastor said to a young sister that there was no harm in going to see a certain show in a theater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart that reads differently .

There are mountains of difficulties on the left hand and deep pitfalls on the right hand , but her pathway lies straight between . By her following the Bible , she will keep clear from both . Read and meditate much in the law of the Lord and you will be kept from the by-paths of worldliness and sin . <h> 8 : It is the secret of spiritual growth . <p> " As newborn babes , desire the sincere milk of the word , that ye may grow thereby .

Upon taking up the Book to read , lift your heart to God for a moment imploring the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit . <p> Yield the whole heart to God ; open the door wide that the truth might enter in . <p> Meditate on each text . Is it a warning ? If so , do I heed it ? Is it a command ? If so , do I obey it ? Is it a promise ? If so , do I believe it and fully rely upon it ? Does it teach some heart experience ?

She then related several instances wherein God had answered her prayers . One of these instances I will relate . Her provisions were daily growing more scanty . The flour was almost gone . She went again and again in prayer to God . One morning she baked the last of the flour and knew not where bread for her and her childrens dinner was to be had , only her trust was in the God that miraculously fed Elijah . Before noon a boy brought her a bag of wheat . This was taken to the mill and exchanged for flour , and thus God supplied their needs . As she related this simple story of Gods love and goodness to her , He became dearer and more precious to our hearts and we were reminded again how blessed it is to trust Him . Such sweet stories of Gods gracious dealings with His trusting children lift our souls heavenward until we feel more as if we were in heaven than on earth . <p> One autumn day I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two months before and whom I had not seen since the meeting . She met me at the door with a hearty , " Praise the Lord ! " There was heavenly music in her voice . When we were seated , she began to tell me of Gods goodness to her since her conversion . Her soul had been full of joy ; day and night she had sung praises to God . She had made her wrongs right . Among her wrongs to make right was a small sum of money she owed to a jewelry firm . But she could in no way obtain their address , as some years had gone by since the jewelry had been sent her from some firm in a distant city . Being unable to obtain the address , she sent the money to a minister to help in the work of God . Once she longed to go to a certain meeting ; but her husband said if it rained that day so he could not get a certain piece of work done , he could not take her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainy , her faith staggered not . She told God of her love to Him and of her love to His people ; she told Him how she longed to go to meeting . She then asked God to disperse the clouds and to stay the rain so that her husband might get his work done . In a few moments the sun was shining out clear and bright , and it did not rain . <p> At this juncture a tramp peddler came to the door . She invited him to a seat and went on at once telling me of the goodness of God to her . She said she prayed three times every day for her husbands salvation . At one time he was away from home for a few days upon the sea . On Sunday morning at ten oclock she asked God to convict him of his sins , to make him uneasy , and to give him a deep concern for his soul . When he came home , she asked him whether he had had any concern about his soul while he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sunday morning . All this time the peddler sat there listening to the story of Gods goodness to her , he seeing no opportunity to show his goods . <p> As I saw her simplicity , innocency , and childlike confidence in God , I thought , " I would rather have her humble station in life and her knowledge of God than to be the president of our nation . " Oh , how we delight to be in the company of those who have hearts full of love to God and never weary in talking of His righteousness ! Such conversation bears our souls upward and onward and makes us more like God . This world fades farther and farther away , and we approach nearer and nearer the gates of glory . <p> If you desire a closer walk with God , seek the companionship of those who are spiritually minded and who live where the heavenly breezes blow and where the fragrance of Christian graces perfume the air . Oh , that I could help the reader to feel in his soul the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could help him to see the deep truth contained in the following words ! As tobacco-users and whiskey drinkers so deaden their sense of taste that they become unable to tell by it whether the meat they are eating is beef or mutton or whether the jelly is apple or peach , so they whose minds are stayed on earthly things and whose conversation is of the things of the world so benumb their souls that they lose the spiritual sense of taste or that delicacy of moral perception which enables those who walk with God to have such sweet tastes of His love . I have seen those who would sit and sleep while someone talked of how God hears and answers prayers and of how real He is in all the common affairs of everyday life , but who as soon as a conversation was begun about earthly things were wide awake and ready to join in the conversation . Shame on such a professed Christianity ! <p> God has the sweets that tempt the Christians soul . He has those things that delight us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of eternal life ; He has rest ; He has peace ; He has love ; He has all for which our souls pant or hunger . Oh , how the Christians soul clings to God ! He is the fountain of life . He has the sweet viands that delight it and satisfy all its longings . Nothing satisfies the Christians heart but God . As the child shrinks back from the poisonous reptile , so the Spirit-filled soul shrinks back from the world . As your little child clings tightly to your hand while you walk near the cage of wild beasts , so the Christian clings closely to God as he sees the allurements of this world . <p> It is the sweet life of Jesus that fills us with such ecstatic joys , such unspeakable glory . A thousand deaths would be preferable to separation from Christ . The martyr at the stake freely gives up life ; he will not part with Christ . Christ is more than life . The martyrs whole soul is aflame with the love of God and the flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are flowing so deeply through his soul that he hardly feels the flames that are devouring his physical being . The glory of God filling the soul counteracts pain and makes death bearable . I am persuaded that Stephen , who saw the heavens open , felt but little of the pains of death by stoning . One bitter cold night your humble servant had fifteen miles to go after preaching . The glory of God so filled his soul that he felt not the cold ; otherwise he would have suffered greatly . This was a precious lesson and gave valuable knowledge of God . <p> He who has tasted of salvation and those graces that flow out from God looks over all earth , heaven , and hell and says : " These contain nothing that can separate me from the object of my hearts fond love . The world has its trials and tribulations and may pour them out with a vengeance upon my head ; they shall not separate me from God . The distresses , the persecutions , the famines , the nakedness , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limit of their power , they can not move me . Hell , with all its threatening horrors , can not alarm me . Evil spirits can not seduce nor discourage my soul . I am lost in the love of God . Should the love of angels be turned to jealousy , I will cling to Jesus . Nothing in life , nothing in death , the height of heaven , nor the depth of hell , with all the creatures they contain , shall be able to separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus . " Thus sings the soul that is drinking at the fountain of heavens eternal love . <p> The fervent in spirit are fully satisfied with their close walk with God today , but they want a closer walk with Him tomorrow . As the hart pants after the water brooks , so pant their soul after God . This is not the experience of one seeking after salvation . It is the experience of the saint all along his Christian way . I find two classes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those who are rich in the grace of God and full of spiritual life are satisfied . They desire more of God ; their souls have appetite for God and for His word , but they are never dissatisfied . It is not hungering for bread that makes man dissatisfied . It is blessed to become hungry , because it makes the eating enjoyable . The man that has no appetite is the one who does the complaining . He is not satisfied with the most delicious foods . The hungry man eats with a relish and thanks God for a good appetite . Do you not often feel your soul thirstirig after God ? Do you not feel heart-hunger for prayer and the Word ? Do you not feel an eagerness to meet with the saints of God ? Do you not hunger and thirst after righteousness ? This good appetite is indicative of good spiritual health . No appetite for these things is unmistakable evidence of spiritual disease . Another class of religious people who are seemingly satisfied are those who are poor and naked and blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have need of nothing . They are like the small boy that danced for joy because he imagined himself taking sweetmeats from his empty pocket and eating them . Some people imagine themselves rich in the grace of God and are happy in their imagination . <p> The true Christians life is one of constant growth in grace . True followers of Christ are ever becoming more spiritual . They are drawing unto the perfect day . " * ( Proverbs 4:18 ) The Spirit of God in the heart of man is represented by a fruit-bearing tree . The fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , gentleness , longsuffering , goodness , meekness , temperance , faith , etc . Can these fruits be increased in our hearts and life ? There is but one answer : they can . All along our Christian journey we are to abound more and more in love ; we are to grow stronger in faith ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more meek and humble and to have more patience and be more gentle . The horticulturist increases the fruit of the trees of his orchard by cultivating and developing the tree . He cultivates , not the fruit , but the tree . The tree in our hearts is the Spirit of God . To increase the fruits of the Spirit , we must develop the tree . The true and successful Christian life is one of constant progress . <p> Some people seem to experience some alarm when we begin to talk about growth in grace or gaining a closer walk with God . They fear we will become fanatical . No one is more opposed to fanaticism than the ardent advocates of Christian development , for nothing is a greater hindrance to such development . But facts are facts . We can not but acknowledge that the true and proper Christian life is one of constant growth . <p> Causes produce effects . To become more spiritual is the effect of a cause . There is a law of growth and development in all life . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in other words , growth is but the effect , or the result , of complying with certain causes . This is true in both the physical and the spiritual life . In order for the child to develop its physical life and powers , it must eat , drink , exercise , sleep , breathe , etc . It is not enough for the child to know and say , " I must eat and drink , that I may live and grow " ; but it must put in actual practice what it knows . It is trueand how good God is to have made us so ! that the child is given an instinct that inclines it to eat and to exercise . <p> We meet the law of growth naturally and without taking thought because God has given us appetites and desires that lead us to the performance of the things requisite to growth . I said we naturally and without taking thought meet the requirements for growth because God has given us appetites that incline us to these things ; but God has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control the appetite to the best good of the physical development . Small children do not have this intelligence , but the intelligence of the parents should answer for the child . The very thing God has given us for our development may prove the most disastrous to it if it is not kept in proper bounds . He who sits down to his table and eats for the mere purpose of satisfying his appetite acts brutishly . <p> The laws respecting the physical life find an analogy in the spiritual life . There is a law of growth and development in the spiritual world . There is also a law which governs the law of growth , or in other words , our growth in grace is but the result of our complying with certain requisites . Cause produces effect . It is folly to expect developments in animal life if the law governing that development is not observed . It is as great folly to expect growth in grace if the law governing the growth in grace is not observed . <p> " As newborn babes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may grow thereby . " * ( 1 Peter 2:2 ) The Greek adds " unto salvation . " Growth unto eternal salvation is the consequence of living upon the sincere milk of the word . Here is cause and effect . Do not expect the effect without the cause . It is at this point that some experience alarm . They fear an over-exertion . No amount of worry , anxiety , or trying will promote growth . The child does not grow by trying . It does not worry about its growing . But it does eat . I am saying nothing more than this here : if you grow in grace you must eat . An established law declares you must . Some teach that we have nothing to do with our spiritual development . To prove their assertion they refer us to the beautiful lesson of the growing of the lily , which neither toils nor spins . In the lesson of the lily Christ is teaching us , not about our spiritual development , but about the care God has for our temporal life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must eat . <p> " But if we are saved , do we not naturally desire the sincere milk of the word ? " <p> I have said nothing to the contrary . I have only said that we must desire the sincere milk of the word , that we may grow thereby . <p> " But is it not true that we sometimes may have a keener appetite for the sincere word than at others and a greater relish for prayer ? " <p> Encourage your appetite by eating . Select some delicious foods , such as these : " I will never leave thee nor forsake thee . " * ( Hebrews 13:5 ) " Casting all your care upon him ; for he careth for you . " * ( 1 Peter 5:7 ) " He is able to keep you from falling . " * ( Jude 1:24 ) " No man is able to pluck you out of my Fathers hand . " * ( John 10:29 ) Such foods will revive you and whet up your appetite if you are not dead . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no relish for prayer . During the warm months of one summer I was accustomed to arise at midnight for prayer . One night there was a dull , morbid feeling upon me . I wrestled with God for some time , but lay down without getting any apparent blessing . When I awakened in the morning , heavens glory was streaming into my soul . I was then reaping the blessing of my midnight prayer . We may pray ofttimes and apparently receive very little benefit ; but it benefits us more than we are aware . It is our life . If we cease praying , we shall die . Many a time I have gone to prayer without any inspiration for prayer , but soon the inspiration would be given . I have gone into the pulpit likewise . <p> Regard not the feeling . Keep up the faith and do your duty . Make it a business to serve God . If you would have a closer walk with God , keep aloof from the world ; " abstain from fleshly lusts , which war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; avoid the company of the foolish talker ; stay your thoughts on God ; meditate on His law ; pray much and live on the word ; " refuse profane and old wives fables " * ( 1 Timothy 4:7 ) ; give no heed to the signs , the superstitions , and the foolish saying of the worldly-minded ; have no mind for such things ; take no interest and have no part in the neighborhood gossip , but " exercise thyself rather unto godliness " * ( 1 Timothy 4:7 ) ; attend to the things that will make you more godly ; have a conversation and have meditations that are edifying ; think upon the life of Christ ; search therein for the excellencies and the beautiful ; see the purity of His love and the tenderness of His care for you until the affections of your soul , like the magnetized needles , tremble with life and turn toward their object . The words of a learned writer are appropriate here : <p> It is an admitted principle that protracted and close attention always fixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the longer and more intensely the mind attends to any subject , other subjects proportionally lose their power to interest . The same is true in relation to the affections . The longer and more intensely we contemplate an object in that relation which is adapted to draw out the affections , the more deeply will the impression be made upon the heart as well as the memory . The most favorable circumstances possible to fix an impression deeply upon the heart and memory arefirst , that there should be protracted and earnest attention ; and second , that at the same time the impression is made , the emotions of the soul should be alive with excitement . Without these , an impression made upon the heart and the memory would be slight and easily effaced ; while on the contrary , an impression made during intense attention and excited feeling will be engraved , as with pen of steel upon the tablets of the soul . <p> On this I give a brief comment . The more attention we give to heavenly things and the more intently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our affections are drawn out to them , and the things of earth proportionably lose their power to attract us . The longer and more deeply we meditate upon Gods law and the beauty of His holiness , the more deeply the impression will be made upon us and the more we shall be like Him . The more earnest attention we give in contemplating the love of God to us in adopting us as sons ; the more our heart is touched by the scenes on Calvary ; the more vivid and real this is made to usthe deeper will be the impression made upon the tablets of our soul . O beloved , stand before the cross of Calvary and behold the love of Jesus for youdying , dying for you ; hear the groans of His agony ; see the deliverance from hell He has wrought for you through His death and unfathomable love . Stand and behold until all the emotions of your soul are alive with excitement . Stand and behold until the fleshly tables of your heart are made so soft and tender that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . A worldly conversation and worldly thoughts and the minding of earthly things harden the heart and cast a morbid feeling over the soul , making it incapable of receiving any imprint from heavenly things . <p> Fellow pilgrim to a heavenly home , if you desire the faith once delivered to the saints , you must " earnestly contend " * ( Jude 1:3 ) for it . If you desire a crown of life , you must " lay hold " * ( 1 Timothy 6:12,19 ) upon it . If you desire to run the Christian race successfully , you must " lay aside every weight , and the sin which doth so easily beset you . " * ( Hebrews 12:1 ) If you desire to obtain an incorruptible crown , you must " So run that ye may obtain . " * ( 1 Corinthians 9:24 ) Do you desire a closer walk with God ? Then " Draw nigh to God . " * ( James 4:8 ) Do you desire to gain heaven ? Then have a heart full of purpose and @ @ @ in Christ Jesus . " * ( Philippians 3:13-14 ) Let us who are in the Christian race " be thus minded . " * ( Philippians 3:15 ) <p> Make it a business to serve God . In Him live and move and have your being . Make Him the center . Everything in life should center in God . Whatever you do , do to His glory . Live in His presence . " Pray without ceasing " * ( 1 Thessalonians 5:17 ) ; guard against all attacks of the world ; keep a tender conscience toward God ; walk in the light of His countenance ; drink of the fountain of life daily ; cultivate feelings of reverence , devotion , and thanksgiving ; give no place to anything that will dull the finer sensibilities of your souldo these things , and you will be rewarded with a closer walk with God . 
@@72205467 @905467/ <h> Second <p> Modern tongues people claim all speak in tongues , as evidence of the reception of the baptism of the Holy Ghost , but the Bible says no . We will quote from the Greek and Emphatic Diaglott 1 Corinthians 12:29-30 : " All are not apostles , all are not prophets , all are not teachers , all are not powers , all have not gifts of cures , all do not speak in different languages , all do not interpret . " There were multitudes of people at Jerusalem who believed and were filled with the Holy Ghost , but mention is made of only one hundred and twenty of those on Pentecost who spoke in tongues . The language of Jesus in the commission gives no more ground for believing or supposing that every individual believer should speak with tongues , than for believing they should take up serpents , or lay hands on the sick for healing , or cast out devils . John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Ghost from his birth , but did not speak in tongues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongues , except it would be for some others benefit . Some say they do not seek the tongues , but they will not accept as the baptism of the Spirit any experience until the tongues come . Such a belief opens an avenue for deception , as they will not be satisfied with anything except it be accompanied by tongues , which makes it easy for the enemy to take advantage of them and give them a manifestation of muttering and jabbering , which they readily accept as the real gift of tongues . Now where are the texts which prove that tongues must in every instance accompany the baptism ? They are not in the Bible . They are to be found only in the deluded mind of man . We have record of three times only of the tongues in connection with the Holy Ghost , namely : <p> But it is supposed by some that because three times we find they spoke in tongues when the baptism was received , that in every case , when the baptism was received , they spoke in tongues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our argument on what is in the Bible rather than on what is omitted . <p> To illustrate , a certain good man went in a grove every day for secret prayer and for some time took a stone with him , putting it on a little pile of stones . Suppose that after awhile the little pile of stones ceased to grow as at first . Is there anything in that to prove the good man had quit going to pray in the grove ? Not a thing . Why not ? Because there is not an essential connection between the man and the stone . Now the fact that in three instances the speaking in tongues did accompany the Holy Ghost baptism , is no proof that tongues should accompany all baptisms . Jesus said of the Holy Ghost , " When he , the Spirit of truth is come , he will guide you into all truth . " * ( John 16:13 ) And in the 17th chapter He said to the Father , " Thy word is truth . " * ( John 17:17 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the truth , " therefore , is something that can be learned , is it not ? If not , why not ? As the Holy Ghost helps us to teach it and understand it . We are warned to not into the world .

" * ( Isaiah 8:19 ) Peeping and muttering mean indistinct , inarticulate talk , like the lowing of cattle , the bleating of sheep , or as Paul says , concerning inanimate things , " whether pipe or harp , except they give a distinction in the sounds , how shall it be known what is piped or harped ? " * ( 1 Corinthians 14:7 ) It would be unknown , " So likewise ye , except ye utter by the tongue language words easy to be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye shall speak into the air . " * ( 1 Corinthians 14:9 ) <p> The Biblical meaning of tongues , therefore , according to the Greek , the Emphatic Diaglott , or any other translation ( even the King James , when we consider that the " unknown " is in italics , which signifies a word supplied and not translated ) , is languages .

" * ( Jude 1:6 ) <p> These particular texts may be a little obscure and their true interpretation a little difficult to establish clearly , even to myself , in the light of all the other passages considered on this subject . However , this one thing I know : any given text of Scripture must be interpreted according to the general tenor of the overall teachings of the Scriptures on that subject . If any interpretation of a Scripture crosses or contradicts other plain texts on that subject , one can rest assured that something is wrong with his interpretation on that Scripture . To conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cast down to hell , would be to contradict the general tenor of Scripture as evidenced by the discussion of this number of other passages on this subject . Therefore , even if we may not clearly understand this particular passage and may be able to fully explain just what it does mean for sure , we know that it does not mean that . <p> But I will close by inserting an excerpt from the writings of Charles E. Orr which seems to me to be a reasonable and true interpretation of these passages : <h> 2 Peter 2:4-5 and Jude 1:6-7 <p> This has reference to Adam and Eve . They were cast out of Eden , their first estate . Notice that in the last two texts the writers are speaking of great wickedness or sin . Why should Peter start with sin in the eternal heaven and then go next to the wickedness in the days of Noah ? Why should he overlook the sin in Eden which plunged the world into sin ? We understand that Peter and Jude are talking about wickedness on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden and not sin among holy angels in heaven . The Bible is not a record of what is done in heaven , but what is done in earth . It is said in John 8:44 that the devil " was a murderer from the beginning . " In John 1:1 we are told that God was " in the beginning . " The word beginning is used here of both God and the devil , and is so used because of our finite minds being unable to grasp the fullness of eternity ; but this beginning reaches back into eternity beyond beginning . <p> Sin is a principle . Righteousness is a principle . We hold that no holy being could create or generate a sin principle any more than an unholy being could create a righteous principle . For holy angels to sin , a sin principle must have existed , and they received it in their nature by faith or in some manner . The devil and angels did not create sin , for God created all that has been created ( Colossians 1:16 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodness . Goodness is an uncreated and eternal principle . We hold that sin is an uncreated and eternal principle . If it be a created principle , then God created it , for He alone is Creator . A holy being could not create sin and retain his holiness ; therefore God did not create sin . Devils could not create it ; therefore sin is uncreated . God saw that His creation was good , but we do not understand that sin was His creation . <p> Jesus taught His disciples to is in heaven . " * ( Matthew 6:9-10 ) Now , if angels in heaven sinned , then Gods will was not done in heaven and Christs words would not mean much to us . If holy angels in heaven sinned one time , how can we know that they have not sinned many times ? Why could they not sin some future time ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after we got to heaven ? To our mind the only logical conclusion is that sin never entered heaven and never will . No holy being in heaven ever sinned or ever will . Why would God redeem sinning man at such a great cost , and not redeem sinning angels ? 
@@72205473 @905473/ <h> Is God in Everything ? <p> One of the greatest obstacles to living unwaveringly this life of entire surrender is the difficulty of seeing God in everything . People say , " I can easily submit to things which come from God ; but I can not submit to man , and most of my trials and crosses come through human instrumentality . " Or they say , " It is all well enough to talk of trusting ; but when I commit a matter to God , man is sure to come in and disarrange it all ; and while I have no difficulty in trusting God , I do see serious difficulties in the way of trusting men . " <p> This is no imaginary trouble , but it is of vital importance , and if it can not be met , does really make the life of faith an impossible and visionary theory .

But the trials inflicted by man are full of bitterness . <p> What is needed , then , is to see God in everything , and to receive everything directly from His hands , with no intervention of second causes .

" I answer to this , unhesitatingly , Yes . To the children of God everything comes directly from their Fathers hand , no matter who or what may have been the apparent agents . There are no " second causes " for them . <p> The whole teaching of the Bible asserts and implies this . Not a sparrow falls to the ground without our Father ( Matthew 10:29 ) .

The truth really is , that His care is infinitely superior to any possibilities of human care ; and that He who counts the very hairs of our head , and suffers not a sparrow to fall without Him , takes note of the minutest matters that can affect the lives of His children , and regulates them all according to His own sweet will , let their origin be what they may . <p> The instances of this are numberless . Take Joseph . What could have seemed more apparently , on the face of it , to be the result of sin , and utterly contrary to the will of God , than his being sold into slavery ? And yet Joseph , in speaking of it , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; but God meant it unto good . " * ( Genesis 50:20 ) " Now therefore be not grieved , nor angry with yourselves , that ye sold me hither : for God did send me before you to preserve life . " * ( Genesis 45:5 ) To the eye of sense it was surely Josephs wicked brethren who had sent him into Egypt ; and yet Joseph , looking at it with the eye of faith , could say , " God sent me . " It had been undoubtedly a grievous sin in his brethren , but , by the time it had reached Joseph , it had become Gods will for him , and was in truth , though at first it did not look so , the greatest blessing of his whole life . And thus we see how the Lord can make even the wrath of man to praise Him , and how all things , even the sins of others , shall work together for good to them that love Him . <p> I learned this lesson practically and experimentally long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was attending a prayer-meeting held for the promotion of scriptural holiness , when a strange lady rose to speak , and I looked at her , wondering who she could be , little thinking she was to bring a message to my soul which would teach me such a grand lesson . She said she had had great difficulty in living the life of faith , on account of the second causes that seemed to her to control nearly everything that concerned her . Her perplexity became so great , that at last she began to ask God to teach her the truth about it , whether He really was in everything or not . After praying this for a few days , she had what she described as a vision . She thought she was in a perfectly dark place , and that there advanced towards her from a distance a body of light , which gradually surrounded and enveloped her and everything around her . As it approached , a voice seemed to say , " This is the presence of God ; this is the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the great and awful things in life seemed to pass before herfighting armies , wicked men , raging beasts , storms and pestilences , sin and suffering of every kind . <p> She shrank back at first in terror , but she soon saw that the presence of God so surrounded and enveloped each one of these , that not a lion could reach out its paw , nor a bullet fly through the air , except as His presence moved out of the way to permit it . And she saw that , let there be ever so thin a sheet , as it were , of this glorious presence between herself and the most terrible violence , not a hair of her head could be ruffled , nor anything touch her , unless the presence divided to let the evil through . Then all the small and annoying things of life passed before her , and equally she saw that these all were so enveloped in this presence of God that not a cross look , not a harsh word , nor petty trial of any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to let them through . <p> Her difficulty vanished . Her question was answered forever . God was in everything ; and to her henceforth there were no second causes . She saw that her life came to her , day by day and hour by hour , directly from His hand , let the agencies which should seem to control it be what they might . And never again had she found any difficulty in an abiding consent to His will and an unwavering trust in His care . <p> If we look at the seen things , we shall not be able to understand the secret of this . But the children of God are seen are eternal . " * ( 2 Corinthians 4:18 ) Could we but see with our bodily eyes His unseen forces surrounding us on every side , we would walk through this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or penetrate , for " The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him , and delivereth them . " * ( Psalm 34:7 ) <p> We have a striking illustration of this in the history of Elisha . The king of Syria was warring against Israel , but his evil designs were continually frustrated by the prophet ; and at last he sent his army to the prophets own city for the express purpose of taking him captive . We read , " Sent he thither horses , and chariots , and a great host : and they came by night , and compassed the city about . " * ( 2 Kings 6:14 ) This was the seen thing . And the servant of the prophet , whose eyes had not yet been opened to see the unseen things , was alarmed . And we read , " And when the servant of the man of God was risen early , and gone forth , behold , an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots . And his servant said unto him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " * ( 2 Kings 6:15 ) But his master could see the unseen things , and he replied , " Fear not ; for they that be with us are more than they that be chariots of fire round about Elisha. " * ( 2 Kings 6:16-7 ) <p> The presence of God is the fortress of His people . Nothing can withstand it . At His presence the wicked perish ; the earth trembles ; the hills melt like wax ; the cities are broken down ; " the heavens also dropped at the presence of God : even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God . " * ( Psalm 68:8 ) And in the secret of this presence He has promised to hide His people from the pride of man , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with thee , " He says , " and I will give thee rest . " * ( Exodus 33:14 ) <p> I wish it were only possible to make every Christian see this truth as plainly as I see it ; for I am convinced it is the only clue to a completely restful life . Nothing else will enable a soul to live only in the present moment , as we are commanded to do , and to take no thought for the morrow . Nothing else will take all the risks and " supposes " out of a Christians heart , and enable him to say , " Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life . " * ( Psalm 23:6 ) Abiding in Gods presence , we run no risks ; and such a soul can triumphantly say <p> " I know not what it is to doubt , My heart is alway gay ; I run no risks , for , come what will , God alway has His way . " <p> I once heard of a colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but who was a joyous , triumphant Christian . " Ah ! Nancy , " said a gloomy Christian lady to her one day , who almost disapproved of her constant cheerfulness , and yet envied it " ah ! Nancy , it is all well enough to be happy now ; but I should think the thoughts of your future would sober you . Only suppose , for instance , that you should have a spell of sickness and be unable to work ; or suppose your present employers should move away , and no one else should give you anything to do ; or suppose " <p> " Stop ! " cried Nancy , " I never supposes . De Lord is my shepherd , and I knows I shall not want . And , honey , " she added to her gloomy friend , " its all dem supposes as is makin you so misable . Youd better give dem all up , and just trust de Lord . " <p> There is one text that will take all the " suppose " out of a believers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a childlike faith ; it is in Hebrews 3:5-6 : " Be content , therefore , with such things as ye have ; for He hath said I will never leave thee , nor forsake thee " ; so that we may boldly say , " The Lord is my helper , and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. " * ( Hebrews 13:6 ) What if dangers of all sorts shall threaten you from every side , and the malice or foolishness or ignorance of men shall combine to do you harm ? You may face every possible contingency with these triumphant words , " The Lord is my helper , and I will not fear what man shall do unto me . " If the Lord is your helper , how can you fear what man may do unto you ? There is no man in this world , nor company of men , that can touch you , unless your God , in whom you trust , shall please to let them . " He will not suffer thy foot to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behold , he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep . The LORD is thy keeper : the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand . The sun shall not smite thee by day , nor the moon by night . The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil : he shall preserve thy soul . The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth , and even for evermore . " * ( Psalm 121:3-8 ) <p> Nothing else but this seeing God in everything will make us loving and patient with those who annoy and trouble us . They will be to us then only the instruments for accomplishing His tender and wise purposes towards us , and we shall even find ourselves at last inwardly thanking them for the blessings they bring us . <p> Nothing else will completely put an end to all murmuring or rebelling thoughts . Christians often feel a liberty to murmur against man , when they would not dare to murmur against God . But this way of receiving things would make it impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come , it must be because that trial is the sweetest and best thing that could happen to us , and we must accept it with thanks from His dear hand . The trial itself may be hard to flesh and blood , and I do not mean that we can like or enjoy the suffering of it . But we can and must love the will of God in the trial , for His will is always sweet , whether it be in joy or in sorrow . <p> Our trials may be our chariots . We long for some victory over sin and self , and we ask God to grant it to us . His answer comes in the form of a trial which He means shall be the chariot to bear us to the longed-for triumph . We may either let it roll over us and crush us as a Juggernaut car , or we may mount into it and ride triumphantly onward . Josephs chariots , which bore him on to the place of his exaltation , were the trials of being sold into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chariots may be much more insignificant things than these ; they may be nothing but irritating people or uncomfortable circumstances . But whatever they are , God means them to be our cars of triumph , which shall bear us onward to the victories we have prayed for . If we are impatient in our dispositions and long to be made patient , our chariot will probably be a trying person to live in the house with us , whose ways or words will rasp our very souls . If we accept the trial as from God , and bow our necks to the yoke , we shall find it just the discipline that will most effectually produce in us the very grace of patience for which we have asked . <p> God does not order the wrong thing , but He uses it for our blessing ; just as He used the cruelty of Josephs wicked brethren , and the false accusations of Potiphars wife . In short , this way of seeing our Father in everything makes life one long thanksgiving , and gives a rest of heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is unspeakable . Someone says , " Gods will on earth is always joy , always tranquillity . " And since He must have His own way concerning His children , into what wonderful green pastures of inward rest , and beside what blessedly still waters of inward refreshment , is the soul led that learns this secret . <p> If the will of God is our will , and if He always has His way , then we always have our way also , and we reign in a perpetual kingdom . He who sides with God can not fail to win in every encounter ; and whether the result shall be joy or sorrow , failure or success , death or life , we may , under all circumstances , join in the apostles shout of victory , " Thanks be unto God , which always causeth us to triumph in Christ " * ( 2 Corinthians 2:14 ) ! 
@@72205480 @905480/ <h> The Seat of the Image of Jealously <p> " And he put forth the form of an hand , and took me by a lock of mine head ; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven , and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem , to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north ; where was the seat of the image of jealousy , which provoketh to jealousy . " * ( Ezekiel 8:3 ) <p> Behind all outward sins are the inner causesthe sins behind the sins . Just as a mighty river starts from little beginnings , so an apostasy stems from hidden beginnings . These beginnings are buried back in history , both ancient history and recent , but the eye of God sees them from their smallest beginning , for " all things are naked and open unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do . " * ( Hebrews 4:13 ) This fact is both overwhelming and comforting . We can not get away with anything , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not heal and fix , for His comprehension of our need is absolutely complete . He saw when the Jews went astray ; He knew what needed to be acknowledged , confessed , and forsaken . We need to understand that God throughly understands why things are not working correctly today , and He knows how to fix it , too . <p> " And he brought me to the door of the court ; and when I looked , behold a hole in the wall . Then said he unto me , Son of man , dig now in the wall : and when I had digged in the wall , behold a door . " * ( Ezekiel 8:7-8 ) <p> There is a hole in the wall , a little hole , that is available ( through the mercy of God ) to every thoughtful soul . Even that little hole , that little insight , is only found because God brings it to our attention . Is it not a little hole ? It does not seem very significant . A brothers testimony was mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he had been raised , in a church that professed to be the Lords , but he kept thinking , " There has got to be more to this . " The inconsistencies and barrenness in that place did not seem enormous or overwhelming at that time to him . It certainly did n't  appear to him as it does now , since he fled the ruin . It was just a hole in the wall . " Behold a hole in the wall . " It was just enough for him to make a choice , and that choice , at that time , was not to stay or flee . It was a choice of whether or not to dig . <p> We can say with great certainty that God is always bringing to the attention of people the holes that lead to the underlying causes of sin ; and we can say with equal certainty that most people choose not to look further . They do n't  say , " Do n't  look at the hole ! " Of course not . Just to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lest I be obligated to act upon what I see . <p> God is very faithful to mankind , and all of His dealings with us are true and righteous altogether , but the overall picture of mens dealings with God is a sad contrast . If God has changed your heart so that your one great desire is to please Him and do what is right , then you will attempt to understand what God is trying to show you . But most people do not really have a heart to please Him ( even if they think they do ) . As the Bible tells us , when many were invited to the great supper He had prepared , " They all with one consent began to make excuse . " * ( Lk. 14:18 ) <p> At this point , many will attempt to avoid inquiry by stating , " Thats just your interpretation . " ( But does not God have an interpretation ? Are not the scriptures of no private interpretation ? 2 Peter 1:20 ) That " your interpretation " excuse is an excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from " I must know what truth is . " It is a long way from " Buy the truth , and sell it not . " * ( Proverbs 23:23 ) <p> Another sophistry of the devil is , " Thou shalt not judge . " This anti-digging tool is a twisted scripture . It ignores the words of Jesus , " Judge not according to the appearance , but judge righteous judgment . " * ( John 7:24 ) It ignores the pronouncement of Isaiah , " Zion shall be redeemed with judgment , and her converts with righteousness . " * ( Isaiah 1:27 ) It would have us believe that any judgment shows a lack of love . It creates an atmosphere where no line is drawn between right and wrong ; where a warm and fuzzy feeling is counted virtuous ; where sensitivity to the feelings of others and " meaning well " are the only esteemed virtues . Furthermore , it would insinuate that Gods judgments are unknown , except in the more gross and distasteful immoralities , and that we should not meddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fleshly to properly understand them or employ them . Strangely , this lack-of-judgment is very judgmental against people being judgmental . One young woman declared , " I will not worship with people who are judgmental . " It is one of the more judgmental declarations I have ever heard . <p> All of these hellish devices are ploys to keep people from digging . ( Yes , I know that each can be taken to extremes , and this is just as wrong . ) More people are hindered from a rigorous and effective inquiry of what is right and what is wrong by these attitudes than is imagined . <p> Now in our text , God takes Ezekiel on a fact-finding mission to see what went wrong with the Jewish nation to the extent that the temple is destroyed , the city of David is demolished , and the people are captives in the land of Babylon . And when God points out the little hole in the wall , He tells Ezekiel , " Son of man , dig now in the wall . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . We will never discover what God wants us to know unless we dig . You will just keep passing by that little hole . You will keep on saying things like , " That little thing ? That 's not important ! Besides , we should n't judge ! " Or maybe you will say , " Well , that 's your interpretation that the hole means something ! A lot of others , including me , feel differently about it . A little hole like that ? That 's not important ! How could that amount to much ? " But Brother Ezekiel had a different mindset , did n't  he ? He dug . And he found , hidden in the dirt with just a little hole leading to it , a door . <p> There are diggers who never get to the door . We might say , " Well , at least , they dug ! " And it is certainly better to do what God tells us to do . " Son of man , dig . " But we must go far enough . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God meant for us to see . <p> A brother and sister visited a congregation . This visited congregation was vilified and condemned among the people where the brother and sister came from . But the two had been stirred by recent developments in their church to do some digging . Perhaps the Lord was blessing over there in that congregation , they thought . So they visited . Now their expectations were shaped by the people among whom they made their home , and they honestly perceived no need for adjustment in themselves . They felt they were honest and up-to-date in their light , and I believe they were . However , they did not realize how much God would require them to change to take a stand against the errors that were bothering them among their people . In short , they vastly underestimated the amount of digging that would be necessary to uncover what would turn out to be a doora door that God wanted to show them . <p> The sister came to meeting with a burden to speak . She felt the Lord had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Spirit would make room for her . And that room was given to her in precisely the same way that it was extended to every other child of God . No special announcement was made that opened the way for her to speak . No inward or outward attitude was raised in opposition to her speaking . In fact , we were all there to hear whatever the Lord would lay upon anyone . The burden of proof that one was in order lay upon anyone who felt compelled to exercise himself or herself . We rather hoped that this sister would have something to say . <p> She did not say anything . She left the meeting without saying anything . She visited with others for the better part of a day without saying anything . She did not say anything for the better part of five years . Then she decided to talk . She went to a sister that resided at that congregation and told her that she felt she could not say what God had given her to say that night in service without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer any evidence of a spirit of domination , even after all that time . She simply stated that there was . After this assertion , things began to come out . She was asked if she had talked to anyone else about the matter , and at first she denied it . She really thought she had n't  talked to anyone , that she had been impartial and not influenced , but she had forgotten some things . Then God reminded her of whom she had talked to , and she was honest enough to call and confess what she had forgotten . We knew the ones she had talked to . We had been in situations where we had tried their spirit . A picture began to emerge . " I 'm still digging . I 'm still a digger . " But they do not find the door . We were afraid for her . She had not found the door . <p> " Well , maybe there is no door to find . " Whenever wrong is going on , there is a door . " Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) There is a cause . Sin has roots . God knows where those roots are , how to expose them , and how to get them out . But we must have a heart to do our part . Our part is to dig where He points . He will show us the hole . Then we are tested on just how much we want to know and how far we want to go with God . We can leave Him there pointing at the hole and ( 1 ) stop digging , ( 2 ) dig in other places , ( 3 ) dig so halfheartedly that nothing is accomplished . In any of these ways , the door will not be discovered . <p> What was behind that door that Ezekiel dug up ? Behind the door , well hidden , was " the seat of the image of jealousy . " At this point , the question is , are you willing to look behind the door ? Will you go all the way with God and look at " the hidden things of dishonesty " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abhor them as God abhors them , if you want to see what depths deliverance must reach to do the job of establishing holiness acceptable unto God , then you must " go in , and behold the wicked abominations that they do here . " * ( Ezekiel 8:9 ) <p> We pause to consider the effect on us of this insight . You will not be the same . You will not sit and listen to the preaching as you once did . You will see things that will burden you and tear at your soul . You will see why there is not more power and glory . You will see why healings are hindered and so many are spiritually weak and can not do anything much or stand very much for the Lord . The reasons are behind that door . They lie in the sins behind the sins . You will find yourself in the position of a man of God who made this statement in his last message to his congregation : " If I had known the hardness of mens hearts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This was a faithful brother who saw many things behind many doors , but something in his temperament did not care for the " adamant flint " ( Ezekiel 3:9 ) necessary to penetrate to the depth of need , and God had allowed it to come out in this way at the end of his life and ministry . ( Well , how could he be right , then ? In the same way that Brother Peter was still saved and sanctified after sitting with the Jewish brethren and separating himself from the Gentile brethren Galatians 2:11-14 . ) <p> We see plainly that the rootsthe real needsof mankind are buried . There are two barriers . There is a lot of earth that masks the hidden motives and thoughts of the heart , but God has a way of access for us . God is willing and desirous of showing you your own heart . He has written His Word in such a way as to reflect a perfect picture of youjust how you stand before Him , His standard of holiness , and His standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . To get a hold of Gods standard , you must dig through the dirt . You must wade through your fleshly conditioning . How your relatives think . The prevailing values of your family . Your own temperament . Your own prejudices . Your fears . What the devil suggests to you in the fleshly reasoning of your own mind . Behind all this dirt is the doorthe will . In the Jews to whom Ezekiel preached , this door was firmly closed to God . God was not in their heart . Other things had been taken through that door . Then the whole thing had been covered over with earth . <p> This is the classic pattern . Hardly anyone says , " The reason I am in such great trouble is because I shut my heart against God and His ways and piled earthly reasoning over my decision to justify myself . " A child of God will readily say this and testify with great thankfulness to the process of digging and uncovering , forsaking and cleaning out , opening to God and His salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . They serve sin and the devil . <p> There was a professing preacher who secretly used chewing tobacco . His son was convinced that he secretly drank alcoholic beverages , too . " He always had a milky condition in his eyes , " the son said . " But when he reached his old age and could no longer get around , that milky condition cleared up . " The son suspected that he secretly purchased and consumed alcohol thoughout his life until he couldnt do it anymore . This same son was the one who caught him using tobacco . He said , " I think Dad thought that he was one of those people who needed tobacco . There are no such people . He had convinced himself that he needed it just as other people need to eat food or vitamins . " In this way , he justified his secret sins . In this way , he piled up the earth before the door of his heart . Behind the door , what he had allowed in , flourished . <p> It did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins . Expedient means fit or proper under the circumstances ; conducive to self-interest ; desirable ; advisable ; advantageous ; sometimes contradistinguished from right or principled . The words synonyms include suitable , appropriate , and politic . The hypocrite reasons that his actions would be acceptable in a different moral atmosphere , although they are not acceptable now , so he hides what he does . He does not take into account that God is a revealer of secrets , yea , the secrets of mens hearts , and that God is infinitely holy and hates all sin with an infinite hatred . Gods judgments reveal all sin and show the way to righteousness . He does not vary His standards as men do . <p> A minister had a daughter who loved to dance . But for her , there was a problem . The church of which he was the pastor forbade dancing . This heritage was the result of holy living by their predecessors . It was a valuable understanding . But the minister had something other than a love for truth and holy living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he counseled his daughter . " Things will change . Eventually , dancing will be allowed among us . " This account was written by the daughter when she was an older woman . She rejoiced in the fact that her daddy was correct . Things did change . She got to indulge her love for dancing with the approval of the church . <p> There are many things going on in secret today that are waiting for a chance to come out and appear respectable , at least to some . And there are others who are not willing to wait , but defiantly champion some sinful thing in open rebellion against the prevailing understanding of what is right and wrong among men . Until it is expedient to let it come out in the open , it is carefully hidden behind the closed door of the heart , with a small mountain of dirt over it . But God has left a hole in the fleshly reasoning of men against this expediency , this practice of politics . These inconsistencies , the causes of i 'll spiritual health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , searching , knocking , then you will began to dig ; and eventually you will come to the door . <p> The dirt hides the door . The flesh is a veil to the decisions of the heart . The idols of the heart are veiled by the common attributes of the heart . " * ( Hebrews 4:12 ) Gods Word , in the hands of His Spirit , will cut though all obstacles and reveal the thoughts and intents of the heart . God will show you what is really behind your door and the doors of others , if you will stay with Him and keep looking . <p> So we see Ezekiel , taken by the hand of God to the hole in the earth , digging , digging , digging , until behold , he finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said unto me , Go in , and behold the wicked abominations that they do here . So I went in and saw . " * ( Ezekiel 8:9-10 ) We see then that a man directed by God , willing to dig as God wants him to dig , will find the door to the human heart . He will be directed and empowered to go in and see . Sometimes it may be his own heart that he is privileged to see ( for it can not be accurately seen without the help of God ) , and sometimes it may be the hearts of others ; but the overall effect will be to understand the will of God ( Ephesians 5:17 ) and to be enabled to cry to the Strong for help . <p> When Ezekiel saw the inward hearts of the Jews , the whole thing made a lot of sense . The judgment ( even their captivity ) was not too severe in any way . It was directly in proportion to the wickedness behind the closed door . God saw it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now Ezekiel began to see it . And the children of the captivity needed to see it , too . Without this horrible perception , there is no deliverance from the sin . God does not enjoy rubbing the faces of mankind in their sins , but the in-your-face ordeal is absolutely necessary if we are to be saved ( 2 Corinthians 7:11 ) . Without a true impression of the sinfulness of sin , there is no godly sorrow , consequently no heartfelt repentance , and no deliverance . <p> The stomach-turning tour of the inward thoughts and motives of the Jewish people began , and we read , " Behold every form of creeping things , and abominable beasts , and all the idols of the house of Israel , pourtrayed upon the wall round about . And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel , and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan , with every man his censer in his hand ; and a thick cloud of incense went up . Then said he unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark , every man in the chambers of his imagery ? for they say , the LORD seeth us not ; the LORD hath forsaken the earth . " * ( Ezekiel 8:10-12 ) We see at a glance that we are looking at spiritual wickedness in high places . Those who should have been guardians of the truth had utterly betrayed it , even the ancients of the house of Israel . The depths of their unbelief and godless philosophy are revealed in the words , " the LORD seeth us not ; the LORD hath forsaken the earth . " This pernicious skepticism had gone through the nation like leaven . Only a handful had not bowed the knee to Baal , so to speak . <p> This horrible betrayal of truth is just as real today and just as evil . The brethren who re-discovered the truth of Gods church , His body , in the Evening Light Reformation of 1880 , taught a depth of deliverance from sectish principles and ideas that echoed the same teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrayed in the New Testament . They exposed the false reasoning that had captured and bound millions of Gods children in different churches since the Protestant Reformation of 1530 . They insisted on the cleansing and purifying from the idols of party and groupism that defiled these Babylonish captives , and this sanctifying work of God enabled them to escape , one by one , to stand once more on the foundation that God kept from ever being corrupted . <p> But the current leaders of those who profess to have escaped Babylon have changed the focus of the message . It has been steadily slipping toward holding the " church " together instead of deliverance to a vision of God . The truth has more and more evolved among them to a doctrinal shadow , and when we dig into their attitudes and teachings , we find that they are more like sectism than not . <p> This is what has happened to a the vast majority of those who claim to be the church of God today . Only by their doctrine can they be distinguished from many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ godliness , but denying the power thereof . " * ( 2 Timothy 3:5 ) They teach and appear to cherish the doctrines of separation and distinction from all other groups ( 2 Corinthians 6:17 ) and love to celebrate " having been raised in the truth , " but they know little to nothing of the perfect love and eye single that enabled men and women to break every yoke and return to the rebuilding of Zion . <p> I am thinking of a minister who was esteemed among them because of his spirituality ( who nevertheless eventually settled for being one of them ) , who said of them in a certain locality , " They do not know what salvation means . " When I first heard this , it seemed rather extreme and a little far-fetched . Surely they could not have such a heritage without at least knowing what salvation means ! But he was right . Not only did they not have the experience working in them , they had at that place lost consciousness of it to the extent that they regarded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taught , and a " sweet " spirit as evidence of salvation . They had lost all consciousness of such truths as , " Anything less than a perfect trust in God is a denial of Him . " They actively intermingled with others of the same philosophical bent as themselves in the group of people with whom their congregation fellowshipped , and they were suspicious and a little apprehensive of those who went deeper . Their pastor was a man of mighty intellect ; he edified their minds , satisfied their curiosity , and entertained them . They ignored and still ignore the holes in the earth . Behind the closed doors of their hearts , they burn their incense and worship their abominations . Their descendants come along and build on their work , little suspecting that the effort is adulterated and impure in the eyes of God . These descendants act sincerely , more or less , in following something that is less than complete truth . The same goes on in tens of thousands of sects all over the world . <p> When faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apostasy , they are highly offended . Just outraged . In a different time , physical imprisonment and even death might have followed . Now they just kill the influence of those who oppose them as best they can , and keep that door firmly sealed against anything else that conflicts with where their heart is set . <p> Every now and then , something happens that exposes a hole . This is Gods mercy to the people behind the door , although it is largely unrecognized . <p> About 23 years ago , a pastor was teaching a standard that was in direct contradiction of the Bible on a number of points . If you lived in that congregation and loved the Lord , you were heavily censured , even persecuted , if you did not go along with those Bible contradictions . This pastor was quite influential ; he was much thought of in many other congregations , and the less-than-spiritual standards had made headway in many other places . Several spiritual ministers were quite burdened about the situation , and several ( unsuccessful ) meetings were held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including him . These were of no avail . A man in his congregation opposed these same things . Finally a general ministers meeting was held about the matter , and the details of the spiritual conflict came to light . About twelve points came outall of them in violation of the Bible . All of them were apparently little things . The matter was presented before the ministerial body , and the pastor spoke . It was plain that he was indeed teaching and doing those things . He defended them . He sidestepped the importance of those things . <p> I sat in that meeting and confidently waited for men and women of God to refute the false teaching and deal with the heart of the brother . And I received one of the great shocks of my life . They did not . There were brethren there who had good understanding of what was involved and what it would mean . One of them said , " Well , let 's have a Bible study . If we do n't  know what we believe , then let 's study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study the Bible about those things . Any fair study would come to a conclusion that those things were wrong . Folks werent mixed up or confused about those things . The problem was not ignorance or confusion . <p> The problem was political . A young brother and sister approached an older sister and asked her , " What 's going on ? Why wont any of you speak up ? We were taught that these things were wrong . " The old sister replied , " We are all so afraid . " And that was the truth . They were afraid to stand up for the truth . They were afraid that it would split them . Such was the pastors influence . Instead , they had a vote of confidence in the pastor . Most of the ministers there , in the presence of the pastors apostasy , showed by uplifted hands that they continued to have confidence in the pastor and his ministry . Some abstained ( I was one of them ) . The pastor continued to teach the same poisonous stuff among them until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall that demanded further inquiry . God was showing great mercy in allowing all this embarrassing , awkward confusion to surface . But much of this was wasted on the vast majority of the ministers who attended the meeting . They were not interested in digging to discover any closed doors . They will deny to this day that there was any significant change among them as a result of their doing ( or not doing ) . In another meeting , some months before the one mentioned , a young minister had voiced the same sentiments as the older minister in this meeting described above . Remarkably , the entire body of ministers had rejected the exact same letdowns in principles and concepts . The young minister did not have the same influence as the older minister . <p> In this way , people choose ( by not taking a stand for truth ) the abominations that they really believe in behind their closed doors . And regardless of their overall profession , the actual fruits of their idols and abominations began to manifest themselves . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first is an increasing skepticism in God and His promises as He sees fit to work . The second is the worship of idols , such as Tammuz . Both are recorded in Ezekiels writing . The first characteristic leads to the second , for if we are not led by God and His promises , we will be led by something . <p> " Then said he unto me , Son of man , hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark , every man in the chambers of his imagery ? for they say , the LORD seeth us not ; the LORD hath forsaken the earth . He said also unto me , Turn thee yet again , and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do . Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORDS house which was toward the north ; and , behold , there sat women weeping for Tammuz.

The idea of an absent , unconcerned Christ is a key thought to how false Christianity justifies its doings . <p> Tammuz was a young god in the pagan myth who supposedly died each fall and was resurrected each spring . According to the myth , he was very comely , and festivals of rejoicing greeted his arrival in the spring , while mourning attended his supposed annual death in the autumn . In many ways , he represents fleshly , earthly hopes , and this fable was especially attractive to women . Many Jewish women of the captivity found this story particularly appealing . They had hopes that there would be a " spring " from their captivity as they mourned the loss of Jerusalem , etc . As though there was a natural rhythm of loss and gain , and this " fate " was the explanation of what had happened to them , of why they were exiles in Babylon . <p> There are many people weeping for Tammuz today . They have little or no faith in God , except as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the flesh , especially the flesh at its best , i.e. , Tammuz . The Tammuz worshipers believe in the flesh .

If we go beyond the oft-expressed twofold salvation of the Word , we see no propriety in summing up the gospel in four special gifts , since its divine mercies are , we may safely say , a thousand fold , its blessings innumerable . But the great object of the Saviors death is to save men from all sin . And because sin exists in two forms , the word of God often presents salvation as a twofold cure for sin .

That is , sin in nature ; sin as a moral element ; or a bent to evil , back of , and distinct from all sinful actions that arise from it . This is a fact clearly taught in the Scriptures , and consciously experienced in all unsanctified humanity . It is said to be " sin that dwelleth in me. " * ( Romans 7:17 ) Sin in " motion .

Thus saith the evangelistic prophet Isaiah , " Ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles , and in their glory ye shall feast yourselves . For your shame ye shall have double ; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall possess the double : everlasting joy shall be unto them .

The apostasy in the Evening Light Reformation movement is no exception to this rule but has followed the general pattern of all before it , beginning with only minor points and working on into the bigger things later on . But perhaps the apostasy in this movement has been the most rapid of any before it . This should cause us to stop and take notice , because this certainly indicates a general condition existing in the world and in the hearts of men which makes it easier for the people to accept these things and for the devil to push them in upon the people .

@@72205502 @905502/ <h> The Importance of Established Landmarks <p> I esteem very highly the early pioneer ministers of this Evening Light Reformation and the standard of holiness they held both in life and teaching . I consider those standards to be right because they worked and produced results , and the results they produced are the very same results the people of God yearn for and decry the lack of in our midst today . I reverence those early brethren to the extent that it is very grievous to me when I hear people criticizing them and challenging their teachings . But it is common practice among those who accept and condone the innovations of worldly things , which have been coming in among us little by little over the past few years , to speak lightly of the standards taught and held by the early brethren . They also discredit those who hold for those standards yet in our day , and sometimes such remarks as this are heard : " I do my own thinking . I do not accept a code that has been handed down by tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " etc . Sometimes those who stand for those old standards are accused of just subscribing to some old tradition and doing things because someone else said to do it , etc . But when we see those old standards and that old way work and produce results and better results than the codes which people want to bring in and go by now , that is the deciding factor in our thinking . <p> Of course , that attitude is not fair on the face of it , for who of us do not do things because others do them ? Those who are in the " know " regarding those things , tell us that the human race produces only a very small percentage of leaders . All the others are followers .

If suddenly no woman of the world would ever curl her hair or wear a permanent , do you imagine you would still think it necessary to curl yours and contend for those things as you do now ? If not , why not ? Then why would you think it proper and fair to taunt those who choose to stand by the old landmarks and not move the bounds in such a way and think of them as you do ? <p> You may askand I have been askedif I believed the early brethren had all the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement to be true in regard to them . But let us realize there is a vast difference between new light as it is being advanced today and more light on what the brethren of the early days taught and the church subscribed to in that time . I believe without doubt that we of our day have more light on some points of truth than they had in their day because there have been developments in the intervening time which would throw some clearer light on some points of truth than they could have had in their day . I can accept additions of light on these points of truth on that basis , but I can not accept " new " light which contradicts the basic teachings of the early brethren on any points of truth . But I believe that the doctrines taught in the early days of this Evening Light Reformation contained the overall coverage of the truth as taught in the New Testament , though some of it was perhaps in a limited sense which developments have brought out clearer than they had it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most of the points I could call to mind in this category would be dealing with scriptures of prophecy and having to do with the signs of the times and the fulfillment of prophecy and not with the real standards of holiness and Christian living .

And I feel inclined to warn all of you at this point to be careful about accepting or being carried away with any of the innovations of worldly things or variations in teaching and practice which have been coming in among us the last few years and are coming in among us now . <p> If I could see more real godliness and deep holiness of life and more of the power of God accompanying these things , I could be more interested in them .

Let us not remove the old landmarks nor remove the bounds which have been set for us by those who have gone before us .

I know you do n't  like that . I do n't  either . I would like to see it different , but to be honest I must face up to the facts as I see them and I feel you should , too .

Some would like to have all that power and glory and benefits of the early church but they are not willing to follow that standard . The two can never be harmonized so we may as well stop trying ; and if we are willing to throw the standards of the early brethren overboard , just throw the rest overboard also , and quit worrying about what they had that we do not see in that same measure in the church of our day .

@@72205510 @905510/ <h> Nature and Effects of Entire Sanctification <p> The work of entire sanctification , like other spiritual operations , is not accurately and fully definable . It does not follow , however , as some have erroneously supposed , that sanctification must therefore be nothing because incapable of logical definition . Regeneration is equally indefinable and might as reasonably be rejected on this ground as entire sanctification , but some would reject one for this cause and retain the other . Many things that limited human wisdom is unable to explain fully are commonly believed and experienced . An illustration of this is that mental operation called thought . We all believe in the reality of thought , but what it is and exactly how thinking is done is unknowable to us . The mind itself is a mystery . Yet we believe we have minds , and we use them constantly during waking hours . But though psychologists may tell us much concerning the phenomena of the mind , yet they can not tell us many important facts that we wish to know about the mind itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but can not know fully what it is . Likewise we know only the phenomena resulting from native depravity , but are unable to tell fully and exactly what that depravity is . We also know by His works in nature that there is a personal God , but we are unable fully to define and to comprehend God Himself . We may say He is a spirit , but we are unable to know what is a spirit . All we can naturally know of God is His phenomena . <p> Some things can be known only by experience . A person born blind can have no comprehension of color , even though one may try earnestly to explain it to him . He has nothing in experience with which to compare it . So also a practical idea of the nature of entire sanctification is possible only to one who has the experience . Exactly so , one can know the nature of regeneration only by being converted . But while such knowledge is possible only to those having the experience in their own hearts , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unable to give the philosophy of the experience ; so some may have experimental knowledge of sanctification and yet be unable to tell exactly what it includes . But , happily , it is unnecessary to understand fully and to be able to reason out the nature of Christian experience in order to possess the experience . One desiring to take a trolley-ride does not need to possess a technical knowledge of electricity nor does he need to be able to comprehend and explain the intricacies and processes by which the current from a trolley-wire propels the car . All he needs to know is how to get aboard the car , to pay his fare , and to get off at his destination . But how foolish he would be who would refuse to board the car on the ground that he did not understand the philosophy of electricity , and who would demand that the motorman explain it fully to him before he would get on ! But those who reject sanctification on the ground that we do not understand its philosophy are , we think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because God offers it , even though we can not understand some things concerning it ? <h> The Philosophy of the Second Cleansing <p> In the very nature of the case it is impossible that a cleansing of the heart subsequent to justification could be a cleansing from those sins which are already forgiven . Therefore we believe it must be a cleansing from that depravity in the nature which , as we showed in a former chapter , exists in the regenerated . This cleansing we understand is really a restoration of that derangement of the moral nature which resulted from Adams sin and which is inherited by all his posterity . It is simply an undoing of the perversion of mans nature . It should be understood that depravity is not a root , a stump , a germ , nor any other physical entity , but a change in mans nature . The difference between a depraved person and Adam before the fall is like the difference between the lion and the lamb . The fact that the lion is ferocious and the lamb gentle is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully explainable . <p> This depravity is especially a derangement of two facultiesthe affections and the will . It manifests itself in inordinate love for thingsfor the creature rather than the Creator ; it causes one to love that which is harmful and sinful ; it causes him to love sinful things and hate God and right . It weakens the will ; even though the unconverted one controlled by depravity may desire to do good , he finds himself unable to do so . The effects of depravity are described by Paul in Romans 7:14-25 . Depravity gives a tendency to sin by the exaggeration of temptations from the natural . The second cleansing by a restoration from depravity overcomes that tendency to sin . Through depravity those natural qualities and desires which God placed in man are perverted until they become sinful . <p> God created man with a natural pride which we know as self-respect , which causes one to seek to be agreeable and pleasing to his fellows . But depravity causes him to want to be not only well thought of , which is proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anyone else . This is selfish and therefore sinful pride and is condemned as sin in Gods Word . <p> God placed in man a sense of justice , or that which causes a natural anger , indignation , or displeasure at an injustice . This is that which God felt toward sinful Israel and which Jesus felt as mentioned on one occasion . It is that which every good man feels at the sight of oppression of the helpless by the strong . It is good that man has this feeling . It is fundamentally necessary to his moral nature . But depravity causes him not only to feel displeasure at what he does not approve , but also causes him to have a vindictive selfish anger or hatred that would lead him to do wrong himself by retaliating . Also , depravity turns natural approbativeness into sinful pride , jealousy , and envy ; natural acquisitiveness and the disposition to provide for dependents is turned into covetousness , dishonesty , and theft ; the physical appetites are perverted into inordinate lust ; natural desire for pleasure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jesting . <p> Sanctification does not take away those qualities which properly belong to human nature , but it does restore them from that perverted condition . A wholly sanctified man will possess natural pride or self-respect , feel displeasure at injustice , have the disposition to be provident , have physical appetites , will desire pleasure , and have a sense of humor ; but he will be saved from the perversion of these . <h> What Sanctification Does Not Do for Us <p> The failure to distinguish clearly between human nature and the depravity of that nature has led many to misunderstanding much as to what effects should result from the cleansing from that depravity in the work of entire sanctification . It has caused some to claim for sanctification that which it does not provide , and because some who sought the experience failed to obtain that which they had been told sanctification would do for them , they have often been led either to reject the doctrine and experience entirely or else to doubt their having the experience and , as a result , become greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are always harmful . The harmful effects may not be apparent at once ; but possibly years after , one thus wrongly instructed may be led to doubt his experience or to reject sanctification . <p> Another common error of teachers of sanctification has been to minimize the work of conversion in order to magnify more that of the second cleansing . Still another error is in preaching what sanctification does in a particular lifeto preach personal experience and imply that the effects must be the same in all lives . As already explained , some are more depraved than others , because of either inherited or acquired depravity , therefore there must be a difference in the effects of entire sanctification ; for the effects of cleansing from depravity must , in the nature of the case , be just as varied as are the effects of the depravity . Likewise , because some do not notice the effects of depravity so much as do others , they do not notice the effects of cleansing from it so much as do others . <p> Briefly , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make absolutely perfect in all respects , does not save from the possibility of sinning , and does not destroy the human nature . <h> How Does a Sanctified Person Feel ? <p> Physical appetites and desires still remain in the sanctified for the reason that they are a part of the human nature and depravity is no essential part of them ; these were in Adam before he sinned . However , depravity commonly manifests itself through these physical desires , and sanctification does purify these desires in that sense ; but the desire itself was given of God for a good purpose and is not to be despised . Some have supposed that sexual desire should not exist in the sanctified and have been troubled because it did exist in them . The sanctified person is still human ; but this sexual desire is exalted from its abnormal , lustful condition to that in which man was created so far as the heart is concerned . <p> Another person is troubled because he fails clearly to distinguish between natural and sinful pride . Normal self-respect and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not suppose these will be destroyed in sanctification . Undepraved human nature is good , and these qualities are given man for his good that he might be respectable and pleasing to others . It is that selfish , sinful desire to be regarded as better than anyone else that is destroyed in sanctification . <p> Others are troubled because of a failure to recognize the difference between a proper displeasure at an act of injustice and vindictive anger or hatred . This sense of justice is essential to moral character , and without it man would be unable to determine what is right conduct toward his neighbor . But that which enables him to recognize what is right conduct in himself or others must also cause him to recognize that which is wrong in others . A good man must be displeased at injustice , and he will have certain feelings in the matter . To illustrate : if you see a strong , rough man cruelly beating a little boy or a crippled person , you will probably feel something within you stirring , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say you should blindly follow such feelings , for they might lead you to a sinful act , though they are good in themselves , just as certain physical appetites are good in themselves , yet may lead to sin if not controlled . The sanctified man will have these natural feelings , but he does not have that perverted , abnormal , or augmented form of them which we know as hatred or vindictive anger . The sanctified person may have feelings of impatience , and these if not controlled may lead him to do that which is sinful in itself ; however , the feelings themselves are not sinful nor a result of depravity , but may be traceable to qualities that are good in themselves . We are instructed in Gods Word to " add patience . " * ( 2 Peter 1:5-8 ) It is a result of Christian growth , as are virtue and knowledge . it may not be possible always to draw a fine line of distinction between the natural and the depraved in some of these things either in ones own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is that we have the experience . <h> Christian Perfection and Adams Perfection Distinguished <p> As far as heart-purity is concerned , we understand that Christian perfection is identical with Adamic perfection ; but in various other respects there is much difference . The fall into sin affected the race , not only morally , but also mentally and physically . Not until we are glorified in heaven will these effects of the fall ( such as physical death ) be overcome . Adam , we understand , had a body not incapable of injury , fatigue , or disorder , yet there is reason to believe it was sound , healthy , and sufficient to meet all the demands put upon it by mans duties and needs . But the sanctified man , even though his body is healed by Gods power , yet , as in Pauls case , his duties may cause extreme weariness , weakness , and suffering . In other words , mans body has suffered as a result of the fall of the race into sin . <p> Likewise , it is reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but so balanced and sufficient as to meet his needs . But how inadequate are the intellectual faculties of man in his present condition ! His perceptive faculties are impaired , his judgment is enfeebled , the memory fails to perform its work , and the imagination is weakened . It is hardly possible to think that God created man without the mental capacity to do properly the work he should do . Evidently the fall has affected mans intellect . Though it is true that heart-purity and right living may by a course of long training overcome these physical and mental deficiencies in a small measure , yet it must be allowed that in these things Christian perfection is vastly below the Adamic perfection . <p> Also , it must be allowed that in many qualities which have to do with the moral there is a lack of balance through an under-development or an over-development of those brain cells which have to do with that faculty of mans nature . To illustrate : if a persons foreparents have been much given to foolishness and lightness , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he will likely find after he is wholly sanctified that he has an undue tendency to the humorous and must watch continually lest it hinder his spiritual development . Heart-purity is not the remedy for his trouble . It is caused by an over-development of certain brain cells . Just as it has taken many years and possibly generations to effect this development , so it will likewise probably take years or generations of training in sobriety to overcome it . <p> Likewise , there may be a lack of balance developed in this way in approbativeness , the sense of justice , acquisitiveness , self-respect , pessimism , optimism , physical desires , etc . One may be fully sanctified in heart , yet the effects of depravity in the physical and mental may have to be overcome and struggled against throughout many years . This is why some persons have special trials in one line and others in another . But Gods grace is sufficient for these things . It is here that we need to " grow in grace , " * ( 2 Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some persons by careful spiritual living have done much to overcome these faults , as we commonly call them . We are aware of the fact that some enthusiasts for sanctification would try to have us believe that Christian perfection is almost absolute perfection ; but we have tried to claim for it only that which is in harmony with the Bible , experience , and reason .

There are also some people today who have been pardoned , but have not got over into the Acts of the Apostles . They read the Acts , and their heads are there , but their hearts are back in the beginning of the evangelists . But a real Bible Christian has been through repentance at Sinai , has been reconciled at the cross of Christ , and has been baptized with the Holy Ghost at Pentecost . <h> Jews <p> The first outpouring of the Holy Ghost was upon converted Jews .

" They were all filled with the Holy Ghost . " * ( Acts 2:4 ) To be filled with the Holy Ghost is not evidenced by being filled with emotion . You may be so full of emotion that you ca n't talk , and yet not be full of true religion . Being full of emotion is one thing , and being full of a divine Personality is entirely another thing . Being full means that everything contrary to the Holy Ghost was pushed out . <p> Remember that these one hundred and twenty were not the apostles only . Mary , the mother of Jesus , was there , and other women as well as men , and they had all been converted before . It is awfully absurd to talk about these people being converted just then .

That is not it at all , not by ten thousand leagues . Others think it is a sort of unction that comes on some people to help them to preach . Not at all . You can be filled with the Holy Ghost and be sound asleep . You can be filled with the Holy Ghost and have the headache so bad that you ca n't talk . Some think it is to " get a blessing . " Why , do n't  you know that already the apostles had experienced a wonderful time casting out devils , and healing the sickand then had a dispute about who should be the greatest in Jesus council .

It is a Person , brethren ; and when you get filled with the Holy Ghost you get filled with a divine Person ; a thoughtful , secure , almighty , powerful Spirit that moves you to do His will . That is what the apostles received at Pentecost . <h> Samaritans <p> Many people think that the outpouring at Pentecost is the only one on record , and when you talk about four , people get afraid . But you will find that this same thing took place with the humble Samaritans in the eighth chapter . Philip went down and preached , and they had a wonderful revival . Some people there were possessed of the devil . The Bible calls things by their proper names , in plain , unsophisticated language . We do not talk that way nowadays .

There had been " great joy " among them already , and joy is an unspeakable element in every young converts heart . Not that they might get " a blessing . " No , Peter and John prayed specifically and distinctly " that they might receive the Holy Ghost , " * ( Acts 8:15 ) and after laying hands on them , they were filled with the Spirit . Let us not miss the lesson which is taught here . Here was a new church so happy that everyone was rejoicing .

Do as they did , and you will have a revival . " Now here was a church not more than six weeks old that received this wonderful baptism . Oh , if I only had received it that soon after I was converted ! I began holding meetings and working at once . But if in about six weeks or so , some Peter and John had come and taught me , and led me on into the specific baptism of the Holy Ghost that takes away the evil elements that lurk down in the heart , it would have saved me a thousand slips and sorrows . God often uses His servants , chosen members of His body , to call a definite meeting , or write some quickening book , so that the people may receive companionship to help them on in the way . <p> Notice that Peter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer , except for this one great bestowment . It was definite prayer , definite instruction , and definite work . When people say , " Do n't  bother young converts about the baptism of fire , " they had better read the Acts of the Apostles . Do you know that young Christians are the very ones who can seek this full baptism . When church members live many years without seeking this baptism , they form chronic habits . They form the habit of neglecting secret prayer , and neglect the reading of the Bible ; and some form the habit of backsliding , and then getting alarmed and saying , " I must get closer to God . " But they soon go back again , and thus form a chronic habit of going forward and then backward . Some have a chronic habit of grumbling , others a chronic habit of distrust . <p> Young converts naturally believe that God counts the hairs of their heads , but they can soon grow to become philosophical , and skeptical , and think God can take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When were you converted , brother ? " " Ten years ago ? " " Well , are you saved now ? " " You hope so ! " Chronic doubt ; do n't  you see ? <p> It is absolutely essential , when we are converted , to take the examples given us in the Bible and be in the apostolic succession . I believe in the apostolic successionbelieving as the apostles believed , praying as they prayed , and acting as they acted . If you want to follow the example of the apostles , then settle it now that Gods Word requires you to go on to a personal Pentecost . <h> Romans <p> The next outpouring of the Holy Ghost you will find described in the tenth chapter of Acts . It was upon RomansCornelius and his household . Some people try to make out that Cornelius had never been converted . But if he was not converted , please show me the man who is . He was a " devout man " ; that is equivalent to saying that he had religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as declaring that he loved God . " They that feared the Lord spake often one to another . " * ( Malachi 3:16 ) He " gave much alms . " This does not prove him to be a converted man , but naturally accompanies true religion . He " prayed to God always . " Will you show me a man here in Philadelphia who has all these and yet is not converted ? But that is not all . He had a vision and an angel visited him ; and then Peter says plainly that Cornelius was " accepted with God . " Peter also goes on to say , " The word which God sent unto the children of Israel , preaching peace by Jesus Christ That word , I say , ye know . " * ( Acts 10:36-37 ) Peter declared that Cornelius knew the word of peace in Jesus Christ . I wish that before I received the " second blessing " I had come up to all that . It is sad , but it is comical to see how people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say that this man was a heathen . <p> Now while Peter preached to them the Holy Ghost fell upon them , and the Jews were astonished , for they had thought that they were the only ones to receive this great baptism . Notice that though Cornelius had no tongue of fire on his head , yet he spoke with tongues and magnified God . He told the experience which he felt within himself . <h> Greeks <p> The fourth outpouring occurs in the nineteenth chapter of Acts . Paul came to Ephesus and found some twelve disciples to whom he put at once the question , " Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed ? " To which inquiry they made answer , " We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost . " Now let us look at this in a common-sense way . They had heard of the Spirit of God , for the Old Testament was full of references to that .

" * ( Acts 18:26 ) Apollos then left to preach in Achaia , and while he was at Corinth , Paul came to Ephesus to see this infant church . He met the certain disciples mentioned above , and could telllikely by the way they prayed and testifiedthat they had not received the Holy Ghost , so he asked them , and received the reply that they had not heard of such a thing . They had been listening to sermons proving that Jesus was the Messiah . But now Paul prayed for them , and suddenly they received the baptism of fire and spoke with tongues and prophesied . <p> Years afterward , Paul wrote a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very event in their history . He says , " In whom ye also trusted , after that ye heard the word of truth in whom also after that ye believed , ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise . " * ( Ephesians 1:13 ) <p> It is interesting to see how the blessed Holy Ghost was poured out in these four different cases , on those of four different cultures , and yet each a part of His church . This shows that wherever the gospel of Christ was preached and received , there the whole work was to be done , and the baptism of the Holy Ghost was to follow conversion . <p> I trust God will open every heart here , that each one may put himself into the attitude in which he may be cleansed and filled with the Holy Ghost . We must have the whole Trinity , having repentance toward God here , faith in Jesus Christ here , and the baptism of the Holy Ghost here . Thus we will be fitted to live and to die . 
@@72205542 @905542/ <h> Meaning of Sanctification in Its Various Uses <p> Probably one of the most fruitful sources of controversy concerning the Scriptural doctrine of entire sanctification is the great amount of confusion and variety of opinion as to the meaning of the term " sanctification " as used in the Bible . We are prone to suppose that , because in one text or use it has to do with a particular phase of Christian life or experience , therefore it has that same meaning in every other use of it in the Bible . The mistake is often made of giving a technical meaning to this term and of trying to limit its usage to this one meaning . To illustrate : One man finds the term used of the cleansing from committed sins , therefore he decides that must be the Scriptural meaning of the word exclusive of all other meanings . Another man finds it used of the work of regeneration , or the new birth , so he decides it means that wherever it is found . Another finds it used of the cleansing of believers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleansing from every text in which the term is used . Still another person finds the term used in the sense of consecration , or a setting apart , so he contends it means that and nothing more . <p> The many one-sided views of sanctification as often held forcibly remind us of the story of the six blind men who went to see the elephant . The one who took hold of his leg thought the elephant was like a tree . Another who grasped his tail thought him like a rope . A third seized his ear , and decided he was like a fan ; while the one who placed a hand upon his broad side said he was like a wall . And , as the story goes , when each had examined the beast and found him different from what the others had , they all disputed loud and long as to which held the right theory of the elephant . This is a homely illustration , but it is exactly parallel to the cause for much of the dispute concerning the nature of sanctification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is all there is to it . They are all partly in the right , yet they are all in the wrong as much as were the six blind men , and their conception of the meaning of the term " sanctification " is as inadequate as were the views of the blind men concerning the elephant . <h> The Meaning of the Term <p> To understand clearly the Scriptural meaning of the term " sanctify , " it is necessary to go back of the English word to the Greek term . The best Greek authorities hold that the Greek hagios and its derivatives are properly translated by the following English words in their various formssanctify , holy , pure , chaste , clear . In the Bible they are translated by these various words . They also include the idea of consecrating to a holy purpose or of ascribing holiness to a person or thing . However , the more common use of the Greek hagios is to cleanse . Likewise the primary meaning of sanctify is to cleanse . Therefore it is evident that wherever there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sanctification , whether that cleansing be of the heart or of the life , spiritual or physical , of committed sins or of inherited depravity , actual or ceremonial . If it were always borne in mind that sanctification may have this variety of meaning , as does cleansing or almost any other term , much misunderstanding could be avoided . The sense of the term or the sanctification referred to in a particular text of the Bible must be determined by the context , etc. , as we determine the particular usage of any other term . We question whether the term sanctification has any technical use in the Bible as it seems to have in the minds of many people . <h> Eight Different Possible Uses of Sanctification <p> The term " sanctification " is capable of being used in at least eight different senses in respect to experience or practice and is used in most of these senses in the Scriptures . In some of these uses an equivalent term is employed . The following is a list of these uses , the first four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart and are always used when the work is said to be done by God . The second four are other uses of sanctification and are applied to work performed by man . <p> The foregoing , if not the only uses , are at least the principal proper uses of sanctification . Careful study of the referenced scriptures will be profitable . <h> Entire Sanctification Defined <p> While we allow these various senses of the term " sanctification , " it is not our purpose in this book to discuss all of them , but only that often described as " entire sanctification . " We define it briefly at this point as a definite cleansing , subsequent to conversion , from the depravity of the nature , which condition remains in the regenerated until the time of this entire sanctification , a work contemporary with the Holy Ghost baptism . As a matter of convenience we shall here commonly designate this second cleansing by the term " sanctification " ; but it should be remembered that the word sanctification ordinarily has no technical meaning .

The field was full of stones ! It almost seemed as if they grew there . Mr. Brown watched as Chris shoved stones into the bucket and carried it to the wagon . He had to try twice before he could swing the bucket up to dump it . When he looked up Mr. Brown was nodding . <p> " Thats the ticket , " he said . " You might find it hard work at first , but you 'll toughen up . " <p> Chris watched as the farmer drove the tractor into the next field .

Soon it seemed to Chris that he had lugged more stones than anyone in the whole world . But every bucket of stones seemed to fill that wagon like you would fill up a swimming pool with spoonfuls of water . <p> Chris back and arms began to ache . " I 'm going to kill myself trying to fill this old wagon , " he muttered . He watched sullenly as the tractor made another turn in the field and turned toward him .

As he stumbled back to the field , he heard the farmer call , " I 'll be checking on your progress in half an hour ! " <p> " Mr. Brown did n't  even notice all the work Ive done , " Chris grumbled . " He acts like its easy ! " Slowly he began loading another bucket . This time only five stones went in . But the strange thing was , the bucket felt heavier than all the others . That was because Chris was n't just hauling stones . He was hauling a huge load of resentment , too .

He wished that he dared throw them at the farmer . But he did n't  . He was afraid of the police and jail . And losing his pay . <p> " Mr. Brown probably wont even pay me for all this hard work , " he muttered , gloom filling his mind . " No one ever treats me right . Even my mom left me to live with strangers . No one will ever love me or appreciate me . No one . " <p> That terrible thought made Chris stand still .

The farmer pointed toward the tractor and the boy nodded his head . " Its probably his son , " Chris muttered to himself . " He probably gets to ride the tractor anytime he wants to ! " <p> Chris turned his back and picked up the dirty old bucket . Clunk , thunk . He tossed in a couple stones . When he heard the tractor start up , he gave a quick glance over his shoulder .

" He was carrying three five-gallon pails . He handed one to Chris . Then , with rapid , scooping motions , he raked the other two pails full of stones and walked quickly to the wagon . There was the thundering roar of twin stone waterfalls , and just as quickly as that , Andy was back scooping up more stones . <p> " I 'm not going to be beat by a little squirt like him , " Chris told himself .

" Chris wanted to know . <p> " I was suppose to be picking up stones , just like you , " Andy continued . " But I figured Mr. Brown would never give me a chance to do anything else unless I proved my abilities , so I decided to get my hands on the controls to show him what I could do . " <p> Chris looked at the smaller guy in surprise . " Just like me , " he thought . Then he quickly began filling his buckets , wondering if Andy had read his mind . But the other boy kept right on talking . <p> " I really showed them , all right . I wrecked the barn , almost ran over Mrs. Brown , killed several of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , yes !

@@72205551 @905551/ <h> A Bible Definition of Pride <p> " Oh , to be but emptier , lowlier , Mean , unnoticed , and unknown , And to God a vessel holier , Filled with Christ , and Christ alone ! " * <p> I feel a burden to write about pride , and I want to address the subject in such a way as to be of practical benefit to those who love God and want to walk worthy of the vocation to which they are called ( Ephesians 4:1-2 ) . <p> The Bible tells us that " the pride of life is not of the Father , but is of the world . " * ( 1 John 2:16 ) God has made us capable of achievement , but there is an attitude that arises naturally with achievement that is not of the Father , but of the world . To have victory over pride is to excel and achieve without giving a place to this sinful attitude . In this way , it is similar to being a steward over material increase . " If riches increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Psalm 62:10 ) You can see at a glance that it is both possible to set your heart upon earthly riches , and it is possible to avoid doing so . The same Father who has made us capable of achievement has also made a way to do exploits and yet possess a lowly mind . " Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man : thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues . " * ( Psalm 31:20 ) <p> Pride , then , is a mental attitude ; it is not attainment itself . An individual was once told , " I do n't  see how you can keep from being proud because you read so much . " But it was n't the amount of reading or retention that mattered ; it was the attitude of the heart toward the acquisition of knowledge . Jesus was full of goodness and success , but He rest unto your souls . " * ( Matthew 11:29 ) We can learn from Him how to be meek and lowly in heart , while conquering and overcoming through the power of God . Jesus was able to reply to the rich , young ruler , " Why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one , that is , God . " * ( Matthew 19:17 ) Now He was full of goodness , and the servant is as his Master , but the goodness comes from the indwelling God , and the attitude of the heart toward the virtue within is right , i.e. , lowly and humble . Jesus was quick to give the credit to God . Although He was God Himself , come down from heaven to offer Himself as an atonement for us , He quickly and reflexively gave the credit for virtue to His heavenly Father . It is this set of heart and mind that avoids the pride of life and lives in humble reliance upon God . <p> When the man stood in the temple and prayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what he had done was wrong , nor was it the fact that he was living more virtuously than other men that condemned him . It was appropriate and right that he was not an extortioner , or unjust , or an adulterer . It would have been wrong , a shame , and a disgrace if he had been guilty of those things . It was the attitude of his heart toward what virtue he had in his life that was dead wrong . He was wrong while he was right , at least in some things . The pride of his heart separated him from God . It kept the door of mercy closed against him . A far more reprehensible man beside him was able to humble himself and attain mercy . <p> You can readily see that an attitude of deep thankfulness and an attitude of pride are mutually exclusive . There is an independence of God and Gods bestowals in a proud outlook that renders any attempts at appreciation and gratitude as hollow and insincere . " Is not this great Babylon , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the might of my power , and for the honour of my majesty ? " * ( Daniel 4:30 ) Notice the independence from God in the declaration of Nebuchadnezzar . There is no acknowledgment whatsoever of how much this king owed his position and worldly success to the God of heaven . The proud Pharisee in the temple " stood and prayed thus with himself . " * ( Luke 18:11 ) He did not pray with God , who resisteth the proud and heareth the humble , but " with himself . " He went through the motions of giving credit to God , saying , " God , I thank thee , " * ( Luke 18:11 ) but it does not take much insight to see that he was not really leaning on the Lord to live with integrity , nor did he possess the accompanying graces from God that come with receiving His help . For the power and glory that comes from God to make His children overcomers also comes with full provisions for a deep feeling of unworthiness and gratitude . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not mine , For the love and the power and glory Belong to the Savior divine . " * <p> Before you can be delivered from pride and be a humble child of God , you must face this inner conviction that you believe that you are superior to others and you must come to an absolute certainty that there is no merit or goodness in you of yourself . Only inasmuch as God is present within you are you good , and then it is not your goodness , but His ( James 1:17 ) . It can not be overemphasized how needy we are of Gods help in this matter of discovering all pride within us . Verily , we can not do it by ourselves , no matter how rigorously we discipline ourselves . The awful irony is that the very vigor with which we pursue pride in ourselves will induce a hidden pride in that very effort . Proud of our attempts to get rid of pride ! Is it possible to escape the pride of life ? <p> Yes , a soul can wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision , Hebrews 11:40 ) that He will discover everything that needs to be discovered . This waiting is death to the flesh . It is a continuing confession of our needvery humiliating to our powers of reason , etc . But it is facing realitythe reality that only God can free us and keep us free of this deadly trait . And , in its essence , humility is simply a coming to terms with this reality : I am weak ; I am really weak ; really , I am weak ; I will always be weak ; always , I will be weak ; I need God ; I will always need God . How utterly , appallingly weak and needy I am ! I will never get to a place where I will not be so needy of Him . <p> There is nothing that I can do to escape my inherent weakness . Even being filled with the power of God does not change the fact that I , myself , continue to be weak . I can be full of might and power by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HisI am still weak in myself . <p> I repeat , it is not possible to get to this place without the help of the Holy Spirit , who alone knows all and how to bring what He knows to light in just the right way as to be of help . In every way , it is a personal Divine Revelation of the souls need to the mind and will . It is informative to an incredible degree in that wonderful way that God has of saying so much with such little said . He touches the keys to the soul in every case , unlocking and manifesting , revealing and convicting ; all with that wonderful tender love and hope that speaks better things than the best of the glory of the natural man . " Verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity . " we have to do . " * ( Hebrews 4:12-13 ) He reveals to us what we need to know to have and retain His approval , and the process is ongoing and precious beyond words . There is such an encouragement in it ! <p> " Hark ! I hear Hope sweetly singing Softly in an undertone , Singing as if God had taught her , It is better farther on. " * <p> With all this comes an overwhelming conviction of the rightness of Gods waywe plainly see and acknowledge our humble state . Listen to the conviction in these words : <p> Pride must die in you , or nothing of heaven can live in you . Under the banner of this truth , give up yourselves to the meek and humble Spirit of the holy Jesus . Humility must sow the seed , or there can be no reaping in heaven . Look not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility only as a decent virtue ; for the one is death , and the other is life ; the one is all hell , and the other is all heaven . <p> So much as you have of pride , so much you have of the evil one alive in you ; so much you have of true humility , so much you have of the Lamb of God within you . Could you see with your eyes what every stirring of pride does to your soul , you would beg of everyone you meet to tear the viper from you , though with the loss of an hand or an eye . Could you see what a sweet , divine , transforming power there is in humility how it expels the poison and makes room for the Spirit of God to live in you , you would rather wish to be the footstool of all the world than to want the smallest degree of it . <p> William Law ; Spirit of Prayer <p> Only when the soul is fully stirred and aroused to an understanding of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Him who is able to deliver in fervency and faith . <p> My experience has been that God will break something in you . Something that will help you to keep " prostrate in the dust " * before Him . It will be as Jacob , who wrestled with an angel all night to get help from God . He would not let go until he was blessed ; and finally , " the angel touched the hollow of Jacobs thigh ; and the hollow of Jacobs thigh was out of joint , as he wrestled with him . " * ( Genesis 32:25 ) " And the angel said unto Jacob , What is thy name ? And he said , Jacob . " * ( Genesis 32:27 ) This acknowledging of his name was a confession , for the name Jacob meant supplanter , i.e. , a sly individual , tricky and conniving , a person not to be trusted . This was what he washe had been named accurately . And the angel required him to acknowledge it . After this humbling experience , Jacob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His name was changed to Israel , and he was no longer the proud , sly Jacob , but he limped the rest of his life . <p> And thus it is when God touches us and breaks our self confidence before the awesome truth that " without Him we can do nothing , " * ( John 15:5 ) that is , nothing worthwhile . <p> Regarding the natural things of life , we limp . We have come face to face with a great reality , and it takes away our confidence in natural gifts , abilities , talents , energies , etc . With Brother Paul , we can say we have " no confidence in the flesh , " * ( Philippians 3:3 ) and we prove it , too , counting all else but dung that we might win Him and be found in Him ; that He might approve of us , use us , and dwell within . <p> " I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies , and of all the truth , which thou hast shewed unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When my inner image of myself is adjusted to my needy reality and I have accepted my poverty as a fact of life , then the door is opened for a deep and heart-felt gratitude . How impossible it is to be truly thankful without a humbled heart ! <p> The poet said , <p> " None but the holy and innocent sing , Out of a bosom where pleasures abide . " * <p> This is certainly true , but I would like to put another thought beside it : you can only know real thankfulness as your heart is humbled . <p> Just as there are certain vantage points of view in observing the landscape , etc. , there are places which open to us more perfectly the nature of our relationship with God , with His plan of salvation , and with our small part in the general scheme of things . It is needful to live very lowly to bear the yoke that God has for us with Him . How much damage is done by the pride of mens hearts ! How necessary it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of God ! Jesus commands us , " Take my yoke upon you , and learn of me ; for I am meek and lowly in heart . " * ( Matthew 11:29 ) <p> In the book A True Story in Allegory , written by Sister Lottie Jarvis , she writes of " The Taming School . " This was and is a way devised by the Apostasy family to control the preaching of the gospel wherever they can . Who were the best candidates for the preachers of apostasy ? " Grade One : This grade will be for those who are a little high-headed , self-sufficient or inclined thereto . " * Just as it is necessary to be very humble-minded to do the Lords work , it is just as necessary to be at least a little proud to do the devils work . <p> Some years ago , the author observed a number of precious people who had a great zeal for God , a real missionary burden , and a spirit of sacrifice to pay any price and endure any hardship . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord were letting down and compromising truth , and they abhorred that . They withdrew with a lot of blessing , high hopes , and confidence toward the future . I would to God they would have realized all they envisioned . <p> Years later , I was talking with one who had been part of that . " I noticed their pride , " he said , " but I reasoned that they had something to be proud about . " This brother was young in the Lord and did not realize that all the work of the Holy Spirit in people starts , continues , and ends with lots of humility . In spite of the high profession of these people , the pride was a dead give-away that something was badly amiss . Furthermore , the pride would hinder them from seeing their need . <p> Thus it has proved out . Soon a hierarchy began to manifest itself among them . One with more experience insisted that he prevail . As did Diotrephes in the Bible , he " loved to have the preeminence among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group accepted his dominance . He recognized some as more spiritual than others . In this way , an " inner circle " emerged . They lorded it over the others , all in the name of decency and order . The thrust and weight of such scriptures as Matthew 23:8-12 and 1 Peter 5:3,5-6 were ignored . If you had questioned what was happening , you might be answered by such scriptures as Hebrews 13:17 . This is the effect of pride . It exaggerates the direction in which it already has an inner inclination , until lines are crossed and sin is committed . The effect of pride among these dear people was such that the ministry were exalted to the place that should be occupied by the Holy Spirit alone . The entire spirit and nature of the people within the movement changed character as men submitted to men , thinking they were doing God service . <p> But you might say , " Does not this scripture in Hebrews 13:17 teach a submission to the ministry ? " Yes , but for it to be properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will not take advantage of the people whether by accident or design . Such a ministry will stay in the order of God , and that is the kind of ministry that was in the New Testament of which the writer of Hebrews was speaking . It was a ministry in which all children of Godthose anointed to preach the Word and those anointed to hear the Wordsubmitted to each other constantly in the Lord . " Yea , all of you be subject one to another , and be clothed with humility . " * ( 1 Peter 5:5 ) It was not just the hearers submitting to the Lord in the speakers , but the speakers submitting to the Lord in the hearers , also . <p> Back of all this subject of ministerial authority is the great fundamental difference in the Old Testament and the New . We find it in Hebrews 8:11 " And they shall not teach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others in the Old Testament dispensation because no one possessed the law of God written in the mind and heart that is the centerpiece of the New Testament . But in the New Testament , " all shall know me . " The Lord can and does use any as He sees fit , and others of His children hear His voice and submit . Yea , " a little child shall lead them , " * ( Isiah 11:6 ) as long as that little child is an earthen vessel for the solemn and august voice of God . For His sheep " know his voice . And a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him . " * ( John 10:4-5 ) <p> But in a given person or group of people , everything depends on their level of humility , which determines how much and how easily they are persuaded by what " seemeth right unto a man . " * ( Proverbs 14:12 ) A great dearth of self-sufficiency in a person will keep you waiting on God , for you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the people mentioned above . Their pride deceived them . They thought they were pretty special . In fact , there was and is definite traits in them of this scripture : " No doubt but ye are the people , and wisdom shall die with you . " * ( Job 12:2 ) Their human enthusiasm and elation were inspired by their flesh , rather than from heaven , though they knew it not . They were very sincere at first and wanted to do it right , and this seemed right . So they did it . They followed whatever seemed best to their ministry , and their ministry tried to do what seemed best to it , as well . <p> What followed was classic . Something else was leading , not the Spirit of God . God was faithful to them , but the little checks and warnings were ignored in the general excitement and determination to follow this path . A spirit of emotionalism characterized their meetings . They were full of enthusiasm for display and show , all in the name of demonstrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " The more they did ; the more strenuously they " strained at a gnat , and swallowed a camel , " * ( Matthew 23:24 ) the more highly they thought of themselves . They could not imagine any reason not to think highly of themselves . They really were superior in life , missionary outlook , and unity to everybody around ! They became impatient with humility in othersespecially others coming to them . It became synonymous in their minds with infantile feebleness , and was a thing to be left behind as soon as possible . <p> In this way , the door was opened to all kinds of errors and oppressions . For , just as humility is the door of entrance into every manifestation of Gods grace ( unmerited favor ) , pride is the entrance into all manner of evil work . Envy and strife came in like a flood in the absence of humility , and the movement would have fallen apart if the leadership had not clamped down a brutal and oppressive requirement to submit to them in everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to restrain the growth of pride . For Gods kingdom works by love for what 's right and this inner conviction of the soul that one needs and wants whatever God determines is best for oneself .

" * ( Philippians 2:3 ) <p> I will now quote a little from the writings of Brother Pink : <p> When I came in contact with this movement in 1903 , I met a people that manifested great love for each other , all spoke the same thing , and at least seemed to see eye to eye .

That humility led to instant obedience , even as the army of Israel was minimized more and more , completely contrary to all human reasoning and common sense . It also led to Divine deliverance with all kinds of implications for good ( Judges 7:2 ) . <p> And thus we find Gods people " clothed with humility " * ( 1 Peter 5:5 ) everywhere in the sacred records .

" Every good gift and perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from the Father of lights . " * ( James 1:17 ) Do you congratulate yourself on your achievements ? Is thine heart lifted up in thine own estimation ? Do you say within thyself , " My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth ?

This text Conybeare and Howson render thus : " In honor let each set his neighbor above himself . " It reads as follows in Rotherhams translation : " In honor outdoing one another . " The word rendered prefer means " to take the lead " in being nothing . " Be ambitious to be unambitious . " Outdo each other in being humble and show this by preferring that others have all the honor . Some have grace enough to be willing that honors be given to another if they themselves can have equal honors ; but to the truly humble such grace is given as enables them to secretly desire all honor to be given to others . Is this your experience ? <p> Suppose that in company with three other brethren you went to pray for a man dying of consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days was a well and strong man . Someone , in telling of this wonderful healing , told who the other brethren were that prayed for the dying man , but failed to mention you .

Would you be really and truly glad if it should never come to the ears or minds of anyone that you , too , were present and prayed for the man ? O my brother , if you are humble , you will rejoice to be unknown and unnoticed . <p> At one time two brethren made a visit to some sisters . Several beautiful songs were sung by the sisters . Finally one of the brethren sang a very inspiring hymn . There was , however , but little comment upon the hymn . After the lapse of a few moments the brother asked whether any of the company had ever heard that hymn before . The reply was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord had given him that song down in the rural districts of one of the southern states . The point for the brother to examine closely is , Did he desire to magnify the Lord , and the Lord alone ? Or , did he have a secret desire to let the company know that he was the composer ? Self has a desire to be set forward , an itching to be noticed . The Apostle John would have said , " The Lord gave a disciple that song to His own glory . " How beautiful a grace is humility ! Self sometimes gets so cunning as to seek applause by seeming to shun it . <p> Now the same God that humbled Nebuchanezzar is able to humble you . He wants your consent , however .

@@72205553 @905553/ <h> An Example of Perverseness Towards Human History <p> We here quote from a history of the Polynesian people on the island of Tahiti : <p> Many Polynesian infants never drew a first breath because they were strangled by their parents , usually their fathers , before they could take a first breath . In many respects , though not all , this was the main means of birth control . ( Our corresponding one is abortion . ) And birth control was even more important to them on their finite little islandsin an earlier stage of the evolution of their culturethan ours is now in an overpopulated , finite globe . We are only just beginning to realize the absolute necessity of abortion . You may cringe , as the missionaries did , at what they considered the unspeakable horror of infanticide , but if a fetus is to be curtailed , what really is the difference between three months and nine ? Mind you , the importance to the Tahitian of a babys first breath . If the mother wished to and was able to trick the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fetch the orange-colored plantain , or going to carry a present to his sister on the other side of the island , or whatever , an hour before delivery , so that when he returned the infant was breathing , no power or spirit would make him go through with his obligation to snuff out the life . Because , with the first breath , life had begun , and no social law told him to be a murderer . His duty to society , and also the mothers to social survival , was to abort the life before it started . So let that be the first contrast to our mores . <p> Edward Dodd ; The Rape of Tahiti <p> Note the perverse tone of this narrative . It is stubbornly dishonest . It contends that the Polynesian people had to do as they did " the absolute necessity of abortion . " Here is immorality stifling the conscience by contending that murder is necessary for survival . The same author professes admiration for the " innocence " of these individuals , their " childlikeness , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who discovered them and removed their isolation from the rest of the world did them a great disservice . Thus is perpetuated the myth of the " noble savage , " violated and ravaged in his primitive purity by the corrupting mores of modern civilization . Thus is preached the doctrine that morality is hypocritical and unnecessary . What a perverse , unbelieving spirit is manifested in all this ! Thoroughly dishonest , it picks through the history of man , carefully selecting what few evidences can be twisted into a show of support for its unholy affections . <p> To get a better idea of what happened on Tahiti , we can read a history of the people of the Hawaiian islands . The author of this work spells out an account of the end of a people who embrace the spirit of adultery and sexual uncleanness : <p> Women started childbearing in their early teens . Families of twenty children and more were commonplace . <p> And this propagation was heartily encouraged by chiefs , since the importance of their domains was measured in part by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , little sentiment was expended by parents on their young offspring , and many of them never survived . Family ties were loose , principally because few mothers could ever be quite sure who had fathered a child . " For husbands to interchange wives and for wives to interchange husbands , " explained historian Sheldon Dibble , " was a common act of friendship , and persons who would not do this were not considered on good terms of sociability . When a solicitation is made , they seem to imagine that to comply is generous , liberal and social , and to refuse is reproachful and niggardly . From this confused state of things it will be understood at once that there could be little or no attachment in the various domestic relations . " <p> Children came easily and regularly , and there were so many of them that they were seldom kept together as brothers and sisters . They were freely exchanged or given away like other possessions , so that many children never knew who their real parents were , and the parents themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unceremoniously put out of the way ; others were neglected ; sickly ones were placed out of sight and sound where their cries would not be disturbing , and allowed to languish and waste away . <p> In an amoral society , there was no one to condemn either abortion or infanticide . Both were accepted without qualms of conscience . Still the survival rate of the young at least balanced the death rate of adults . <p> W. Storrs Lee ; The Islands <p> What we are reading about is the disintegration of the family unit entirely through unrestrained licentiousness and promiscuity . The spirit of perverseness contends that this is " natural " and " wholesome . " It was not . The same author paints us a picture of what it was like to live in such a society : <p> " As you are passing the outskirts of some city or village , " dramatized historian Dibble , " you behold a wretched woman carrying something to a secluded spot . You observe her as she stops , lays down her burden and digs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is about to bury ? Her own smiling infant . The child perhaps is sick and troubles her . She stifles its cries for a moment with her hand , thrusts it into the grave prepared , covers it with a little earth and tramples it down while struggling yet in the agonies of death . <p> " But wait and look around a little , " he continued , " and you will find that this is not the first grave she has dug . Perhaps this may be the fifth or the seventh child she has disposed of in the same way , and for many of them perhaps for no better motives than to rid herself of trouble or to leave herself more free for sensual pleasure and vicious indulgence . " <p> A missionary wife accidentally discovered that her own serving girl , Pali , and the young brother who always accompanied her were the sole survivors of a family of ten children . The other eight had all been buried alive , and the brother lived only because Pali had followed her mother to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islands <p> Here is a true picture of sin . Conscience seared and any sense of responsibility trampled . The vulnerability of the innocent . <p> We also need to understand sin in its true color : deforming , defiling , breaking of the righteous law , affronting an awful majesty , profaning a sovereign crown by casting it to the ground . We need to see sin as sin is . But to do this we must be under the influence and inspiration of the Holy Spirit . It is only then that sin appears exceedingly sinful . Even if saved people get too far out from under the influence of the Holy Spirit , sin will not look as bad to them as it actually is . <p> Ostis B. Wilson ; The Nature of Sin <p> The Bible speaks of the hardening effect of the deceitfulness of sin ( Hebrews 3:13 ) . It tells us that the wicked human heart is wicked above all things to the extent that it is impossible for man to know himself and the full effect of his sinful behavior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremiah 17:9 ; John 16:7-8 ) . Except the Lord dealt with each of us , we would have no chance at all ; we would not know sin as sin truly is . But , when God has dealt with us , and a certain amount of light has been cast on our condition , the question is then what we will do with what we are convicted of . Will we humble and acknowledge and seek for help , or will we resist conviction and make excuses ? This latter course will lead to perverseness . It actually results in men attempting to bend truth to suit their inclinations . <p> These truths cast light on the heart condition of Mr. Edward Dodd , the Tahitian historian quoted at the beginning of this article . Mr. Dodd is not appalled at the gross immorality practiced by the Polynesian people . One senses that he thinks it is " natural , " even " healthy . " He has walked down this path of perverseness long enough that it has deceived him into thinking that the murder of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of all truth .

" * ( Luke 6:31 ) Mr. Dodd was able to write his perverse thinking because someone spared his life when he was helpless and took care of him when he was innocent and vulnerable . In thus debasing human life by claiming the right to snuff it out at will , Mr. Dodd devalues his own life . He makes a mockery of all that is decent and honorable for his soul ? " * ( Matthew 16:26 ) but this perverse Mr. Dodd would put us on the level of the beasts : " Its time to cull the ( human ) herd ; it is inconvenient to have so many children running about . " <p> One does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the folly of this deception . A little honesty , a little attentiveness to the conscience , a little discernment of the results of sin in the history of men are more than enough to convict the mind of any serious thinker . We will quote again from W. Storrs Lee , the historian of the Hawaiian people : <p> Yet Hawaiians were perishing en masse before the march of civilization . Actually they had been indulging in an orgy of self-destruction long before the influx of disease-carrying foreigners , so great an orgy that only a phenomenal birth rate could account for anything like a " teeming population . " For them life was cheap , and death held no fears . They could afford to live recklessly and kill recklessly . The carnage of their pitched battles taxed credulity ; the scale of their wars was Homeric . <p> Nearly a century after the coming of the white men , acres of battlefields , like Diamond Head Crater on Oahu and Keei on Hawaii , still glistened with bleached skeletons of slain warriors . And these bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies relentlessly sought out the families and supporters of the vanquished enemy to prolong the slaughter over periods of weeks and months . " When discovered , they are cruelly massacred on the spot , " lamented William Ellis , " or brought down to the king and chiefs to die perhaps , to live perhaps . " John Young testified in his old age that he had seen thousands massacred in the wars of extermination . <p> The mortality from interisland and intertribal clashes alone would have prostrated a less resilient and less prolific people . And between wars the demand of priests for human sacrifices and the enforcement of capital punishment for violation of taboos constituted a steady drain on the population . Temple kahunas possessed a powerful incentive for the enforcement of taboos , for violators all made acceptable candidates for sacrifice on the altars of the gods . <p> " The restrictions of the chiefs and priests were like the poisoned tooth of a reptile , " observed the dispassionate young adventurer Francis Olmsted . " If the shadow of a common man fell upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mantle or malo of a chief , it was death ; if he went upon the house of a chief , it was death . If a man was found standing on those occasions when he should prostrate himself , viz. , when the Kings bathing water or his tapa or his malo , were carried along , it was death . So , too , if he continued standing at the mention of the kings name in song , it was death . If he was irreligious , he suffered death ; if he indulged in connubial pleasure on a taboo day , he paid the same penalty ; if he made a noise while prayers were saying , he met a like fate . If a woman ate pork , cocoanuts , bananas , a certain kind of fish , or lobster , it was death . So , too , was it death to be found in a canoe on a taboo day . " Added to these were a great many other causes of premature death , like participation in too dangerous and chancy sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accidents at sea and in the high mountains , not to mention the occasional depopulation of whole villages by tidal waves and lava flows . Flirting with death was a favorite Hawaiian occupation . <p> Yet , despite this rampant slaughter , in the years before the intrusion of foreigners , the throngs of growing youth always seemed to keep pace with the death toll . Women started childbearing in their early teens . Families of twenty children and more were commonplace . <p> W. Storrs Lee ; The Islands <p> With the coming of men from America and Europe , a judgment came upon this promiscuous peoplethe scourge of venereal disease was loosed upon the population . The same visitation that restrained men and women in other parts of the world came to the islands . <p> Under influence of the killer , what little family adhesiveness once existed deteriorated further . The incentive for bringing up large families was lost . Raising children was not worth the struggle . They were expensive in labor and taxes , an extravagance , a burden , an encumbrance . Infants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the number of surviving children was shockingly reduced . Where there had once been families of twenty sons and daughters , two were more than enough . <p> Puzzled by the small size of family groups , William Ellis pried into the reasons for it on his extensive tour of Hawaii . He concluded : <p> We have long known that the Sandwich Islanders practiced infanticide , but had no idea of its extent until we made various inquiries . It prevails throughout all the islands , and , with the exception of the higher class of chiefs , is , as far as we could learn , practiced by all ranks of people . However numerous the children among the lower orders , parents seldom rear more than two or three , and many spare only one ; all the others are destroyed sometimes shortly after birth , generally during the first year of their age . It is painful to think of the numbers thus murdered . <p> Missionaries commonly agreed that at least two-thirds of the children had perished at the hands of parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons the trouble of bringing them up , the handicap of roving about with young ones in tow , the annoyance of their crying , the bother of feeding them , deformities and trying illnesses of one sort or another . In fits of jealousy mothers killed the favorite child of their husbands , and in retributive fits , husbands killed the wifes favorite . They suffocated them , strangled them , beat them to death , dashed them on stones , but most frequently buried them alive . <p> Some paradise on earth , was n't it ? In spite of all that the spirit of perverseness might claim , the truth of the matter is that " Righteousness exalteth a nation : but sin is a reproach to any people . " * ( Proverbs 14:34 ) <p> The ultimate effect of the sin of these people was destruction : <p> By 1900 their total population was down to less than thirty thousand , one-tenth of what it had been before foreigners inflicted upon the Islanders their diseases , their western worries , their monetary values , their horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ibid . <p> This was an awful fact , though by no means unusual in the history of man . Sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily ( Ecclesiastes 8:11 ) , but every transgression receives , in time , a just recompense ( Hebrews 2:2 ) . A large part of the history of mankind is the sinning and the reaping . <p> What do you suppose is the attitude of the spirit of perverseness toward such a disaster of such unconcealed proportions ? A little humbling , perhaps ? Some degree of abashment ? <p> There had to be a popular scapegoat to carry the blame for such decimation , and the handiest one was the body of missionaries , nonmedical and medical . By insisting on dressing the natives in holokus and cotton pants , by helping to destroy their dance and sports , by discouraging bathing in the nude , by tampering with the superior diet of fish and poi , by introducing them to culture and letters that completely changed their manner of living , the missionaries undoubtedly contributed to the physical decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been given a free hand , without missionary intervention , the Hawaiians most certainly would have been virtually annihilated .

What a lot of truth and fact this conclusion would ignore ! <p> Late in the century clusters of journalists without too many chips on their shouldersmen like Richard Henry Dana and Mark Twainweighed the arguments and went on record unequivocally in favor of the missionaries . But no affirmation counted for more than that of worldly John Young , who knew the kingdom intimately both before and after the arrival of the New England apostles .

And what I read gripped me , for it seemed written just for me : <p> These vessels therefore were for some other use than for formal worship in the house of the forest of Lebanon . The best way then , that I know of , to find out what they were is first to consider to what they are joined in the mention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them with Solomons drinking vessels , and since as they were made of fine or pure gold , I take them also to be vessels of the same kind , namely , vessels to drink in . Now if we join to this the state of the church in the wilderness , of which , as we have said , this house of the forest of Lebanon was a type , then we must understand that by these vessels were prefigured such draughts as the church has , when in a bewildered or persecuted state . And they are of two sorts : either , first , such as are exceeding bitter ; or , second , such as are exceeding sweet ; for both these attend a state of war . <p> First . Such as are exceeding bitter . These are called cups of red wine , signifying blood ; also , the cup of the Lords fury , the cup of trembling , the cup of astonishment , etc .

See the Lamentations and you will find all this verified . See also Revelation 11:3 , 12:2 . And whoso considers what has already been said as to what the house of the forest of Lebanon met with , will find that what is here inferred is not foreign but natural . For , can it be imagined , that when the king of Assyria laid down his army by the sides of Lebanon , and when the fire was to devour her cedars , also when Lebanon was to be cut down and languish , that these vessels , these cups , were not then put into her hand .

The afflictions , therefore , that the church in the wilderness hath met with , these cups of gold , are of more worth than are all the treasures of Egypt ; they are needful and profitable , and praiseworthy also , and tend to the augmenting of our glory when the next world is come ( 1 Thessalonians 3:3 ; Revelation 2:10 ; 1 Peter 1:6 ) . Besides they are signs , tokens , and golden marks of love , and jewels that set off the beauty of the church in the sight of God the more ( Galatians 6:17 ; Revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means by which men are proved sound , honest , faithful , and true lovers of God , as also such whose graces are not counterfeit , feigned , or unsound , but true , and such as will be found to praise , and honour , and glory , at the appearing of Jesus Christ ( Isaiah 27:9 ; Hebrews 12:7-10 ; 1 Peter 2:19 ; 2 Corinthians 4:17-18 ; 2 Thessalonians 1:5 ) . And this has been the cause that the men of our church in the wilderness have gloried in tribulation , taking pleasure in reproaches , in necessities , in persecutions , and in distresses for Christs sake ( Romans 5:3 ; 2 Corinthians 12:9-10 ) . Yea , this is the reason why they have bidden one another rejoice when they fell into divers temptations , saying , " Blessed is the man that endureth temptation , " * ( James 1:12 ) and , " Behold , we count them happy which endure . " * ( James 5:11 ) And again , " if ye be reproached for the name of Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4:14 ) These therefore are vessels of pure gold , though they contain such bitter draughts , and though such as at which we make so many wry faces before we can get their liquor down . <p> Do you think that a Christian , having even this cup in his hand to drink it , would change it for a draught of that which is in the hand of the woman that sits on the back of the scarlet-coloured beast ? ( Revelation 17:3-4 ) . No , verily , for he knows that her sweet is poison , and that his bitter is to purge his soul , body , life , and religion , of death ( 2 Timothy 2:11-12 ) . God sends His love tokens to His church two ways , sometimes by her friends , sometimes by her enemies . When they come by the hand of a friend , as by a minister , a brother , or by the Holy Ghost , then they come smoothly , sweetly , and are taken , and go down like honey . But when these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy , then they are handed to them roughly ; Pharaoh handed love tokens to them roughly ; the king of Babylon handed these love tokens to them roughly . They bring them of malice , God sends them of love ; they bring them and give them to us , hoping they will be our death ; they give us them therefore with many a foul curse , but God blesses them still . Did not Haman lead Mordecai in his state by the hand of anger ? Nor is this cup so bitter but that our Lord Himself drank deep of it before it was handed to His church ; He did as loving mothers do , drink thereof Himself to show us it is not poison , also to encourage us to drink it for His sake and for our endless health ( Matthew 20:22 , 26:39,42 ) . And , as I told you before , I think I do not vary from the sense of the text in calling them cups ; because , though there they have no name , they are joined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the type , so they are also joined here ; therefore the cup here is called Christs cup . " Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of ? Ye shall drink indeed of my cup . " * ( Matthew 20:22-23 ) Here you see they are joined in a communion in this cup of affliction , as the cups in one and the same breath are joined with those king Solomon drank in , which he put in the house of the forest of Lebanon . <p> John Bunyan ; The House of the Forest of Lebanon <p> " Who will suffer with the Savior ? Take the little that remains Of the cup of tribulation Jesus drank in dying pains ? <p> " Who will offer soul and body On the altar of our God ? Leaving self and worldly mammon , Take the path that Jesus trod ? <p> " Who will suffer for the gospel , Follow Christ without the gate ? Take the martyrs for example , With them glory at the stake ? <p> " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who will dare the truth to herald , At the peril of his life ? <p> " Soon the conflict will be over , Crowns await the firm and pure ; Forward , brethren , work and suffer , Faithful to the end endure . " * <p> I remembered Paul had said to the Colossians , " and I fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his bodys sake . " * ( Colossians 1:24 ) Naturally , I thought the suffering had been accomplished at the cross ; but being presented with the fact that there was left on purpose room for me to suffer , I began to weep . For I saw , in a very real sense , how much the Savior had suffered to give me the precious gift of forgiveness . If I suffered so much in my inadequacies in learning to be a homemaker , doing my best to obey His will , how I could I even vaguely comprehend how much He had suffered that I could be changed from being a servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't really comprehend ; but it was beautiful to gaze uponHis love for me had gone deeper than I ever had supposed . <p> " So , will you drink of the cup I have drunk of already ? " He gently asked me . <p> I sat on my bed , thinking . He had already tasted itHe knew it was bitter , the prayer in the garden of Gethesame showed that . His hope had seemed cut off , like He suffered in vain . He knew how I feltwho would want a girl who had had a record of being so dumb as to not pick up the joys of knowing how to put a house in order and run it with a confident hand ? <p> Many others had accepted the cup of suffering , martyrs are an excellent example . It seemed they sang to me : <p> " Who will suffer with the Savior ? Take the little that remains Of the cup of tribulation Jesus drank in dying pains ? " <p> And so I pledged and promised Him that I would drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had He not said , " My grace is sufficient for thee " ? Yes , He had . <p> From that hour , I began to change . Mind you , not the circumstances , but I began to change . I found a gem of wisdom in a book about scheduling information upon which I changed a few of the ways I was doing laundry and cooking chores . And behold , the glory of the King touched and blessed the change , and I began toyes , you guessed itenjoy the laundry and cooking . They became exciting activities ! Instead of the unshakable mindset of dumb-things-I-have-to-do ( because they must be doneand how on earth can other people find pleasure in doing them ? ) , they became alive to me , exciting to me , challenging for me to figure out their peculiar little secrets ( like in cooking , and in laundry , how to be the most efficient as possible ) @ @ @ @ @ light shined. " * ( Isaiah 9:2 ) For Jesus came to help those that dwell in the shadows of death , and to me those activities were as dead as a doornail , so to speak , for they did not challenge my mind whatsoever , rather they dulled it . And so Gods great light came into this home , and my heart began to glow with the riches of His grace . Every new challenge I breathed a prayer over until it became a victory , and then how my countenance did shine ! It was wonderful to work with Him beside me ; oh , yes , how I do love Him ! <p> I had found what the martyr Pomponius Algerius meant when he wrote : <p> The heat of the prison to me is coldness ; the cold winter to me is a fresh spring-time in the Lord . He that feareth not to be burned in the fire , how will he fear the heat of weather ? Or what careth he for the pinching frost , which burneth with the love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them that be guilty ; but to the innocent and guiltless it is mellifluous . Here droppeth the delectable dew ; here floweth the pleasant nectar ; here runneth the sweet milk ; here is plenty of all good things . And although the place itself be desert and barren , yet to me it seemeth a large walk , and a valley of pleasure ; here to me is the better and more noble part of the world . Let the miserable worldling say , and confess , if there be any plot , pasture , or meadow , so delightful to the mind of man , as here . Here I see kings , princes , cities , and people ; here I see wars , where some be overthrown , some be victors , some thrust down , some lifted up . Here is Mount Sion ; here I am already in heaven itself . Here standeth first Christ Jesus in the front ; about him stand the old fathers , prophets , and evangelists , apostles , and all the servants of God ; of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , some open the sacraments unto me , some comfort me , other some are singing about me : and how then shall I be thought to be alone , among so many , and such as these be , the beholding of whom to me is both solace and example . <p> Now then , if to die in the Lord be not to die but live most joyfully , where is this wretched worldly rebel , which blameth us of folly , for giving away our lives to death ? Oh , how delectable is this death to me ! To taste the Lords cup , which is an assured pledge of true salvation ; for so hath the Lord himself forewarned us , saying , the same that they have done to me , they will also do unto you . Wherefore let the doltish world , with his blind worldlings ( who in the bright sunshine , yet go stumbling in darkness , being as blind as beetles ) , cease thus unwisely to carp against us for our rash suffering , as they count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which said that the disciple can not be above his master , nor the servant above his Lord . The same Lord hath also commanded that every one shall take up his cross and follow him ( Luke 9 ) <p> quoted in The House of the Forest of Lebanon , by John Bunyan <p> For if we take up His cross to follow Him , He will not leave us alone with the weight and gloom of it . Oh , no . He comes and changes the cross , and it becomes a treasure house , a delectable place : <p> " The voice of my beloved ! behold , he cometh leaping upon the mountains , skipping upon the hills . " * ( Song of Solomon 2:8 ) thy countenance is comely . " * ( Song of Solomon 2:14 ) <p> Sometimes the Master seems to like the strangest placesas in a cleft of rock , or under some stairsjust tell me what is so beautiful about those places ? But if you go with Him , one , and come away , " * ( Song of Solomon 2:10 ) it is beautiful wherever He goes , that is , if you love Him . For He is one in ten thousand . Or as Solomon put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Song of Solomon 5:10 ) It is Him , His voice , His countenance that makes anywhere He chooses to go so lovely . <p> And so it was that later I picked up the now precious passage of the bitter cup , and read on : <p> But these are not all the cups that belong to the house of the forest of Lebanon , or rather to the church in the wilderness ; there is also a cup , out of which , at times , is drunk what is exceeding sweet . It is called the cup of consolation , the cup of salvation ; a cup in the which God Himself is ( Psalm 116:13 ; Jeremiah 16:7 ) . As he said , the Lord is the portion of my cup . Or rather , " The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup . " * ( Psalm 16:5 ) This cup , they that are in the church in the wilderness have usually for an after-draught to that bitter one that went before . Thus , as tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their palate after they have drank a bitter potion , so God gives His the cups of salvation and consolation , after they have suffered awhile . " For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us , so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ . " * ( 2 Corinthians 1:5 ) Hence the apostle assureth himself concerning the affliction of them at Corinth ; yea , and also promiseth them , that as they were partakers of the sufferings , so should they be of the consolation ( 2 Corinthians 1:7 ) . <p> Some of these cups are filled until they run over , as David said his did , when the valley of the shadow of death was before him . " Thou preparest a table before me , " said he , " in the presence of mine enemies : thou anointest my head with oil ; my cup runneth over . " * ( Psalm 23:5 ) This is that which the apostle calls exceeding ; that is , that which is beyond measure . " I am , " says he , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our tribulation . " * ( 2 Corinthians 7:4 ) <p> Now he has one answering the other . " Thou hast made summer and winter . " * ( Psalm 74:17 ) Thou hast made the warm beams of Thy sun answerable to the cold of the dark night . This may be also yet signified by the building of this house , this type of the church in the wilderness , in so pleasant a place as the forest of Lebanon was ( Song of Solomon 4:8 ) . Lebanon ! Lebanon was one of the sweetest places in all the land of Canaan . Therefore we read of the fruit of Lebanon , of the streams from Lebanon ; the scent , the smell , the glory of Lebanon ; and also of the wine and flowers of Lebanon ( Psalm 72:16 ; Hosea 14:6-7 ; Isaiah 35:2 , 9:13 ; Nahum 1:4 ) . Lebanon ! That was one thing that wrought with Moses to desire that he might go over Jordan ; namely , that he might see that goodly mountain , and Lebanon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also setteth forth , by comparing of her to Lebanon . " Thy lips , O my spouse , " says He , " drop as the honeycomb : honey and milk are under thy tongue , and the smell of thy garment is like the smell of Lebanon . " * ( Song of Solomon 4:11 ) This house , therefore , being placed here , might be to show how blessed a state God could make the state of His church by His blessed grace and presence , even while she is in a wilderness condition . <p> John Bunyan ; The House of the Forest of Lebanon <p> Girls , you may be in a wilderness condition , being unmarried , and perhaps your hope is quite dim , but look what God has for you . If we want the beauty of a home and family of our own , we must drink first the cup He gives to us , and it may be bitter to our taste . And He knows , for He has tasted it first ; but when we have drained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of consolation . And that cup is so very sweetunfathomably sweet .
