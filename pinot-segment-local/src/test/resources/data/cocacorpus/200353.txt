Biometric device management <p> In earlier versions of Windows , biometric authentication and management of biometric devices ( fingerprint sensors ) required third-party software that might or might not integrate well with the OS . Now its built in so Windows 7 includes the Windows Biometric Framework , which gives developers an API they can use to build biometrics into applications . Makers of fingerprint sensor hardware , such as UPEK and AuthenTec , worked with Microsoft on the development of the Framework allowing biometric devices to be managed through a Control Panel applet <p> Faster Boot Times Better Performance <p> One of the biggest complaints about Vista was related to the amount of time it took to boot so Microsoft took significant steps to improve this with Windows 7 .

Breakthroughs and innovations are carried across the ranges , so they are constantly improved , upgraded and developed . We 're also investing in future form factors and interfaces , to make our drives more compatible with and adaptable to emerging technologies . <p> All our drives incorporate proven , award-winning technologies , including self-testing and analysis tools to signal any potential drive problems . Key components are manufactured to the highest standards , so users can always be sure of a reliable as well as powerful performance .

The Smart Command Transport feature set includes the ability to log the temperature at regular intervals this can be reported to the system , or could be used in field returns to see the history of the drive temperature for failure analysis . <p> Thermal Fly-height Control The need for ever-more sophisticated surveillance systems with higher data storage capacities means finding innovative solutions for fundamental magnetic recording technology issues . In this context , a pressing issue is how to effectively read data and write new data over a wide range of operating temperatures . For many product generations , Hitachi used an on-board thermal sensor so the operating temperature can be monitored , and in turn the write current could be adjusted to compensate for changes to the head mechanical fly-height . But in 2006 , we introduced Thermal Fly-height Control on the Travelstar and Deskstar families , which helps create more consistent spacing between the read/write elements and the recording disk . Fly height is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important parameter affecting error rate performance . A key variable of fly-height is the read/write element protrusion towards the recording disk . This protrusion changes with temperature and read/write duty cycle , affecting the spacing to the recording disk . Using an integrated heating element in the head allows direct control of the head read/write element protrusion . <p> Low power idle Consumers and manufacturers are demanding greener , less power-hungry products . Which is why we 've developed hard drive models which use less power but do n't compromise performance . These drives are designed to switch to a low wattage idle power mode if recording or playback pauses for longer periods . They require smaller power supplies and less cooling , which may help extend the life of the hard drive and the host product <p> Load/unload and advanced power management Today 's disk surfaces are very smooth , with minimal texturing to reduce stiction .

Ramp load/unload allows a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also provides addition resistance to non operating shock , resulting in impressive power reduction . Many of our hard drives also incorporate Advanced Power Management capabilities , which significantly lower the power consumption of hard drives while they 're in idle mode . <p> Error handling Hitachi GST drives can be customized to handle errors for specific applications like set-top boxes or CCTV . SmoothStream and AV-zoning technologies have refined the way errors are handled by the hard drive , improving recovery times and contributing to a better overall experience for the end-user . WorkloadBulk data encryption Hitachi 's bulk data encryption uses a miniature processor directly on the hard drive to encode and decode the data , which frees the host computer 's CPU for other tasks , enabling users to protect data without impairing system performance , effectively putting data ' under lock and key ' SMART command transport protocol Our latest drives have been designed to improve data integrity and meet the deadlines in streaming applications . The SMART command transport protocol minimizes disruptions in stream delivery by adapting buffer management behavior and error recovery timing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because AV systems play and record streams of data , they place very different demands on a hard drive from traditional IT and computing applications . If the stream is interrupted , audio or video information can be lost , creating an unacceptable delay . Our patented SmoothStream technology , which delivers an integrated set of features and functions , helps Hitachi hard disk drives perform their best in audio/video applications . Hitachi SmoothStream technology enables a host device to control the drive 's error recovery processes . This feature tunes the drive to capture video data streams on a command by command basis , allowing integrators to mix different AV and IT applications on the same platform . AV-Zoning Some of our drives offer a special feature called AV-Zoning , which allows data recovery procedures to be defined differently for multiple partitions on the same drive . In this way , critical system data can be differentiated from time-critical video content , which may not require the same stringent data recovery measures . As a result , AV-Zoning helps ensure smooth video experience .

Typically when people hear mention of the words " shortage " and " NAND " they instinctively think back to the early days of solid state drives when supply was truly difficult , if not impossible , to find . But in this case we are talking about a situation that is far more manageable but does require resellers that are heavily vested in SSD to pay close attention to the market in order to properly navigate the situation . In order to do this it is helpful to understand what is causing the shortage , and to try to estimate how long it will last . <p> In terms of the shortage in NAND - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overall supply is being impacted by the transition to 3D NAND . As manufacturers like Intel , Samsung , Micron and Hynix convert their factories to 3D NAND they are taking previous production capacity off line to retool the factories . While the long term benefits of lower cost per gigabyte and increased storage capacity resulting from 3D NAND will benefit the growth of SSDs , the short term impact of less capacity is helping contribute to the supply shortage . Second , cell phone makers such as Apple who are getting ready to release new smart phones are consuming supply as they increase the storage on their new phones so this is pushing demand higher for NAND . Last , the market growth for solid state drives is not declining and is only expected to increase as SSDs continue to be deployed in data centers and notebooks , as well as make inroads into client PCs particularly for mainstream desktops .

@@23282879 @3282879/ <h> NAND Shortage Continues through 2017 <p> Back in August 2016 we posted a Blog regarding the shortage on NAND memory and the impact it was having on SSD supply . In the blog we outlined the major contributors to the shortage and gave an industry perspective on when supply may recover . Today we are posting this update because the more things change the more they stay the same . Simply put , NAND memory continues to be constrained as demand outpaces volume and the shortage is now expected by some to continue through 2017 and may extend into Q1 of 2018 . <p> Here is the updated Blog revised from August 2016 . <p> Weve heard a lot recently about the rapid changes in NAND technology that has been driving down the cost per gigabyte and increasing the storage capacity of Solid State Drives but these transitions are having an impact on NAND supply which has led to some shortages of popular size SSDs and some price increases on tier two brands . Typically when people hear mention of the words " shortage " and " NAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid state drives when supply was truly difficult if not impossible to find but in this case today as we are talking about a situation that is far more manageable but does require resellers that are heavily vested in SSD to pay close attention to the market in order to properly navigate the situation . In order to do this it is helpful to understand what is causing the shortage , and to try to estimate how long it will last ? <p> In terms of the shortage in NAND , that is being influenced by several factors . First , the overall supply is being impacted by the transition to 3D NAND . As manufacturers like Intel , Samsung , Micron and Hynix convert their factories to 3D NAND they are taking previous production capacity off line to retool the factories . In addition , the manufacturing process for 3D NAND is far more complex than that of 2D NAND so yields are still lower than expected . While the long term benefits of lower cost per gigabyte and increased storage capacity resulting from 3D NAND will benefit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity is helping contribute to the supply shortage . Second , cell phone makers are continuing to consume supply as they release new models and try to meet the consumer expectations for more storage . Last , the market growth for solid state drives is not declining and is only expected to increase as SSDs continue to be deployed in data centers and notebooks as well as make inroads into client PCs particularly for mainstream desktops . All these factors of less manufacturing capacity and increased demand are creating the shortage for NAND . <p> The next question is how long will the NAND shortage last and what will be the impact to mid-term SSD supply . This is always the million dollar question and the most difficult to answer . We do n't  think we will see shortages like we have in the past but we are already witnessing continued constraints on certain capacity stand-alone SSD drives .

@@23282880 @3282880/ <p> Now for most of us when we think about Intel products for the server market , we think of building block components like processors , server boards , cases , power supplies , solid state drives , high performance LAN , and even some select rackmount bare bones , but now Intel is offering something completely new in the way of turnkey servers fully integrated with memory , storage , LAN and more . <p> Whether you 're involved in Cloud Computing , Data Centers , or High Performance Computing , the server market is generating a significant amount of opportunity and growth for computer VARs . ASI has a long history and track record of providing this market with various solutions including server bare bones , or fully integrated and tested servers . <p> Perhaps one of our most strategic partnerships is with Intel . Intel Server processors , boards , and systems are renowned for their exceptional designs , delivering maximum processing power , excellent manageability , and high reliability , all backed by an industry leading three year warranty . Now Intel takes their server platforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin with Intel Server Building Blocks and add all the necessary hardware components including the Intel Xeon processors , memory , storage , RAID controller and Intel Remote Management Module to create a complete solution . <p> For those companies that build and brand their own servers , Intels new turnkey server solutions offer many advantages and benefits . These servers are completely integrated by Intel which means they are fully tested and validated using the same procedures as those performed on the Intel server boards . This helps ensure the highest levels of reliability and compatibility for the entire server , not just a specific component . In addition , Intel has one of the best warranties in the industry which not only includes three year coverage but also includes 24x7 technical support and advance warranty replacement of defective parts for Intel Technology Partners . For those familiar with Intel , this is not new for the Intel components but now the warranty covers all the non Intel parts installed in the turnkey server which would consist of the memory and hard drives , for example . <p> Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servers offered by ASI is that they all include Intel RMM ( Remote Management Modules ) which allow authorized users to gain access and control of the server as well as do remote diagnostics from any machine on the network . With service being a critical value add for many VARs , having the ability to access the server from a remote location can dramatically improve the level of support offered by the VAR . <p> In addition to Intel validation , warranty support , and remote access capability the Intel turnkey servers also save time and costs . Having the servers assembled , tested and ready to ship without operating system , which ASI can install , saves the VAR integration costs and assembly time allowing them to focus more on services and other value add offerings that are beneficial to the end clients and the reseller . <p> Intel Turnkey Servers are offered and available in stock from ASI in four base configurations but other choices within the rackmount family can be offered , so contact ASI for more details about custom designed Intel Turnkey Servers .

@@23282914 @3282914/ <p> As early technology advocates , gamers have long been a very important customer base for the channel , helping accelerate growth as they load their PCs with the fastest processor , best performing solid state drive and highest end graphics card . But over the past year as sales have doubled from 550,000 units to 1.2 million units worldwide , gaming monitors have become the new hot product for the PC Enthusiast . <p> While overall sales of monitors remained relatively flat with over 7 million units shipped through distribution in the US , gaming monitors with higher ASPs and higher profit margins represent a growth opportunity for resellers that focus on the high end PC market . With demand continuing to grow , more manufacturers such as Dell , HP , LG Electronics , Lenovo , Samsung , and AOC plan to release products in 2017 to join market leaders ASUS , BenQ , ViewSonic , and Acer . <p> For most computer users a monitor is a monitor with the main differences being screen size and resolution . While these factors are important to gamers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise detail and location of objects at a variety of distances . There are several advances in technology that help ensure the sharpness as well as the accuracy of these details by eliminating blur and smear , but among the two most notable are response time and refresh rates . <p> Pixel Response <p> Just like screen size , monitors come with a range of pixel response times that are influenced by a variety of factors including the type of panel technology implemented in the monitor . Response times are measured in milliseconds based on the amount of time it takes a pixel to transition from one shade of gray to another shade of gray ( GTG ) with the lower number indicating better performance . Response times range anywhere from 15ms to some recently announced monitors that can achieve 1ms . Gaming monitors should have a low pixel response time to reduce or eliminate smearing which can occur in high action games with fast moving objects . A fast pixel response time would ideally be 2ms or less but 4ms is said to be adequate . <p> Refresh Rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monitor to redraw the entire screen , is measured in Hertz . Standard monitors have a 60Hz refresh rate so the screen is refreshed 60 times per second . In games , fast moving objects or intense action scenes may appear blurry or have tearing , so gamers should look for monitors with at least 120Hz refresh rate which is already a requirement for 3D Technology , but will also help reduce blur or tearing in standard games . As of today , some monitors go as high as 144Hz . <p> Panel Technology <p> There are several types of display technologies and each has its advantages . The most common technology is Twisted Nematic ( TN ) panels which are popular for gaming monitors because they offer fast pixel response times and higher refresh rates but they may show color shifting when viewed from an angle . Vertical Alignment ( VA ) panels are known for their high native contrast ratio , robust colors , and ability to display deep blacks , but they are also known to produce noticeable ghosting effects , which can hurt gaming performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-around color quality , strong gray-scale performance , and wide viewing angles . IPS panels require other technologies so monitors that utilize these screens tend to have higher costs . In addition , they are subject to motion artifacts and can not match the pixel response time of TN panels . Customers may be hard pressed to determine the type of panel being used in a monitor , except for in the case of IPS which is well marketed because of the color quality at variable viewing angles and because Apple popularized the use of the term with their displays . In addition , IPS panels are widely used in touch solutions since pressing your finger on the screen does n't  cause trailing distortions . <p> G-Sync and FreeSync <p> Another popular feature among gamers is to look for monitors that use synchronization technology or adaptive refresh technologies to help reduce tearing and other motion artifacts . Both NVIDIA and AMD have introduced V-Sync solutions for their graphics cards . NVIDIAs solution is called G-Sync and AMD offers FreeSync . Both achieve the same result which is to give control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monitor , so the card can adjust to variable refresh rates resulting in a very smooth gaming experience . The implementation of the two solutions is however different . With NVIDIAs G-Sync , there is additional hardware that must be licensed from NVIDIA which means the monitor itself must have hardware that supports G-Sync as well as have Display Port 1.2a , and the graphics card must be a 650Ti or higher , so there is a cost premium for such technology . AMDs FreeSync does not require additional hardware on the monitor side but does require support for Adaptive Sync through the Display Port 1.2a specification . In addition , AMD requires a newer graphics card ( GCN 1.1 or later ) . While NVIDIAs G-Sync may be more costly , it has a distinct advantage over FreeSync in that if the action in the game drops below 40fps ( frames per second ) the frames are doubled to prevent tearing at the lower frame rates . <p> Solutions from ASI <p> ASI has partnerships with many display manufacturers including ViewSonic and ASUS who both have solutions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2ms or 1ms , as does ASUS , but with ASUS they also have monitors that support NVIDIA G-Sync technology as well as AMD FreeSync Technology . At the highest end ASUS has the PG2480Q which is a 24 " LCD with 1920x1080 resolutions , 1ms response time , 144Hz refresh rate that can be overclocked to 180Hz and supports NVIDIA G-Sync .

@@23282941 @3282941/ <p> Digitimes recently announced that the gaming notebook market would increase to 4.5 million units , which represents a 12.5% growth rate , with MSI expected to surpass ASUS to take the number one position as their sales surge from 900,000 units in 2015 to 1.2 million in 2016 . While ASUS and MSI , who make up over 50% of the gaming notebook market , expect continued growth , there are several factors that are influencing this vertical segment . <p> NVIDIA GTX 10 ( Pascal ) <p> NVIDIAs latest graphics controllers , code name Pascal , give notebooks a unique GPU that is delivering performance that is a quantum leap over the previous generation of products because the mobile versions are not speced down models of the desktop card , so they have the same core specification as the desktop part : the same CUDA core count , and the same boost clock . The only exception is the GTX 1070 which has a lower boost clock speed but has more CUDA cores than the desktop part . The end result is that the GTX 1060 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will perform nearly the same as those found in desktops . The only variations being the result of the different thermal solutions found in notebooks which could impact boost clocks and drop the overall performance in certain games . Resellers do n't  need to worry about identifying the model number for purchasing the mobile versions of the GTX 10 series because these are GPU chips only available to the notebook manufacturers . <p> Virtual Reality <p> Another market factor that is expected to continue the growth rate for gaming systems including notebooks is Virtual Reality , which is expected to become a new trend in 2017 . The Nvidia GTX 10 series , driven by NVIDIA VRWorks , is designed to enhance VR performance with the lowest latency , and includes VR audio physics and also provides plug-n-play compatibility with leading headsets . In addition , MSI has recognized the potential of virtual reality on the gaming market so they created their own VR Lab to optimize their laptops for virtual reality , allowing them to be the first and only gaming notebook brand to be certified by HTC Vive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gaming Market <p> The interactive experience being made possible by virtual reality along with the dramatic performance improvements being made as a result of the NVIDIA GTX 10 series graphics cards , as well as those achieved from Intels 6th Generation Core processors , are extremely compelling to gamers who refresh their systems on average every 2 years compared to mainstream desktop users who refresh every 4 to 5 years . This focus on having the latest technologies to take advantage of improved features and capabilities has long been a driving factor that makes the gaming segment unique for both notebooks and desktops . <p> NVIDIA GTX 1080 Notebooks <p> Although there are fewer manufacturers offering gaming notebooks , the segment has received a lot of attention from resellers and with its continued growth . The main manufactures being Alienware ( Dell ) , HP , ASUS , Gigabyte , Clevo , Acer , and MSI are looking to offer more models to provide a larger variety of models to the entire channel . MSI has begun to release next-generation gaming notebook models ranging from 14 to 18 inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and GTX 1060 discrete graphics card , but as with any new product the demand for the higher end GTX 1080 is greater than the supply so there are some temporary constraints on this specific model . Supply for the GTX1060 and GTX 1070 GPU is much better so MSI notebooks that use those chips have better stock and availability . To differentiate from its competitors , MSI has made improvements in the devices ' industrial design , materials , heat dissipation and sound quality . <p> Wearable compute devices which are primarily made up of smart watches , wristbands , and ear wear , are expected to ship 125.5 million units in 2017 , according to data from IDC Worldwide Quarterly Wearab ... <p> As early technology advocates , gamers have long been a very important customer base for the channel , helping accelerate growth as they load their PCs with the fastest processor , best performing solid ... <p> Now for most of us when we think about Intel products for the server market , we think of building block components like processors , server boards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfo ... <p> While most of the traditional markets in the computer sector have struggled to find growth , several verticals have proven to be extremely successful , maybe none more than the security surveillance mar ... <p> SSDs have been making significant gains in market share at the expense of hard disk drives for the past several years .

@@23282943 @3282943/ <h> All In One <h> All-In-One <p> Based on the simple idea of combining the computer components ( MB , CPU , Memory , HD , and so on ) into the back of the monitor to reduce the amount of space needed for the PC , All in One computers or AIO 's have been available in the market for some time but the product category had limited growth mainly due to the proprietary designs which made service and support difficult particularly for system integrators . Fortunately that is no longer the case since Intel , in an effort to enable BTO resellers , developed standards for the Thin Mini ITX motherboard platform . This was a significant step in the evolution of the AIO , because Intel 's involvement has been crucial in helping build a stronger ecosystem of suppliers which brings greater variety , improves serviceability , and helps reduce cost which are all key benefits for resellers . <p> AIO computers offer many advantages that make them ideal for a variety of markets and usage models that are helping to drive growth and user acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems shipped worldwide is small compared to the more mature desktops , laptops and tablets , the share of all-in-one PCs as a percentage of total desktop shipments has continued to increase . In fact , in 2016 , AIO shipments topped 12.11 million units compared to desktops at 116.8 million units so AIOs now account for over 10% of all desktops sold and that number is projected to continue to grow and be over 11% by 2018 . <p> The questions are why are AIOs experiencing a growth pattern where all the discussion or expectation for growth is with notebooks or tablets . There are several reasons businesses , schools , and consumers are considering as well as purchasing AIO . <p> 1 . Touch Screen With the release of Windows 8/8.1 and now with Windows 10 , Microsoft began the process of transitioning the market to a new OS that uses touch to improve user efficiency and provides the same experience across a wide range of devices from cell phones to computers . AIOs provide a natural platform for the integration of touch technology for users looking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As touch usage continues to grow , cost will continue to decline resulting in touch becoming a standard feature on the AIO platform . <p> 2 . Low Power , low noise AIO systems use external AC adapters , utilize lower watt processors and as a result have few if any fans . This not only reduces noise but also lowers power consumption . <p> 3 . Full Features and customization With Intels involvement in the AIO category and the development of the ThinminiITX motherboard form factor , AIO systems based on this standard are not only customizable in terms of processor option , memory size , storage capacity and OS options but system integrators can also add advanced features like vPro as well as provide features commonly found in notebooks such as wireless/Bluetooth , integrated camera , integrated speakers , and mSATA SSD . <p> 4 . Better space utilization and fewer cables AIO systems are far more integrated then desktops and with their thinner designs , they take up less space in work environment and have fewer cables . Antennas for the wireless and blue tooth are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to eliminate your network cable and mouse or keyboard cables . Cameras and speakers are also integrated in the case housing so that frees up additional space as well as requires no additional expense or connectivity to add those devices . <p> 5 . Easier to Service In the past , servicing an AIO system was difficult due to the proprietary designs particularly with the MB and power adapters . AIO systems that adhere to the ThinminiITX form factor use standard parts readily available in the market . This means AC Power adapters are standard as are the motherboards which are available from manufactures such as ECS and Intel . AIO systems also use other components such as SODIMM memory , 2.5 " or 3.5 " HDD , slim ODD , and so that all available in the market . <p> AIO systems are emerging in many markets due to their thin design and limited cables . While there are many applications and markets suitable for AIO systems a few worth mentioning are listed here . <p> Education PC usage in todays classroom is becoming more sophisticated with lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Space , manageability and security are also concerns , all of which can be solved with an AIO system . Since the PC and monitor are integrated together , the AIO takes up less desk real estate . With the camera , microphone , and speakers integrated in the unit ( much like a notebook ) as well as with support for wireless network connectivity and Bluetooth keyboards with mouse , the AIO system only has one cable to connect , allowing the systems to be used where the teacher feels is most suitable . <p> Ergonomics As we spend more hours at work and at home using a computer , proper ergonomics becomes a greater concern to help prevent back or neck strain and other repetitive issues . With their fully integrated design , limited cables , and VESA mount support , AIO systems are ideal for use on monitor arms that allow for proper positioning of the computer screen as the user may change positions from sitting to standing as an example . Resellers can differentiate themselves and their product message by including an ergonomic option supported with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIO systems are ideal for schools and ergonomic usages , they are also ideal for digital signage applications , particularly in small businesses . The ability to combine the PC and monitor into one unit and reduce the number of cables and utilize capabilities such as mSATA SSD to save power and reduce heat , along with the improved manageability of vPro , make AIO systems unique in the digital signage segment . <p> Born as an addendum to the mini-ITX form factor , the thin mini-ITX form factor is designed to become the standard for desktop AIO units . Although the PCB is the same size as the standard mini-ITX board ( 170mm x 170mm ) , the thin mini-ITX components are situated on the board in a way that brings the total height down to approximately + that of a standard IO shield . Low profile boards are great candidates for AIO integration . The thin mini-ITX utilizes SO-DIMM modules and the slots are angled at 90 degrees and stacked in order to minimize the space needed . Most thin mini-ITX boards also have at least 1 space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ITX motherboards from ASUS , ECS , and Gigabyte so we can offer a full range of solutions that support Intel 4th Generation and Intel 6th Generation Core processors as well as provide options for dual LAN and vPro . <p> AIO systems are designed thinner to use less space on a desk or when mounted on wall and as such they use 65W or lower desktop processors . Standard desktop processors have higher wattage than 65W so its important to identify the correct CPUs . For all Intel Core i3 or lower processors , the wattage is below 65W so there are no special identifiers to consider when using these CPUs . For 4th Generation Core i5 and Core i7 family of processors resellers should use products with a " T " ( 45W ) or an " S " ( 65W ) at the end of the SKU . For 6th Generation processors resellers can use Core i3 , i5 or i7 processors ( Non K or Xtreme models ) as most are 65W . " T " series processors for the Intel 6th Generation offer 35W options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Intels involvement standards have been created around the Thin Mini ITX motherboard to bring AIO systems to the channel that are easy to integrate and service . Thin Mini ITX boards use standard SODIMM memory , and the AIO systems support standard 3.5 " or 2.5 " HDD as well as slim ODDs . In addition , the AC Adapters are 100-240Vinput / 19.5V 7.9A output which have been standardized for Thin Mini ITX . ASI offers full warranty support on the AIO systems which include extended warranty options of up to three years excluding the touch screen . <p> There are specific touch panels required for Microsoft Windows compliance , so selecting an AIO system that meets these standards is vital . The touch panel in the Loop AIO models are a capacitive 10-finger multi-touch screen which is 100% Microsoft Windows certified . Being a capacitive screen , the panel works well for family , home , or business usage as it was originally designed to be used in high traffic environments such as restaurants , factories , and hospitals ; therefore it is very resistant to liquids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interact with multiple points or interactive objects on the screen at a single time . Many previous generation AIO units only utilized single input points which worked well for POS kiosk systems that input orders or ATM machines which are designed for one-finger short term transactions , but prove to be not so useful for todays modern computing needs such as editing music and video , running educational software , or data research . <p> Loop LP3400 The LP3400 is a unique 34 " curved AIO designed for the performance market utilizing MiniITX motherboards as opposed to ThinMiniITX , which allows the LP3400 to support discrete PCIex16 graphics cards as well as the latest Intel 7th Generation Core i7 processors .

@@23283001 @3283001/ <p> Another difference between Bloomfield and Lynnfield is the interface used to connect the processor to the memory controller and other components on the system . In the past , Intel had utilized the Front Side Bus but they abandoned that method with the release on Nehalem which integrated the memory controller on to the processor . With Bloomfield , the FSB was replaced by Intels Quick Path Interconnect which provides a point to point connection to the memory controller and other components in the system . The QPI which is a bi-direction interface can support up to 25.6GB/sec or 12.8GB/sec per direction . In addition , QPI offers the added benefit of using the same data path to connect multiple processors which has significant benefits in the server or workstation space . <p> For Lynnfield , Intel is using the Direct Media Interface or DMI which still provides a direct point to point connection to the memory controller and other components in the system but it does not support multiple processors and the transfer rate is not as high . Based on a bi directional design just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overall throughput is less than what is found on Bloomfield . Again , for most end customers , this level of detail may not be important but for resellers the difference can help in determining proper product positioning .
