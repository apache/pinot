What a great afternoon/evening on the water ! And what a great Captain and Boat ! First off Captain Rob &amp; Drag N Fly ended up being really convenient for us , right across the waterway . We packed a picnic and were on our way . Captain Rob and the boat were very inviting and made us comfortable from start to finish . All was in order and ready to go when we arrived , boat running , our favorite music playing and we off the dock in no time . Captain Rob was very knowledgeable of the area and provided interesting details of the area and great conversation . Rob suggested our sailing options and left it up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising the sails . We opted for the inlet and the Atlantic as it was a beautiful day with a brisk breeze but not too choppy . Rob relinquished the helm and we were out of the channel and cruising along the coast in a flash . We even spotted a manta Ray or Sting Ray ? on the way out . The Drag N Fly moved smoothly and handled the swells well allowing us to enjoy our picnic lunch in comfort . Rob continued to let us all take turns at the helm while providing instruction where needed . A great sailing lesson and experience . After covering some great distances up and down the coast and enjoying the views we could see the sun was sinking and it was time to head back in . As we worked our way back up the channel we enjoyed a beautiful sunset . We thought the sail may be coming to an end and time to motor but that was not the case Captain Rob kept full sails in the waterway and to our surprise the wind was still quite strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon above The Drag N Fly slipped smoothly forward with ease . We took it as far as we could with the wind tapering and the causeway bridge approaching in the darkness . Captain Rob radioed the bridge to open , guided us through and had us back smoothly and safely on the dock . Thanks Captain Rob ! We hope to sail with you again someday , The Smiths : )

At checkout , you will be able to see a further breakdown of fees , taxes , and extra services .

Similarly , if the renter does not show up to take the boat out , the no-show will be treated as a renter cancellation . If a renter does not contact Sailo to cancel the rental , the renter will be charged the total amount for the rental period until the issue is resolved . <h> Does the rental price include fuel ? <p> Great question ! This depends on the boat owners ' choice , since they will be the ones to decide whether fuel is included or not in the price listing . In general , the rental price will NOT include fuel. - We make this process easier by providing an estimated average fuel cost per hour for each boat . However , make sure you discuss your fuel options with the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibited items allowed on boats ? <p> At Sailo , safety is always a priority . Therefore , we ask that good judgment be used at all times ( if it 's illegal on the land , it will quite likely be illegal on the water as well ! ) while checking with boat owners for any specific restrictions given the fact that they have the final say as to what is and is not allowed on the boat . <h> How many people can be onboard at the same time ? <p> Paid charters may only carry 6 or 12 passengers at a time , unless it is a US Coast Guard Inspected Vessel. - There are many factors to determine whether a boat may carry 6 or 12 in one trip . Primarily , vessels that weigh less than 100 GRT ( gross tons ) can carry up to 6 passengers ; vessels greater than 100 GRT can carry up to 12 passengers. - A boat can only carry more than 12 passengers if it is classified as a Recreational Vessel - manufactured and operated primarily for pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the boat , or an accident ? <p> If there is a serious accident while out on the water , please alert the US Coast Guard +1 ( 800 ) 323-7233 immediately , or hail them on VHF 16 . <p> For more minor incidents/damages , please make a note of it on the Check-In/Check-Out Survey , and contact the owner as soon as possible .

Keep in mind that the boat generally needs to be back at the dock by Friday evening , and you will need to be off the boat on Saturday morning so they can prepare the boat for the next guests . <h> What should I wear on a yacht charter ( or boat rental ) ? <p> We suggest checking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as each boat owner may have specific thoughts or requirements . As a general rule , we recommend wearing non-marking shoes ( e.g. , deck shoes or white-soled sneakers ) , and bringing an extra layer since it is often cooler on the water than on land . Make sure you also bring a hat , sunglasses , and sun protection . Check out our Discover Boating guide for more information . - <h> How and when do I pay for my boat rental ? <p> On Sailo , you pay for the charter at the time of booking with either a credit card , or Apple Pay . This confirms the rental , and holds the boat for your trip ! Gratuity is generally not included in the price for captained charters , and you will pay in cash for this upon completion .

You and your team can form everlasting bonds and discover new leadership skills through boat-based activities including sailing or yacht racing ( all with the help of professional sailors , of course ! ) on boats in a variety of sizes . Here are the top five reasons why we think that you and your team should plan your next team-building event on a boat : <p> - <p> 1 ) Increase your team 's communication skills <p> When your team is out on the water , getting from point A to point B is all about communication .

Have each of your employees take their turn as the skipper and have them lead the team - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members and facilitate excellent communication . A popular option is for the manager to not take the role as skipper and instead let his or her team members take the lead and give orders to the manager - it 's a great way for members of your team to build up their confidence when it comes to communication ! <p> - <p> 2 ) Foster a sense of healthy competition among your colleagues <p> A little bit of a healthy competition is a great way for your team to focus on working towards the bigger picture .
