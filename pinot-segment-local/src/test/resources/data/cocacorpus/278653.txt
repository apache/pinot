Less than 1 in 10 companies ( 8% ) intend to reduce their graduate intake , despite concerns over the number of graduates in the UK jobs market . The median starting salary for graduates in 2017 is estimated to be -30,000 , rising to -47,000 in the investment banking sector . <p> Leading organisations have increased their graduate recruitment by 13% in the past three years , making the competition for talent fiercer than ever .

EY reportedly increased the quality and quantity of their graduate applications by 11%1 by introducing specific changes to their process . These included short videos ( no longer than 30 seconds ) and the launch of a dedicated graduate recruitment site and blog . Social media was also instrumental in attracting more applicants , including Facebook , Instagram and Twitter . <p> Simplify your process with technology : Another essential change EY made was to simplify its application process to capture basic data rather than ask applicants to spend two to three hours completing online forms .

The issue of effective education remains . <p> For example , the engineering sector is facing a shortfall of 182,000 people per year between now and 2022 but only 5% of University applications relate to an engineering discipline and it is struggling to attract female students . More liaison is needed to encourage young people into STEM subjects to address the predicted talent shortage in key sectors and reduce the number of graduates employed in non-graduate jobs . <p> GCHQ 's CyberFirst <p> Some organisations are dropped their mandatory requirement for University degrees in order to address the skills shortage .

@@44110081 @4110081/ <p> Social media , AI , wearables and virtual reality are already driving digital recruitment . Virtual reality allows employers to reach a wider talent pool by offering online assessments and video interviews which reduce both the time and cost of hire . A recent article from Jessica Stillman in Inc magazine also promoted the idea of virtual reality having the potential to reduce bias in hiring in the future . Is augmented reality the next step ? <p> As traditional hiring processes are n't always effective in attracting top graduate talent , digital technologies have emerged as an alternative recruitment marketing and engagement tool . For example : - <p> Gamification : Gamification is used by several companies , including Lloyds Banking Group , KPMG and Deloitte , to attract high achieving graduates and is effective in identifying skilled candidates as well as enabling employers to speed up the hiring process in a competitive market . 57% of the UK population is involved in gaming on a regular basis , with companies such as PwC using dedicated online games such as Multipoly across all of its hiring process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most offices is generally mundane and routine . Innovative exceptions come from global brands like Google or Lego , who recently unveiled its new London offices , designed to mimic an environment constructed entirely from Lego blocks . Virtual tours can however , be used to introduce candidates to their potential future employer to provide insight into company culture . <p> Wearables : Wearables used in the graduate recruitment offer a number of advantages . For instance , they provide insight into the hiring process , when combined with HR analytics . They also help HR to understand behavioural patterns of candidates , including their response to stress during interviews . These come with caveats of course , requiring candidate permission and careful analysis to ensure objective assessments during hiring . <p> The principal obstacle to growth lies in the shortage of basic digital skills in the UK workforce . Empowerment : The Barclays Digital Development Index ranks the UK 7th out of 10 countries in content creation and coding skills .

@@44110087 @4110087/ <h> Discrimination Or Due Digilence ? The Perils Of The Reference Check <p> The latest jobs market figures from REC ( Recruitment and Employment Confederation ) reiterate the unrelenting pressure on HR to source talent quickly . Demand for staff is at a 21 month high and candidate availability remains in freefall . As the pressure mounts to hire quickly , skipping the reference check has become routine for some employers . But for those that carry out this essential part of the hiring process , the situation is becoming more hazardous . <p> The problem of missed reference checks <p> A recent survey reveals the extent of the problem with reference checks1 . <p> Nearly a quarter of candidates ( 23% ) are n't asked for character or employment references following their job application . Of those that provide names of referees , nearly one in four were n't pursued by their prospective employer . <p> Nearly half of candidates ( 45% ) admitted to providing false information to a potential employer , specifically exaggerating their experience and qualifications . A similar number took advantage of the gaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of securing a job offer by providing false information in their job application . <p> The problem is n't exclusive to the private sector . It recently emerged that up-to-date background checks have not been carried out on thousands of police officers across the UK2 . <p> The implications of a bad hire for HR affect culture , morale and productivity in the workplace as well as reflecting negatively on your employer brand . Employers who omit taking even basic reference checks risk exposing their business in a number of areas , including : - <p> Fines of up to -200,000 per hire when new employees are not eligible to work in the UK . <p> Here 's where a dilemma often arises . The uncertainty over background checks was highlighted when a recent employment tribunal ruled in favour of a candidate over a reference which resulted in their job offer being withdrawn . The reference provided was deemed to be discriminatory . As such , some employers are understandably cautious about confirming any details relating to their former employees beyond dates of employment and the position held . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a candidate 's claims . <p> Social media background checks ' <p> As part of their pre-hire assessment and dilemmas over reference checks , a growing number of employers are turning to the social media profiles of their job applicants to assess their suitability . The CIPD reports that one in five employers now reject a potential candidate based on the online activity on their social media pages3 . <p> In larger organisations , social media accounts of job seekers are used as an integral part of their screening process . <p> A social media profile should not be considered an effective reference check or a part of your formal pre-hire screening , whether in favour or otherwise of a candidate . <p> In addition to resulting in discrimination or breaching data protection laws , these types of checks are often subject to unconscious bias . <p> Discrimination or due diligence ? <p> The dilemma for HR is whether to trust the information provided in a reference check and knowing which questions to ask ( or answer ) to avoid a potential discrimination claim arising from it . As employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your recruitment software ensure compliance with the basic requirements in your hiring process . <p> These include : - <p> Initial pre-hire screening in the form of online recruitment assessments carried out during candidate screening . These may include personality questionnaires , psychometric assessments or situational judgement tests to evaluate a candidate 's suitability for a specific role . <p> The use of anonymised CVs through your applicant tracking software avoids the tendency to carry out a social media review of your candidates , reduces bias and ensures initial screening is carried out based on appropriate company and job criteria . <p> Automate formal reference checks which begin at the onboarding stage to prevent delays in the candidate 's start date . Modern recruitment software includes inbuilt links to accredited checking agencies and DBS ( Disclosure and Barring Services ) . HR is automatically alerted over any problematic response that might affect a candidate 's eligibility for your job . These checks ensure compliance without risking discrimination . <p> The CIPD provides more detail on what is permissible for references on its website . <p> On a final note , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are turning to temporary workers to source candidates with critical skills within their business .

@@44110088 @4110088/ <h> How Will HR Resolve The Problem Of The National Living Wage ? <p> The National Living Wage ( NLW ) comes into force across the UK on 1st April 2016 on what appears to be a wave of negative publicity . A report released by the British Retail Consortium ( BRC ) claims that the combination of the NLW and the apprenticeship levy may result in 900,000 lost jobs in the sector by 2025 . The increase means the minimum hourly pay for people over the age of 25 will rise- from -6.70 to -7.20 per hour . - The predicted additional cost to wage bills according to the BRC is predicted to reach -300 billion annually . <p> Just over half of all employers say they will be affected by the National Living Wage according to a survey carried out by the CIPD and the Resolution Foundation ( RF ) . This figure rises significantly in the retail , hospitality and healthcare sectors . Some of the suggestions being considered by UK businesses to offset the impact of the NLW include : - <p> Reducing headcount . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiring permanent employees . <p> Increase prices to customers . <p> Increase hiring of people under the age of 25 " which has its own inherent problems of age discrimination . <p> The most common proposal made by- one third of employers is to- offset the cost of the NLW by increasing productivity and therein lies the problem . According to the Office of National Statistics , productivity in the UK workforce remains stubbornly- low and is significantly lower ( 20% ) than the average of the G7 nations . <p> How can HR boost productivity to absorb the costs of the National Living Wage ? Improving productivity is n't a matter of bringing in more talent , it requires a strategic approach from HR focusing on specific- areas to transform the underlying problems . <p> Here we identify some of the key areas requiring that focus : - <p> Succession planning and leadership development : Identifying the people who will lead and motivate efficient teams to meet business challenges now and in the future is key to improving productivity . Research carried out by Roffey Park suggests that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning cited as a problem by 70% of respondents . Deloitte 's 2016 Global Human Capital Trends Survey echoes this problem , revealing that 28% of business have weak or very weak leadership pipelines . It recommends that HR applies rigorous , structured , scientific approaches ' to succession planning . Early identification of future leaders , supported by a comprehensive ' leadership culture is vital . <p> Overcoming the recession mindset : In its report Weighing Up The Wage Floor : Employer Responses To The National Living Wage , the CIPD and the Resolution Foundation highlight the lingering impact the recession has left on the mindset of employers . 40% were still focused on cost-cutting and creating leaner businesses , caught up in a survival mode which affects their behaviour . As the challenges of automation , the looming EU referendum and the management of- a multi-generational workforce gather pace , HR must focus on the creation of- a- motivated working environment . <p> Pay and rewards- : - The CIPD 's report indicated that the introduction of a pay and rewards strategy was a further consideration to boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work/life balance , flexible working hours , ongoing career development opportunities and recognition over pay increases- in employee surveys. - A further point to note is that nearly half ( 46% ) of employers questioned by the CIPD can not accurately predict the impact the NLW will have on employee pay . <p> Training and development : Learning and development is key to employee retention and improving morale . Roffey Park 's report refers to the need for- talent preparedness ' , - combining training and development with what it describes as experience-creation ' . In essence , this is on-the-job-training ' with a difference , offering employees the chance to move beyond their comfort zone , combining theory and practice to enhance both technical and soft skills . <p> Investment in technology : The CIPD sums up the problems behind the UK 's productivity puzzle ' , as the result of weak investment ' not just in people but also technology . Technology supports robust hiring processes , automating repetitive elements of the HR function . If HR is to play a transformative role in improving motivation , performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Potential setbacks to HR initiatives <p> Several additional concerns face HR which may hinder its efforts , including those outlined below : - <p> Automation in the workplace ? While the National Living Wage was identified as one of two principal causes of job losses- by the BRC , this overlooks the impact that automation will have , particularly in sectors such as retail . Furthermore , Deloitte 's new report Global Cities , Global Talent , which identifies London as the soft power capital of the world ' , highlights a predicted hollowing out ' the city 's lower paid jobs due to automation . Automation is predicted to have the most significant impact on low paid workers and women , according to a report from the WEF . Combined with the soaring cost of London living , this compounds the problems arising- both from potential jobs cuts and- talent shortages in specific sectors such as IT . <p> Downward pressure on wage growth : Despite the skills gap , the downward pressure on UK wages is expected to continue during 2016 . Predictions suggest that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates and a sufficient ' labour supply in the majority of sectors . At current levels , pay rises may be restricted to 1-2% for the rest of the decade . This may pave the way for an ever decreasing circle of low motivation , disengaged employees , - poor retention levels and continued low productivity . <p> A positive note in the retail sector <p> A glimmer of good news is on the horizon in the retail sector . Brands such as Aldi , Lidl and Morrisons have offered a pay deal above the NLW to all of their staff . Similarly , - as part of a series of initiatives , Starbucks will also pay the NLW to all of its employees , including those under 25 years old and apprentices . <p> Regardless of the- stark headlines , - the impact of the introduction of the NLW can not be accurately predicted . It does , however , present HR with an opportunity to positively impact productivity and performance while improving the competitive advantage of UK business .

@@44110103 @4110103/ <h> Are 64% Of Your Employees Disengaged ? <p> If you 're reading this article at work , it 's likely that two thirds of your colleagues or team are disengaged . Latest research into employee engagement found that only 36% of UK employees are highly engaged ' . As the survey reveals , this is affecting productivity in UK businesses , regardless of size . The chances are that your company falls into this category . <p> We identified three areas that companies must pay attention to if they are to re-engage their employees : - <p> The pay gap <p> Significant gaps in salaries between different levels of employees within an organisation often have a corrosive effect on company culture , leading to demotivated and disengaged staff . The controversy over public sector pay rises fixed at 1% compared to a 10% recommended pay rise for MPs epitomises this problem but the private sector is n't immune . <p> According to research carried out by XpertHR and the Chartered Management Institute , underperforming managers are still receiving bonuses at an average rate of -9,000 per underperforming employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 3.5% . By refusing to acknowledge this issue , companies risk creating a negative culture , leading to higher levels of absenteeism and lower levels of retention . The same survey revealed that nearly 90% of employers are struggling to recruit talent to meet business demands in 2015 , compared to 70% last year . <p> Recommendations include tackling CEO pay and managing the expectations of business leaders , stating exactly how their performance will be measured . <p> No concern for carers <p> A CIPD study shows that one in nine UK workers now combines their employment with a caring role for parents , siblings , grandparents and partners in their personal life . The majority of carers found their workplace the least carer-friendly ' of their communities . Employers who do n't make provision for this changing dynamic risk losing talented performers as three quarters of those interviewed experienced a lack of support in the workplace . While flexible working is welcome , carers are reluctant to accept it in all cases as it may have a detrimental effect on their career . With 67% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to identify affected employees early in the hiring process . Approximately one third of companies currently have strategies in place for carers at work . <p> Learning and development <p> Deloitte 's Global Human Capital Trends Survey 2015 identified learning and development issues as one of the top three talent challenges for global businesses . Companies that transform their learning and development can dramatically improve employee engagement and retention ' . The report highlights the example of Deckers Outdoor , manufacturers of Ugg footwear and a company with high levels of staff retention . The company adopts an approach of inspiring people to learn ' with each programme of learning incorporating the why ' behind the content ' . - Deckers ' head of Learning and Development is also responsible for employee engagement , culture , and employee communications . The majority of businesses identified a clear capability gap between their needs and what they are able to deliver . Yet again the onus is on HR to offer learning opportunities to meet both the needs of the business and expectations of employees. - <p> Create an environment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for a culture of empowerment , meaning , openness and learning . <p> Create a company culture rooted in purpose and local culture . <p> Create loyalty without asking for it .

@@44110114 @4110114/ <h> AI At Work : Benefit Or Threat ? <p> Has the obliteration of jobs by automation been over-exaggerated ? At the end of last year Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned that up to 50% of UK jobs could be wiped out by automation . A recent report suggests that so far the AI-jobs apocalypse has yet to materialise . <p> Recent research from the Chartered Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors ( CIEHF ) together with CV-Library found that two thirds of businesses had not yet witnessed job losses due to automation . Over a third believed that automation had actually increased the number of jobs available . <p> This is an outcome suggested by Deloitte . In 2015 , it highlighted the benefits of automation and its ability to create better quality jobs by removing tedious and dull work which increases the potential for errors due to boredom . Its research also noted that as a result of automation : - <p> 5 million low risk jobs have been created since 2001 , compared to 800,000 high risk jobs lost . <p> Each new low-risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job it replaced . <p> This does not alleviate underlying concerns but it may suggest a transition in the nature of work . PwC 's latest UK Economic Outlook predicts that 30% of jobs in the UK are at risk from automation by the early 2030s . Like Deloitte , however , it notes that the type of available jobs will change . Sectors at highest risk of job losses through automation include transport , wholesale and retail and manufacturing . Jobs in education and health and social work are at the lowest risk of being replaced . <p> Ongoing resistance to AI <p> Despite this more encouraging outlook , the CIEHF/CV Library survey reports a resistance ' among employees to automation as employers are failing to communicate its benefits effectively . <p> HR remains one of the most resistant areas to AI .

In hiring processes , this means the automation of mundane procedures , including personalised e-mails to job applicants , effective screening to reduce unconscious bias and insights into key hiring metrics that impact your ability to hire .

To accept and take advantage of automation , consumers must trust both in the technology and in the business delivering the innovation . For employers that means having confidence in their supplier of recruitment software and its ability to deliver benefits to its hiring process . Three steps exist to gaining that trust : - <p> Cognitive compatibility : In other words , make it easy to understand . The more complex the nature of the technology , the less likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Advorto 's easy to use recruitment software requires no formal training and its usability can again be tested during a month long trial period . <p> Recruitment software aside , as companies continue to invest in technology it is vital to maintain employee buy-in and foster trust by upskilling employees . The UK faces a significant digital skills crisis in addition to a wider talent shortage but employers are failing to invest in the necessary training to equip employees with vital skills . Training and development is essential for businesses that wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their brand . It will also go some way to overcoming resistance ' to technology in the workplace . <p> Ethical concerns <p> On a final note , ethical concerns is an area that HR must address the use of artificial intelligence increases . <p> The EU1 has proposed the creation of a European agency to provide technical , ethical and regulatory advice on robotics and AI , including the consideration of a minimum income to compensate people replaced by robots and a kill switch ' for malfunctioning AI systems . A similar concern was recently expressed by the International Bar Association which warned that AI could ultimately lead to the introduction of legislation for quotas of human workers in the future2 . <p> While the debate over the benefits of AI at work continues , there is no doubt about the struggle that employers face to hire and retain qualified candidates .

Nearly 6 out of 10 people are thinking about moving jobs this year , representing a rise of 10% on last year .

For SMEs unable to increase employee pay or organisations who are limited by pay structures , flexible working is a viable alternative .

Your KPIs are way off target and your last shortlist was rejected by your client . Could you be guilty of these five bad recruiting habits ? <p> - Distorting ' the truth : Successful recruiters build their reputations based on trust , integrity and authenticity . Do n't claim you have a vacancy that does n't exist in order to try and attract passive candidates . Do n't fudge the fact that your strongest candidate has withdrawn from an interview or you only have twenty guaranteed temps for a project that needs thirty ( and you guaranteed your client exactly that number ) . Be honest . Letting your client down jeopardises your reputation and your ability to build sustainable working relationships . <p> Stalking your clients ( and candidates ) : Calling , texting and e-mailing prospective clients ( or candidates ) half a dozen times a day is n't an effective way to win friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harassment and suggests desperation . Follow up with an employer no more than three times . If they do n't respond to you they either are n't interested or they do n't require your services right now . E-mail them to say you will follow up again in another three months " and do that . <p> Sending CVs without candidate permission : Sending a candidate 's CV to an employer , without their agreement is not only a bad habit but poor recruiting ethics . Candidates trust you to act in their best interests to find a position . Sending a CV without their knowledge in the hope an employer will like what they see is in only in your best interests . Explain to your candidate that the employer has previously expressed a preference for their particular skillset and you would like to present their CV to them now but make it clear there is no existing vacancy .

Treat them with respect . If you ca n't help them , do n't dismiss them if they have taken the time and effort to contact you . <p> False promises : You 're falling behind on your targets and an employer calls you with a job you know you ca n't fill , yet still you say yes ' .

The case brings into sharp focus the downside of the gig economy , with suggestions that unscrupulous employers take advantage of the sector in order to avoid employment costs . <p> Referred to as the open talent ' economy by Deloitte and the flexible workforce ' by the CIPD , the gig economy is changing the way in which businesses source , manage and engage with talent . In this article , we examine the positive and negative aspects of the gig economy and the position of HR in the current unpredictable jobs market . <p> Uber 's taxi drivers will argue that their employment status should be that of workers , rather than self-employed professionals , entitling them to holiday pay and the national minimum wage . Nor is the company alone in facing controversy over the rights of its flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target of negative publicity when it was claimed that its self-employed couriers were earning below the national minimum wage , an accusation it disputes .

Not necessarily . <p> The rise in self-employment <p> Flexible working is on the rise in the UK . In the three months to May 2016 , the Office of National Statistics ( ONS ) showed that the number of people registered as self-employed rose by 300,000 to 4.79 million . The figure represents 15% of the UK workforce , or 1 in 6 people . <p> Across the EU as a whole , gross revenues from the sector reached -21.6bn in 2015 , twice the previous year. - In the UK , the gig economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be worth -9bn by 2020 . <p> These figures show a need for employer guidance around the use of freelance workers .

The CIPD also noted that the EU 's guidelines recommend : - <p> Growth in the sector should be encouraged and developed in a responsible manner ' . <p> Fair taxation and employment conditions . <p> The gig economy should not be regarded as a way to abuse labour ' . - <p> Brexit will of course allow the UK to determine and set its own guidelines . <p> A further point to note on taxation which may impact the sector was noted by the Financial Times . The HMRC has proposed that sub-contractors working in the public sector should have their tax deducted by employers before paying their fees , with effect from April 2017 .

@@44110145 @4110145/ <h> The NHS : Finding A Way Through The Staffing Crisis <p> The NHS is facing a widely reported staffing crisis , highlighted by frequent reports throughout this winter period of A&amp;E departments unable to cope with unprecedented patient levels . <p> How can it respond to and navigate a way through this crisis ? <p> This article examines the ways in which it is responding , in particular to GP recruitment shortages , highlighting the Trusts that are making HR driven steps forward and looks at developments in AI and ongoing hiring strategies . <p> Preparing for Brexit <p> The CIPD recently reported that the healthcare sector may already be feeling the effects of Brexit . Online job searches from Eastern Europe for health and social care jobs fell by a reported 17% in the wake of the referendum vote . In 2016 , PwC predicted that Brexit 's biggest impact across the NHS would be its effect on GP recruitment . The anticipated triggering of Article 50 by the end of March will reinforce these concerns . <p> A shortfall of almost 10,000 doctors is predicted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that shortage " and of a shrinking post-Brexit talent pool - NHS England has launched a new scheme to recruit GPs from across Europe , including Poland , Croatia , Lithuania and Greece . Salaries of -90,000 coupled with a generous relocation package ' are on offer and new recruits will undergo training for 12 weeks in Poland. - <p> This initiative may also have been influenced by a report from the National Audit Office which warned that lack of access to GPs was contributing to the A&amp;E crisis . The scheme is being piloted in Lincolnshire and the first GPs are expected to take up their new positions in April . <p> The new initiative only expects to recruit half of the 10,000 shortfall , however , forcing NHS leaders to explore more creative ways to address the staffing crisis. - The NHS in Wales is endeavouring to overcome- its historically low numbers of recruits with a targeted hiring campaign to attract skilled candidates to the region . <p> In a further attempt- to create a uniform standard among GP candidate assessments , the General Medical Council- has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills tests , alongside all foreign applicants . This new medical licensing assessment will be in place within the next 5 years . It is intended to improve the standards of graduate doctors . <p> Instilling positive HR led leadership <p> In order to attract talent , a positive employer brand is essential , but the NHS is facing a number of leadership issues . These include demoralised employees and difficulties in recruiting and retaining senior staff , leading to high levels of stress and absenteeism . <p> The CIPD gives one definition of leadership as the capacity to influence people , by means of personal attributes and/or behaviours , to achieve a common goal ' . This requires transparency and an open culture with a willingness to engage in- conversations with employees . <p> Steps have been taken to successfully achieve this goal within some NHS trusts . The CIPD People Management Awards 2016 highlighted the successful strategies of the winner of its overall prize " Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust . The Trust was awarded best employee engagement initiative for its campaign to improve patient safety and experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and employee behaviour were tackled using HR led ' interventions , encompassing a variety of areas including leadership . In the process the hospital made a marked improvement ; its CQC rating is now outstanding ' , compared to a previous rating of inadequate ' . <p> At the same awards , University College London Hospitals ( UCLH ) NHS Foundation Trust attained best recruitment and talent management initiative . In order to address high levels of staff turnover , the Trust became the first NHS employer to sign up to the National Living Wage in London . It also campaigned against plans that would have prevented the recruitment of Filipino nurses . <p> The NHS 's intention of creating an open culture also led to a formal policy on whistleblowing in May last year although The Telegraph reported in August that job applicants regarded as whistleblowers ' were still being blacklisted . <p> The impact of AI <p> Artificial intelligence and automation have featured prominently in recruitment headlines , with up to 15 million jobs considered at risk but Deloitte ranks the UK 's human health and social work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> AI could in fact have a beneficial impact by relieving the pressure on health and social care . Middlesex University and the University of Bedfordshire are currently carrying out a -2 million project to develop robots with cultural awareness ' and a good bedside manner ' to care for older people in care homes or sheltered accommodation . The development of these Pepper robots is expected to take three years . <p> Effective HR led recruitment strategies <p> In the meantime , the NHS must continue to follow the example of Frimley Health and UCLH NHS Foundation trusts in creating initiatives to improve talent management strategies . The following three suggestions offer additional ways to improve recruitment and retention : - <p> Improve diversity : Improving diversity is essential for the NHS to address skills shortages , avoid accusations of bias and recruit from a broader talent pool . The use of anonymised CVs , combined with video interviewing during screening and a formal strategy to reduce unconscious bias should be incorporated into hiring . All candidates should be assessed against pre-determined key skills and performance criteria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Extend flexible working : - Timewise 's Power Part Time list released this week revealed that the number of shared senior level positions in the UK is now at its highest . Furthermore , almost half of business leaders would now consider this option for senior positions . Recruiting people into leadership roles has proved problematic for the NHS in recent years . Flexible working across all areas of the NHS can help to both attract and retain skilled members of leadership teams . Recruitment analytics provides insight into the extent of senior level roles which are shared , or those across the NHS which offer flexible working . <p> Support with HR technology : In the face of an ongoing staffing crisis , HR must create and drive efficient hiring processes , supported by HR technology . As well as reducing time consuming administration , recruitment software offers a number of advantages , including : - <p> Identification of applicants with business critical skills and fast tracks tagged candidates through screening . <p> Reassurance that your job posts are compliant . <p> Automates the key elements of essential background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of future hiring needs , bringing an end to the boom and bust ' cyclical nature of healthcare recruitment .

What is your biggest hiring problem ? For example , engaging candidates with regular automated updates will help to prevent talent dropping out of your pipeline while recruitment analytics will identify the source of your best applicants . <p> Opt for cloud based software : Launching a big data initiative means HR will need to collate information from different departments . Cloud based software is the most effective way of achieving this , storing data in one accessible location . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infrastructure , in-house skills or resources to carry out comprehensive analysis in-house . <p> Select a dedicated point of contact : Once you 've selected your HR software , allocate a - dedicated person within HR to oversee its implementation and take responsibility for understanding the software , including the benefits and cost savings offered to your business . A single point of contact helps to minimise confusion as your business makes the transition from manual to automated systems . <p> Ensure ethical use of data : Concern over the misuse of big data has prompted calls for it to be accompanied by an ethics review board ' . Confidentiality and privacy must be a prime consideration for businesses collecting data on numerous candidates which may include personal information such as health issues . Establish ground rules for the use of talent analytics within your organisation and work closely with other departments to ensure no breaches of confidentiality .

Robots have long been a common feature in factories and warehouses , considered to be low-cost , efficient devices , and their growing presence will continue to impact jobs . The automation of manufacturing and advances in AI has been described as the fourth industrial revolution ' . <p> On a similar theme , in Beyond Automation , Thomas H Davenport and Julia Kirby highlight three clear stages of automation in the last three centuries : - <p> Low skilled , low paid workers are predicted to be five times at risk of losing their jobs to automation due to this new revolution but other jobs are at risk too . Automation , it is suggested , wo n't simply see the replacement of low skilled jobs but the hollowing out of middle-income , medium skilled jobs ' affecting not just construction but accounts , transport , retail and sales sectors . <p> Others still are concerned about the social and psychological effects from AI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession to unemployment among the young as AI replaces knowledge work ' . <p> The most extreme concerns arise over AI replacing jobs and surpassing the need for human skill altogether . Such concerns are prompted by the rise of cognitive technologies , ie , the ability of machines to simulate human thought processes and perform tasks that humans alone once carried out . Cognitive technology was ranked as important ' or very important ' to business leaders in Deloitte 's Global Human Capital Trends survey of 2015 . <p> While businesses are yet to absorb or understand the impact of cognitive technology , there are positives to AI for businesses and HR . <p> AI " the benefits <p> Creativity <p> As the report Beyond Automation ' highlights , a large number of jobs are considered to be repetitive , routine and often predictable on some level " which may be a contributing cause towards the lack of engagement and stagnant productivity affecting UK businesses . By automating those elements of the process , the workforce , it is claimed , will be freed to become more creative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 , compared to 800,000 high risk jobs lost . <p> Each new low-risk job pays a salary -10,000 higher than the high risk job it replaced .

Soft skills will be a key factor in securing jobs .

Businesses must collaborate with educational institutions , focus on soft skills in the hiring process , assign mentors , teach millennials to differentiate between personal and professional boundaries and reskill the entire workforce . This is not to overlook the wealth of soft skills available in older generations in the workforce. - Expectations must be set and managed from the outset . <p> Conclusion : Embracing AI in HR <p> AI is a new and growing phenomenon in HR , with its foundations in recruitment software , the inclusion of algorithms and in predictive analytics .

The big four ' accountancy firms , E&amp;Y , Deloitte , PwC and KPMG are automating entry level jobs that would typically be carried out by graduates , suggesting that artificial intelligence may spell the end of graduate recruitment . But for many employers , this is just one of several challenges related to graduates and their employability . <p> The issues facing graduate employers go beyond automation to include the following : - <p> Employability of graduates : The government 's latest whitepaper , Success As A Knowledge Economy , highlights the problem of employability among graduates and coincided with calls to improve job prospects for STEM students .

The government 's targets of three million apprenticeships by 2020 should , it recommends , focus on the level of apprenticeships available . At present , 60% are provided at Level 2 , equivalent to just 5 passes at GCSE level . <p> Competing with Europe : UK employers also face competition from Europe for graduate talent . Denmark was recently named as the top employment destination for UK graduates due to its high salaries and low cost of living .

Here we outline the principles of each type of assignment . <h> Contingency Recruitment <p> A contingency assignment is an agreement between the recruitment agency and the employer to fill a specific vacancy on a no placement , no fee ' basis. - In other words , the recruitment consultant presents CVs of suitable candidates who they believe are a potential fit for the role with no obligation from the client that they will interview the applicant . Recruiters are only paid for their- efforts if one of their candidates is selected for the position , accepts the offer and starts working for the employer . <p> There is no guarantee of payment in contingency recruitment . Generally , employers will place the same vacancy with a number of recruitment agencies and candidates may find themselves approached by several recruiters for the same vacancy . Additional competition comes from job seekers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ability to work quickly is essential for the contingency recruiter who will often submit a large number of CVs for each role. - Getting the agreement of candidates to their CV being put forward for a vacancy ahead of other agencies- is vital . <p> Exclusive or Non-Exclusive ? To minimise risk and increase the chances of securing a placement , a recruiter may persuade the client to agree to a period of exclusivity on a contingency assignment . This gives them an agreed time to source suitable candidates before the employer offers the vacancy to other recruiters . <p> Fees Paid : Fees are normally a percentage of the first year 's basic salary , ranging from 10-20% , for example , or employers may agree a fixed fee in advance . Rebates for hires that do n't work out are- typically offered over the first twelve weeks on a sliding scale. - <p> What are the benefits ? The benefits to the employer of no up-front financial commitment are self-evident but contingency searches may be advantageous for the recruiter in industries where skills are scarce and they- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exclusivity for a recruiter experienced in their market will allow more time to- identify better quality candidates . <p> Advorto Marketplace let 's you promote your contingent and retained agency services to some of the UK 's largest employers " for free <h> Retained Search <p> Retained searches are carried out by executive search recruiters , often referred to as headhunters ' , to fill senior level or hard-to-fill positions . Retained assignments are exclusive agreements with fees broken down into two or three stages for example : - <p> One third of the fee paid to the recruiter on authority to proceed with the assignment . <p> One third paid on production of a shortlist of , for example , three to five candidates . <p> One third paid on the candidate 's acceptance of the job offer , or when the new employee starts work . <p> Sometimes it may be split into two stages , rather than three , depending on the executive recruiter and the client 's requirements , or employers may request a larger shortlist . <p> In theory , a retained search means the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry niche so their hardest decision should be making the final candidate selection . The sourcing and selection process is thorough with recruiters approaching passive candidates who are not actively looking for jobs . It may take between 4-6 weeks to provide a shortlist as consultants search for the best available candidates to present to the employer . <p> Exclusivity : Retained searches are always exclusive assignments although employers can reserve the right to terminate the assignment if an acceptable shortlist is not produced . <p> Fees Paid : Fees vary , but as a guideline employers can expect to pay around 30% of the first year salary , split into three stages . Some executive search companies may include an element of benefits and bonuses in their fee . Others may charge a higher percentage rate or agree to a significant fixed fee . A rebate will generally only apply to the final third of the fee and cover a shorter period than a contingency assignment. - <p> What are the benefits ? A retained search is the goal for an established recruiter as it offers consultants the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upfront payments to be a risk but will receive a much higher level of service and quality of candidates appropriate to the vacancy .

Indeed 's data ranked the health and social care sector as one of the least reliant on EU workers but a recent infographic published on Business Insider provides a breakdown of EU workers per NHS region and reiterates the anticipated shortage of doctors . Social care faces a unique crisis of its own after new figures found that 900 people every day are leaving their jobs in the sector2 . <p> Tech : Demand for tech professionals has risen by almost a quarter in the last two years according to the Association of Professional Staffing Companies ( APSCo ) latest Professional Recruitment Trends report .

For London based retailers , the Living Wage Foundation notes an average 25% reduction in staff turnover for companies paying the NLW , accompanied by an 80% improvement in staff performance . Our Retail Sector Focus includes more details on that and the issues facing the sector . <p> Apprenticeships : Some suggestions have been raised over the feasibility of apprenticeships bridging the Brexit skills gap but the controversy over their quality and the Apprenticeship Levy persists . A new report from the Association of Employment and Learning Providers ( AELP ) has already cast doubt on the structure of apprenticeships and the lack of flexibility since the Levy came into force on 6th April . <p> Offer job security : Job security is regarded as the number one concern for many of today 's applicants .

@@44110253 @4110253/ <h> LinkedIn &amp; The Generation Gap : How To Attract Generation Y <p> LinkedIn is one of the first places employers and recruitment companies turn to in their search for talent through online recruitment channels . A recent article in HRZone highlighted its ability to act as a type of applicant tracking system ' with an extensive back catalogue ' of career histories and achievements of millions of professionals . <p> Yet with the average age of a LinkedIn candidate- quoted as 44 , Generation Y has apparently failed to see its attraction . <p> As well as the age and inherent culture gap , the article highlights a number of reasons for this indifference , including : - <p> The line between the professional and personal lives of Generation Y is more blurred than that of previous generations . Facebook is the website of choice so joining a separate networking site for career progression opportunities simply does n't make sense to them . - <p> Rather than the emphasis on who you know ' , millennials prefer to be recognised for their achievements and skills , not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> LinkedIn does n't produce the instant ' results that most millennials seek so they will migrate to other sites which may not feature so prominently in an employer 's e-recruitment strategy . <p> The online recruitment evolution is , however , about to undergo another shift with the revelation that Facebook is developing its own Facebook at Work . This professional networking site will compete with both LinkedIn and Google and also- comes at a time when LinkedIn is facing a class action lawsuit over lost job opportunities in the US . Both announcements will deter millennials from heading to LinkedIn . <p> Where does that leave companies eager to engage with and hire Generation Y who are predicted to comprise 75% of the workforce by 2025 ? <p> Employers today require a talent recruitment system which encompasses the more traditional online recruitment locations such as job boards and LinkedIn , while embracing the contrasting job seeking habits of millennials . An appropriate talent acquisition strategy will offer that when- supported by a sophisticated recruitment management system . <p> Our advice is as follows : - <p> Post to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social media sites including Facebook , Twitter , Google+ ( and even LinkedIn ) simultaneously allows the broadest candidate reach for your vacancies . - An integrated applicant tracking system will also- identify the point of an applicant 's entry into your recruiting software offering vital insight into where Generation Y first engages with your brand . Generation Y is also known for being more socially active so a simple sharing facility will- encourage them to share your vacancies across their networks . <p> Ensure brand consistency : Employer branding is predicted to be the hot topic in talent acquisition during 2015 . Generation Y looks for a consistent brand message across your entire online presence and e-recruitment channels. - Take advantage of your recruiting software to ensure uniformity in your message with a careers site that is fully integrated with your own website . For time-poor Generation Y candidates frustrated with lengthy application forms , the provision of a registration of interest ' - allows them to submit their CV at a later stage , while their contact details are logged in your applicant tracking software . <p> Match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does n't live up to expectations will result in lost talent . The experience of all candidates must reflect your culture and core values with timely and consistent communication. - Choose a recruitment management system which provides an automated , personalised messaging facility via SMS or e-mail to maintain engagement. - <p> Show what 's in it for them : Successful talent acquisition strategies need to take into account the expectations of Generation Y to be successful . Employers must clearly spell out the benefits of working with their brand across their e-recruitment and social media platforms and fulfil all promises made during the hiring process . - Millennials also seek employers with a strong sense of Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) which should be evident- across your online recruitment channels . <p> Promote flexible working : Millennials demand a positive work/life balance from their employer and will think nothing of leaving a role that does n't meet their aspirations .

Here are seven your hiring team needs to be aware of right now : - <p> A move away from zero hours <p> Last week McDonald 's announced its intention to offer 115,000 employees the option of moving from zero hours to fixed contracts . The global fast food chain is one of the biggest employers of zero hour contract workers in the UK and its move may prompt others to follow its example . Suggestions of a higher minimum wage for zero hours contract workers have also been raised . As the traditional 9 to 5 job changes , employers who offer job security and commitment will be the most successful in sourcing and retain qualified candidates . <p> Retention of new hires is a real problem <p> As the available talent pool shrinks this already significant problem will become more pressing for HR. 90% of businesses are already worried about their ability to hang on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diversity in screening , non-existent background checks and hiring teams with no interview experience all affect staff retention . Start by supporting your hiring process with recruitment software that pinpoints the problems in your process . <p> Your office space matters <p> The state of your office space may just tip the balance between your ideal candidate accepting your offer and that of your competitor . A recent survey suggests that over half of all job seekers turn down job offers if their new working environment fails to meet their expectations . Unsalubrious working conditions , broken furniture and a lack of natural light all influence that final decision . Location matters too , the closer you are to transport links and amenities , the more likely that your offer will be accepted . <p> Salaries are squeezed but not in tech or finance <p> Salaries for advertised vacancies have fallen by 3.8% in the past year but two sectors are bucking the trend . Glassdoor 's list of the highest paying jobs of 2017 is dominated by tech and finance companies . Understanding your specific industry and regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable more successful targeting and promotion of your job posts . <p> Facebook and Google step it up <p> As Facebook reports almost two billion monthly users and continues to move forward with Facebook for Jobs , anticipation is rising over the launch of Google Hire as a prospective jobs site . Despite the acquisition of LinkedIn by Microsoft , it still struggles to appeal to millienials and recently reversed changes to its site in response to a wave of criticism from recruiters . Social recruiting should play a role in your hiring strategy . Data in your recruitment software will inform you which social media site is the most effective for your business . <p> Your graduate recruitment has to change <p> Korn Ferry 's report Graduates , Brexit and Beyond found that nearly a quarter of graduates are changing their long term career plans following Brexit and nearly half of European students are reconsidering their options . The Association of Graduate Recruiters notes that employers spent an average of -1,700 per hire to attract and market to candidates but 5.4% of last year 's graduate vacancies were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your graduate recruitment strategy has to change in order to attract and retain the best talent this year . Faster recruitment times and paid internships are two strategies adopted by leading employers in a bid to secure the commitment of the best graduate talent . <p> The digital skills shortage is a bigger threat than AI <p> Artificial intelligence is n't materialising as the threat to employment that has been predicted to date . 5 million low risk jobs have been created since 2001 , compared to 800,000 high risk jobs lost , yet hiring teams are wary of harnessing the advantages of automation and AI in hiring . Of far more immediate concern is the digital skills crisis affecting the UK which prompted the CIPD to suggest businesses are sleepwalking ' their way into a low value , low skills economy ' .

@@44110258 @4110258/ <h> The Most Common Mistakes People Make With Recruitment Software <p> Cloud based recruitment software helps to make your hiring process more efficient but it ca n't fix fundamental issues within your talent acquisition strategy . <p> Here are eight of the most common mistakes made by HR when they invest in technology : - <p> Your screening is too broad : Applying general keywords or criteria to your applicant tracking software will leave you with a mounting pile of CVs to review . Be specific with your screening . New research from the Aberdeen Group found that best in class organisations are 36% more likely to use assessments in the pre-hire process . Incorporate additional screening such as video interviews and online psychometric assessments available through your recruitment software to ensure you see only the most qualified candidates . <p> You do n't understand your market : Understanding your sector enables HR to improve the effectiveness of your job posts . For example , the latest regional report from APSCo/Vacancysoft highlighted a significant increase ( 22% ) year on year in new jobs in the retail sector while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacancies . Regional trends also affect your hiring success . Uxbridge saw a rise in vacancies of 42% while the North East England and the West Midlands reported significant rises . Combined with the data in your recruitment software , trends will help you to target your job posts more specifically to attract talent where candidates are in short supply . <p> Your job posts need work : Recruitment software wo n't improve the number of qualified candidates applying to your vacancy if your job posts are ineffective . Only 40% of job seekers enjoy the job search process . Make it easier for them to find your post by including appropriate keywords which will determine the ranking of your vacancy during their search . Avoid attention grabbing headlines and focus on the main purpose of the role and the advantages of working for your organisation . Analyse your data to identify your most successful job posts and apply the same principles to your future vacancies . <p> You do n't see the need for a personal touch : Today 's candidates expect a positive experience during the hiring process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for many that 's your response to candidate applications . It 's impossible to interact with each individual but your recruitment software enables you create personalised automated responses to promote a positive brand image . <p> You ignore social media : With the news that Facebook is offering a new platform for organisations in the US and Canada to create job posts through their company Facebook pages , social recruiting should form part of your talent acquisition strategy in 2017 . Modern recruitment software enables HR to simultaneously post vacancies across all social media sites . Integrated sharing also makes it easier for your employees to promote your vacancies across their own social networks . You can track the success of your social recruitment strategy through your recruitment metrics . <p> You still use manual recruitment systems for onboarding : Research suggests that as much as 20% of staff turnover occurs within the first 45 days of employment . Take advantage of your recruitment software by automating the basic processes in onboarding such as reference requests and DBS checks . Effective onboarding ensures your new employees are engaged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must reflect the promises made during the interview process which can only happen if HR has the time to focus on new hires . <p> You expect HR software to fix your broken hiring process : Recruitment software ca n't fix what 's broken but it will give you clear insight into the problem areas in your hiring process . Pay attention to what the data is telling you and make informed , evidence based decisions to improve your hiring success . Automating processes which do n't work will prevent you from realising the full potential of your HR software . <p> Do n't let simple mistakes get in the way of your hiring success .

Research carried out by Glassdoor reveals a gradual increase over the last six years , with interview processes alone in the UK now taking , on average , 28.9 days .

Slow hiring will exacerbate this problem . The most sought after candidates will be on the receiving end of a number of job offers .

Employers need to do more to impress job applicants . If you 're not sure of your average time per hire , invest in an effective applicant tracking system- that will provide you with the- metrics you need . <p> Lower- quality of hire : A lengthy hiring process does n't guarantee an improvement in candidate quality or a better quality of hire .

Conducting an effective and positive interview is central to achieving this but , for HR , it is n't as straightforward as it might seem . <p> Candidates who suffer ' at the hands of unprepared and inexperienced hiring managers will vent their frustration online , impacting your employer brand and ability to attract qualified candidates . Here 's our advice . <p> What types of questions should you be asking ? <p> With the expanse of interview advice available online , today 's talent is well rehearsed and prepared for most questions , making the final selection sometimes difficult to call . Does that mean the surprise question still exists ? Writing in the Harvard Business Review , John Sullivan thinks not . He suggests that factors which have traditionally been relied upon for candidate assessment are no longer effective . These include brainteasers ' and meeting more than four interviewers . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a successful hire . <p> That does n't mean you should rush to tear up your traditional interview methods . For example , Google 's structured interview process includes a combination of behavioural and situational based questions , supported by online assessments to evaluate cognitive ability , conscientious and leadership . <p> Remove the obvious : Questions such as What are your strengths and weaknesses ? ' and Where do you see yourself in five years ? ' should be avoided . <p> Restrict behavioural questions : The way in which a candidate performed in their job five years ago is likely to be far less relevant in today 's rapidly changing workplace . <p> Adopt a job content ' approach : Make it relevant to your vacancy . Ask candidates to outline how they would solve a challenge specific to the role as it stands , for example . <p> Anticipating the future : This might include questions which require candidates to forecast potential changes in the industry or outline their strategy for success in their first six months of employment . <p> Four interview rules for hiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's jobs market . Nearly two thirds of candidates will accept a job offer yet continue their search . The experience during the interview will influence their final decision making process . With many hiring managers lacking interview experience or training , the guidelines below should be a given for every interview : - <p> Be prepared : Review each candidate 's CV prior to the interview to prepare questions based on their individual skills and experience . Do n't begin reading their application during the interview itself and do n't repeat basic questions already covered during the screening process . <p> Show respect : Block the time out in your calendar and set your mobile to silent . Do n't send e-mails on your laptop or take calls during the interview unless it is a genuine emergency . <p> Familiarise yourself with the job description : Only one third of hiring managers are engaged with the recruiting process . Make the effort to read the job description and understand exactly what the key performance objectives and critical skills are for this job . <p> Focus on the candidate : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person behind the CV . Whether or not you hire them and regardless of whether you think they are a good fit for the job , your focus should be on them , not you . <p> In essence , hiring managers should prepare for the interview with the same attention to detail they expect from their candidates . <p> Responding to a rejected job offer <p> Rejected job offers are increasingly one of HR 's biggest challenges . Understanding why your offer is declined enables you to improve your candidate experience and job offer to acceptance ratio . Introduce a process that obtains feedback from all candidates , but specifically those who turned down your job offer . Factors affecting their decision may include : - <p> Job offer , title , salary , benefits and location . <p> A distracted hiring manager , or a lack of knowledge about the position or candidate . Given the figures on interview experience above , this is possible . <p> A drawn out decision making process or too many interviews ( a maximum of three is normally sufficient ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult choice between two or more job offers . In this situation , understanding what your competitor offered in terms of salary , culture , training and career development opportunities is critical . <p> Significant discrepancies in the advertised job post and the information provided at interview . <p> Not all candidates will feel comfortable providing negative feedback directly so a confidential feedback form shared via a third party may be the best option . Ensure questions are open-ended for the broadest response . Constructive feedback enables you as an employer to improve your candidate experience and your future job offer to acceptance ratio . <p> The role of technology <p> Making your final hiring decision solely on the basis of the interview raises the risk of a bad hire . A historical study found that the initial judgements of the hiring manager frequently determine the final outcome of the interview . These judgements , it suggests , are useless ' .

@@44110290 @4110290/ <h> 8 Ways To Fix Your Graduate Recruitment Process <p> Hiring processes for young people are broken and jeopardise the ability of employers to attract graduates . That 's according to a new report from Business in the Community ( BITC ) and City and Guilds Group which found that one in five young people were put off by a company following a bad candidate experience . Businesses are being urged to change their recruitment strategies to attract the talent they need to compete . <p> Here 's how : - <p> Be realistic : Do n't hire graduates for jobs that do n't require graduate calibre skills . A CIPD report in 2015 revealed that nearly 60% of graduates were in jobs that did n't require a degree qualification . Furthermore , over half ( 57% ) of young people surveyed by BITC reported that a lack of experience was a barrier to their progress , yet 39% of employers claimed they require no experience . Be clear about what you expect from your candidates . <p> Make it easy to apply : One in three young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through your own candidate experience . How easy is to apply ? Lengthy application forms , careers sites which are n't mobile friendly and a system which requires repeat submissions of the same information wo n't work . Keep in mind that this may be your graduate 's first ever job application . Use recruitment software to ensure a seamless transition from your corporate website to your careers page and a one-click ' apply process . <p> Provide feedback : A third of candidates welcome meaningful feedback , even if it their application is rejected . Young people in search of their first job will benefit from advice that will help them in their ongoing job search . Keep in mind too that graduates share their experiences of your hiring process on social media and sites like Glassdoor . Constructive feedback promotes a better impression of your employer brand . <p> Understand your key metrics : Invest in HR technology for insight on key metrics such as time to hire , cost of hire and candidate drop-outs . For example , in-demand graduates will quickly realise their value on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur in your pipeline will help you to address the problems . Sophisticated recruitment software achieves this . <p> Reduce delays : Lengthy time to hire is one of the biggest obstacles to successful graduate recruitment . Automate key elements of your process to ensure qualified talent is quickly screened , assessed and interviews are scheduled . Candidates will respond more positively to businesses with efficient hiring process . <p> Manage expectations : Nearly a fifth of young people claimed the high costs of the recruitment process are a problem . Consider alternatives such as video interviews to reduce the pressure on candidates and offer to reimburse essential expenses when face-to-face interviews are carried out . Manage expectations by clarifying exactly what is provided from the outset . <p> Be innovative : Take inspiration from global financial services company AXA . Last year the brand ran a Great Global Adventure online , offering the winner a twelve month all expenses paid trip around the world . The prize also included two internships with AXA and a chance to work with one of its volunteer partners . In one move it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for adventure and expectations of corporate sociable responsibility from their employers . In the process AXA also added 20,000+ graduates to its talent pipeline . <p> Be aware of future trends : Effective graduate recruitment strategies require a long-term , pro-active approach , not simply a response to current demand . Graduate applications to universities in 2016 show a slight increase but longer term applications from UK students are expected to dip . As global universities raise their game to appeal to international students , UK universities " and employers - must respond accordingly . 40982 @qwx450982 40998 @qwx450998 40992 @qwx450992 
@@44110291 @4110291/ <h> HR &amp; Brexit : The Debate So Far <p> With over three months still to go , the debate over the effect of Brexit on HR and the jobs market is being strongly contested by each side . In this article , we look at some of the principal issues and arguments and explore how HR can prepare for the potential impact of Brexit . <p> The skills shortage <p> CV Library found that over 40% of UK recruiters are concerned about restricted access to qualified candidates as a direct result of Brexit . It is a view reiterated in a survey released just yesterday by recruitment agency Manpower which highlights that over 200,000 jobs created in the UK last year were filled by workers from the EU . Official figures were provided by the Office of National Statistics ( ONS ) . Those skills , it is implied , could be lost if the out ' campaign is successful . <p> An alternative view exists , however . A CIPD report suggested there is little evidence of a skills shortage ' due to current record levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for employers . The level of excess- labour is also seen as responsible in part for the current downward pressure on UK average wages ( predicted to remain within the 1-2% bracket during- 2016 and beyond ) . <p> Brexit would mean a wider choice of vacancies for job seekers but the potential for business growth may be limited due to a reduced skills supply- if EU workers are no longer permitted to move freely to work in the UK . A smaller labour pool may also lead to higher pay levels. - Average weekly earnings at present remain 9% below 2008 in real terms . This may be regarded as a benefit for employees but an additional cost at a time of uncertainty for employers . <p> The most vulnerable industry sectors <p> Industries which rely on access to a broad talent pool of low skilled workers , such as construction , retail and agriculture , may feel the impact more strongly but not exclusively . <p> Professor Adrian Favell , writing for the London School of Economics makes a clear distinction between freedom of movement ' and immigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightest and best ' talent would not come to the UK , resulting in a shrinking talent pool . Professor Favell views freedom of movement as a set of rights ' permitting both short-term and long-term movement across the EU . London has been a main beneficiary of this freedom of movement implying that employers based in the capital would experience the biggest talent shortage . - <p> Much would also depend on whether investment in a post-Brexit UK rises or falls . Increased investment would lead to more jobs being created but a fall may dramatically impact the stock market . <p> Employment law <p> In theory , the UK would be free to amend all employment laws following Brexit but doubt exists over whether it would do so in practice . The CIPD comments that employment law would be unaffected by Brexit as it believes that the UK government would be unlikely to remove safeguards and protection against such issues as discrimination and equal pay . <p> As EU membership affords greater protection to public sector employees by giving them the right to enforce EU directives on issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue to be considered . <p> The requirement to refer cases to the European Court would no longer exist which would be a cost benefit for UK businesses . <p> Agency Workers ' Rights ( AWR ) <p> Introduced in October 2011 , the Agency Workers ' Rights charter ( AWR ) granted temporary workers equal rights with permanent employees , including holiday and sick pay , after 12 weeks of continuous employment . Some parties have voiced concern that leaving the EU would lead to the repeal or amendments of AWR and the European Working Time Directive . <p> Alternatively , it is considered that a renegotiation of trading terms with the EU may be conditional upon EU employment directives remaining in place . <p> Big business versus small business ? <p> Following the announcement of the referendum , nearly 200 business leaders signed a letter to the Times in support of remaining in the EU , citing their need for unrestricted access to the European market of 500 million people ' to ensure ongoing investment in job creation . <p> On the opposing side of the argument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Brexit , identifying unnecessary regulations ' - as problematic for- their bottom line . This group claimed that the UK economy was sufficiently robust to create more jobs without being held back by the EU ' . <p> It is n't a straightforward matter of big business versus small business . Three of the UK 's leading supermarkets " Sainsbury 's , Tesco and Morrisons " refused to sign the letter supporting the remain ' campaign , stating that this is a matter for the British people to decide . Arguably , a shrinking labour pool would impact them the most . <p> How can HR prepare for a potential vote to leave the EU ? <p> It is impossible to predict the outcome of the EU referendum , much less the impact it will have on jobs , access to skilled labour or employment laws . Separating facts from the- increasingly heated debates of the opposing campaigns will be a huge challenge for employers . <p> One thing is certain . Nothing will happen overnight . The UK will have two years within which to negotiate the terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further year if required . Changes are likely to be gradually phased in to allow HR to transition . - The type of relationship the UK negotiates with the EU in the event of an exit will also affect what happens during this time . <p> The UK becomes a member of the EEA ( European Economic Area ) . Norway currently operates on this basis . <p> The UK adopts Switzerland 's model as a member of the European Free Trade Association ( EFTA ) . <p> The UK negotiates its own agreements with the EU and other countries as a member of the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) . <p> In the meantime , HR will still be required to deliver solutions to meet workforce demands . Its focus must be on the issues it can impact , whatever the result . <p> These include the imminent implementation of the National Living Wage on 1st April , boosting productivity , the creation of effective talent acquisition and retention strategies and key areas identified in this year 's Human Capital Trends Survey , such as , organisational design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event of Brexit , additional issues to be borne in mind include : - <p> The possibility of work sponsorship : Managing Director of Migrate UK , Jonathan Beech , speaking to Recruitment Grapevine believes that Brexit may lead to the introduction of work sponsorship , mirroring the system in place for non-EEA- workers with transitional ' arrangements for EEA workers already living in the UK . There is an argument that this could lead to more equality in the talent pool as restrictions on non-EU workers have recently become more complex. - <p> The importance of background checks : At present , failure to confirm an employee 's right to work in the UK risks a fine of up to -20,000 per person . Brexit may lead to confusion around this issue so the onus is on HR to ensure compliance in all areas . Recruiting software with inbuilt links to major checking agencies minimises the risks of HR operating illegally . <p> Investment in technology : Whether or not the UK votes to leave the EU , HR can not continue to rely on manual recruitment systems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to move quickly , streamline its systems and become more creative will be heightened , making it increasingly difficult for businesses without recruitment software or HR analytics to compete effectively . <p> In or out , the uncertainty and changes brought about by the referendum debate are likely to intensify the competition for talent in many sectors .

In addition , spending on- learning and development- initiatives rose by 11% between 2014 and 2015 ( an increase of 15% compared to the- recession ) .

All main sectors reported a fall with manufacturing , mining and quarrying and electricity and gas contributed the most to the widening gap . There is n't a single solution for improving productivity but the Leesman Index suggests that the design of workspace plays a significant role . It claims that only 54% of UK employees believe their working environment is conducive to a productive working environment . <p> The Index , which records satisfaction levels with numerous workplace features and services , shows employees are increasingly looking for a variety of workspaces , such as social and informal areas , to collaborate and communicate with colleagues , yet employers are failing to provide them . <p> The tools we use to work with have changed significantly in recent times but physical workspaces have n't been affected by radical change .

The UK 's culture of long working hours- is often given as- a cause of stagnant- productivity and high staff turnover . Flexible working offers employers the opportunity to reduce employment costs , retain the skills of key workers who might otherwise leave and improve efficiency . Flexible working can mean allowing people to work remotely too . Today 's technology allows for constant connectivity and monitoring of out-of-office workers and over a third of remote workers report an increase in productivity . <p> Do n't write-off the over 50s <p> Older workers possess a wealth of skills and experience that HR can tap into to benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demise of the over 50s by focusing on retirement planning in preference to career progression .

The report also found that only 10% of HR leaders believe their talent acquisition strategies are strategic and optimised ' . <p> If you 're new to talent acquisition or simply want to boost the success of your hiring process , here are our ten tips : - <p> Social media : A consistent social media presence is one of the most cost effective marketing tools and integral to the creation of talent pools . Research which sites are most suited to your sector starting with LinkedIn , Facebook and Twitter . Do n't be distracted by talk of recruiters on Snapchat and Instagram . Start small and build a positive reputation . Respond promptly to enquiries and post regular updates . <p> Personalise communications : Candidates know their CVs are likely to be processed through applicant tracking software but you can still give the impression of a human touch . Personalise automated responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct qualified applicants to relevant company information , such as your careers site , latest press releases or reviews on Glassdoor . <p> Create a leadership projection : Succession planning is often overlooked by HR during talent acquisition in its rush to hire qualified applicants.Evaluate the progress of your shortlisted candidates over their career to assess their future leadership potential . Did they peform a number of different roles in one company ? What skills were acquired ? Did they begin in a junior role and work their way up the company ranks to a leadership or managerial position ? Leadership is a major concern for today 's businesses " think long-term talent acquisition , not- short-term fix . <p> Do n't rule out job hoppers : Traditionally , a job hopping career history resulted in the elimination of a candidate from the hiring process but today 's employment market is changing . It 's not unusual for today 's job seekers to have changed jobs frequently " every one or two years on a regular basis - especially during the early stages of their career . Job hoppers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network of resources that employers can tap into . Evaluate each candidate on their merits . <p> Work on your culture : An authentic culture is the key to successful talent acquisition .

For companies that get it right , the talent shortage does n't exist ( as we 've highlighted before , it is more difficult to get into Harvard than it is to get a job at Google ) . <p> Anticipate rejection : Evaluate the reasons why a candidate might reject your job offer . A slow hiring process , poor candidate experience or a counter offer may result in a no ' . To add to employers ' frustrations nearly a third of candidates reject offers because they accepted a job with another company .

Will it change their work/life balance ? Have they considered how they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will help to save time and frustration . <p> Evaluate ambition : Talent acquisition is a costly business requiring significant investment . You need to know that your preferred candidate is committed to your company and show that you can offer them the progression they need . Evaluate ambition by asking where and what their next job will be " ie , the one that they would convince them to leave your company . <p> Consider hiring boomerang employees : A boomerang employee is someone who previously worked for you and is later rehired . In a talent starved market it is an option but one that should be carefully considered .

MRINetwork 's Sentiment Study released in December 2014 revealed that as many as 42% of successful applicants are rejecting job offers . As HR faces more pressure to create flawless hiring solutions , here are ten steps to ensure your job offer is accepted : - <p> Get the candidate experience right : The candidate experience is- your biggest opportunity to convince a prospective new hire that your vacancy offers an- ideal career move . 2014 's Candidate Experience Awards revealed that 47.7% of applicants had no previous relationship with an employer before applying for a- position with them . Promote a positive impression of your company through your online recruitment channels and across your careers site . Take advantage of your recruiting software to ensure consistent , personalised and branded communication throughout the hiring process . This means setting expectations and delivering on them by responding to questions and providing feedback at every stage of the process . <p> Raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter offers are on the rise . If you 're certain you 've identified a strong contender for your vacancy you must deal with the spectre of the counter offer early in the process . Ask questions such as , How will your current employer react if you hand in your resignation ? ' and What would make you stay in your present job ? ' According to the MRINetwork survey nearly half ( 49% ) of professionals leave their current job in search of greater opportunities for advancement . Identify the motivations- of your preferred candidate and address them during the hiring process . <p> Do n't waste time : Time kills deals . Once your decision is made contact your prospective new hire within 24 hours and preferably on the same day of the interview . Bear in mind that 31% of candidates in the MRINetwork survey rejected a job offer because they accepted another one . Do n't waste time . <p> Pick up the telephone : Call the candidate to make the initial job offer . Not only does it demonstrate how keen you are for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to evaluate their initial reaction . If you really want this candidate on your team , show them how much ! - Follow up with formal confirmation processed through your recruiting software once your offer is accepted. - <p> Show enthusiasm : Let the candidate know that out of the hundreds ( or thousands ) of CVs screened through your applicant tracking software they match the requirements of the job more closely than any other candidate . Share what impressed you about their attitude , skills and accomplishments . An interview is the place for formality . Once you 've made your decision , enthusiasm is a must . <p> Negotiate salary : Be clear on exactly what salary and benefits a candidate can expect from joining your company . While it 's not the primary reason for most professionals quitting- their jobs , an increase in salary is still a given . If the final package comprises an on-target earnings element provide clear illustrations of how that can be achieved with details of what employees in similar roles have earned in the past year. - <p> Be flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perks that make the difference in acceptance and rejection of the final job offer . Be innovative. - Technology company Samsung recently launched several new benefits packages to reward staff , including magazine subscriptions , a wine club offering and a concierge service . Go above and beyond flexible hours which are now a legal right . <p> Emphasise- job security : Small businesses may feel they ca n't compete with the ' glamour ' of- larger organisations but the latest great places to work in the UK survey- suggests the opposite . Job security ranked higher than rewards among respondents , with smaller organisations performing better than corporations in offering job security to candidates . SMEs also have the time to attract the right people to their organisation and offer more effective performance management . If that 's your business , highlight that advantage . <p> Get a commitment : Once the job offer is made , press the candidate for a commitment . A tentative acceptance is preferable to indecision . Deal with objections quickly and request formal acceptance of your offer within three days . Close them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other shortlisted candidates that the job offer has been accepted ? ' <p> Stay close : The notice period is often a stressful time for candidates . Stay close to them during this time through regular telephone contact and updates on how you are preparing for their arrival . Onboarding begins when the job offer is accepted . Ensure yours is successful with modern recruiting software which will take care of essential background checks and schedule your new hire 's orientation process .

These simple strategies can help to reconnect with a workforce that feels irrelevant and undervalued : - <p> Speak to your people - Nearly half of all staff have n't spoken to a representative from HR in the previous 12 months according to a YouGov survey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound persistent problems with low productivity . UK workers believe that over one third of their time spent at work is unproductive but unless HR communicates with its employees , it ca n't begin to identify problems in the workforce . <p> Value your employees : Forget age group classifications , people generally want similar things from their employers . Most want to be treated with respect , recognised for their achievements , enjoy a positive work/life balance and have access to career development opportunities . That includes people over 50 with both technical and soft skills vital to your organisation who are too often prioritised for retirement planning . Recognising your employees is a first step towards a more positive working environment . Investors In People 's Job Exodus Survey found that nearly 40% of employees wanted to leave their jobs because they do n't feel valued .

With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative headlines over brands like Caffe Nero and BP , the pressure to pay a fair salary is growing . Controversy over the gender pay gap has fuelled the belief in a disparity between the treatment of employees and senior executives . One positive recent example , however , is the example of Richard Pennycock , Chief Executive of the Co-op , who has taken a 60% pay cut as his job has ' become easier ' . <p> .. and pay people on time : Nothing destroys trust or demotivates your employees more than persistently paying them late , but one fifth of UK workers have experienced delays , with nearly half having been paid late on more than one occasion . <p> Encourage healthy sleep patterns : The World Economic Forum suggests that driving a positive change in your organisation 's performance and culture ( and subsequently trust ) could effectively begin by encouraging your staff to get a good night 's sleep .

This may in part be due to the reluctance of the majority of employees to approach HR over fundamental issues such as pay , flexible working and sick leave . <p> Treat all of your people equally : It should go without saying that all people should be treated equally , but a new study found that the questionable morals of some high achievers are overlooked , providing they meet their performance objectives . This will not only contribute towards a toxic culture but also create a divide between your employees . <p> Work on your culture : Culture is inextricably connected to employee engagement and trust , requiring commitment from business leadership .

Learn from the mistakes of others . Your candidate may seem perfect but it 's essential that your hiring decision is based on more than gut feel ' . The Risk Advisory Group reports that CV inaccuracies and blatant candidate lies ' are on the rise , up to 70% in the last year . Background checks are the vital final step in your recruitment process . <p> The importance of background checks <p> As we recently highlighted , 42% of UK companies fail to carry out background checks on prospective hires but they are essential for the following reasons : - <p> Ensure your candidate is eligible to work : 38% of companies do n't check the right of an employee to work in the UK . The penalty for hiring an illegal worker is a maximum of -20,000 per person if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Confirm there are no compliance issues : Compliance checks such as credit status and criminal records are essential for specific jobs but once in work , periodic checks are also necessary . Recent examples of theft include a recruitment agency defrauded of c-31,000 by an unsupervised member of staff , resulting in lost commission and bonuses for the remaining employees . <p> Ensure your workers are safe : For positions involving contact with vulnerable people , checks are mandatory , however , we recommend carrying them out on all of your prospective hires . Employers are expected to be increasingly more accountable for the actions of their employees . The Supreme Court this week ruled that supermarket chain Morrison 's was vicariously liable ' for an employee attacking one of its customers . <p> Temporary workers should also be covered by your company 's standard background checks .

For security , automate your reference checks through recruitment software with inbuilt links to DBS ( Disclosure and Barring Services ) and accredited credit checking agencies . Responses can be forwarded to nominated individuals within a company , particularly in the event of negative feedback . <p> In addition to automated checks , confirm a reference verbally to gain insight into a candidate 's character . When speaking to referees , keep conversations professional and objective , covering the following points : - <p> Confirm in what capacity they know your candidate . <p> Plan your questions carefully , focusing on the core skills and competencies as well as the key performance objectives of the job . <p> Confirm essential facts relating to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities .

Remain impartial and do n't rush the call . <p> Conclude by asking them if they would re-employ your candidate if appropriate . The response will be informative . <p> Everyone makes mistakes and sometimes candidates may have genuinely included some erroneous information in error . Discuss the issue with the hiring manager and address the problem with the candidate as soon as possible .

@@44110342 @4110342/ <h> 6 Ways To Hold On To Your Graduate Talent <p> In addition to last year 's unfilled vacancies and last minute job offer rejections , graduate employers are facing a new problem " holding on to their graduate hires after completion of their initial training period . <p> The Association of Graduate Recruiters ( AGR ) revealed that 16% of graduates leave within the first two years of employment , an increase of 9% compared to last year . Financial services was the only sector to record a small ( 1% ) increase in graduate retention levels . Replacing a departing graduate hire is becoming more difficult too . According to data from Adzuna , the graduate sector is in the top five for skills shortage as 7.4% of graduate vacancies remain open after 90 days . <p> Engaging with your graduate recruits and understanding what motivates them enables HR to improve retention . Deloitte 's 2017 Millennial Survey highlights what millennials as a whole want from their employer : - <p> An employer that acts as a force for positive change in society . <p> The ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be involved with good causes ' locally . Workplace apathy is a significant problem for the UK 's employers , making meaningful work a priority to improve retention levels of graduates . <p> Transparency , plain talk ' and an inclusive culture , with the focus on a leadership which appeals to people who are isolated . <p> Flexible working opportunities . <p> At an average cost per hire of -1,700 according to the AGR , and a median spend of -3,105 per hire on graduate development , the implementation of a graduate retention strategy must be a priority for HR this year . <p> Incorporate the following steps to reduce your attrition levels : - <p> Review salaries , including the gender pay gap <p> Better pay was the reason given for almost 1 in 5 graduate departures in the AGR 's survey . Creating a culture of transparency and equal opportunities for all of your employees will improve attrition rates .

Agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Female graduates often earn more than their male counterparts in just eight sectors , including general engineering , social work and pharmacology and pharmacy . Review the data in your recruitment software to compare starting salaries of your graduate intake compared to your attrition rates . <p> Introduce an internship programme <p> Graduate hires who previous working as interns stay on average an additional six months with their employer . UK internships have doubled this year but have attracted a degree of criticism due to the number of unpaid positions and HR 's tendency to allocate opportunities to well-connected individuals , inhibiting social mobility . The Institute of Public Policy has proposed the introduction of a National Opportunity Programme as an alternative , to increase diversity among graduate employers . An effective , transparent internship policy promotes your employer brand and enables HR to create a graduate talent pool as well as improve retention levels .

That is where your weakness lies . <p> Offer career development and training opportunities <p> 14% of graduates leave due to the lack of opportunities for career progression according to the AGR . Some employers place so much emphasis on the graduate recruitment programme in order to attract the top talent that fulfilling the promises they made during the hiring process are forgotten . Provide ongoing training and career development to meet expectations of meaningful work and retain your top talent . <p> Carry out an exit interview <p> An exit interview should be mandatory for all of your employees .

Post Brexit , HSBC announced it no longer plans to remove 1,000 jobs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indicating a more positive outcome . <p> In developing effective graduate recruitment strategies during this transition period and beyond , UK businesses should be aware of the following : - <p> STEM skills shortages : If restrictions on freedom of movement are put in place , the onus will be on employers and Universities to ensure graduates are equipped with relevant skills to meet business requirements . For example , the level of unemployment among computer science graduates currently stands at 11.7% . At the same time , STEM jobs as a whole are suffering from a talent shortage , which is exacerbated by new figures which found that only 12.8% of jobs in the sector are held by women . Issues of culture and retention need to be resolved by employers to address this imbalance . <p> Graduates looking overseas ? Global jobsite Indeed reported a spike in young people looking for jobs overseas immediately following the Brexit vote . Dublin , Canada and Berlin were named as the most searched for locations . To attract top graduate talent HR must work on employer brand , on-the-job training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of skills . <p> The soft skills gap : CIPD Chief Executive Peter Cheese recently called for business schools and employers to work more closely together to tackle the UK 's soft skills gap . In particular , he highlighted the problem of high levels of graduates leaving University unprepared for the realities of the modern working environment . Basic employability skills ' were emphasised , coupled with the need for UK employers and Universities to create learning experiences for students that equip them for the changing world ' . A restriction on freedom of movement may force employers to invest more extensively in their workforce and specifically on the development of soft skills . <p> A shrinking talent pool : Path Motion 's survey found that 95% of employers regard access to the EU graduate talent pool as vital to their business . Faced with a smaller candidate pool , over half would apply for a work permit in order to continue hiring EU graduates with skills essential to their business , while 25% stated they planned to recruit higher numbers of UK graduates . <p> Resolving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay gap among graduates , which may be partly influenced by the lack of female candidates for STEM jobs . As the tech sector relies heavily on European talent , this is an issue which needs to be resolved quickly . Again , liaison with Universities and educational institutions is required , with the emphasis on additional technical training and strategies to overcoming cultural issues . Hiring strategies which remove bias through the use of anonymised CVs will help businesses to develop a more extensive and diverse talent pool to attract the right graduate talent . Data driven recruitment is the key to achieving this . 40982 @qwx450982 40998 @qwx450998 40992 @qwx450992

Candidates are not required to undertake a lengthy series of questions , as Elements tailors the difficulty of the next question presented based on the candidate 's previous responses . This ensures the questions they see are at the optimum level of challenge for them . It also means that there is no upper ability cap on the test enabling the candidate to demonstrate their true ability . This is known as adaptive testing ' . <p> Having this capability means that administrators no longer need to maintain a suite of ability assessments covering different ability levels , as all roles from supervisor upwards can use the same test . <h> Key features <p> Measures : verbal , numerical and logical reasoning <p> Suitable for : recruitment , identification of high potential <p> Average completion time : 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elements Verbal <p> The Elements Verbal reasoning test consists of 15 questions based on passages of text . The questions are designed to measure a candidate 's ability to interpret verbal information and reach correct conclusions . This ability is important for any work involving the communication of ideas or the understanding of written information . It can also be important for work requiring analytical thinking . <p> There is no overall time limit for the test but there is a time limit for each question : 75 seconds for the first question on each passage of text and 60 seconds for subsequent questions . The average test completion time is approximately 12 minutes . <h> Elements Numerical <p> The Elements Numerical reasoning test consists of 12 questions based on information presented in tables . The questions are designed to measure a candidate 's ability to analyse and draw inferences from numerical information and data . Numerical reasoning ability is important for a variety of roles that involve working with data . <p> There is no overall time limit for the test but there is a time limit for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table ( or set of tables ) and 75 seconds for subsequent questions . The average test completion time is approximately 12 minutes . <h> Element Logical <p> The Elements Logical reasoning test consists of 12 questions based on an incomplete series of symbols . The questions are designed to measure a candidate 's ability to analyse abstract information and apply this to determine outcomes and patterns . Logical reasoning ability is important for a variety of roles requiring complex problem solving . <p> There is no overall time limit for the test but there is a time limit for each question : 75 seconds . The average test completion time is approximately 9 minutes . <h> Features <p> There are a wide range of benefits to using Elements in your recruitment and development processes . <p> Speed : each Elements test takes approximately 12 minutes to complete " half the time of most ability tests " without compromising on scientific rigour . <p> A single test system : this removes the need to maintain a large suite of tests for different ability levels . In addition , while there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separately . <p> Fair : test difficulty is not predetermined by any assumptions of candidate ability enabling a candidate to demonstrate their true ability level . <p> Multiple-use of the data : Elements data can be re-used and interrogated for multiple purposes so whilst initially you may have gathered data for recruitment , it can later be used for succession planning and identifying potential . <p> Customisable : Elements can be re-branded using an organisation 's own branding and design . <p> Reliable : Elements can be completed remotely but results can be confirmed with a six to eight minute verification test ( at no extra cost ) , completed in person to minimise the risk of cheating . <p> Secure : Elements ' adaptive structure means that each candidate is likely to receive a unique combination of questions . There are also multiple versions of the questions , which further decreases the chances of two people receiving the same test . Both of these features reduce the chances that questions and correct answers can be published . <p> International : Elements is currently available in over 40 languages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programmes . <p> Return on investment : one final and often overlooked benefit of Elements is the return on investment ( ROI ) that it offers the organisation . By using a robust and valid assessment in the early stages of a recruitment process , applicants that are not suitable can be screened out so that the more costly , often face-to-face , stages can be conducted with those candidates that appear to be more suitable for the role . Also , by introducing an assessment with proven validity , the organisation will very soon see marked differences in the productivity and performance of employees , which ultimately will impact the bottom line in a wide variety of ways .

@@44110372 @4110372/ <h> Changing HR : AI At Work <p> Data driven recruitment has a significant , positive impact on talent management strategies and business performance . As technology becomes more sophisticated , AI is playing an increasingly essential role in decisions made around hiring and is used by brands such as Facebook as an integral part of the screening and assessment of candidates . <p> This article examines its ongoing effect on the jobs market and the ways in which HR can harness its advantages to better understand , improve and predict hiring needs and potential problems . <p> Changing employment sectors <p> AI is broadly defined as machines which perform tasks which humans are capable of performing ' . It has been traditionally been regarded as a threat to jobs , with the most drastic predictions suggesting that unemployment rates will reach 50% within 30 years , but perceptions and predictions are changing . <p> Rather than AI leading to a jobless future , the 2016 report from Stanford University 's One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence suggests that AI will be regarded as a radically different mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leading to the creation of new types of jobs . <p> To give this some context , a reported 60% of existing retail jobs1 have a high chance ' of automation by 2036 but a new sector of e-commerce has emerged in response to this change . As predicted by Deloitte , high risk jobs are being replaced by more creative low risk jobs with each new- job paying a salary -10,000 higher than the- one it replaced , in the process adding -140 billion to the UK economy . This shift is also apparent in the rising demand for specialist tech skills in areas like data analysis across all sectors . <p> Stanford University 's 2016 report also concludes that the impact of AI is n't limited to medium skilled jobs but will invade almost all employment sectors ' affecting the higher end of the job spectrum , encroaching on professional services and impacting even cognitive roles . <p> The need for the human touch <p> The proliferation of AI is not without its problems , however . AI-averse HR leaders have enjoyed some justification for their reluctance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the negative publicity generated by Microsoft 's Twitter bot , Tay , Facebook has faced criticism after replacing its trending ' team with algorithms , which led to the publication of false and inappropriate links . More relevant to HR was LinkedIn being forced to deny claims of gender bias in its search algorithm . <p> AI is most effective when combined with the human touch . It is based on mathematics ; when harnessed within HR technology , it improves the hiring process , from candidate screening to onboarding , enabling HR to create more effective talent management strategies . AI is a collaborative robot or co-bot ' as it is referred to , - freeing people to carry out more productive tasks . <p> Technology and the competitive advantage <p> Technology is vital to the future of the workforce , giving employers a competitive edge . A study from Oxford Economics , entitled Leaders 2020 , found that the most successful businesses are one and a half times more likely to use technology . It also reiterates the following : - <p> The businesses- it describes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updated technology to their employees . <p> These organisations also tend to have happier and more engaged employees . <p> Of concern was the fact that less than half of respondents stated that their company leadership was highly proficient ' in using technology , a growing problem in the UK 's economy . <p> Incorporating AI into the- recruitment process <p> AI should be regarded as critical to all businesses. - It guides HR to make better decisions , replacing tasks rather than jobs ' and driving improvements across the following areas : - <p> Improving talent acquisition : Your business will be better informed and able to predict future hiring needs , source people more quickly and identify skills gaps within your existing workforce . HR technology is- the first step towards identifying those gaps . <p> AI , in the form of HR analytics , helps to improve diversity and reduce bias in recruitment . Diversity means hiring the best candidate for a position who will also fit well with your existing team . The Oxford Economics report found that a diverse workforce results in higher revenue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of your hiring process , enabling HR to eliminate poor hiring decisions , cutting out the need for gut feel ' and guess work . It also predicts the candidates most likely to succeed . <p> Improving retention : AI can quickly identify factors affecting high staff turnover . For example , your current pay scale may match the market but if it veers towards the lower end , your business risks losing talent to your competitors . HR analytics enables identification of those patterns within your organisation . <p> HR analytics predicts the skills needed for your future workforce , - equipping HR with vital data needed for- effective planning . In a knowledge based economy , the World Economic Forum predicts that a combination of mathematical and interpersonal skills will be among those in highest demand . Traditional educational models coupled with a lack of vital skills in the UK are leading to a mismatch of talent , however. - To be truly effective , a- ' joined-up ' HCM process begins with a recruitment management system that integrates ongoing employee skills assessment and training. - <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the central components to its hiring strategy , namely Marcus Buckingham 's and Curt Coffman 's book " First , Break All the Rules .

It recommends that the primary focus in candidate selection is on talent , which they describe as a recurring pattern of thought , feeling or behaviour that can be productively applied ' . Technology provides a range of techniques from sophisticated screening through applicant tracking software and online assessments to virtual reality such as video interviews enabling HR to identify , focus on and hire talent . <p> Advorto 's recruitment software provides workflow and structure across the entire hiring process , offering a dynamic database of candidates and analytics .

@@44110373 @4110373/ <p> What does it take to be successful in talent acquisition ? In today 's workplace , with its complex list of demands , the answer is n't straightforward . We 've focused on five of the most essential below : - <p> Ability to carry out structured interviews : Recent headlines have pointed out the increasingly unusual interview questions posed , including an impossible ' puzzle from Microsoft . Quirky questions may be more suited to global tech brands with a surplus of job applicants . For most employers they may have a more negative impact . Successful people in talent acquisition understand the value of structured interviews , combining competency and situational based questions with online assessments during the screening process in order to assess cognitive ability and gain an insight into culture fit . <p> Commitment to reducing bias : Bias or discrimination in hiring is difficult to eradicate . The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors is the latest organisation to bring attention to gender bias ( only 14% of its global membership is female ) and take steps to rectify the issue with the introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most successful HR professionals understand that business success depends on hiring the best candidate regardless of social background , education , race or gender . Supported by HR technology , they work towards removing confirmation bias or hiring on intuition from their talent acquisition strategy . <p> A flexible approach : The best people in talent acquisition find workable solutions . For example , HR Magazine recently explored the difficulty businesses face in successfully addressing the issue of flexible working . It highlights a division of BAE Systems that allows production workers to end their working week on completion of targets , which often occurs on a Thursday afternoon , giving them Friday as a free day . Nor is flexibility limited to extending standard working hours . It 's also about the simple gestures that can create a happier workforce such as allowing staff time off to watch Game of Thrones or Euro 2016 . <p> They talk to their employees : So far , 2016 has seen stark warnings about rising levels of job dissatisfaction , people in the wrong job and employees who have n't spoken with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiring process , the engagement , development and retention of new employees begins immediately . This should incorporate regular career conversations as well as more formal , ongoing assessments to replace the annual performance review . The best people in talent acquisition ensure these conversations happen . <p> Willingness to embrace change ( ie , technology ) : Negative headlines about automation have sent wary HR functions deeper into the comfort zone offered by their manual recruitment systems . While headlines have focused on job losses , automation can lead to the creation of higher skilled , lower risk jobs , as suggested by Deloitte . Furthermore , Natwest Bank 's latest report reveals that the UK has seen a 12.5% rise in highly skilled jobs , including doctors , lawyers , teachers and accountants , since 2008 . It found that this increase offset a much smaller fall in the number of low skilled jobs , which were frequently repetitive roles replaced by technology . Employers who resist incorporating technology in their hiring process will struggle to attract qualified candidates to their job posts as they have no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their best hires come from . The most successful people in talent acquisition recognise that and take advantage of all that technology has to offer . <p> Take your first step into technology with recruitment software that allows you to hire better people faster .

Job hoppers often switch jobs several times early on in their career while testing out their strengths and weaknesses and what works best for them . Before you rule out a candidate , review their CV and find out why they changed jobs so frequently . According to a LinkedIn survey , the top reason is lack of career advancement opportunities with their current employer , followed by : - <p> Salary <p> Unhappiness with company leadership <p> Dissatisfaction with company culture <p> Wanting more challenging work <p> No recruiter wants to be paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who leave their jobs within a year .

Professionals working in the public sector may lose up to a third of their take-home pay as a result leading to- concerns over the potential loss of highly qualified individuals from the public sector . Employers and recruitment agencies providing interim workers " rather than the individuals - will be responsible for ensuring professionals are paying the correct level of tax and National Insurance . The NHS in particular will be forced to absorb additional costs at a time when its finances face more pressure . <p> In terms of recruitment , it also faces ongoing crises in the following areas : - <p> Nursing recruitment remains in a critical stage . One in three nurses is expected to retire in the next 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Following the withdrawal of bursaries the Royal College of Nursing reported a 23% drop in nursing applications depleting an already diminished talent pool . The RCN has also called on the Government to fund additional staffing following a report by the Care Quality Commission ( CQC ) which suggests safety- at 80% of hospitals is ' not good enough ' . Newly released allegations of ' fat cat pay ' in the NHS will only add to the pressure as it has been revealed that over 600- quango- officials now- earn six figure salaries . <p> Growing numbers of nurses are turning to agency work to improve their work/life balance . Despite a cap , - agency spending in the NHS- is likely to remain high until staff recruitment and retention issues are resolved . Industry watchdog NHS Improvement recently identified over 100 agency workers earning in excess of -200,000 per year , many of which are already NHS employees . This practice is now being prohibited ahead of the introduction to the IR35 changes . <p> Research from the British Medical Association published in February suggests that 40% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK following the Brexit vote. - A further survey from the General Medical Council suggests this figure could be as high as 60% . The outcome of Brexit on staffing shortages remains uncertain with interest in healthcare jobs from the EU already seeing a fall . <p> The NHS employer brand is seemingly staggering from one crisis to another . Additional concerns were also raised this week following the revelation that half a million documents containing sensitive medical information were placed into storage in error- rather than being delivered to GPs between 2011-2016 . <p> The issues facing the NHS are complex and not easily resolvable . The following strategies have been recommended but implementation takes time and collaboration . Effective , robust recruitment has never been more critical for the NHS . Our sector focus on recruitment in healthcare expands on the following issues : - <p> Develop compassionate and inclusive leadership : The Kings Funds proposes a compassionate and inclusive leadership across the NHS , putting an end to the culture of blame and fear ' . To achieve this means creating and nurturing a diverse pipeline which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias within the hiring process at all stages . Creating a robust talent management strategy means a complete review of hiring strategies and effective analysis of the data provided . <p> Increase flexible working : More flexible working is essential to both attract and retain talent in healthcare as demand for key skills continues to exceed supply. - Concern was expressed over the lack of flexibility at a recent roundtable event for NHS Employers reported by the CIPD . Approximately three quarters ( 76% ) of the NHS 's workforce is female . The introduction of flexible working would help to reduce the pressure on HR and talent management strategies that are failing to retain staff with key skills . The belief is that the introduction of flexible working would reduce the reliance on agency workers to fill vital gaps in the workforce . It was noted that two thirds of nurses also take on additional agency shifts in addition to the permanent roles . <p> Implementing strategies to improve retention : Issues including bullying , pressured staff working long hours and the inflexible approach to working hours will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Our previous article highlighted the success of Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust which adopted a number of HR led ' interventions in areas such as employee behaviour to win the best employee engagement initiative at the CIPD 's People Management Awards . A further example was University College London Hospitals ( UCLH ) NHS Foundation Trust which became the first NHS employer to agree to the National Living Wage in London . <p> Adapt to the gig economy : As the IR35 deadline approaches , efforts must be made to retain the skills provided by contract workers in key areas . Effective training , a wellbeing policy and a formal performance review strategy which incorporates gig economy ' workers will become increasingly more urgent . <p> Incorporate onboarding : Onboarding is the final and equally essential part of the candidate experience . Previous research carried out by PwC found that one in three new hires leave their new job within a year , with 22% of these leaving within six weeks . Integrated onboarding is proven to boost time-to-productivity and employee engagement and reduce staff turnover . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the healthcare industry must extend to the hiring process in order to offset the broader issues facing the NHS .

@@44110454 @4110454/ <h> 6 Ways To Improve Your Graduate Recruitment Drive <p> As employers begin to look towards this year 's graduate intake , here 's our advice for how to improve your hiring success : - <p> Take a look at your brand : The impact of a poorly thought out strategy was demonstrated by sandwich shop chain Pret A Manger last week . After expressing concern about the problems Brexit would cause its hiring teams , it announced its Big Work Experience Week ' , intended to hire 500 teenagers for a week of work experience . A reference to paying them in sandwiches ' led to a widespread social media backlash and threats to boycott the chain . Do n't underestimate the effect a careless remark or badly worded job advert might have on your recruitment efforts . <p> Move beyond the same talent pool : New data from the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) suggests that unemployment among graduates in London is highest among young black men . The BBC reported that of approximately 1800 graduates recruited by 11 of London 's top graduate employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployment rate stands at 18% compared to 10% for white male graduates . Barclays employed the highest percentage ( 9 out of 320 ) while the NHS Leadership Academy recorded none . These figures come at a time when the UK 's biggest businesses have been warned of mandatory targets on diversity in recruitment if they do not voluntarily improve career development opportunities for BAME employees . Take the first step to reducing unconscious bias in your hiring process by removing filters in your recruitment software . An analysis of your recruitment data will also reveal just how diverse your hiring process is . <p> Do n't dismiss the digital skills crisis : A new report from Intern Tech1 found that 93% of tech firms are held back by a shortage of qualified candidates . The problem is compounded by the fact that 48% of graduates lack necessary tech and digital skills and were unfamiliar what specific tech jobs entailed , including roles such as data scientist , app developer and cyber security specialist . Last year we reported that UK businesses were paying up to 30% above current market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tech and finance . <p> Offer degree apprenticeships : Rolls Royce , GlaxoSmithKline and Goldman Sachs are among the growing number of employers who offer degree apprenticeships in partnership with Universities to attract young people with relevant skills . It can be a more attractive option for the employee as businesses pay both a salary and tuition fees . For sectors such as engineering , where 182,000 extra people are needed each year up until 2022 , the degree apprenticeship may offer an effective alternative to standard graduate recruitment . <p> Think outside the box : Companies are stepping up their efforts to identify the best graduate talent . Earlier this month Pepsico announced its Go Trendsetter ' challenge , an online competition which asks graduates to identify an industry trend and submit proposals on how to market it effectively . Elsewhere , online simulations , hackathons and gamification are increasingly used in graduate recruitment and the rural surveying sector recently took the unusual step of signing a Rural Charter in an attempt to reduce the number of job offers being turned down at the last minute . <p> Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote , 50% of the UK 's leading graduate employers anticipated a reduction in graduate recruitment , with an estimated 50,000 jobs in the balance . The reality is very different . High Fliers predict an increase of 4.3% in graduate vacancies this year with just 8% of businesses now intending to reduce their graduate intake . Retail , the public sector and engineering will collectively add 1,200 new graduate vacancies and nearly one third of graduates believe their job prospects will improve as a result of Brexit according to Intern Tech .

JP Morgan and Citigroup also reflect this trend . <p> After attracting a bad press and losing prospective talent to fintech companies in recent times , the FT article suggests this is in part due to the sector 's pro-active response to criticism . Banks are collectively working together to overturn a culture of gender bias and long working hours by following the example of Google and other tech brands . Notably , the CEOs of both JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are ranked in the top 25 CEOs in Glassdoor 's 2016 Employees ' Choice Awards , a list which was topped by the CEO of Metro Bank . <p> Where does that leave other employers with ongoing concerns about the employability of graduates and their ability to attract the right candidates ? <p> Understanding current trends may partly provide the answer to that question . We 've identified the following : - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their degrees are more likely to be employed in non-graduate roles such as retail or secretarial jobs , within six months .

This echoes a further study which shows young women aged 18 are 35% more likely to apply to University than young men " if this trend continues , it is projected to reach 75% for girls born in 2016 . <p> When it comes to hiring , however , the traditional gender bias appears to resume , with female graduates facing a reported pay gap of -8,000 , a trend which is slow to change . <p> Problematic interviews <p> One of the biggest obstacles to attracting and hiring talented graduates lies in the interview process which may also she 'd some light on the issues of the gender pay gap . It is harder for young women overall to apply to jobs and they are less likely to receive positive ( or any ) feedback according to the City &amp; Guilds Group and Business In The Community .

It also revealed a fall in graduate vacancies . <p> Effective hiring strategies <p> Awareness of trends helps to shape effective graduate recruitment strategies . For employers keen to hire top graduate talent quickly who may not attract the volume of applicants seen in the banking sector , here 's our advice : - <p> Adopt Google 's approach to hiring : This includes a positive stance towards work/life balance , plenty of on the job perks and a data driven approach to HR .

Which aspects are time consuming or frustrating ? Make it easier for graduates to apply and provide constructive feedback to every candidate you interview . <p> Invest in technology : Sophisticated HR technology enables you to open up your hiring process , remove your graduate filter and minimise bias . Look beyond gender and University education to understand what a great candidate looks like for your organisation . Taking advantage of HR technology to inform future hiring trends within your business will also enable HR to predict and plan for future vacancies , rather than simply react . <p> Whatever sector your business is in , support your graduate hiring strategy with recruitment software used by some of the world 's leading organisations . 40982 @qwx450982 40998 @qwx450998 40992 @qwx450992

A new study from Britain 's Healthiest Workplace suggests that employees who face an hour long commute or more each day are less productive and more likely to develop health related issues . Employees with the longest commute are also a third more likely to experience depression . Long commutes ( two hours or more ) increased by almost in the third in the past five years with 3.7 million workers travelling two hours or more every day .

Less than half of all employees have regular contact with a member of HR , ultimately creating a disconnect and potential mistrust . <p> A new study from Glassdoor found that one in five employees leave their jobs because of their boss 's attitude .

A report from Deloitte stated that at current rates of progress it wo n't close until 2069 . Today , the pay gap stands at 9.4% and is shrinking at the rate of just 2.5 pence per year . The report suggests that one cause of the problem is the lack of women in STEM jobs . At present , women represent 14.4% of the STEM sector and hold 17% of tech jobs . <p> The shortage in the tech sector is n't exclusive to the UK . Deloitte Global notes that less than 25% of tech jobs in developed countries globally will be held by women by the end of 2016 . Attracting more women into tech jobs may help to alleviate the pay gap . <p> How can employers attract more women into tech ? Here 's our advice : - <p> Provide role models : Overcoming stereotypical views of an industry dominated by men is vital to attract more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female role models to demonstrate what is possible in a career in IT . Women comprised 16% of the top 100 CIOs in the UK in 2015 . Business Insider lists 26 of the coolest women in UK tech .

By replacing the word hacker ' with developer ' in their job adverts , social media platform Buffer noted an increase in the number of female candidates applying to their vacancies . Recruitment analytics will provide a breakdown of the ratio of male to female applicants to your tech vacancies , including which posts have proved to be the most successful in terms of candidate quality . <p> Expand your networks : Broaden your talent pool by tapping into networks such as Women in STEM , TechUK and the IET 's Women 's Network to learn more about the issues faced by women in the sector . Tailor your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirations and attract the talent your business needs . <p> Hire interns : For graduate employers , internships are an effective way of recruiting women into tech careers . The Association of Graduate Recruiters ' ( AGR ) annual survey showed that three quarters of graduate employers hired interns this year , with 45% of last year 's intake securing a job with the same employer . Be prepared to pay for rising tech stars , however . Social media brands including Snapchat , Twitter and Facebook pay over the odds to their interns to attract high achievers . <p> Highlight the positives : When employers get it right , a career in tech is a positive experience . A recently released list of the 20 happiest job titles for women ranked three tech jobs in the top 10 , including Senior Program Manager in first place .

Technology is regarded as the key to business success yet the UK is currently ranked only 14th globally for digital adoption . Training for skill does n't have to be restricted to your existing employees . For example , in March this year Sky launched its Get Into Tech initiative to encourage more women into careers in technology , offering free training for up to 60 women per year . Digital skills training must be part of HR employee development and engagement strategies . <p> Flexible working : The jobs which attract the highest number of remote or flexible workers are in sectors where skills are in short supply , according to global jobsite Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women are more likely to work part-time , the introduction of flexible or remote working opportunities is vital to open up your talent pool .

Workplace wellbeing is central to your ability to hire and retain talent in 2017 but the UK is facing a problem . <p> Health &amp; Safety Executive ( HSE ) figures1 show that 11.7 million working days were lost to work related stress , depression or anxiety in 2015/16 . Stress was the reason behind 45% of all working days lost due to i 'll health . <p> These figures support the CIPD 's 2016 Absence Management Survey which highlighted stress as the leading cause of long-term absence in the workplace . The area most affected according to the HSE is the public sector , including education and health and social care , but no industry is immune . Workload pressure , too much responsibility and a lack of support from line manager bosses are all causing stress at work . <p> Offer flexible working : Flexible or remote working is a straightforward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers would consider a pay cut to spend more time with their families but 11% are n't offered that option by their employers , according to the 2017 Modern Families Index report . A rigid workplace environment is more likely to lead to the loss of your most talented employees . Your recruitment software will provide insight into attrition rates and the number of your job posts that offer flexible working . <p> Be alert to presenteeism : Presenteeism is a growing problem in the working environment . For example , the FT reports that NHS staff are off sick for an average of 11 days each year but 65% also reported coming to work when they were i 'll during the previous month . Levels of presenteeism are higher than absenteeism in every sector , a factor which the CIPD believes is behind persistent low productivity in the UK . <p> Create a wellness programme : The CIPD recently reported that two thirds of companies do not have procedures for supporting staff with illness and only 45% have policies for dealing with bereavement .

Employees must feel confident in approaching HR to discuss the issues affecting their performance at work . <p> Review your zero hours ' policy : The prevalence of zero hours contracts in the UK is adding to workplace stress . One fifth of employers give their workers on zero hours contracts just 48 hours ' notice of shifts starting , changing or being cancelled . One fifth do n't allow staff to refuse these shifts . Furthermore , one in four people report that money worries are affecting their performance at work . Job security is the number one priority for job seekers today .

Wearables can help to monitor health and wellbeing among your employees and identify potential problems . While offering benefits for HR and employees , their use requires careful monitoring .

@@44110506 @4110506/ <h> 5 Ways To Improve Diversity &amp; Hire The Best Graduate Talent <p> The graduate jobs market is in a state of uncertainty . According to the Association of Graduate Recruiters ( AGR ) , the number of graduate vacancies has fallen by 8% in the past year . <p> Construction , retail and engineering saw the largest fall in open jobs with both Brexit and the apprenticeship levy regarded as partly responsible for this change . Employers are also beginning to replace some graduate positions with higher level apprenticeships . This move does not , however , resolve the issues for companies facing a shortage in key skills . The problem may lie in their approach to hiring . <p> A biased hiring process remains an obstacle to recruiting the best talent , with some industries more affected than others . The Social Mobility Commission 's report Socio-Economic Diversity in Life Sciences and Investment Banking found that recruitment in the banking sector is heavily biased towards candidates from wealthier backgrounds . Job applicants are filtered based on their secondary schools and the level of their parents ' income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sector came from fee paying schools compared to only 7% of the UK population as a whole . The report also found that bias extends towards speech patterns , accent , behaviour and dress ' . <p> These findings are supported by a study from the Higher Education Funding Council for England ( Hefce ) which found that white , male graduates from wealthy backgrounds are more likely to be hired in professional roles . <p> Unconscious bias means that employers are not accessing the top graduate talent available . Diversity in hiring expands your talent pool and provides access to candidates with in-demand skills . The digital skills shortfall alone is expected to reach 745,000 by 2017 according to the government 's Digital Skills Crisis report . <p> Improving diversity can be as simple as adopting the following criteria : - <p> Relax the application and screening process . Deloitte , PwC and EY were among the first organisations to remove academic qualifications from their entry criteria to ensure a more diverse approach to recruitment . <p> Extend your screening process to incorporate a wider range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Review your HR analytics to find evidence of bias in hiring , ie , graduate talent recruited from a similar socio-economic background or a pattern of recruiting from the same talent pool , irrespective of candidate quality . <p> Focus on data driven recruitment . Hiring managers who rely on intuition and overlook CV inaccuracies because the candidate feels right ' are recruiting based on unconscious bias . <p> Liaise more closely with schools , colleges and universities to prepare young people for the working environment and ensure appropriate skills are taught . The shortage of young people studying STEM subjects remains a problem , especially among girls . <p> Concerns over apprenticeships <p> If the graduate jobs market is shrinking , skills and training must be provided elsewhere . Apprenticeships should be the go-to alternative but the system is not without its problems . The National Audit Office has recently expressed concern over the government 's target of three million apprenticeships by 2020 which it believes is prioritising quantity of courses over quality of training . <p> One alternative is a new initiative from KPMG , which recently drastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked up with the Open University to launch a new apprenticeship service . Online learning is a key part of this new venture , which aims to help businesses to predict future skills needs and develop appropriate apprenticeship programmes . Three higher level apprenticeships will initially be offered , namely : - <p> Healthcare practitioner assistant higher apprenticeship <p> Chartered manager degree apprenticeship <p> Digital and technical solutions degree apprenticeship . <p> Recruitment analytics provided by HR technology will also enable your business to anticipate skills gaps within your workforce . 40982 @qwx450982 40998 @qwx450998 40992 @qwx450992

@@44110511 @4110511/ <h> 6 Ways For Recruiters To Manage Client Expectations <p> For rookie recruiters , winning your first client is a justifiable cause for celebration but before you head to your database to start your candidate search , hold on for a moment . What are your client 's expectations and how do you intend to manage them ? Here 's our advice : - <p> Agree terms : Permanent placements rose again in September according to REC , while hourly pay rates for temp and contract staff rose at their fastest rate for three months . Recruiters are fighting for the best available talent . Negotiate your payment terms and agree your fee before sourcing candidates . If your fee is based on a percentage of the first year salary , clarify the anticipated final amount with your client to avoid ' surprise ' at the time of invoice . 20% of a -30,000 basic salary equates to a -6,000 fee . Some recruiters are reluctant to discuss terms but the situation will become much more difficult further down the line if you do n't . <p> Explain your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide a search firm standard shortlist . Others are happy with names and a summary of the candidate 's career history or LinkedIn profile . Retained recruiters will qualify every candidate and assess their level of interest in the job as part of their search . Much will depend on the type of recruitment your agency specialises in but make it clear from the beginning exactly what you mean by candidate sourcing ' . <p> Schedule interviews : If this is a contingency search which requires you to respond quickly , set dates for both first and second interviews in the hiring manager 's diary when agreeing terms . Skilled jobseekers are in short supply ; you need to be able to hold their interest when you find them . <p> Who will make the offer ? As the recruiter responsible for this placement , our recommendation is that you handle the offer negotiation with the preferred candidate . Allowing clients to negotiate directly with candidates is hazardous . Explain that as a third party you can deal with any issues which may arise in the process , manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer being accepted . In a competitive jobs market , you must also cover the counter offer in your discussions with your candidate . <p> Recruiting timetable : Set out and agree a timetable with your client to include the following : - <p> Shortlist target date . <p> Interview schedule . <p> How often you will provide updates , ie , daily or weekly <p> How you will communicate updates , ie , voicemail or e-mail . <p> Target start date for the new hire . <p> Some employers will be satisfied with you contacting them when your shortlist is finalised . Others may wish to interview potential employees as you identify and source them depending on the urgency of the hire . Hiring managers working with a recruiter for the first time may need more frequent updates for reassurance . <p> Under promise and over deliver : Do n't promise your client a shortlist of five qualified candidates by the end of the week when you know it 's an impossibility . Be cautious . Build contingencies into your schedule , anticipate problems and advise the hiring manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ensure your placement progresses smoothly . <p> Advorto Marketplace - the UK 's largest online place for recruitment services - is now ready to give your agency an important new channel to market .

The report supports this , suggesting that middle skilled jobs will be at more risk than lower skilled due to the high cost of designing AI to replace those roles . It is also estimated by the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) that 5 million jobs could be lost by 2020 . More pessimistic predictions claim that AI will replace 50% of all jobs within 30 years . <p> HR leaders who embrace technology within their hiring processes will be best positioned to respond to the changes AI continues to bring to the shape of the workforce . <p> The demise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around three quarters of businesses expect an increasingly multi-generational workforce to create a divide between Generation X and younger workers . This claim is at odds with research from McDonald 's who found that its employees are happier in a multi-generational environment . <p> As an estimated one in three UK employees does n't trust their employer , perhaps the underlying cultural problem lies elsewhere . For those businesses , the cohesion of their future workforce requires a more detailed strategy to rebuild trust .

Start with these five simple steps : - <p> Choose the right recruitment system <p> Earlier this year , Oxford Economics estimated the cost of replacing a departing employee at -30,614 . That 's without factoring in the disruption to your existing team and plummeting morale when a hire fails more than once . Throw in the fact that new employees in SMEs ( up to 250 workers ) do n't reach optimum productivity for 24 weeks ( 28 weeks for large firms ) and the importance of getting your employee retention strategy right first time escalates. - Investing in an effective talent recruitment system enables your human resources team to streamline your hiring process more efficiently thus allowing them to focus on what really matters " hiring the best quality talent available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels will enjoy a much needed boost . - - <p> Focus on your talent pool <p> Talent communities provide the most successful companies with a constant source of qualified candidates . Taking advantage of online recruitment and social media platforms to create your own talent pool will provide you with candidates who are both aware of your brand and attracted to your company culture. - An effective recruitment software system makes it easy for those candidates to actively register their interest in your company. - <p> Promote from within <p> Your talent acquisition strategy should n't be focusing on external candidates to the exclusion of your existing employees - some of the most qualified candidates may already be working for your company . - With the lack of career development opportunities featuring high on the list of reasons employees leave their jobs , promoting from within your existing team will go some way to improving loyalty . Again , your recruitment system will help to identify overlooked talent . <p> Be thorough in your hiring process <p> A systematic approach to hiring will enable you to create a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarity in your job description to identify the type of employee you want to hire . Utilise your recruiting software and integrated applicant tracking system to share your vacancy across all of your online recruitment networks as well as efficiently screen subsequent applications , providing you with only the CVs of qualified candidates . <p> Stay in- touch with your talent pipeline <p> Separate yourself from your competition . The most frequently heard complaint from disenchanted candidates relates to the lack of communication from employers once applications are submitted . Consistent , timely contact during the hiring process means qualified talent remains within your pipeline . An effective recruitment system enables you to communicate via either customised or automated messages to maintain interest . It all adds up to better employee retention in the long-term . <p> Contrary to popular misconception , employee retention does n't start with the on-boarding process but from the very first time potential talent encounters your brand . Meticulous attention to detail throughout your recruitment process will both improve your quality of hire and enhance your employee retention levels .

@@44110530 @4110530/ <h> 5 Strategies To Interrupt Unconscious Bias In Your Hiring Process <p> New evidence has recently emerged of the extent of bias in hiring . A report in the Harvard Business Review found that a single female candidate in a talent pool has no chance of securing a job offer , but her chances rise if she competes against other women . Bias in recruitment comes as no surprise to a jobs market that is grappling with issues over the pay gap . The question is , how can HR overcome or ' interrupt ' that bias to improve diversity in hiring and attract the best available talent ? <p> Types of bias <p> Two common types prevail in hiring . These are : - <p> Confirmation bias : This is a firm pre-existing belief in our minds which we look for evidence to support . In talent acquisition , it may take the form of a hiring manager preferring candidates who have been educated at a particular college or University , for example . Applicants matching these subconscious preferences are favoured before a meeting takes place . Confirmation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hiring on intuition : When interviewers strike up a rapport with candidates , their natural inclination is to hire that person . Gaps in skills , inaccuracies on the applicant 's CV or a potential cultural fit are overlooked because this person feels right ' . Decisions based on our intuition , are emotive and subjective , again influenced heavily by the intellect and background of the interviewer . <p> The aim of successful talent acquisition is always to hire the best candidate available for a vacancy , regardless of gender , race , disability or age . The strategies below will assist HR in achieving that goal : - <p> The introduction of name blind CVs ( anonymised screening ) <p> Name blind CVs have gained in popularity since being incorporated into hiring processes by major employers , including the NHS , Deloitte , KPMG , HSBC and Virgin Money , but progress in areas is slow . New research suggests that almost half a million female and ethnic minority candidates are overlooked for jobs in tech and finance based on their names alone . Changing names is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications for additional evidence of a privileged background , according to lecturer in Human Resources Management , Dr Louise Ashley . Part of this arises from a cultural issue within legal , accountancy and finance sectors and the privileged status afforded to candidates from elite schools . Technology removes bias in screening but cultural issues stem from leadership and must be addressed at that level . <p> Level out candidate assessment <p> In the early stages of screening , the use of video interviews can offset discrimination by asking identical questions of each candidate . Conducting panel interviews and bringing in stakeholders may also level out the applicant ' playing field ' but a residual element of cultural bias will again remain . Algorithms have been proven to make more effective hiring decisions than people so HR analytics must play a role in final candidate selection . HR may still of course choose to ignore data driven recommendations . <p> Provide reasons for candidate rejection <p> Providing feedback both internally and to candidates to clarify the reason for their unsuccessful job application requires accountability and ensures that decisions are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns for rejection revealed through HR analytics sheds light on where your recruitment philosophy falls short of its aspirations . As an added bonus it also ensures compliance in hiring . Part of this must include reference checks to verify a candidate 's claims , as well as candidate surveys and feedback at the end of the hiring process for unsuccessful applicants . <p> Adopt a bias interruption ' philosophy <p> Research carried out several years ago by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that by introducing a ' salary negotiable ' headline into job adverts , the pay gap was narrowed between men and women . Interrupting ' hiring patterns that give rise to bias requires analysis and continual review . Recruitment analytics will instantly provide insight into the diversity in your organisation and where bias may exist . The leadership of an organisation also points towards overarching issues . For example , female CEOs of private UK companies halved from 2015 to 2016 . The aforement report from the Harvard Business Review demonstrates that this is more than a national issue . <p> Introduce unbiasing ' with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve diversity in the workplace , through unbiasing ' , what it describes as the process of acknowledging and minimising the impact that unconscious bias has on our attitudes and decisions ' . Measurement is the key to assessing and tracking efforts to achieve this . <p> While it 's impossible to rewire innate thought patterns overnight , data driven recruitment is the only way to overcome subjectivity and unconscious bias in hiring . Putting checks in place throughout the hiring process , carrying out regular reviews and acting on the conclusions drawn from evidence based HR will help to enhance talent acquisition strategies and introduce a more diverse global workforce where people are hired on merit . 40982 @qwx450982 40998 @qwx450998 40992 @qwx450992

The challenge for most hiring functions is their readiness ' for analytics . Deloitte notes that only 8% have usable data . <p> Recruitment is the number one area of focus for analytics and as the UK faces the prospect of a skills crisis , HR must begin to integrate people analytics into its talent management processes . Recruitment software is the first step to achieving that . Here 's how : - <p> Data driven business decisions : Technology saves time and enhances the decision making process across your business , not just within HR .

Rapidly evolving technology , a focus on specific skills , a mix of part-time , full-time , temporary and gig economy workers and rehiring former employees means that managing the talent pipeline has become more complex and more urgent . <p> The urgency is highlighted in the latest figures from the Recruitment and Employment Federation ( REC ) for September which show that candidate availability fell for the 41st successive month . Engineering and healthcare are the sectors most affected by the skills shortage . <p> Consistently sourcing qualified candidates is n't a one-off recruitment marketing push but must form an ongoing part of your talent acquisition strategy . HR metrics are key to that . The seven below will help you to build an effective and consistent talent pipeline : - <p> Source of hire : Job boards are an applicant source but not necessarily the source of your successful candidates . Data analysis will enable a comparison between the two . Drill down into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many of these are qualified , where your shortlisted candidates entered your pipeline and how your new hire found out about your vacancy . <p> Candidate drop-out ' : It 's vital to understand where ( and why ) qualified candidates abandon your application process .

Over half of UK businesses have been affected by negative online reviews in the past year and a poor reputation can cost your business an estimated 10% extra per hire . <p> Open jobs v filled positions : For larger organisations dealing with multiple vacancies this is a vital metric to monitor the effectiveness of job posts and make changes where necessary . Measure this metric on a monthly or quarterly basis and evaluate together with the time to hire ' metric below . <p> Time to hire : In 2014 , the average time to hire was 28.9 days in the UK .

A simple way to assess quality of hire is to evaluate your staff retention levels in your recruitment data . If one particular role repeatedly requires resourcing , it could be an indication of a bigger problem in your hiring process . <p> Candidate rejection ( offer to acceptance ratio ) : Candidate turndowns are important metrics particularly as the number of job hoarders are likely to rise as the skills shortage intensifies .

Your cost of hire will include the cost of job posts where relevant , maintaining social media accounts and time spent interviewing candidates , together with agency fees and administrative costs .

Additional hidden ' costs include disruption to staff morale and training of your new hire . <p> A note on data <p> If your business is new to HR software , building a talent pipeline means tapping into multiple candidate streams , such as job boards and social media , until sufficient information is available to begin to evaluate your hiring success .

Defining your ideal candidate , including their background , essential qualifications ( must-have ' as opposed to ideal ' ) and even down to the type of companies they have worked for will improve your initial screening results . Consider a candidate persona for difficult roles , which requires a detailed analysis of your ideal hire , even down to analysing profiles on social media and LinkedIn , their stage of life , upbringing , background and their work/life balance needs .

While companies are struggling to fill jobs , the volume of unsuitable applicants is slowing down the process . Over 60% of UK workers apply for jobs they are n't qualified for . At the same time , the number of job applications are on the rise so candidates in this part of the funnel need to be processed quickly through your applicant tracking software . <p> The second ( middle ) section of the funnel sifts the close-match candidates , according to your company and job specific requirements .

Expanding your talent pool beyond your traditional sources is essential .

The current drop in EU talent is also forcing recruiters and employers to make contact with Universities to source suitable candidates . <p> A healthy recruitment funnel draws potential employees from a variety of sources , including social media , employee referrals , job adverts and increasingly , from the open talent in the gig economy .

@@44110549 @4110549/ <h> Essential Recruitment Questions For Your Client Vacancy - Part 1 <p> To source quality candidates for your client vacancies , recruiters must ask a number of essential questions . In the first of a two part series , we present ten of the most important : - <p> How long has this vacancy been open ? Ideally you want to be top of your client 's list following a resignation or creation of a new position . Vacancies that remain open for several months should raise a big red flag . Either recruiting has n't been a priority for this company or your client has failed to fill this role . Ask probing questions to discover the reasons . Barriers to hiring include low salary , unrealistic expectations of the candidate , lengthy time to process applications . <p> Why did the last postholder leave ? An internal promotion is ideal , company expansion is fantastic and leaving for a better offer elsewhere is inevitable . If the employee left because of the pressure of the job you need to evaluate whether or not their reasons were justifiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far ? If your client has received over 50 applications for this job and disregarded them all , the issue lies in their ineffective job posts , or an over-selective ' employer . <p> How many job offers have been made ? Likewise if the client has made a number of job offers that have been rejected , the problem may lie in employer expectations , salary or company culture . <p> What are the consequences for your organisation of not filling this vacancy ? A we can make do ' is not the answer you want . It indicates the client does n't consider the job important and it 's likely they 'll pay little or no attention to your shortlist . It 's affecting staff morale and company performance ' guarantees a quick response to your candidates . <p> Why do your employees stay with your company ? Responses which incorporate company values , vision , career development opportunities and a positive culture ( with evidence of how they recognise their staff ) are encouraging signs . Follow up by asking about staff turnover levels which will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the reality of their working environment . NB : This response is not about how well they pay their people . <p> When can I schedule interviews ? A lengthy recruitment process will lose your client credibility " and risks jeopardising your relationship with your candidates .

As most employers know , however , life is n't like that . Recognising the realities of the lives of today 's professionals impacts your ability to tap into elusive talent in areas where skills are in short supply . Here are five real life ' lessons affecting your talent acquisition success which HR ca n't ignore : - <p> Flexible working is inevitable : Progress towards flexible working is slow . The TUC recently reported that 1.5 million people work flexibly " an increase of around one fifth over the last decade . Less than 9% of advertised quality jobs ' ( with pro-rata salaries of -20,000 or above ) offer flexible working according to job site Timewise 's annual Flexible Job Index . Employers who do not promote this key option are overlooking a vast , untapped talent pool that can address the skills shortage within their business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are promoted in your job adverts and career progression is viable for all of your employees . <p> Carers are on the rise : As people live longer , an estimated nine million employees will also be part-time carers in the UK by 2037 , according to the CIPD . At the same time , as the number of young people entering the workforce falls , HR must support working carers in order to attract and retain qualified candidates , while boosting workplace productivity and engagement . Your recruitment software will identify the most successful sources of your qualified hires . The introduction of flexible working is again essential , combined with practical support in the working environment . <p> The pressures of parenthood : Some city based firms have introduced parenting consultants ' for employees who have children later in life to help them to deal with the joint demands of corporate life and parenthood . The Office Of National Statistics ( ONS ) revealed that the employment rate for women has now reached 69.2% - the highest since records began - making this an issue that is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discrimination against working mothers on the rise , flexible or remote working should again be considered an option to hire and retain talent . Meanwhile , HR should also implement effective wellbeing policies which acknowledge and accommodate the real issues many employees face in their daily lives . <p> Promote your benefits : Glassdoor found that around a third of employees are influenced by benefits on offer when applying for a job . For SMEs who ca n't compete with lavish perks offered by global brands , take inspiration from examples such Bacon Thursday and Hot Food Friday ' , days off for employee birthdays or an extra day 's holiday for Christmas shopping . Automate your job posts across social media to emphasise the benefits on offer within your organisation and highlight just why your business is a great place to work . <p> People over 50 are an asset : One in four people in the workforce is now over 50 according to a new report from the CIPD .

Two thirds of UK CEOs expect to increase their headcount , according to PwC 's 19th Annual CEO Global Survey1 , above the global average and higher than any other European country . <p> The need for an engaged talent community to succeed in a competitive employment market is one of seven key talent acquisition trends we identified in our previous article . Here 's our checklist for success : - <p> Create your talent pool : Many companies do n't actively begin their hiring process until they have a specific need , leaving a gap in their organisation that impacts morale and productivity . You already have a number of sources available to you to create your talent pool . These include previous close match ' applicants to your job posts and those with key soft skills and the potential to fill future vacancies you anticipate within your business . Evaluate your unsuccessful applicants and request permission to send e-mail updates before adding them to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To deliver a future supply of high achievers , a talent pool must be focused on people who possess the critical skills missing from your business . A candidate persona will provide detailed insight to enable specific targeting and generate higher quality candidate leads . <p> Avoid job spamming : If you consider engagement with your talent pool as promoting a succession of job posts people will lose interest . Share stories and content that present a positive employer brand and demonstrate why your company is a great place to work . The next point epitomises what we mean . <p> Adopt the ' Game of Thrones ' strategy : UK tech company +rehabstudio this week announced a half day annual holiday for all of its employees to allow them to watch the new Game of Thrones Season 6 premiere . The story went viral and job applications have reportedly since soared . <p> Do n't obsess over qualifications : Ask yourself whether those must have ' qualifications are essential before eliminating potential candidates from your talent pool . Soft skills improve the chances of a cultural fit and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for skill ' philosophy . Tech talent considers itself self taught in many areas , which wo n't necessarily equate to formal qualifications . <p> Do n't dismiss active job seekers : Active job seekers often get a bad press in terms of candidate quality but the line between passive and active candidates is no longer so distinct . 64% of employees will explore a job opportunity according to a recent survey by Jobsite . Active job seekers are also more likely to accept the invitation to join your talent pool than passive candidates . <p> Select an appropriate platform : Choose HR technology with an integrated CRM ( customer relationship management ) tool to monitor and evaluate the success of your talent pool . Building and nurturing a talent pool takes patience , regular engagement and consistency in your message . Modern HR technology will enable you to automate updates but responses to individual enquiries through social media or e-mail must be prompt and personalised . <p> Consider peepl : For businesses without dedicated HR resources or with only occasional hiring needs , a talent pool is n't always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free service to help you find the candidates your business needs . The next time you have a vacancy you can not fill , or that you need to fill quickly , submit your job title to us .

Job markets across the country ( with the exception of Scotland and East Anglia ) are up and competition is strong . As well as creating a consistent source of external talent , employers will need to focus on existing employees to address the skills gap . HR analytics will identify the people within your current workforce who may meet the requirements of your next vacancy . <p> Prepare for flexible or remote working <p> Your company 's location affects your ability to attract qualified candidates . In certain regions , explosive growth means there are n't enough skilled people to fill open jobs . Reed recorded the strongest jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create 100,000 jobs in the city by 2030 , with an additional 250,000 across the region . Technical and digital skills are those likely to be in high demand . Employers may need to consider more flexible or remote working options to recruit the right people in 2017 , as a further report in the Guardian this week expressed caution over a graduate brain drain ' from the north to London . <p> Include boomerang employees in the mix <p> Over one third of HR directors have rehired former employees in the past year . Recruiting boomerang employees provides an additional source for your talent pool which may offer a better cultural fit but caution is required . A quarter of HR directors who rehired former members of staff would not do so again . Treat ex-employees in the same way as other candidates in your screening process and hire them for the right reasons , not because it seems the easiest option . <p> Adopt a formal strategy for your gig economy workers <p> EY 's new report , Gig Workers By Design suggests that 40% of larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of contingent employees in their business within the next five years . A quarter of these believe that around a third of their workforce will be contingent employees by 2020 . The biggest reason given by over half ( 56% ) of employers for hiring freelance workers is to fill the demand for expertise beyond the capability of the existing workforce ' . This is not referring to the grey area ' of self-employment highlighted by the recent Uber ruling but the open talent economy described by Deloitte . The key to success within this growing sector is treating your freelance workforce as you would treat your permanent employees and implementing an effective performance management strategy . This requires HR to provide context , encourage communication and two-way feedback , incorporate performance feedback and coaching and recognise excellence. 1 <p> A diverse workforce is essential to succeed <p> UK employees need to expand their talent pools to keep up with demand in 2017 , particularly in areas such as tech and engineering which needs an extra 182,000 people every year between now and 2022 .

One third of new employees plan to leave their new job within the first year . Automate basic hiring checks to allow HR time to welcome your new employees and begin onboarding when your job offer is accepted . <p> Include your older workers in talent management strategies <p> The over 50s are playing an increasingly bigger role in the workforce . The Department for Work and Pensions ( DWP ) ' s report Employment statistics for workers aged 50 and over found that the number of people aged 50-64 has increased by 14.2% in the past 30 years .

Hiring teams spend an estimated 60% of their time on admin and maintenance tasks2 leaving the hiring process and employee engagement lingering at the bottom of their priority list .

Investment in HR technology that automates essential , mundane tasks and enables HR to assess and improve key recruitment metrics is the first step towards improving your hiring success . 40982 @qwx450982 40998 @qwx450998 40992 @qwx450992
