This Cauliflower Fried Rice is about to become your new staple during Passover <p> Everyone who keeps kosher knows that it can be a little bit challenging at times . Especially when it comes to eating out , and especially if you live in an area where the options are scarce or non existent for that matter . <p> But when it comes to Passover ahhh almost everyone struggles . Everyone I know , at some point , ends up standing in front of the fridge wondering what the heck to eat . Because the thought- of eating eggs and potatoes one more time will make you wan na go on a hunger strike . <p> For us , it was never a huge deal growing up . Being raised in a Sephardic home , our options were pretty varied . Having a mom who is an unbelievable cook , was most definitely a plus . Rice was a staple during the Holiday , and even though we did n't  have many " kosher for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wine and ONE type of cookie ) , we were perfectly happy with everything our mom made ( especially her Passover Walnut Cake ) . <p> Once I married into an Ashkenaz family , things changed . Completely . All of the sudden I had to worry about a whoooole lot of stuff that I could no longer have in the house during Passover . Rice included . Ugh . <p> So every year , I have no choice but to put my creativity hat on , and come up with out-of-the-box dishes that my family will enjoy . Because , in case I have n't mentioned it before , when it comes to food , my family is n't happy with just " whatever " . <p> Cauliflower Fried Rice to the rescue ! <p> We wanted to give it a little bit of an Asian twist , which , again , was a challenge , since we could n't use sesame oil , peanuts or soy sauce . But hey , we did it ! <p> The flavor and texture is there . And you can use your favorite vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better ! ! ) . <p> - <p> So here 's what this cauliflower rice ( literally ) - brings to the table : <p> Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the same skillet . Add cashews and saute for about 30 seconds , stirring constantly to keep them from burning . Add the cauliflower " rice " , 1 tablespoon of ginger , vegetable bouillon and + teaspoon of salt and toss well . Cook over medium heat for 3-5 minutes . Transfer to a large serving bowl and set aside <p> On the same skillet , cook the diced pineapple with the sugar , maple syrup or honey over medium heat for 5 minutes , until it starts to caramelize , stirring constantly <p> Add the cook pineapple , vegetables and chopped cilantro to the cauliflower , toss well and garnish with cashews . Serve warm <p> Notes <p> You will need the skillet to cook the cauliflower , so make sure you use one that is big enough <p> I 'm not at all clued up as to what you can and cant eat during Passover , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you were Sephardic or Ashkenaz . This bowl of deliciousness looks good enough to satisfy anyone however and you 've made it look so appealing.Choclette recently postedWild Garlic Pesto Two Ways Quick , Easy &amp; Delicious

A friend of mine told me about a 21 day " sugar detox " he did and I decided to give it a try , for no other reason than to prove myself I could do it . <p> The first time around , I did great . And it ended up being a lot easier than I thought it would be . Barely any cravings , felt great overall . <p> Second time , the complete opposite . My stomach was a mess , I had no energy and I got really moody and foggy Which is really not good for anyone , but especially for someone in my profession . And I 'm almost ashamed to admit I was not able to go all the way . <p> Third time around ? - Hmmm Im still trying to figure out how I 'm feeling . I 'm now 8 days into it . Energy has n't  been a problem , despite the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the first time I went though it . My stomach has good days and bad days . Not terrible , but not as good as I would like it to be . Cravings though ? Bad . Really bad . I 've caught myself a few times- fantasizing about buckets of ice cream covered in caramel and bathtubs filled with melted chocolate . I 'm not kidding . Its that bad . <p> But I 'm staying strong and although I do admit that I 've tasted a couple of " forbidden " foods here and there , overall I think I 'm doing pretty good . <p> Another thing Ive been missing , besides sweets , is crunch . Sounds weird , I know , but I really crave that crunchy texture you find in crackers and snacks in general.Plus , being allowed to eat cheese and nut butters is great , but without a " transportation device " , they 're really not that much fun . <p> Until my genius sister came up with these crackers and saved the day . <p> Now , we all know shes not the best baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no rising involved in these , the recipe worked out great . They 're nutty , salty , loaded with healthy fats and fiber and best of all , crunchy ! They do take a little while to bake , but they are super easy to make and you can prepare large batches at a time . <p> We made them " free form this time , but f you want even pieces , all you have to do is score the mix before baking and that 's it ! <p> Zaatar is a middle eastern blend of herbs and spices mainly thyme , sumac , sesame seeds etc . You can read more about it here . You can usually find zaatar in middle eastern markets , the kosher section on your supermarket or specialty gourmet stores . You can also buy it at Amazon.com If you can not find it near you , you can use an italian spice blend or oregano to add taste to the crackers . <p> I LOVE these ! ! A couple of weeks ago , I started a new type of diet/lifstyel called LCHF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd but it is a really interesting concept ) . Eitherway , sugar is out as well and the one thing I have been missing is the CRUNCH ! So I found a similar recipe to this and made it over the weekend what a life saver ! I would have never thought of making it with Zaatar but that is genious ! I am currently living in Mexico so it will be impossible for me to get this here- but my bro lives in Abu Dhabiso I am going to ask him to buy me a whole load and he can give it to me when we meet at home in Sweden ! Ha , it seems as though my family is just as mixed up as your ! = Love the blog by the way , you have a new follwer = <p> So glad you found us . WOW ! I thought out family was spread out all over the world ! Now we have some competition = We hear it a lot from people in low carb diets that they miss the crunch , these crackers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can probably use oregano and other herbs to flavor the crackers . <p> The only problem I have with these is that I do n't  know how to stop eating them ! ! ! I used honey instead of date syrup and my own concoction of herbs &amp; spices . They turned out absolutely fantastic . Its so hard to find good GF recipes without a million ingredients . Will be making these often and sending the recipe to friends = Thank you ! ! ! <p> I just made two batches of these , one as noted above and one with chia/flax , but added 1 tbs of honey , 2 tsp of cinnamon , and 1 tsp of vanilla . I want to dip these in some homemade almond butter as a replacement for Graham Crackers ! <p> I have made these several times as suggested but went with a sweeter version myself this time with cinnamon and maple syrup and some currants . I also decided to substitute some ground flax for some of the flax seeds so well see how they turn out . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like " Marys Crackers ) so reduced all the ingredients a hair as well . <p> Okay , I 'm in the middle of making these and I 'm confused . I flipped them as suggested , but what to do about the parchment ? My first idea was to take it off the ( now ) top , but it was n't working so well . Paper sticking in some spots and then seeds sticking to paper in others . SO I just left it on and continued baking . I 'd hate to waste all these yummy ingredients ( not to mention the time ) . Is there a trick or did I miss something ? <p> We are sorry , you are experiencing problems with he crackers . We never had the crackers stick to parchment paper however , we did have them stick to aluminum foil paper . That 's why we switch to parchment paper . When we make this recipe we are able to take the crackers in one whole block ( since bake them uncut ) from the parchment paper and flip them with no problem . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can think of is that maybe you spread the mixture too thin into the pan . <p> I had the same problem my first time making these .. if the parchment paper sticks when you flip it , spray lightly with water , let sit for a few minutes and the paper should peel right off . Because of this issue , I bought some of those silicone baking sheets and used them instead of the paper . They work perfect ! Good luck ! <p> Heather , I am so happy I read your comment before baking . I am in progress at the moment and to my surprise the paper got stuck ! ! Spraying with water helped 95%. 5% pealed off with the paper . I am so happy to rest the rest ! Thanks soooo much ! ! <p> Vicky &amp; Ruth , many thanks for sharing .

After 20 minutes , do I drain the water &amp; keep the seeds ? Re : " Add the rest of the ingredients and mix well . " So , am I using ANOTHER cup of water to make the crackers ? I have n't tried this recipe yet , but just reading the directions to make sure everything " adds up " . <p> Hi there , The flax and chia seeds are soaked in the ( one ) cup of water that is listed on the ingredient list .

No fuss meatless holiday entree ready . <p> We suggest you serve these warm and fresh out the oven , so the puff pastry stays flaky and slightly crisp . <p> Cut the tempeh into 4 equal pieces .

Add beer and cook until dry , 3-4 minutes . Set side until ready to use <p> Carefully remove the tempeh pieces from the water and pat dry them with a paper towel or a clean towel . Season each piece with salt and black pepper to taste ( seasoning here is optional ) <p> Heat one tablespoon of olive oil in the same skillet you used for the mushrooms . Sear the tempeh pieces over medium heat , about 2 minutes per side ( keep an eye on them to make sure they do n't burn ) . Let them cool until safe enough to handle <p> Preheat the oven to 400F .

And its not that we do n't  trust our own judgement , but seeing things through someone elses eyes ( or in this case , taste buds ) is most definitely helpful at times . You know , like when you 're about to go out wearing a brand new outfit and a new hairdo and you think you look absolutely amazing , but in reality you look like Mrs. Potato Head had an unfortunate encounter with a mop ? And you have to rely on your friends to tell you ? Yeah , its just like that . In a less extreme way maybe , but you know what I 'm talking about . <p> Being a taste tester ( or as I call it , a Guinea pig ) does n't  require much .

In any case , I got the thumbs up so , here they are . <p> Now , let me tell you why I think these granola bars are awesome . Very simple : tahini and turmeric . Health benefits aside , a match made in heaven from a flavor standpoint , if there ever was one . Yes , the combination makes these bars somewhat unusual , but that 's in part what makes them so good ( in my opinion anyway ! ) .

I know that the colder it gets , the more I crave something warm and flavorful ! <p> There 's something special that only a steaming bowl of soup can offer when snow is falling outside . As much as I love tomato-based and vegetable soups , I 'm not always in the mood for them . They 're of course great , but after we have had weeks of winter , I usually have exhausted my collection of favorite cold weather comfort food recipes , and there are only so many ways to approach vegetable or tomato soups in their traditional forms . <p> As I was thinking about new soup ideas , my cousin Adriana came to mind . Growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had , and they became more like siblings to us than anything else . Adriana is our youngest cousin and even has a child had the most spunky , witty personality . Being around her always meant a guaranteed laugh and there was never a dull moment with her . Luckily for us , she now lives in New York City , and we always look forward to her visits . <p> As a child , Adrianna LOVED French onion soup , and always ordered it when we were out if it was available . She also despises the cold weather , so you can see where our inspiration came from ! <p> Now as you probably know , French Onion soup is traditionally made with a beef broth- or beef stock base . With that as a key ingredient , most recipes put this soup out of the running- for us . However , we were determined to create a vegetarian alternative that would be just as- savory and delightful as the original inspiration . <p> What people often look for in French Onion Soup is richness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the inclusion of cheese allows us to stay close to the roots of this dish . We chose Sincerely Brigittes Tarragon Ginger cheese to make it super rich , creamy and , just like our dear cousin , a little spicy . Combining all of the ingredients should provide you with a deep , full flavor that is perfect for- keeping you and your family warm on the freezing days which are still on their way ! <p> Heat olive oil in a large soup pot . Add onions and salt and cook over medium heat for 30 minutes . Add 1 teaspoon of sugar and continue cooking for about 50 minutes , stirring frequently . Add flour , mix well and cook for another 5 minutes <p> Add mushroom broth , Worcestershire sauce , wine and pepper and simmer for 20 minutes . Taste your soup and adjust salt and pepper and sugar if necessary ( remember the the cheese will add saltiness to it ) <p> While the soup is cooking place cheese in the freezer for 20 minutes ( so it 's easier to shred ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slice baguette in + inch rounds and toast until crunchy . <p> Preheat oven to 350F <p> Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil . Place 4-6 oven proof bowls on the baking sheet and ladle soup into the bowls . Add 3 tbsp shredded cheese to each bowl , mix well <p> Gently place one or two pieces of bread on top of soup and cover bread with + cup of cheese per bowl <p> That looks gorgeous . I love soup . Squash is possibly my favourite , but I 'd be more than happy to tuck into a big bowl of this . I think I only ever tried French onion soup once . I 'm guessing it was n't great as I 've never made it again . <p> You grew up in Barcelona ? I loooove Barcelona . I was able to visit when I was studying in Spain years ago . What a cool city ! And this soup looks so perfect for cold weather ! I could dive into a bowl of it right now ! Meghan Fox and Briar recently postedChocolate Fondue <p> OMG this soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say TarragonGinger Cheese ! How amazing is that . Tarragon is very French and ginger is very Asian , so the combination of the two is very bold ! I will have to pick some up to make this pronto ! Shawn recently postedFrozen Banana Ice Cream With Macadamia Nut Butter <p> Hi Kate , you can use vegan Worcestershire sauce , soy sauce and even some porcini mushroom powder ( just grind dried porcini mushrooms into a powder ) . you need that umami flavor for this soup since French Onion soup is usually made with beef broth .

@@29051529 @2751529/ 120190 @qwx320190 <h> Warm Pumpkin Spice Cocktail <p> You would be amazed to know how many people are utterly surprised to find out we did n't  grow up celebrating Thanksgiving . That we did n't  really know much about the Holiday until we moved to the US . Which , if you think about it , makes sense , since Thanksgiving is an American Holiday and its not celebrated in Spain ! <p> I have to say though , it really is one of my favorites . Mainly because I 'll take any excuse to gather friends and family and spend some quality time together . And no other Holiday does that like Thanksgiving . I love the fact that people travel from all over the country to be with their families on this day . I love the days of planning and preparation that go into it . And of course , I love that its a whole day affair with lots and lots of food . <p> We might not have any family traditions we grew up with , but we have certainly created our own over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sister and I have , to come up with new pumpkin recipes every year . Personally , this " obsession " I have for pumpkin started on my very first Thanksgiving , when I had Naomis pumpkin pie for the first time . I thought it was the strangest thing when I first saw it , but once I took a bite , I was hooked . And I 've loved everything pumpkin ever since . <p> The wheels usually start turning as soon as pumpkin season starts . And the main challenge is coming up with recipes that are fun and different , but also vegan . Since in our family we have meat eaters , picky eaters , vegetarians and vegans AND we keep kosher ( which means we can not serve meat and dairy products together ) , we have to come up with dishes that everyone can enjoy . Not always an easy task , but definitely one that gets our creative juices flowing ! <p> We came up with this recipe last year , but we never got a chance to share it . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get my co-workers approval though ; ) ) <p> The idea behind it was to recreate the traditional flavors of pumpkin pie , without the " heaviness " of a slice of pie and the amount of time it takes to prepare it ! The secret here ? Using a - good , ready to serve , vegan pumpkin spice drink as a base , like So Delicious Pumpkin Spice Coconut Milk and adjusting the spice and alcohol to your own taste . Top it with a ( big ) dollop of vegan whipped topping ( we love the brand new CocoWhip ! ) and done ! <p> If you are hosting Thanksgiving this year and you 're expecting guests with any dietary restrictions , do n't  panic ! A little bit of research and paying attention to products labels is basically all you need . Luckily , there are plenty of amazing products in the market that will make your like a lot easier !

Make it your own by topping it with your favorite fruit ! <p> I remember the first time I tried cheesecake . I was about 12 years old . Our aunt and uncle had just bought a house in Miami , and they invited us to spend New Years with them . I was so excited . As a kid I had always dreamed of traveling to the United States . Everything was so different , and " cool " . Even something like Tropicana orange juice was like , the greatest thing ever . <p> The day we arrived , my uncle took out a huge white box out of the refrigerator . Inside was this mile high cake , topped with glistening , bright red strawberries . I had never seen anything like it . Not that we did n't  have beautiful cakes in Spain , but that size ? Nah . <p> It was n't long until I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steal a little piece , along with a couple of pieces of super cool American candy . I was in sugar heaven . <p> Fast forward about 10 years . I was then a recently married , much slimmer , more disciplined 22-year-old nutritionist who had just moved to the US . One of my coworkers , who was also an unbelievable baker , shared with me her secret cheesecake recipe . The list of ingredients almost made me faint . The amount of sugar , saturated fat and cholesterol on that cake was probably enough give a coronary to an elephant . I did , however , make it for friends many , many times as per their request ( with the proper warning , of course ) , and managed to never even try a piece . And no , absolute self-control is not one of my super powers all I had to do was remember that ingredient list ! <p> Fast forward 15 years I 'm still that same person ( just a liiiitle bit older ) but now , I 'm a mad scientist wannabe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My latest project ? Vegan cheesecake . Vegan Lemon Strawberry Frozen Cheesecake , to be more specific . The goal ? To lighten it up by cutting down calories , saturated fat and cholesterol , but still keeping it rich , creamy and decadent . And as a bonus , keeping it gluten-free just by using store-bought vegan gluten-free cookies . Now , were not saying this is a low-calorie recipe It is still a rich dessert BUT , its definitely an improvement for the original recipe . <p> here 's how we did it : <p> For starters , we used 1 tablespoon of coconut oil to make the crust , as opposed to 1 ENTIRE STICK OF BUTTER . Right there , huge improvement <p> As a base , instead of the traditional full fat , dairy cream cheese , we used GO VEGGIE Vegan cream cheese , which is lower in calories , has 25% less saturated fat and is dairy and cholesterol free <p> For creaminess and to help hold the filling together , we used coconut cream instead of eggs , and vegan whipped topping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a little lemon zest to add the zing and tang that both cream cheese and sour cream have ( hows that for a healthy swap ? ! ) <p> One more thing , freezing the cake is a must in this case , in order to get the right texture . It thaws in no time , so you can enjoy it and refreeze any leftovers . here 's a tip : if you know you are going to have leftovers , serve the strawberry topping on the side instead of on top the cake ( frozen fruit topping is not very appetizing ! ) . <p> To prepare the crust , place cookies in the food processor and pulse until they turn into fine crumbs . Add melted coconut oil and pulse a few more times . Press the cookie crumbs into a 7 inch spring for pan . Refrigerate until ready to use <p> Combine vegan cream cheese , coconut cream , confectioner 's sugar and vanilla extract in the food processor . Pulse until smooth and creamy .

Pour over the strawberries and stir well . Cook for about 1 minute , stirring constantly and being careful not to mash the strawberries . Transfer to a wide bowl and let cool at room temperature for 45 minutes to an hour <p> While the topping cools , take the cheesecake out of the freezer so it starts to thaw . Cut into slices and spoon strawberry topping over each slice before serving

My husband , who HAS TO keep up with my son , is pretty much doing the same ( he s not as good at the no cheating part , but he s really trying ! ) . - BUT , they still all want to have some kind of dessert , especially for the Holiday . <p> You know what that means ? Let me tell you . I have to come up with recipes that are kosher for Passover AND are not sweetened with any refined sugar ( i.e mainly fruit , dates and occasionally maple syrup ) . And by " I " I mean my sister of course ( I 'm the photographer , not the mad scientist , that 's her job ) . <p> So here 's her first creation : a golden milk cashew " cheesecake " , that we are serving in small individual portions , because , really , after sitting at the Seder table for hours and finishing dinner close to midnight , no one needs anything huge , or heavy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of maple syrup and dates .

Its the frosting I 'm not very fond of . Its always overly sweet and incredibly heavy , just like putting a big chunk of sweet butter in your mouth . And I 'm pretty sure its more of a cultural thing ( absolutely no one in our family likes it ) , because growing up in Spain , the only " frosting " we ate was made with fresh whipped cream that was just a tad- sweet . <p> Most frosting recipes call for an ( in my opinion ) insane amount of sugar .

And just a pinch of beet powder , just for color ( this is totally optional ) . <p> I 'm definitely not a piping expert , but I found this cool color swirl piping bag that I used to combine both frosting flavors . If you do n't  have one , you can use one flavor for each cupcake , or pipe one on top of the other .

Lightly flatten them using the palm of your hand <p> Bake for 10 minutes and let them cool completely before serving <p> 3.4.3177 <p> One of the challenges I look forward to the most every summer , is baking a birthday cake for my nephew , Zeke . We started this tradition years ago , when he was just a little boy . Every year , I try to outdo myself when it comes to " outrageousness " . And every year it gets more challenging , because this now almost 16 year old teenager has become increasingly harder to please . And I mean that in the best way possible . <p> Putting cooking competition shows aside , I 've never met a kid with a more refined palate than my nephew . A lot of kids are picky eaters , we all know that . But this is different . Zeke likes good quality food , and does n't  settle for just anything average . For instance , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Same with sushi and many other foods , even desserts ! And he has the ability to identify ingredients , even when there 's only a hint of them , and ESPECIALLY if its something he s not too fond of . <p> And that 's why he has become one of the main taste testers for our recipes . <p> As much a he loves good food , Zeke definitely has a sweet tooth . With that said , any dessert that is on the " healthier " side ( and by that I just mean made with less sugar , or whole wheat flour , etc ) not really his favorite . And that 's exactly why I knew what his reaction would be when I brought over these cookies for him to try . <p> Zeke : " What are these ? " <p> Me : " Theyre chocolate chocolate chip cookies . Try them , you have to tell me if they 're good enough to post on the blog " <p> Zeke : Picks one up , looks at it for a few seconds . " What 's wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  they ? " <p> And best of all , I got away with not telling him they 're made with whole wheat flour and avocado oil mayo instead of plain eggs . Because let 's be honest , what are the chances of him even taking a bite if he knew ? ? So technically I did n't  lie to him just did n't  disclose all the information . <p> I know that using mayo in a cookie recipe is a little out of the ordinary . But when our friends at Mambo Sprouts sent us some Chosen Foods awesome products to try , we wanted to come up with something creative and out of the box . <p> The avocado oil mayo takes the place of some the fat and the eggs that are present in a traditional cookie recipe . Its made with pure , non- GMO avocado oil as the first ingredient ( which is high in hearth healthy Omega 9 fatty acids ) and in this case , it gives the cookies a rich , buttery texture . <p> Not just kid approved , Zeke approved ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Product was supplied by Chosen Foods and compensation provided by Mambo Sprouts , all opinions are our own <p> These hearty blueberry corn muffins are great for breakfast or as a mid afternoon snack . Loaded with fresh blueberries and just a touch of ginger . <p> Its blueberry season again , yay ! ! And living in New Jersey , were to get some of the tastiest ones in the country . But even better than that , we get to go pick them ourselves ! <p> Our sister and her family is visiting from Israel and spending the entire summer with us . So this year we took our little niece and nephew blueberry picking at a farm near by . And as expected , they absolutely loved it . <p> I still remember the first time I went blueberry picking . Vicky was away on a business trip and I stayed to take care of Raquel , my niece , who must have been 3 or 4 at the time . We went on a school trip and we had the most fun time !

Make it your own by topping it with your favorite fruit ! <p> I remember the first time I tried cheesecake . I was about 12 years old . Our aunt and uncle had just bought a house in Miami , and they invited us to spend New Years with them . I was so excited . As a kid I had always dreamed of traveling to the United States . Everything was so different , and " cool " . Even something like Tropicana orange juice was like , the greatest thing ever . <p> The day we arrived , my uncle took out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was this mile high cake , topped with glistening , bright red strawberries . I had never seen anything like it . Not that we did n't  have beautiful cakes in Spain , but that size ? Nah . <p> It was n't long until I started sneaking into the house while everyone was in the pool to steal a little piece , along with a couple of pieces of super cool American candy . I was in sugar heaven . <p> Fast forward about 10 years . I was then a recently married , much slimmer , more disciplined 22-year-old nutritionist who had just moved to the US . One of my coworkers , who was also an unbelievable baker , shared with me her secret cheesecake recipe . The list of ingredients almost made me faint . The amount of sugar , saturated fat and cholesterol on that cake was probably enough give a coronary to an elephant . I did , however , make it for friends many , many times as per their request ( with the proper warning , of course ) , and managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-control is not one of my super powers all I had to do was remember that ingredient list ! <p> Fast forward 15 years I 'm still that same person ( just a liiiitle bit older ) but now , I 'm a mad scientist wannabe , and experimenting in the kitchen has become one of my hobbies . My latest project ? Vegan cheesecake . Vegan Lemon Strawberry Frozen Cheesecake , to be more specific . The goal ? To lighten it up by cutting down calories , saturated fat and cholesterol , but still keeping it rich , creamy and decadent . And as a bonus , keeping it gluten-free just by using store-bought vegan gluten-free cookies . Now , were not saying this is a low-calorie recipe It is still a rich dessert BUT , its definitely an improvement for the original recipe . <p> here 's how we did it : <p> For starters , we used 1 tablespoon of coconut oil to make the crust , as opposed to 1 ENTIRE STICK OF BUTTER . Right there , huge improvement <p> As a base , instead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GO VEGGIE Vegan cream cheese , which is lower in calories , has 25% less saturated fat and is dairy and cholesterol free <p> For creaminess and to help hold the filling together , we used coconut cream instead of eggs , and vegan whipped topping for a little " fluff factor " <p> And finally , a little lemon zest to add the zing and tang that both cream cheese and sour cream have ( hows that for a healthy swap ? ! ) <p> One more thing , freezing the cake is a must in this case , in order to get the right texture . It thaws in no time , so you can enjoy it and refreeze any leftovers . here 's a tip : if you know you are going to have leftovers , serve the strawberry topping on the side instead of on top the cake ( frozen fruit topping is not very appetizing ! ) . <p> To prepare the crust , place cookies in the food processor and pulse until they turn into fine crumbs . Add melted coconut oil and pulse a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 inch spring for pan . Refrigerate until ready to use <p> Combine vegan cream cheese , coconut cream , confectioner 's sugar and vanilla extract in the food processor . Pulse until smooth and creamy . Transfer to a bowl and fold in whipped topping and lemon zest until well incorporated . Pour into prepared crust and freeze for at least 4 hours or overnight <p> To prepare the strawberry topping , combine strawberries , + cup water , sugar and lemon juice in a medium saucepan . Cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes <p> Whisk together corn starch and the remaining + cup of water in a small bowl , until the corn starch is completely dissolved . Pour over the strawberries and stir well . Cook for about 1 minute , stirring constantly and being careful not to mash the strawberries . Transfer to a wide bowl and let cool at room temperature for 45 minutes to an hour <p> While the topping cools , take the cheesecake out of the freezer so it starts to thaw . Cut into slices and spoon strawberry topping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We might as well have called these the " let 's wing it " cookies ! <p> The first time we made these cookies was during Passover last year . It was the second day of the holiday and we needed some kind of dessert , so we had to figure something out ! With the oven at a set temperature and not being able to use any appliances or write the recipe for that matter , we started mixing a bunch of ingredients together in a bowl and this was the result . They did n't  even make it to dinner ! <p> So I had to rely on my memory to recreate the recipe , and I think I got pretty close ! <p> The recipe and ingredients are nice and simple : melted chocolate , safflower or coconut oil , almond butter , almond meal , potato starch , unsweetened cocoa powder and sugar ( which in my opinion could be optional , since the chocolate is already plenty sweet ! ) .

Especially a great chocolate-centric dessert ? Even though there are probably a million reasons why people avoid chocolate these days ( and probably a million more reasons why people indulge ) , we can never resist the urge to create a new chocolate themed treat . This time , we decided on a vegan chocolate and salted peanut butter mousse ( try saying that one three times fast ! ) . <p> The idea for the salted peanut butter and chocolate blend came after realizing how few healthy , or healthy-ish , options there are in stores for fans of this super popular combo . By making it at home , we had absolute control of the quality of ingredients and the amount of sugar we used and were able to make it vegan and gluten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Using unsweetened chocolate helped us with the sugar part . We sweetened the mousse with maple syrup to give it just the right amount of sweetness . To make it light and fluffy , we used a combination of coconut milk yogurt and our favorite all natural vegan whipped topping , Cocowhip by So Delicious , instead of the traditional heavy whipping cream and eggs traditionally used in regular mousses.

@@29051633 @2751633/ <h> Chocolate and Strawberry Protein Shakes <p> As moms , on our biggest challenges is making sure our families have a balanced diet . That task seems at times impossible , not only because of the kids ! In my case , even trying to keep my husband on track is almost as challenging as as asking him to be home on time for dinner ! <p> My daughter I must say , is pretty easy . Shes been a healthy eater since she was a baby really , and even now that she 's away in college she makes an effort to have some healthy food in her dorm . My son however that 's a whole different story . The kid is ALWAYS hungry , as it is expected from a very active 15 year old boy . Much like my husband , he s a sweets addict . He does , however have a very refined palate and loves food as long as it meets his " standards " . Luckily for me , the one thing he does love and drinks in a regular basis are smoothies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more of a dessert rather than a health food , but by using the right ingredients they can be a great , balanced source of nutrients . <p> My son is usually pretty good when it comes to just plain fruit smoothies . He likes most combinations and even makes them himself . But when it comes to adding protein to them to make them a more complete and balanced drink , it becomes a little bit more challenging . Because he is so selective with what he eats , finding a protein powder that he actually likes is not an easy task . And for us its even more difficult , since the selection of protein powders that are not loaded with artificial ingredients and are also kosher is very limited . <p> So when we received samples of- Integrated Supplements Whey Isolate Protein , I thought to myself , who better than my son to put it to the test ? ? And so I did . I prepared 2 shakes for him , one using the vanilla flavor and the other one using the chocolate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the shake he said he smelled like cake batter . And once I blended it into the drink , he said he though he was drinking a milkshake . It was creamy and smooth , without any kind of aftertaste . <p> He did like the chocolate flavor as well , but trying to be as honest as possible , he thought it was slightly grittier and the chocolate flavor did n't  come through as much as he would have wanted it to . Quite frankly though , I was absolutely thrilled he loved one of them ! <p> Oh , and I did the exact same taste test with my husband , who 's just as ( if not more ) picky , since he s been looking for a post workout protein supplement to add to his recovery shake Same results ! <p> So now that I 've given you the official tastes testers " review " , let me give you moms ( aka , me ) opinion about the product . As I said earlier , the fact that I was able to find a protein powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important things for me is that it does n't  contain any artificial sweeteners . The combination of Lo Han extract and fructose ( both natural ) gives it just the right amount of sweetness without leaving any kind of after taste . Again , if you 're used to reading labels , you 'll notice most products in the market have a long list of artificial ingredients and additives ! Another plus ? You do n't  have to go to a specialty store to get it . You can find the chocolate and vanilla flavors of Integrated Supplements Whey Isolate Protein at your local Target , and Chocolate Mint and Strawberry are available online at- Target.com- ( you can subscribe for monthly deliveries and save an additional 5% ! ) <p> From a practical point of view , I like the fact that it comes in a clear , 100% recyclable jar that is significantly smaller than traditional one gallon containers ( I do n't  know about you , but extra space is something I do not have in my kitchen ! ) . I also appreciate the clear and clean labeling.

This time , regrettably , it seems that we are that person . <p> The good news is that , unlike your cousin 's neighbor or co-worker 's sister -in- law , we 're actually right ! The pasta salad we have devised is a protein -packed , veggie -filled dish covered in a creamy sauce that does n't require mayo , sour cream or any other dairy product . <p> Our answer to the typical , dull pasta salad incorporates whole wheat pasta , edamame , cannellini beans and corn as well as red and yellow tomatoes to boost the color and flavor of our take on this traditional dish . <p> The addition of whole wheat pasta not only- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B vitamins , but also makes it the perfect dish to prepare ahead , because it holds its shape without getting soggy . Which means that with our pasta choice alone we have successfully knocked typical pasta salad out of the park ( or wherever else you like to picnic or barbecue , really ! ) With the edamame , cannellini beans , and corn we were able to introduce additional protein , iron , calcium , and fiber into our recipe . We also sprinkled some Vegan Mozzarella Shreds for a touch of cheesy flavor that pairs so well with tomatoes and basil . And best of all , no mayo is required ! <p> We prepared a creamy basil dressing by using our go-to vegan cream cheese alternative , - GO Veggie ! , to tie our variety of ingredients together and cover them in a succulent rich sauce with less saturated fat than you would have with regular cream cheese and none of the cholesterol or lactose !

@@29051930 @2751930/ 120190 @qwx320190 <h> Vegan Meyer Lemon Bars And A Moral Dilemma <p> Yes , we- have these awesome Vegan Meyer Lemon Bars for you today but could you help us out with an issue were dealing with ? <p> A few days ago , we found one of our recipes ( written word by word , pictures included ) posted on the website of a- so-called fitness celebrity , who took full credit for . We contacted them and asked them to please either remove the post , or give us credit for the recipe . We received a response apologizing for what happened . The explanation they gave us was that someone who no longer works on their team was responsible for posting the recipe , and they assured us it would never happen again . <p> Something did n't  sit right with me , especially after receiving that response , so I started browsing through the website , looking at the recipes posted . Just as I suspected , I found a lot of work from other bloggers and , just like happened with us , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images , some were full recipes , copied to a t . <p> I found myself getting more and more- enraged , the more unaccredited recipes I found . How could someone who is supposed to be a " role model " for healthy lifestyle , do something like this ? How can someone blatantly take another persons work and pass it as theirs ? In my eyes , that is no different than going into a store and walking away with something without paying for it . It is no different than stealing . <p> This whole thing has been eating at me for days , and I 've been asking myself- why that is . They did what we asked for after all , so my not just let it go ? here 's why : because its wrong . And because its unfair . Its unfair , because as food bloggers , every recipe and every picture we post requires hard work , time and dedication . And for someone to take the easy road and use it to their benefit , is just wrong . But the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , we were able to catch it and stop it . But what about all the other bloggers out there who have no idea this is happening ? - Shouldnt they have the right to know , so they can decide what to do ? <p> So here 's my " moral dilemma " : do I try to contact these bloggers and let them know what 's going on ? Or do I just let it go , since we got what we asked for ? And please understand , I 'm not trying to be vindictive here . I just want to do what is right and what is fair . <p> In a medium bowl , cream together coconut oil and granulated sugar for about one minute . Add confectioner 's sugar and vanilla and continue beating for another minute , until creamy <p> Reduce speed , add flour , water and salt and mix until just incorporated <p> Using your hands , pull the mix together to form a dough <p> Press the dough as evenly as possible onto the lined pan , so it slightly comes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times ( this will prevent it from bubbling up ) <p> Bake at 325F for about 30-33 minutes or until lightly golden . Set aside to cool completely <p> In the meantime , prepare the lemon curd . Combine coconut milk , lemon juice , maple syrup , corn starch , turmeric and salt in a small sauce pan and whisk well . Place the saucepan on the stove over medium heat and cook until it thickens ( this should take about 5-6 minutes ) , whisking often <p> Remove from heat and whisk in confectioners ' sugar , coconut oil and vanilla extract . Set aside to cool , about 10 minutes <p> Pour the lemon curd over the shortbread crust and refrigerate for 2 hours or until set . Cut into bars 120191 @qwx320191 <h> Comments <p> First off , these lemon bars look delicious ! Secondly , this kind of abuse is pretty rampant . I would be inclined to contact the celebritys team again and tell them to audit their posts , because you recognize some copyrighted content in other posts . If you do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , or just tag some of them in a social media blast about it . Thank you for being vigilant ! <p> Regarding the issue of recipes being copied from other sites . I agree with you that its not moral . But , having said that , there is no such thing as copyrite on the net and unfortunately people can do as they please . They have to live with themselves . To contact the other bloggers well , its ok , but makes no difference . I collect cookbooks and cant tell you how often I 've come across recipes that have clearly been plagiarised . It certainly cheapens the book in my eyes , but once again , nothing one can do about it . <p> I love your recipes , especially since they are all kosher . Thank you so much Renee Sydney Australia <p> Hi Renee ! Yes , we agree with you , there is n't much we can do about them copying the recipes . But when we contacted them and asked them to give us credit for our work , they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments about it on social media and wanted to take care of it right away ) . So , if the bloggers affected contact them and ask the same , they might get the credit they deserve also Thank you for your input and for the love ! ! <p> Photos are copywritten , as is unique text , like the story told about the recipe . A list of ingredients is not copywritten . Simple , basic instructions are not copywritten , but if instructions use unique language and descriptions , then they could have copy rights . A collection of recipes is copywritten . People have had good luck fighting infringements by filing DCMA take downs with Google , hosting companies , and sometimes with Facebook . Or by sending bills for use of photos . So , if a blogger wants to pursue it , there is recourse . Some bloggers say that recipe theft is rampant , but they get tired of the time and energy it takes to fight it . A bit like whack-a-mole , another one always pops up.Dana @ Foodie Goes Healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathan <p> That is very useful , great information Dana , thank you so much . A lot of us are faced with these kinds of situations often , and we are not sure what to do . All these recipes were copied word by word ( typos and mistakes included ! ! ) , and some posts just had pictures from other people , where no credit was given . Thank you again for your input . <p> Dear Ruth and Vicky , your recipes are so good and you two are great ! I say , if you have any questions about whether to contact the bloggers who " borrowed " photos and recipes , get some legal advice first . While anyones first impulse might be to go ahead and do it , there may be ramifications you did n't  think about . Plus , with solid legal advice and support , your case may be even stronger than you think . I hope that you keep sharing your creations and thoughts with us for a long time to come ! <p> I was so sorry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading and trying out your great recipe suggestions because they work ! You are very much on target and so very delicious ! ! ! Take the " high " road ! Your site is a winner ! You have a supportive and loyal following . <p> You are taking the high road by not releasing the celebritys name . And what you want is to treat other bloggers as you would like to be treated yourself . I would say trust your instincts .. they seem quite worthy of trust . <p> Firstly , these bars look amazing and you know why ? The photography ! ! My mouth was literally watering looking at them . That takes talent to create a picture that makes your mouth water . No way someone else should post your art on their site without your permission . The problem here is that this " star " or the person responding for them , should have looked at every recipe on the site to be sure this did n't  happen anywhere else . Now , let 's presume the former employee did n't  inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do , you should either contact the person who apologized and tell them you know these other recipes belong to other bloggers and ask them to remove them as well or contact your friends and let them decided . <p> Thank you ! ! ! ! It is pretty obvious to us that they were blaming the former employee instead of taking responsibility . There are SO many recipes I cant believe only one person was in charge of posting them . We contacted them again asking to refrain from posting the entire recipe , or use photos without permission in the future . They assured us it would never happen again <p> I would let any bloggers know . You would want to know , so I assume others would , too . I know this kind if thing happens quite a bit , but perhaps if enough bloggers complain to this so-called fitness celebrity , it might happen less . I 'm thinking " tweeting " to the celebrity might be overdoing it and might invite negativity . <p> Yes , we absolutely would want to know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . And we agree , doing it privately is the way to go . Our intention is not to cause any harm , we just want to be fair . Thank you for your input ! <p> Sometimes I just have to answer a question by asking another question ! ! If some other blogger had found your recipes on the fitness celebritys website , would you want them to let you know about it ? That 's probably your answer ! ! And if your recipes are copyrighted , what happened was illegal otherwise , its just immoral . Either way , it does n't  feel good to be " ripped off ! " Apparently , this fitness celeb , believes s/he can just keep getting away with this . You may want to round up the other bloggers and all start calling and complaining but s/he will just find another blogger to rip off ! . If the celeb is required to be certified , you can probably file a complaint with his/her licensing board . And you can have an attorney send the celeb a letter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to do to feel better about this ! *** LOVE your recipes ! ! ! <p> Big fat yes , we would want to know ! ! I guess we were looking for suggestions on the best way to approach the issue . The thing is , regardless of what we decide to do , the bloggers involved should have the chance to handle it however they see fit . That 's why we feel like they should know . Thanks for your comment and for the love ! <p> That 's a really tough dilemma ! They do n't  have any right to take your recipes that you worked very hard on , I would tell different bloggers and see if they care . But if enough of you can get up and make some noise than hopefully you could stop them from stealing ! ! ! btw- love the lemon meyer bars = Good luck ! ! <p> I would let the other bloggers know . They may not be aware of what happened . Wouldnt you want someone to contact you with that information . What they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional courtesy . <p> Yes , you should contact the other bloggers . Just as you deserve the recognation for your work , these other people deserve it as well . They should be given the option of telling the site whether they want the recipe/pictures removed or credit given . This is your work/your livelihood . Do n't  ever apologize for doing what is right for you . <p> Yes . You absolutely should tell the other bloggers if you can identify them . Its like getting your stolen bike back from someone who supposedly did n't  realize it was stolen then watching that person walk over take your neighbors bike . I would even go so far as calling out this " superstar " on his/her deception . You all work very hard to give us awesome FREE pictures and recipes . The LEAST one can do is give you all credit . Good luck and keep us posted ! From a fellow Sepharadit <p> Thank you Esther .

We can make them vegan , gluten free , dairy free , lower in fat You know , all that fun stuff . And the main reason we do it that so many people have to follow special diets- nowadays And a lot of them do n't  even know where to start . <p> For us , the most fulfilling part of it is being able to help people , by creating recipes that EVERYONE can enjoy . <p> Like , this sweet potato pie . <p> Most sweet potato pie recipes call for dairy products and eggs for the filling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ) by using light coconut milk and some silken tofu ( no eye rolling , its just for texture . You wo n't even taste it ! ! ) . We made it gluten free by preparing a crust- with oats and pecans ( which turns out , tastes even better than a regular pie crust ! ) . And for the final twist , we made it " sweet and savory " with a little kick , just for fun , so the amount of sugar is lower and can be enjoyed as a side dish for your main meal . <p> Now if the idea of a vegan and gluten free sweet potato pie appeals to you , but you would like to use it as a dessert , all you need is a couple of simple changes , and done ! <p> Omit the salt and pepper when boiling the potatoes and add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup brown sugar when processing ( depending on how sweet you want the filling to be . Remember , no raw eggs here , so you can taste it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , add maple syrup , coconut oil and cinnamon and cayenne ( if using ) and pulse until smooth . Let the mixture cool and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight <p> To prepare the crust , preheat the oven to 350F . Combine oat , pecans , coconut oil and salt in the food processor and pulse until well combined . Add maple syrup and pulse until the mixture comes together when you pinch it with your fingers <p> Press dough onto a 9 inch glass pie dish and bake at 350F for 15 minutes . Remove from the oven and increase the temperature to 400F <p> In the meantime , prepare the topping . Combine all the topping ingredients in a small bowl and mix well using your hands , so the pecans are well coated with the sugar and spices <p> To assemble the pie , fill cooked crust with sweet potato filling ( you may have a few tablespoons of filling left ) , sprinkle pecan topping all over the surface and bake at 400F on the top rack for about 30 minutes . Serve warm or at room temperature

Best cook ever in our eyes . Watching her every day in the kitchen not only taught us pretty much everything we know today , but was also where our passion for cooking started . <p> She can cook pretty much anything without using one single recipe . No measurements , nothing . And the most amazing thing is that she never tastes or eats any of the food she makes . <p> We recently discovered a new line of cheese by a brand called Sincerely , Brigitte . We received a few samples of their different flavors a couple of weeks ago and we fell in love immediately . All the flavors are beautifully infused into the cheese . Theyre bold and assertive . And the combinations are just delicious . Absolutely amazing ! The cheese is mild and creamy , made with premium rBST-free milk sourced from only small Wisconsin dairy farms and using non-animal sourced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And its also certified kosher ! <p> For todays recipes we used their Wasabi flavored cheese .
