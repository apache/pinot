I am 31 years old and live in Calgary , AB . The primary reason for me to joining this forum is to gain and spread information for my 1st Generation Celica . I also have a fair bit of knowledge relating to the Toyota 3S-GTE engine and GT-FOUR Celicas . <p> What I have is a 1977 Toyota Celica GT ( RA29 ) . This is originally a U.S. car that my friend purchased out of Washington about 4 years ago and had sitting in a garage since then . I purchased the car from him in the summer of 2010 and it has sat covered in my driveway since then . Here are few pictures of it sitting in my driveway , prior to me putting the car cover on her . <p> The interior of the car is a black , which is my prefered colour choice . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side and the headliner is starting to collapse , but aside from that it is in good condition . <p> Here is a nice interior shot of the Celica dragon in the back seat . <p> The body on it is very solid and clean with no real rust points , except some surface rust as you can see in the pictures . It is the original paint on it and it has faded from 35 years of sun and elements . I am very happy with the condition as nothing is hiding under a new paint job that will come to haunt me . Now I just need to sand it down the rest of the way and freshen her up with a new coat of paint . <p> From a mechanical stand point the car was a licensed driver in Washington , but my friend never started the car in the 4 years he owned it . As soon as I got it to my place I changed the oil and threw some gas in the tank and tried to start it up . The engine would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first I was a little worried since I bought the car without ever hearing it run or knowing if it ran . I was especially concerned that when I lifted the hood all I could see was sand . Not sure if this thing was driven up and down the beach in Washington or what . <p> I was n't all that worried though since Toyota 20R and 22R engines are everywhere and could easily be replaced from a local junk yard donor if it had to be . I figured the engine just was n't getting fuel as most of the gas would have evaporated in the previous years . So I decided to dump some fuel into the carburetor and see if there were any issues with the engine . I then went back and turned the ignition and the old 20R engine fired right up and ran smoothly for me ... until it burned off the gas I put in the carburetor . So I repeated this process a few times figuring that I would need to get the new fuel I put in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling the carburetor I eventually gave up as it would n't run on it 's own . At that point I called it quits and covered the car with a smile on my face since the engine did run smoothly , with some assistance . <p> I simply added the fuel system to my project list to be the first thing to do to get the car on the road . I did some further research following this and found out that there is an in-tank electric fuel pump in these cars , so that is most likely the culpret and will need replacing . At worst I will need to drop the fuel tank out and flush it to get rid of the rotten gas and check for rust and debris . If it 's really bad I will probably have to take it in to get coated , I guess only time will tell . <p> Another concern and project on the list is the transmission . It has an A40 3 speed automatic transmission in the car , however it has been leaking transmission fluid all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't investigated the cause , but am hoping that if I clean it up it will be good enough to pass the safety inspection to get my insurance and registration on the car . Once it is licensed , the automatic transmission is going to be gone and replaced with a W58 5 speed manual transmission from a Supra . This was one of the many parts that came with the car when I purchased it . <p> It also came with " smiley " bumpers and different tail lights , that came on Australian models and will really improve the looks . This is also on the project list once it is licensed . Here is a picture of what the bumpers and tail lights will look like and what the existing North American bumpers look like . <p> I also have a set of Supra rims to go on it to improve the looks . <p> Parts that I have already purchased and ready to be installed include : <p> Well that is about all I can think of saying right now . I hope that spring comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update everyone and have this car on the road in the near future . I hope you are able to follow my thread and provide comments . Thanks . <p> If this thread should be under Members Rides , let me know and I will move it to there or an admin can feel free to move it for me . <p> Second , just to point out that the 1st gen supra 1978-1981 did n't have independent rear suspension ... they use a 4 link setup , very similar to the AE86 ( and to your RA29 ) , but with a 7.5 " ( F code ) diff ( same as 2wd pickup ) instead of the 6.7 " T diff in the AE and RA , disk brake and 4x114.3 stud pattern ... which makes it a piece of choice when upgrading AE86 , so they have become pretty rare ... the 2nd gen used a IRS with the same F diff in the center , but it would be a bitch to convert your RA29 to use it ... the MA46 is pretty much bolt-on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out that the 1st gen supra 1978-1981 did n't have independent rear suspension ... they use a 4 link setup , very similar to the AE86 ( and to your RA29 ) , but with a 7.5 " ( F code ) diff ( same as 2wd pickup ) instead of the 6.7 " T diff in the AE and RA , disk brake and 4x114.3 stud pattern ... which makes it a piece of choice when upgrading AE86 , so they have become pretty rare ... the 2nd gen used a IRS with the same F diff in the center , but it would be a bitch to convert your RA29 to use it ... the MA46 is pretty much bolt-on , just a little wider track <p> Thanks for that information .

I do n't have an exactly up to date picture , but this one from a few months ago should give you an idea : <p> To replace the tired old 20r , I picked up a 20v 4age .

If worst comes to worst , I would really like to do a 3sge beams swap . There is some talk of a kit coming out of California to do it , so if that materializes I may go that route . At least I will have ITB 's . <p> By the way , I am by no means new to Celicas . Here is a shot of my 1974 RA21 GT at last weekends Driven 2013 . <p> Some updates , which are n't all that exciting , but they 're updates .

Anyways ---&gt; <p> I built a wooden cart thing so I could wheel it around and present myself with the opportunity to break things on BOTH sides . It has n't collapsed and snapped the frame yet , so we can conclude that this engineering degree has pretty much already paid for itself .

@@8344658 @1544658/ @qwx111434 <h> How does a thermo. oil cooler adapter plate work ? <p> I understand how the full flow oil cooler setup works . But how exactly does this style of oil thermostat work ? <p> Is it a wax pellet setup like a regular engine coolant thermostat ? It kind of looks like it . <p> Looking at this pic , the thermostat is for the most part closing off the line to allow flow to the oil cooler . The internal spring would be on the left and is pushing the brass " block " over to block oil passage . <p> It works somewhat like a coolant thermostat , when it 's not up to temp it just recirculates and when it 's up to temp the thermostatic valve opens and oil flows through the cooler . <p> The thermostat allows cool oil to bypass the cooler . Once the wax pellet warms up , it blocks the bypass passage , forcing all the oil thru the cooler before it can get to the filter , then goes to the filter , then to the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wax pellet type . The other type is a bimetallic coil and those are cheesy and cheaper . <p> But those wax pellets eventually leak out , I 'm sure we 've all had cars overheat due to " stuck " thermostats(they 're not stuck , the wax leaked out ) . Same difference . Why even bother with this thing ? Eventually it 's going to fail and you 'll be back at square one but with a much lighter wallet . <p> But those wax pellets eventually leak out , I 'm sure we 've all had cars overheat due to " stuck " thermostats(they 're not stuck , the wax leaked out ) .

Eventually it 's going to fail and you 'll be back at square one but with a much lighter wallet . <p> whut ? in that case , why drive at all , when the bus is cheaper and lower on emissions ? heck , walk , it 's cheaper than taking the bus . <p> if you DO N'T run an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the oil will never get up to operating temperature and you wo n't have the lubricity nor the ability to boil off moisture . <p> an oil thermostat is standard issue on all 4G63 engines that come equipped with oil to air oil cooler . So it 's not a gimmick . Similar effect is achieved in Honda engines with an oil to water heat exchanger so only when oil is hotter than water it gets the cooling effect . <p> But your 4AGE has always come with a full flow oil cooler and that 's been running for what ? A quarter of a century ? It 's really a non-issue for old ass engines with humongous clearances . <p> Yes . The factory GTS oil cooler is a bypass type , which is controlled by a pressure valve ( spring type ) . Above a certain oil pressure , some of the oil runs thru the cooler and dumps back into the pan . Apparently the spring pressure is the same as the pump bypass pressure , so theoretically instead of the oil pump bypassing and dumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the pan . <p> This is not to be confused with a full-flow oil cooler , which has all of the lubricating circuit oil cooled before it hits the bearings . The lack of a thermostat in this type of system will result in overcooled oil , and lower lubricity ( higher friction ! ) due to higher viscocity . <p> IMO it 's almost better to run no oil cooler at all than a full flow one without a thermostat , especially in the Canadian climate . Also , oil coolers can burst under certain circumstances ( which mostly involve high rpms and cold oil ) without a thermostat to protect it . Some engines running thicker oils can produce well over 100 psi at 2500 rpms when cold . <p> But your 4AGE has always come with a full flow oil cooler and that 's been running for what ? A quarter of a century ? . <p> My Silvertop block is n't compatible with the bluetop oil pan . I was planning to use a spare bluetop pan and run a factory oil cooler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been asking questions about the full flow setup for the last year or so and decided to go for it . It 's a better setup ( for me ) for auto X and definitely lapping days/solosprints . <p> Another question though : <p> As you can see in the pics there are two additional ports to mount sensors . I 've got an aftermarket oil temp sensor and was thinking of installing it in one of the ports . Would one port be better than the other ? My initial thought was that it would n't be right to read just the temperature of the oil returning from the cooler . ( I know that Brian is a fan of installing the sensor directly into the oil pan , but I have the opportunity to save myself from cutting holes in things ) <p> brian , with the mocal plate ... did you just use the two sided flow thru bolt from the stock sandwich plate ? and not thread it into the block all the way ?

These gearboxes are called the K-50 and T-50 . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the K-40 and T-40 ) fitted to other Toyotas , so be careful to ensure you get one with the right number of gears ... T-50 Gearbox <p> The T-50 gearbox has a separate bell housing , utilises a hydraulic clutch and comprises 4 main alloy castings : bell housing , two diagonally split gear casings and a tail housing . This gearbox is often referred to as the split case alloy 5 speed and weighs 29 kg . The ONLY bell housings that will mate a T-50 gearbox to a 4AGE come from a RWD ' A ' series engine ( 3A/4A/4AGE ) . <p> The T-50 bell housing has letters cast externally into the top section between the uppermost bell housing to engine block bolt bosses that identify the engine it came from , ie 3A or 4AG etc. 3A and 4A bell housings have the clutch fork on the LHS while 4AG bell housings place it on the RHS . <p> The T-50 gearbox was fitted to other engines as well , such as 1S and 3T etc . The gearbox itself is identical , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are also two types of T-50 gearbox , referred to as 20 and 22 spline . This relates to the number of splines on the gearbox output shaft . There is also a difference in the diameter of the input shaft bearing , which is covered by the bell housing : 62 mm vs 68 mm . The 68 mm bearing is in the 22 spline gearbox . The 22 spline gearbox is more desirable as it is stronger . It is also what all RWD 4AGEs came with . <p> In general terms gearboxes made 1983 or newer are 22 spline . This means that 3T , 1S , 3A and 4A engines have 22 spline units . 2Ts are 20 spline - so be careful . The AE 85/86 and AA 63 series T-50 gearboxes are 650 mm long from the engine end of the bell housing to the centre of the gear lever mount , however , apparently some tail shaft housings fitted to earlier 20 spline gearboxes are shorter , hence allowing relocation of the gear lever with some mixing and matching of components . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In reality a 22 spline gearbox is the only one you can use because it is the only one that will mate correctly with an A series bell housing and handle the power . K-50 Gearbox <p> The K-50 gearbox has an integral bell housing , utilises a cable clutch and comprises two main alloy sections : front casting with integral bell housing and the separate tail housing . There is also a pressed steel plate that bolts to the bottom of the front section . <p> The K-50 is normally found behind 3A 1500 cc SOHC engines fitted to AE 70 and AE 85 Corollas etc . The ONLY K-50 that will fit comes behind a 3A engine - Bell housings off any other motor will NOT fit a 4AGE . These gearboxes are all 20 spline . <p> The K-50 is ideal for 4AGE conversions into KP 61 Starlets or Escorts etc , ie cable clutch cars . Although it is not as strong as the T-50 you will probably get away with it in a light car with moderate power output and sane driving . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover plate ( that bolts to the back of the block just ahead of the flywheel ) and the 2 cast stays that bolt between the bottom of the block and the lower portion of the bell housing .

The other 2 are on the other side ... lol ) <p> Now remove the gasket with a little scrapper and you can help yourself with some gasket remover or carb claner <p> Next step , to get the linkage off , use a pair of pliers to unhook the spring between the metal tab and the vaccum bell <p> Using a philps head screwdriver , undo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carb body ( you 'll need to change the little rubber washer behind it <p> Next , you need to disconnect the linkage between the primary shaft and the accelerator pump by removing the cutter pin with a pair of pliers ( carefull not to loose the flat washer underneat ) <p> Since I have a manual choke , their is a rod that that is attached to the primary shaft and the choke linkage to open the throttle plate slightly when the choke is closed . I do not know if this is present on auto-choke carbs , if it is , remove it <p> You can now remover the lower carb body ( where both throttle plates are located ) , you just need to flip the carb and remover the 2 philips head on each end and the 2 hollow flat head screws near the center <p> Next , you 'll remove the idle mixture screw ( the one at an angle with a spring under it ) spray some carb cleaner down the hole and clean the tip of the screw real good . Next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as soon as you feel that it 's in all the way , back it off 2 and a half turn ( it 'll help in tunning back the carb after ) <p> Next , let 's work at removing the cover on the upper carb body ... <p> Remove the accelerator pump arm by undoing hte 12mm bolt at the pivot point <p> You can now remove the 8 philips had screws that holds the cover on the upper carb body <p> and open it up ! <p> Let 's start by the cover . You need to undo a rod that rotates freely ... it 's holded down by the offset philips screw <p> Then remove the float by removing the floating pin <p> Remove your needle assembly and assemble the new one in the kit with the plunger and spring just like the old one . My original ones had filter glued to them but my new one did n't , you do n't really need them anyway , just discard those filter , you should already have a particle filter in the tank and an inline fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle assembly in place , make sure you change the ring and gasket , then screw it one before moving on to the next step : getting to adjusting the float level . <p> 1- By holding the cover upside-down , raise the float as far as it 'll go ( without forcing it ) and measure the distance between the top of the needle assembly and the tab on the float that contact it when it goes down . Whatever the origin of you aisin carb , that distance needs to be 1.2mm , to adjust it , bend the 2 upper tab that serve as stopper when you raise the float <p> 2- Now , let float down and push on the needle assembly just by gravity . Measure the distance between the cover ant the top of the float , this thing is variable over the years , so use you FSM or the assembly sheet that came with the carb rebuild kit , for my carbs , it was 8.7mm to adjust it , just bend the tab that connect the float to the needle assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with the cover ! <p> First , remover the plunger for the accelerator pump . You also need to remove the spring under it to reach the ball that is holded in by an other small spring ( use your needle nose pliers ) . After removing all of it , spray some carb cleaner down the hole and inside the jet ! <p> Second , you need to remove the fuel cutoff solenoid , simply unscrew it using a 12mm wrench and change the o-ring at the tip and the gaket at the mating surface . Do n't forget to clean the hole down with carb cleaner to make sure it 's hell'a clean ! <p> Third , their is a brass needle screwed on the left side if the accelerator pump in the picture , it 's the idle jet . Just unscrew it using a small flat head screw driver and spray carb cleaner down the hole and through the jet . <p> Just above that on the picture , their is a round alloy plug with a weight and a ball hidden under , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAREFULL not to loose the weight ) . Clean the hole again ! <p> The 2 tubes for the main jet in the primary and secondary barrel are being held by 2 philips screws , under them , remove the tubes and carefully remove the gasket underneat , you can now remove the venturies and let them sit in carb cleaner <p> On the engine side of the carb , their is a plate holded down by 3 philips head screw <p> It 's hidding a thermostatic valve that just sits there , tilt the carb sideways to let it fall out in order to reach the rubber washer behind it which you 'll change for a new one <p> Carefull with the gasket , I ended up reusing mine because the one in the kit did n't fit <p> Then undo the 2 philips screw that hold the glass over the fuel level sighting hole to reach the o-ring behind . Change it and screw the plate back on making sure the dot in the glass is INSIDE the carb <p> Then undo the 2 bolts with a 12mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jets with a flat head screw driver and change the gasket behind . <p> Now is the right time to clean everything , while everything is out . Blast carb cleaner down the emulsion tubes , blast them throught the main jet , everywhere ! Do not use any thing else than carb cleaner or air pressure to clean all the brass things . For the rest of the surfaces , you can use piano wire to clean out all the holes ( and again not the holes in the jet or emulsion tubes , no piano wire in anything that is of yellowinsh color ) . For the rest of the surfaces , I used a small gentle toothbrush to removre the varnish mainly from the float bowl . Personnaly , I use a small flexible hose at the end of the straw on my carb cleaner bottle to reach inside every port and every little holes <p> While we 're at it , I had some dellorto jet ( for motocycle carb ) and I decided to check if they fitted ... and yes , the thread is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if your carb need jetting , you might want to look at those since they are n't that expensive . <p> Now it 's time to reassemble everything , change the gasket , o-ring , rubber washer and ball with it 's replacement in your kit ( careful about the ball size and washer thickness ) . Then put everything back the way it came out , the only thing you need to worry about is the plunger for the accelerator pump . Before placing the new one in , first lub up the leather piston down with some very light oil and let it sit for a minute before pushing it gently in . <p> When everything is finaly assembled , celebrate victory with a cold one ! <p> ########## <p> Now here is a nice little modification that 's been around for a couple of decade ( I did n't invent anything here ) . it transform the secondary barrel from vaccum actuation into a mecanical one <p> You just need to take the diaphragm bell and remove the 4 philips screws <p> Carefull with the diaphragms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that it really matters , but it 'd rather keep it good if it 's still is ... ) <p> When you 'll remove it , their is a spring under it that keeps the actuating arm down at all time when the bell is closed . that way , the only way to open the secondary is with vaccum from the engine that pulls up compressing spring and pull the arm ( if the linkage on the primary is allowing it to move ) <p> Now , just be dumb and put the spring on the opposite side <p> reassemble everything and see the difference <p> Without the mod , the first barrel open with the throttle cable , but the second one stay close ( it would use vaccum to open up ) <p> With the mod , the secondary open by itself , offset from the primary barel like a weber DGV , it starts to open when the primary is about half way open and then opens at twice the speed of the primary so that it becomes fully open at the same time as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little " what not to do " ! <p> It 's written in the FSM to never , I repete , NEVER undo the screws that hold the throttle plate in order to remove them and the shaft , because they will brake and Toyota does n't stock new ones .... <p> If you do n't listen to that , here is the nightmare you 'll get yourself into .... <p> First of all , before you start saying that I 'm dumb , I really needed to remove the primary shaft because it was bended and since I have 2 carbs , it was impossible to synchronize both if they are not perfectly identical <p> Like they told , both screw head broke ... <p> I think they are M3 , but I ended up drilling right through and oversizing the hole ... so I do n't really know for sure <p> I pulled out the shaft to bend it back into submission : spinning it on a drill close to an erasable marker , you mark the " high " spot and you get an idea of where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's really long and really boring ot do , but when you need to , you need to ! <p> Since the screws where drilled right through , I needed to bolt new ones in ... I oversized them to M4 ( if that is even possible lol ) so I ran a tap through the holes and got myself some M4 countersunk bolts locally , with an allen head , but they are not even close to fit <p> Let 's ' take out the press drill ( poor man 's mill ) and turn the heads until they have the good diameter and the right tapper <p> Red locktight to make sure they NEVER get down the runner through the intake port <p> and here is the finished product <p> Believe me , you do n't wan na do this exept if you really need to bend those shaft back in place ... if not , leave the throttle plates alone <p> The brass screw next to the accelerator pump bore is the idle jet . The " vibrating valve " is actually a mini thermostat that used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did n't mention replacing the power valve including transferring over the jet and also replacing the idle mixture screw with a new one . Did you kit not come with one ? <p> I also recommend removing both booster venturis as you said but then cleaning the very very tiny siphon-breaks ( small holes ) located in their tops at the sides . If these get clogged the carbs will flood each and every time the vehicle is shut off . <p> I also recommend that once the brass parts are all removed that you clean out the passageways with piano wire especially the idle progression holes . The carb clean you guys get is nothing like the stuff we used in the old days when carbs were still sorta around . <p> One last thing , many early Aisan ( not yours ) have a brass filter located under a plug on top of the needle and seat assy .

I 'll edit it with that info later today . <p> My kit did n't have a spare idle mixture screw so I let the original one sit for a bit in the carb cleaner ... <p> I guess I should say more than " clean every thing real good " and include your notices . I did n't know the piano wire trick , I 'll include it at the same time <p> Oh and I had those little filter glued on top of the needle assembly ... the new needle assembly that came with the kit did n't so I discarded them ( I also feared about them getting cloged up and since their is already filter in the tank and an inline fuel filter , I thought it was a bit overkill ) ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock length so I stuck with it ... now both carbs are back on the intake and the linkage is all sorted out , ready to get back on the head , so it 'll stay that way until the next time I need to play with them <p> Thumbs up for the impressive tutorial . As I believe our carbs are very similar ( mine is an Aisan C28 , supplying a Mitsubishi /please do n't shoot / L300 Hymer camper with a 1.6 4G32 engine ) . Because the car was running poorly and the fuel consumption was crazy ( around 17-18l/100km at 90km/h ! ) I decided to give it a good cleaning/rebuild . Not being able to get any kit here in Poland , a got the gaskets custom-made , repleaced all the old rubber hoses etc . After fitting the carb back in place and doind some tests it seems that in the lower rev range the engine is running too rich - black sparkplugs ) and when pushing it full throttle the sparks look too lean ( they 're white ) . <p> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carb the weight above the check ball outlet ( as well as the spring ) were missing - when rebuilding the carb , all I found was the check ball in it 's channel and having some idea on carbs + seeing a system like that before , I found a spring size/tension I thought might work ( just a guesstimate , imagining it would be better than leaving the check ball itself and nothing else ) . In the same diagram we can see that both the primary and secondary main jets are shown ( and described what they should look like ) , but there are no sizes given for either of them and in my case both jets are brass-yellow ( although they do differe in size noticably ) - therefore should the larger sized jet be placed in the primary ( smaller ) or secondary ( larger ) bore of the carb ? I noticed you have removed your jets , so I 'm hoping you would still remember that <p> Now there 's further questions , that I imagine will be hard to answer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where to get one ? ? ) 2 ) What diameter/tension/length spring was there originaly 3 ) Can this be the reason of my problems ? From my understanding it may be a possible cause of " too lean " in the hight rev range - assuming that spring on top of the outlet check ball is too hard , leading to the ball not moving in it 's full range , therefore not opening/fully opening the accelerator channel ) , but does n't really answer why is the low rev range too rich . Here is where I start to wonder if the primary/secondary main jets are n't swapped the other way around , hence I 'm trying to find out what size they should both be and does the bigger one supply the larger of smaller bore of the carb . <p> In this link LONG ... we can see that the float level is adjustable and I 'll try looking into that first I suppose ( but before disassembling everything for the 4th time in a week , I 'd love to sort out the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the carb mounted ) . It 's also possible to do some adjusting to the accelerator pump , although from the diagram I 'm not sure how to measure the actual amout of fuel discharged - I fill up the float chamber , operate the accelerator pump ( so simply accelerate/fully open the throttle one ) and measure what , where should that discharged fuel flow into ( + from where ) ? <p> Also , if a understand what 's in the diagram , the fast idle screw is only meant to adjust the choke-in-operation RPM 's at around 2000 , correct ? 
@@8344661 @1544661/ @qwx111434 <p> sooo from what i understand if you want a shorter stroke shock to go with your lowered car , an sw20 shock is the most commonly used . but you need to either cut the strut cartridge and use ae86 gland nuts . machine the sw20 gland nuts and add spacers. or new option buy the t3 advance strut tubing blah blah blah . now i do n't  work for t3 but with all that time spent i 'm leaning towards just buying it seeing how i enjoy my ride height and do n't  plan on changing it <p> The t3 strut spacers are not worth the money . Basically what they do is add a " spacer " to the inside of the strut tube so you can run a shorter stroke shock . By running a short stroke shock in a full stroke casing , it gets you nowhere . The proper way to go about sw20 struts is by cutting the GTS casings , shortening them by 20-25mm iirc , and then installing the shorter shock ( which gives you more travel on a lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the time to shorten the casings I 'm buying a weld on coilover for the front , which t3 sells . <p> Also , of what I know you are going to want to run the SW20 short stroke shocks in the front , and Camero shocks on the rear . You can use the GTS gland nuts in the GTS casings with the SW20 shocks . <p> The T3 spacer fits at the top of the strut casing effectively pushing the insert close to the bottom where it should be . The problem is that by using it , you create a " cup " at the top of your housing and if you DD your car it can fill with water and other crap . IMHO it 's for people who want to just use lowering or cut springs without going full coilover . <p> And or people who want to run lowered in the Summer and full height in the winter , but do n't have an extra pair of strut housings . I am planning on running trd springs on the stock spring perch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , t3 just simplified it by making it one piece instead of 2 , and it is a new nut . The only down sides are like stated if dd 'd crud can build up inthe small space between the top of the strut casing and where the shock is actually located , and the aluminum to Mild steel Corosion potential . <p> A Oem gland nut or most that would come with front strut inserts for ae86 would have a nice rubber o ring in it to help keep the strut rod free of debris . <p> The sw20 front are the shortest , and the I 'm not 100% but should be the same as tokico Hts , witch in turn should be the same as trd inserts for the 86 , witch are based on ae92 front cartride . <p> And or people who want to run lowered in the Summer and full height in the winter , but do n't have an extra pair of strut housings .

We 've put sw20 fronts into the nose of an ae92 , etc . <p> Body size of the above inserts are all about 60mm shorter than ae86 front . <p> Popular cut is 40mm shorter casing , plus 20mm spacer at the bottom of the cartridge . <p> 2nd popular mod is to re-use FACTORY strut gland nuts that have a shock shaft seal for double sealing . A bit more sticktion this way , but not noticeable . But in dirty conditions keeps the front shock seals happier . This requires minor machinework to the inside ( lower portion ) of the gland nut if you 're doing it properly to center the top of the strut insert . Improper methods would use a shim ( tape ? ) to center the top of the cartridge in the strut housing . Also requires custom lower spacer to account for the extra thickness of the seal . <p> T3 gland nuts can work , but reduce available travel by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff ( 8kg/450lbs ) springs at higher settings . Also , as noted , they can ( and will ! ) collect dirt and hold it around the top of the shaft seal . So not recommended for winter use . Also , because the cartridge sits at the bottom of the strut casing , the nose will sit 2cm lower than with the other setups and can not be raised up . <p> thank you brian for your 10 cents rated at 1 dollar canadian on the exchange market . <p> i sent my struts out to adam to get them shortened but i did n't  really specify how much or use 40mm and a 20 mm washer , i just asked him to make it fit an sw20 insert . <p> also noticed that someone already put a seal inside my gland nut exactly like brian said , i figured it was oem lol. i 'm running the car year round so t3 gland nuts do n't  seem as good anymore and im also running a pretty soft suspension this time around

The 1st batch had sold out on my home forum which is www.ozclubbies.com.au , hence I 've been holding off on advertising the kits here for some time . <p> I do n't own an AE86 as you might have guessed , but I have been toying with the T50 gearbox in my Lotus 7 Replica ( Arrow Westfield ) . An elusive bearing hunt began once I realised that my T50 was starting to show signs of wear . It has almost taken me to the land of the rising sun ! <p> Anyways , here 's the kit in detail : <p> This is by far the most complete kit you can buy and includes the caged needle idler bearings . These caged needle bearings were custom manufactured specifically for this kit as they are the most rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular the 5th gear , hemispherical bearings . To date , there is nobody on the market who is able to supply these . Not even Toyota ! <p> NOTE : This kit is for the late model T50 gearbox that takes a 68mm x 18mm thick input shaft bearing ( 1983 - 1987 release ) . A way to verify this is to remove the release bearing shaft collar and read the part number of the input shaft bearing . It should read Nachi 30RT06S3 ( or SKF 030-4 if it 's been rebuilt in the past ) if you have the late model gearbox . EDIT ( Easier way to narrow down your type of gearbox ) - if you have 20 splines on the output shaft , you have the 1st generation gearbox , sometimes referred to as a 2T gearbox. ( 1973-1981 ) . These boxes are kinda rare , and apparently mechanically weaker . If you have 22 splines on the output shaft , you have either the 2nd generation(1981-1983) or 3rd generation(1983-1987) gearbox . From here it 's pretty hard to tell them apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing . Please ensure you have the 3rd generation type of gearbox . There are 3 variants of this gearbox ! <p> 1x T50 gasket set - In my experience , these paper gaskets are prone to leaking . I 've better luck using Permatex/RTV silicone to seal up the gearboxes . <p> Price : The comprehensive kit is $AUD480 + shipping . So far , the cost of tracked shipping to Canada ( North America ) is approx $AUD72 . So let 's call it $AUD550 landed . At the moment , the Aussie dollar is pretty much at parity with the Canadian dollar . So it equates to about $CAD550 . Payment is done via PayPal . <p> I will also sell individual parts separately . A common addition to the full kit is an extra set of caged needle bearings ( $75 ) . To date there is no other supplier out there for these bearings . Please contact me if you are after a specific part . I will also omit parts from the full kit if you require a cheaper price . <p> Not bad ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the teeth on the dog rings are all worn out as well , cant seem to find those anywhere .. Changing a syncro is n't gon na do to much if the dog ring is all worn out . 
@@8344664 @1544664/ @qwx111434 <h> DIY - Zinc electroplating <p> Well since a lot of you guys have requested it here is a little how to on zinc plating at home . <p> First what is electroplating ? It 's the application of a coating to a piece with the use of electricity . A lot of different material can be electroplated on steel : nickel , copper , chrome , etc ... but much of those need nasty chemical to make it adhere to steel . Zinc on the other hand can be done rather safely by anyone with minimal material at very low cost ... and that 's good ! <p> Now , the primary function of zinc plating is much like paint : to protect the metal from rusting although it also enhance the appearance of the part . The good thing about zinc plating is that it 's much tougher than paint . It resist chemical a lot better than paint and also it protects from rust differently . Paint just act as a barrier to isolate the metal from nasty oxygen . If you scratch a painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as a barrier much like paint but also act as a sacrificial layer of metal to be oxidize . That 's why if you scratch the zinc finish , it will not rust in the scratch like paint because zinc has a lot more potential to oxidize than steel so oxygen will react with the zinc surrounding the scratch before attacking the steel . <p> Well enough background . Let 's get dirty . <p> First we need to prepare the electrolyte , that is the conductive solution that we will use to make the plating bath . <p> Alright , get yourself some vinyl gloves , safety google ( face shield is even better ) . To make the electrolyte we will need zinc chloride . To make that , we will make a reaction of HCL ( hydrochloric acid ) and zinc . The zinc powder I 'm using for this ( see picture ) came from dead alkaline batteries . It 's free so why not . To get it ( sadly I have no picture ) you put your gloves and face shield once again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative ( flat side ) hang out and take a pipe cutter and cut the casing all around as close to the flat side as possible . When that is done , you will take out the electrode that is underneat and goes through the center . The center has a mixture of crap hydroxide and zinc powder . It is held there in a paper tube . Pull the paper tube and put the hydroxide/zinc paste in a jar , drop the rest in a container off to dangerous waste and the case can be recycled . Do that to a bunch of batteries and put that in a coffee filter and let trickle water on that , it will wash the hydroxide paste and let you with zinc powder in the filter . Wash it at last with a solution of water and baking soda and then let it dry . You have zinc powder ! <p> Zinc powder from dead alkaline batteries <p> Now you really really really need to go outside . To make zinc chloride , we 'll mix HCL with the zinc powder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let a crap load of heat and H ( which is hydrogen guys , freaking really explosive stuff ) . If you do that inside you risk to blow your house , do n't say I did n't warn you . So get some heavy glass or pyrex container and pour in 30% HCl ( normally that is non diluted stuff from home-depot of can-tire ) . You need about 30ml per every liter of electrolyte . I made 2 gallons so that 's about a cup . Then you will add SLOWLY a little zinc powder . It will bubble and if you drop too much it will burst out like menthos in coke , except it 's not coke but acid at a pH of 1 that is being heated by a chemical reaction ... not fun ! So do that slowly until there is no reaction when you add zinc . You need to have a little leftover in the bottom of the container so you 'll know that all the HCl reacted with the Zn . Now it 's now drinking safe , but that thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . <p> Alright we also need ammonium chloride . You can make that by combining ammonium ( think really strong janitorial strength cleaner ) with HCl but I did n't calculate anything here with concentration since they already sell something called " sal ammoniac " to clean soldering tips and it 's cheap like 10$ a kilo shipped . You will need 120g per liter of that stuff so for 2 gallons you need about 900g ( although I bought 850 and it did the trick ) . <p> You also need a couple tea spoon of sugar or twin sugar per liter ( supposed to help in brightness although I did n't test it with and without ... but sugar is cheap so drop some in ) . <p> And you need water ... you have to subtract the 30ml of water that is in the ZnCl solution so 970ml of water , 30ml of zinc chloride , 120g of ammonium chloride , couple tea spoon of sugar and you put that in a container . You have your electrolyte ! Just drop that is a non-conductive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and have a beer . <p> Now notice how it 's not a clear solution , it was at first but some of the zinc gets to the bottom and that was after running the thing for several hours , plating over a hundred bolt and a crank pulley ... where I 'm going is that ? Well , if you are careful not to drop anything in there to contaminate it , all you need to do when it gets like that is to filter it to get the zinc , let it dry and add it to your pot of zinc powder from the batteries and reuse that stuff . If you are really careful with your electrolyte it will last a very long time . Keep the cover on and you should be fine . <p> So the steps above need to be done rarely ... which is good because it 's a pain in the butt to make the electrolyte . Now let 's get plating . <p> First , you will need a source of DC ( that is direct current ) . I use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old transformer for a cellphone or old wireless phone , radio , name it . We 'll need under 6 volts and under 1amp so it 's really not a lot of power . <p> You 'll also need old house electrical wiring in order to connect your items that you want to plate . Here is what I did to plate bolts , just twist 20 bolts in the eye and that 's it . For the bigger pieces , you can just use a copper pipe over the bucket and hang the piece with a couple small copper wire from the copper pipe inside the bath . <p> You will also need a zinc anode . I used one for marine use , that bolts on a mercury boat engine but roofing strips on pure zinc can also be found at home-depot and the like ( which I 'll probably go for next time when that boat anode is gone ) . <p> Then you hang that thing in the bath via a non conductive thing ( plexiglass strip in my case , wood works just as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your DC " transfo , inverter , what ever " . If plating bolt , center the anode to place you 're " bolt ring on a string " thing around , for bigger item put your copper pipe at the place of the plexiglass strip and locate your anode at the far end of the bath . <p> Alright setup is done , we need the metal piece . Your bits of metal or anything need to be rust free , and grease free , only bare metal . Best way to do that is to clean them up in an acid bath right before plating . I 'm installing a hood in my workshop and strongly suggest you to do that ( nice for welding fumes and solvent as well ) but my duct work is not completed yet that is why the pictures of the acid bath where taken outside . If you do n't follow my lead on that , it will make everything in your workshop rust if you do n't vent the fumes fast . That being said , I normally degrease my parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mild solution like CLR for a couple of days to get the worst rust off . Then when I 'm ready to plate , I take a bowl outside ( or under a hood ) with HCl in and a perforated bowl inside that one and let the bolts rest for 30min to 1h . HCl will not eat through steel very fast but if you have aluminum washers on your bolt , kiss them goodbye . <p> Then did n't I mention to put GLOVES on ? Yes I did ! Retrieve those bolts/piece and make sure they are rust free . <p> Transfer them in a second pot with water and baking soda , it will neutralize the acid coating the bolts and will protect them . Go back to your work shop and put them on the " copper ring thing " ( we should find a name for that ) and work fast , do n't allow them to dry or rust will instantly flash on them . Work with gloves because even the oil from your skin will contaminate the metal and zinc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contamination . That is why I do n't make more than 20 bolts per run ... too much chances of screwing around . <p> Now put that in the bath around the zinc anode and connect the NEGATIVE side to the cooper wire <p> It should look like that <p> Now turn the power ON and adjust amperage or voltage to get just a slight little micro bubbles appearing at the surface of the part you want to plate , it should not make bubble big enough to brake the surface . The lowest amperage you use , the better it will turn out , but the longer it will take . For 20 bolts I normally use this . <p> It all depends on the metal surface you have to cover but a big crank pulley called for 900 to 1000 milliamps . <p> So there you go , grab a beer and wait . Remember that electroplating is a line of sight process . For complex pieces you may need to use creativity and move the piece around the anode quite a lot ( like was the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them around the anode for 15 min , thread them in there loop 180 to expose the other side and then again 2 more times 15min apart for a total plating time of 1h . It is usually sufficient for most bolt runs . If you notice that you have zinc deposit that feels more like sand ( usually happens on the first bolt of the string ) then brush it off . After 1h your bolts should look like this <p> A dull grey color , sometimes darker , but most of the time light like this . If they are heavily pitted and look more like cheap galvanize nails , then you used too much current . Take them out and leave them to dry . Then use a wire wheel ( brass or steel ) and they will polish to a nice shinny finish ... <p> Tried it , if you have the place to have this running while you plate that 's awesome . My workshop is too small so it 's easier to let my bolt in an ice cream pot than to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HCl , it works faster than phosphoric acid , it 's cheaper and you need it to make the Zinc Chloride anyway ... it 's a little nastier so if you want to work inside without a hood to vent the fumes it might be a nice alternative to use phosphoric acid instead . With a hood or quick access to outside , I prefer HCl.

This LINK suggests the R32 non-ABS ( 15/16 " ) or S14 ( 7/8 " ) masters will bolt up fine but require hard line work . <p> However I have not been able to come to a complete solid conclusion as to what I should do ... so my question is : <p> What brake master and booster ( keep the stock AE86 booster ? ) should I switch to when upgrading to the RX7 caliper BBK ? Which is the most convenient option in terms of requiring the least amount of parts and work ? <p> Additionally , pedal travel on 86s seem to be longer than what I have become accustom to driving new vehicles . I have been reading that different sized masters " should " affect pedal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pedal travel distance to be slightly reduced . Not too knowledgeable on this ... any information is welcome . <p> so i have finally gotten around to installing the bbk. pedal feel is pretty bad . i have to prime the master once and then step on the pedal a second time before the feel is somewhat normal . braking power has increased quite a bit : dba4000 slotted front rotors , blank rear rotors and hp plus pads . <p> so i want to try a different master cylinder ... leaning towards a late model camry ( 15/16 " ) or 97 supra tt ( 1 " ) master now . both are still 2 bolt and need slight modification to the hard lines . <p> Odd options , run a ae86 size master with a larger bore from wilwood . You 'll push more but it 'll be harder to push . The brake booster can be removed if you changed the mounting point on the pedal for some better mechadv . Threshold breaking is nice . <p> good suggestion . i guess i will take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as a proportioning valve . <p> Edit : why are the two master cylinders I listed odd options ? <p> it seems like a lot of work for little gain ? why do you want a bigger master ? If you 're brakes are not at the top of the pedal &amp; squishy that 's bad mmmkay . More brake travel IMO is better for fine tuning threshold braking . If you want a firmer feel switch your stock rubber lines for SSlines . <p> if you want better braking - pads and larger/more pot brake calipers would do much more then changing the master . rx7 fronts i.e <p> the master only pushes X diam Y distance for Z hydro advantage . If you 're hunting to change Z why not use a wilwood or aftermarket with ae86 spec size to suit the application you want ? As well what wrong with a ae86 stock master ? <p> what pads are you running - rs4 or hp+ should be able to lock all four np with stock equipment , na ? <p> Another update . Bleeder screws on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my old ones ... No more leaks so far and pedal feel has stiffened up , no more mushy feeling . Might not even bother with swapping out the stock master now . HOORAY ! <p> IMO larger master gives better brake feel , and makes it easier to threshold brake . More effort is required with a larger brake m/c but most drivers do n't mind this at all . Unless the m/c is way to big , in which case you 'll have excessive effort and poor results . <p> With ma61 calipers and rotors , the 15/16 m/c works great . Some camrys use 7/8 and that would work as well . <p> The nissan s13 stuff has a built-in prop valve and IMO is n't the way to go . <p> Have n't played around with FC stuff on an ae86 , so can not tell you what size to run .

But would it make the car more fun ? Only if it 's closer usable ratios . <p> Personally , it does n't look like it 'll be too much of an advantage . 1st is a stump puller . So , you 're probably going to use 2-3 more . The solution is run higher final drive and bigger tires .

I personally would n't want to buy a header and have to fiddle around with refitting it , especially when I paid for it to be specifically for my Car . I also read that some guys had issues with their OBX headers cracking on them , but that could be because of whatever the obx headers performance levels are capable of and whatever application those guys misused it for . If you do go with the OBX header I suggest Stainless Steel . <p> If you 're not in a rush to get another header soon , consider saving up and going with something not so questionable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stainless Steel headers ? I.E. some form of ceramic / insulating . ( I do n't want to run a heat wrap . ) <p> I like the idea of the SS header , from my reading it should end up being slightly better than the ceramic . It 's a smoother finish inside and out so the flow will be slightly better ( not that it matters ) . It does radiate more heat so I would like to address that hence my coating question . The SS headers from OBX are said to be made of thicker material than the Ceramic coated ones , and the welds on them are better . <p> I got the stainless one and ceramic coated it , then wrapped it .

@@8344674 @1544674/ @qwx111434 <p> Indeed , lol . I have a part number for a 35 and a 9 , but usually Toyota has them matched together ( the driven gear will actually be marked with both it 's teeth number , and the drive gear it is matched to ) . The only set I can find with a 9 drive gear is 33:9 . While I think that 33 is pretty close to 35 , the 35 driven gear may not mesh 100% correctly with the 9 drive gear . <p> Also , the 9 tooth drive gear was never used in a North American vehicle , not a huge deal , but it will make it harder to source . <p> I 'll keep checking into this to see if I can find an actual 35:9 matched set . <p> Also , I 'd like to say that Toyota speedometers are calibrated for 1026 revs = 1 mile , not 1000 , so that should be used in the calculation . Also , by my calculations , Brian , 195/60R14 is 869 revs per mile , not 900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now 33:9 is 3.67:1 , tell me if I 'm wrong on that . <p> Makes life easy .

It is flawed in that the part numbers listed do n't reflect the fact that you ca n't mix and match speedo gears with outputshaft gears . All of the part numbers are there , but we have n't determined completely which are which yet . Jeff , if new EPCs distiguish which output shaft the speedo gear requires please post which numbers are which , my EPC sure does n't . <p> Plugging in Brian 's scenario says he needs a 3.74 ratio , and there are no 9 tooth ratios listed there so that too confuses the thing at the end , but it still gives you the ratios . mk3 5spd supra came with 225/50-16 tires BTW , has the same 5th gear ratio as listed there and had a 4.3 diff too . <p> So yeah , sounds like you need a 9 tooth gear or its time to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the beams anyways ? Does toyota even have a 33:9 speedo gear ? I did n't realize there were 9s , did n't see em in the EPC . Also it sounds like you already have a 35:10 in there which is the furtherest you can go in the direction you need to correct it without delving into 9s . Apparently its only out by 6 percent though . Goto a 4.1 diff and your speedo should be almost perfect . <p> Now here 's where things get tricky , for some mega annoying reason , toyota used a different diameter for the 35:10 gears in all of the Celica Supras that came with 4.3 rear ends . I do n't know if that goes for the mk3 Supra w58s as well or not but it would n't suprise me . I have like 5 w58s on the property , and an r154 and I 've pulled all the gears and they 're all the same diameter execpt the ones that came with 4.3s .

However , a useful little tidbit I learned recently from a Celica Supra owner in Calgary ( funkycheeze ) , on w58s you can actually change the output shaft gear without removing the tail shaft housing ! If you pull the shifter plate off the top of the tranny from in the car , and drop the drive shaft you can use a long nose set of needle nose plyers to pop the snap ring that holds the gear on and slide it out the driveshaft hole . He s done it succesfully with mk2 w58s , but could n't do it with the r154 as it has an abs gear on the output shaft after the speedo gear . I 'm pretty sure the speed sensor on the mk3 supra w58s mounts before the speedo gear so it should work on them too . <p> Brian I have inserted a speedo gear meant for a 10 tooth onto an 11 tooth and vice a versa and the thing went in alright , but I 'm sure they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with two different profiles if it was n't necesary .

I hav n't tried that excel sheet yet with the new mile calibration , might change that error margin a percent point . <p> Jeff , thanks for the corrections and part numbers !

While i 'm under the car the gas tank is being removed , as well as ebrake being tightened up , and rear brakes being done .

That usually works to break the axle bearing free from the housing . I sometimes put one axle flange nut back on a few threads to retain the axle from popping out quickly and ripping the backing plate off ( and brake line etc . ) If they have been removed recently , a couple of whacks is all that is needed .

You can buy them for $0.75 from Canadian Tire in the plumbing section . When you put the diff back in , seal the pig to housing with a thin layer of blue silicone . Be careful when putting the axles back in that you do n't knock an oil baffle plate out of its mooring beside the diff , otherwise it will become part of the rotating assembly .

I 've done a LOT of reading , and have done a lot of work on my motor . I actually love the engine now , and here is what I can recommend : <p> - Download this denso manual to learn how your engine works before you get too serious with messing with the injection pump : LONG ... Diesels are quite different from gasoline engines , and this manual is pretty good at explaining everything . <p> - Get a pyrometer . This is super important to tuning your engine , and keeping the head from cracking . EGT 's are what crack the heads on these engines . Keep your post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your engine is well maintained , I guarantee the head will be fine . Also , the pyrometer will help you tune your engine and ensure you are not getting too rich with it ( opposite of gasoline , a rich diesel makes more power and runs hotter ) . When going up big hills , keep the rpms up , which will keep the EGTs down . <p> - Permanently remove the entire EGR system , and install block-off plates at the exhaust and intake manifold . This will increase efficiency and keep EGTs down a bit . <p> - Remove the throttle body and intake manifold . Unless a previous owner has done it , you 'll find the intake manifold super clogged up with sludge from the EGR/PCV . Clean it really well , also clean the head intake ports which will also be full of sludge . While the throttle body is out , drill out the screws that hold the large throttle plate in , and slide the throttle plate out . It 's only there to create vacuum to make the EGR system work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throttle plate , and you 'll get easier starting . Only draw back is engine shut down will be a little more rough . Most diesels do n't have throttle plates . Re-install the throttle body and manifold . <p> - Install a catch can to keep crud from going back into the turbo/intake . <p> - Install a boost gauge , and install an ebay manual boost controller on the turbo . Boost to 12psi max with no intercooler , and 16psi max with intercooler . <p> - A good water to air intercooler system will yield a very happy engine , and probably 20% more power on warm days . I 'm in the process of installing a water to air system on mine right now ( I ca n't fit an air to air ) . Once the intercooler is on , you can boost up to 16psi , and safely increase fuel to match . <p> - Buy a flange off ebay , and fabricate a 2.5 " or 3 " dump pipe . Hook it up to a free flowing 2.5 " exhaust system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power as well as much lower EGTs . I 'm also in the process of this . <p> - The 2lte runs too rich from factory , which creates dangerous EGTs and wastes fuel . An easy way to trick the computer to add less fuel is here : LONG ... I 've done this and it works great . My truck barely smokes and makes good power . <p> - Finally , if you really want to find the ideal tune , you can control base injection advance and base fuel quantity by changing the correction resistors on the side of the injection pump . I 've connected a couple of potentiometers in place of the correction resistors ( I 've connected directly to the ECU in the vehicle ) , and have gained great power by tweaking them . By default the 2lte is tuned for low emissions ( retarded timing ) and runs overly rich to compensate for the low power . Advancing the timing by a couple degrees makes the thing pull good and way more efficient . Be careful not to over advance , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also increase fuel by the spill control valve . You have to remove a metal cap on top of the pump and can turn it to increase or decrease fuel by a 1/4 turn at a time .

So , the next thing that needs to be done is cut the pushrod on the clevis down by 100mm . <p> After cutting the rod down , I used a bench grinder and tapered the end of the rod to fit the new master . <p> The old master had the brake lines come in from the top . The new one has the lines go in from the bottom so I used this handy little cutter to snip some line away . NOTE**** One line on our cars goes to the rear and one to the front brakes . This is OPPOSITE on the new master cylinder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd remember where they need to go . It is stamped " R " and " F " on both masters . <p> Now maneuver the lines where you need them . I use this tool . <p> Debur the lineds and use a METRIC double flare tool on the stock lines . THIS IS IMPORTANT ! The stock lines are a 5mm double flare NOT 3/16 " using 3/16 flaring tool will not result in a centered flare and may damage the flares in the new master . Bubble flares are also no good . Jet and hastings make cheap metric flare kits . <p> Here I use the 5mm mandrel to set the tube depth . <p> Then insert the mandrel into the pipe and squish ! <p> Remove the mandrel and squish again using the flare press . <p> Hooray !

Replacing a master with a 13/16 bore AND a vac booster with s 13/16 bore master resulted in a ' normal ' feeling pedal ? !

I swapped in a 1 " bore master and no booster , for T3/T4 fitment . I do n't  recall the specs , but I believe it 's a 4Runner or FJ .

What I have gleaned so far is it is a GT Apex with a Automatic Transmission and a Red and Black colour scheme but I ca n't seem to see how they determine if it is a Levin or Trueno , The car was a Levin at one time but was wondering if is a conversion or factory .. <p> Cheers , <p> Steve <p> you 're as confused as we are ... so the car was a Levin at one time , so is it a Trueno now ? Or was it a Trueno then a Levin then a Trueno again ? or is it still a Levin ? lol <p> DiscoQuinn <p> 03-17-2011 , 06:07 PM <p> looks like it 's a Levin from some reasearch .

Sounds like the car was in an accident ... good luck finding a Levin front end if you 're going to keep it a Levin . <p> Even if you put a GTS front end ... just register it as a Levin , that way when you find a front or IF you do , you can swap it back . <p> BotDoc <p> 03-18-2011 , 02:29 PM <p> Exactly I know it was a Levin but I want to know what it came from the factory as . We are all very good at conversions and modifying so has this car been modifyied ? or is it a Levin from factory . <p> Cheers , <p> Steve <p> REN69 <p> 03-18-2011 , 02:47 PM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it came with that front end from Japan . <p> mike-nametaken <p> 03-18-2011 , 09:54 PM <p> would n't it have some bracket for the headlights if it was converted to a levin ? 
@@8344688 @1544688/ @qwx111434 <p> If you they are really giving you some crap , take a pipe and " roll " the lips of the tire so that instead of the sides being concave , they are bowing outward . It makes it easier to get a tight bead sealed onto the rim . <p> You can fit any size tire to any rim you want . But is it the recommended size tire for the wheel ? Read the manufacturers tire specifications . 185-60-14 is usually not a recommended size for a 14 x 7 rim , maximum is usually 6.5 inch . 195-60-14 max is 7 inches . The Tire manufacturer designs the tire , do you know more than them ? <p> If the tire is for show and your driving slow it probably does not matter . But if you drive around and the tire blows out and you crash and burn , the tire manufacture is blameless , the insurance company will say wrong size tire on wheel you lose , the tire install company says you want it you got it and will waive responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print and take your chances . <p> yea it 'll fit , i do n't  know what kind of tire you got but i mounted 185/60/14 on supra rims myself using 2 prybars and help of my bro in my GARAGE so many times ! ! ! it got to a point where we could mount 1 tire in 5min. 
@@8344689 @1544689/ @qwx111434 <p> Would a welded diff be better than an open diff for winter driving ( in a 84 cressida ) ? Any experiences ? <p> an open diff is pretty much better in any situation , other than drifting . welded diffs are locked all the time , and will want to chirp and skid in any sort of tight turn , wet weather , snow , etc . <p> a welded diff , however , may be able to get you un-stuck in the snow- where as a open diff may leave you with one tire spinning . a welded diff will just require more attention when driving on slippery surface . <p> I remember when Ian had the 2way in his corolla during the winter when I came to buy that red corolla in 2001 ... and he could n't get out of a parallel parking spot , when he turned the wheels all the way to the left and pulled forward the tight LSD just pushed his car straight forward ... it was funny . <p> but back on topic ... in the city I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little snow , it 's manageable to handle the continuous oversteer . BUT if your doing a lot of freeway/highway driving , it can be pretty scary to have your back end wander out at 100kph in the snow in traffic ... but running a welded diff with studded snows would be decent . or use an oem lsd from the supra <p> I do n't have a welded but I have tightly shimmed LSD I use in the snow . Personally I love it ... however you have to be ready for each turn , if you just brake and turn the car will plow you HAVE to get the back end out . It freaks other people out around you though ... if you are not extremely comfortable behind the wheel leave it open and get some good snowies . Just as a safety thing for yourself and those driving around you . <p> I would leave it open . Locking up the rear can cause a push in poor traction conditions , and imagine if your car was sitting on a slight angle , as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end is going to slide into the ditch ( or where ever gravity is taking it ) , instead of that one non-spinning tire holding it in place . Especially with your inexperience , leave it open so you are n't swapping ends at every turn in bad weather . <p> i 'm totally for welding the diff , you have way more control and can get unstuck a whole lot easier when more than just one wheel is spinning in the snow . the last winter we had i was running open diff and i got stuck probably 10x more often than when i ran my welded diff. but yea , you really ca n't suck at driving . going down the snow-covered highway at 50-60kph at full lock going in a straight line keeping up with traffic is n't for everyone . <p> WELDED , my winter beater is welded , it is best , more under than oversteer . WITH winter tires . With out winters I do n't  know , why bother ? just stay home . Welded is not realy noticable , with snow tires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on allseasons and welded would be interesting . <p> when i had the welded diff on the daily , i was running all-seasons . when i had open diff , i had winter tires. i was more comfortable welded/all-season , go figure . keep in mind that it IS very slippery in vancouver WHEN we get snow and we 've been getting a good amount of snow in the last few years . <p> Too bad 1.5 way mechanical LSD is n't an option .... would probably be the best idea in my humble opinion . &gt;&gt; <p> or an SL1 swap . lol What does it have to do with this situation ? Jeremy Clarkson says power is everything ..... so that must be the best option . <p> Seriously thought , my understanding is that for highway driving you want an open diff and snowies so you are n't going sideways at 100 . Not that you should be doing a 100 in the snow ..... If you are n't highwaying it a lot , then you can go welded because you will be able to get unstuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow tires . I tried not using snows and off of idle my car 's back end went whichever way the road tilted even a very slight angle . <p> With snows the only times I got stuck was when I ended up in a snow bank or tried to drive over 2 foot + snow drifts without enough speed . Every time I could get out with a couple of people pushing though . Never found any trouble driving on the highway at all , usually passed all the people freaking out about the few inches of snow . Also helps to put more weight in the back of your car , couple of cinder blocks or sand bags etc . <p> I found it no problem at speed either ( with winter tires ) I just put a couple wheels and tires in the trunk for balast . Do what you feel safest with , If you are trying to learn to drift , then a welded diff will make you smile . If you drive a corolla because its cool , just get some winter tires.

Does it have the " remote " type of shifter like the late r154/v160 's ? What about the input shaft length and spline count ? And also what years of Taco 's did they come in ? ( or what other trucks ? ) <p> That is what I am running . Same strength as an R154 , but much lower price . The input shaft is a fair bit shorter than the 154 . Look at my build for some pics of it with shifter location . Any 2wd V6 truck had them . I bought the whole truck with a rebuilt tranny for $300 . <p> Wow your Volvo is coming along nicely since I last looked at the thread ! It looks like the tail shaft is slightly shorter then an R154 ?

That might make it alot easier/harder to swap . You can get put alot of Toyota manual transmssion 's behind both engines . The GS400 will be harder to find bellhousings and clutchs , but would be a better engine if you 're only looking for around 300hp . <p> Originally Posted by Rokubes <p> Is 20 pounds for the weight like 30 if a guy lifts ? <p> No gym for home , work out floor with 30 , but is it for 20 like 30 lb when you no lift it to be for men , for 30 lbs instead ? or half is 10 for 20 pounds ? <p> Ya sorry meant the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore though since as much as I want a Toyota its looking like from a logical stand point a 240 is going to be better for me at least initially . <h> Regarding swapping the V8 to stick <p> You ca n't get any manual trans behind a 1UZ from the factory . One of the few , maybe only Toyota to come with a UZ and a manual transmission was the Middle East spec landcruiser . That transmission wo n't fit in a car , and the flywheel is too big to use with the normal toyota transmissions. the bellhousing does n't swap to any other transmission either <p> I 'm collecting parts to swap my SC400 over to stick . <p> Custom bellhousings are available from New Zealand and Australia . The NZ dollar is crap right now , which works in our favor . Most of them use a pivot point similar to factory and allow a regular push clutch . Another option available is an adapter that uses the factory V8 bellhousing and adapts that to a manual transmission . Also available from Australia and NZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Downfall of these is that they need a hydraulic throwout bearing . PITA to set up , and they are n't cheap . Option 3 is an adapter that goes between the engine and the bellhousing . It 's made in the states . It ai n't cheap , but by the time a bellhousing from NZ is shipped here , it ai n't so bad . That particular adapter uses a JZ bellhousing . That means V , W , and R transmission . If using a W , it 's a good bet , seen as you do n't have to fork out for a JZ bellhousing for an R154 . This style adapter uses whatever factory clutch release setup the bellhousing has . <p> Now that the trans is bolted to your engine , you 'll need a flywheel . <p> Available from quartermaster in the US ( I think ) but it 's a tiny diametre multiplate clutch . Not cheap and no good for street use . Also in the US , someone re-drills V6 flywheels . The bolt holes are oversized so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole . Shoulder bolts from early 3S flywheels are used . Option 3 is again , Australia and New Zealand , where there are several options . <p> Aside from the bellhousing and flywheel , it ai n't so bad . One issue you might have is gearshift position . i forget who in the states extends the shift position on the trans. same guys who sell parts for JZ into 240 conversions . <p> Ya I figured all of that , only thing i was wondering about really was the drive shaft/rear axel , since i checked the wheelbase and the GS is considerably longer then the Supra . <p> when you pick a trans , see if the person selling can get a driveshaft with it . <p> Search around a bit on the net . The right combo of front and rear driveshaft pieces could result in the correct driveshaft length . that 's the case for the SC <p> MK III Supra front piece bolts up to the rear piece of an SC , and it makes the correct length . <p> One thing to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a V160 6 speed , you 'll need to swap the diff too , and most likely the housing that it sits in . Using a V160 with a stock diff ratio from the GS , you 're going to be doing a lot of rpm on the hwy and have a uselessly short first and second gear . <p> The R154 is strong and has ratios that were a close match to the auto in my SC . More specifically , 5th gear in the R was close to 4th gear in the auto box .

@@8344710 @1544710/ @qwx111434 <h> Fuel Pump Not Priming When Ignition On AE86 <p> The car had this problem before I replaced the seized fuel pump so since then , I did some research and it all pointed to me to the " circuit opening relay " behind the speaker on the passenger side . <p> I took it out and rip it apart to clean the points but even then its still the same , only the fuel pump works when I push the flap on the AFM . Other thing is when i 'm revving , you can hear the relay clicking on and off real quick as the flap in the afm closes and opens again . I also seen the diagram and checked every fuse in the car . <p> One thing I noticed is when I had the relay apart , I saw a capacitor in there , so do you think that 's bad ? Should I replace it ? or is it the ecu that 's the problem ? <p> It runs great , just takes forever to start because of low comp and no ing priming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work if I jump it by the diagnostic box . I think the capacitor in the relay may have went bad like in a turn signal relay . I 'll take it out again and check it with a meter to be sure and maby test some pins out . Also I see that 's there one wire coming from the ecu , do you think that could be the problem ? <p> that 's not how it works ..... the ecu has a bunch of fail safes and most people do n't understand this and bypass it by running 12v to the pump . you 're not fixing the problem , you 're ignoring it . unlike Hondas and even later toyotas , these cars almost never have a main relay or open circuit break down , I would n't rule it out but I 'd say its highly unlikely . what would be more likely is a faulty sensor or ground . take a perfectly running 86 , unplug the temp sensor and tell me how easily it will start . check the codes first , and again .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot ? also invest in a multimeter , they 're dirt cheap and you can check for continuity and resistance <p> Its hard to start even when hot but I need to know were the sensor is located so i can find it , I checked the relay and its all fine so that 's not the problem . For the codes , the ecu is not throwing an engine light so sensor might be ok since the motor has only 115psi across all cylinders but ill check the sensor anyways once I find it . <p> There are two parts to the relay . There is the mechanical switch in the AFM that closes the circuit to drive the COR . For starting there is also a B/W wire from the starter circuit that energizes the relay while cranking only . Check ground continuity at the W/B wire at the COR and check for 12V at B/W wire at COR while cranking . Also listen for the electromagnet switch in the COR to " click " when cranking <p> it looks like yours is an 86 - 87 kouki model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the firewall there 's a diagnostics box . turn your key to the on position then jump the terminals ' te1 ' to ' e1 ' then look at your dash , if there are no codes it 'll blink consistently , otherwise it 'll blink in sequences

Remember to fit it in above the swaybar , then turn it into place . Try not to allow the wet FIPG to touch anything . - carefully have your helper retract his/her hand . You have 5-10 seconds to put the pan in place before the windage tray falls down . <p> - at this point , assembly is the reverse of disassembly I &lt;3 love saying that .

The second pipe pulls in . Plug it and its good to go . Also , Nasty NA stuff can have the same effect from reversion do to big over lap , but pretty rare to run into that wild of setups . If there banging around , they can also set off knock sensors . Common on the new sensitive **** like Subaru . <p> Maxx . Your right for the most part . O2 sensors are actually temp sensors in basic terms . So on rotarys , were heat is in the 1800 degree range comapaired to 1500 , they should be a little father down stream to get accurate readings . This is also why most dyno widebands read just air ( 22.3 ) at idle .

I 'm the guy who built and owns the 2az-fe AE86 built from mainly stock parts in Australia . <p> Taka Aonos version uses a Nascar transmission that 's an expensive custom item and his motor was built by Hasselgren , who generally build formula atlantic engines as evidenced by the custom valve cover finish . Its next level stuff , highly boosted 500ft/lb and 500hp plus . <p> I just wanted to fit one to a corolla chassis and try to do it on mainly stock Toyota stuff . It appeals to be because I do n't  mind doing extra work to keep it in the Toyota Family . Its basically about as hard as a fairly common fwd to rwd gen 1/2/3 3sge conversion is , which is reasonably common , with a couple of extra things to consider along the way . Its a challenge to do your own research at the self service wrecker rather than rely on other peoples ideas and patterns of thought . Its service weight is no more than a 4age , maybe even a touch less , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy I can put a bc stroked 2.6 litre motor in and go nuts , although NA appeals more than boost as I 'm more of a purist about the ae86 ( even if that sounds contradictory ) . I wanted a car that handled and steered like an ae86 should , with great torque response and some revvy character to the engine . The 2az is a passenger car engine with a lot of low down grunt to haul you and your family around in a Camry . It is a bit happier at higher revs than an rz engine , it suits the NA screamer punching above its weight ideals of the ae86 more than bigger and heavier truck motors , even if hp/l is potentially greater in a steel blocked rz , I care more about potential hp/kg , and the 2az has this in spades . The car does n't need 800 hp to do what I want to do with it as I 'm not trying to get too far away from the feel of the original . <p> Complex Problems : Starter motor location . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side ala camry series . Has a large aluminium sandwich plate to connect to the transmission that blocks all access from traditional rwd locations . Unknown bell housing pattern or if any rwd tranny suits . <p> Motor has interference issues with the throttle body pointing the wrong way and hitting the firewall with engine mounted . Unmodifiable high temp plastic manifold . <p> Motor leans towards inlet side in stock car but leans the other way 9 degrees ish when rotated and mated rwd . Oil pickup level changes . Sump drain not correct . <p> Very close to/touches top of firewall/tunnel union area . <p> Steering interference to clutch slave on required bell housing . <p> Shifter position a bit forwards of t50 stock position . <p> No engine mount bolt holes with thread anywhere <p> Stock belt system includes an extra 2 devices as I deleted AC and power steering from the motor . This creates interference issues where the belt wants to travel through the tensioner . <p> Solutions/Mods required to adapt it all and fit to chassis <p> Bellhousing was simlar to S motors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GR . I decided to use Y bell as I had the S as well baut it put the starter on the hot side and in a location that interfered with the main structural bolts holding the motor together . Y placed it on the inlet side and in some superfluous metal that could be trimmed . I drilled , chipped and flap disced a spot for the starter to bolt in . There was only the dowels locating the housing and maybe one bolt . I drilled through and tapped a couple holes on the block and bell in turn and was able to get about a 5 bolt union that I was happy with . I had to make a couiple of plates and close up some redundant inspection holes on the union at the engine side . <p> 2azfe flywheel was machined down to fit the smaller Y ring gear and to save weight and to let the native location of the starter on the Y housing locate it in accordance with the ring gear . This natively gave the correct engagement and tooth set angle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the correct face to face distance from starter to ring gear . My first attempt ( 4 washers precisely worked out fine and remains in place to this day ) . Flywheel is well under 10kgs now , it think , I can not really remember but its in my rollaclub thread if you care to read it . The 2az flywheel was retained as it has a unique bolt pattern at the crank and the economics and reliability of redrilling a flywheel is not ideal . Hence the decision to machine it down to suit a starter/bellhousing set from a stock vehicle . <p> The stock 9 inch camry clutch was used that came with the motor originally . I 've slipped it once pretty hard . Otherwise its been fine , held up great especially at the drag strip . I needed the clutch shop top make a custom throwout bearing carrier to adapt the distance offset by the odd fwd rwd mating of surfaces , so the throwout bearing is also way bigger than the Toyota parts that would generally operate this clutch , I think its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all as recommended by NPC , a pretty well loved shop here in Brisbane that does excellent clutch system engineering . I used a wider double row pilot bearing and tapped it to an ideal depth without seating it allt he way , and this perfectly adapted the nose of the input shaft to the motor . <p> The belts were re routed slightly by modifying the tensioner to accept a stud and a different pulley . The belt then was set with a rose jointed arm that turn-buckle adjusts . A custom post was turned on a lathe to hold the lower edge . This clears the path along with some further relief of metal on the tensioner bracket itself to adjust the belt and have it function correctly . The idler pulley was swapped to a back of belt pulley to a grooved 7pk unit to allow the belt to wrap around the other side . Diagrams can be found in my rollaclub thread . <p> Mounts were custom and picked up some holes that I tapped on the block , Hot side is really wierd looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low bolt hole and is cutaway to clear the disptick , the other side has a 3 bolt pattern as you would hope for . <p> Used cusco ae86 engine rubber mounts . <p> Made an itb manifold to suit the 20v itbs . Used Ross machine racing ( USA ) flange on the motor side and sam Q(Australia) made me the flange that spaced the throttles 10mm apart and modified my inks for me . I had a local alloy welding guru weld it up . Mick from Exotic exhaust . I hand formed the port transitions from alloy bullbar tube . SamQ supplied trumpets for me which he makes to custom specifications . Mine are 98mm plus they have 8mm spacers under them . Longer seems better . Total inlet length is about 340mm to valve I think . <p> Has a modified ra65 gearbox cross member to adapt the tranny in . Uses shortened mx13 auto tail shaft that came with the diff and had the correct w57 manual spline for some reason . Its one piece still with the stock 40 year old rubber join intact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a few benefits . Keeps gearbox dead level . Allows longer inlet with less interference with clutch and brake master . Straightens out the early part of the exhaust slightly . Makes the motor more natively fit into the deepest part of the firewall . Reminds me of the old K motor in the previous corollas , which traditionally slants left , although much more than this . <p> Sump was hand formed with a slide hammer and custom anvil recess to accept a new location for the oil pickup screen and drain bung . Dipstick was remarked at approximately double the level of original based off a dry oil fill and engine rotation to prime motor and filter . To achieve a new oil pickup location I custom designed a new oil pickup that I did a sloppy job planning but somehow got correct flange orientation first go . It was made from heavy steel steam pipe and welded by professional pipe welders at a boat engine shop . I faced the flanges and ported the pipe and polished the seam from the inside to enhance flow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have not had a pressure loss while driving in any event or terrain , so it seems to work perfectly . <p> littleredspirit <p> 03-26-2016 , 08:48 PM <p> The bit where it touched the tunnel top edge was simply relief cut slightly , hammered inwards a bit to create the required clearance , and then patch welded over the 2 splits . <p> Clutch slave was modified by being ground to sit lower and at a slight angle and the bleeder shortened to clear the steering . I do n't  recall what it was off but there are at least 3 designs of slaves to suit the Y housings over the years , i just found one that did n't  stick forwards too far and I cant remember what it was off . Clutch works great though . <p> Its a registered road car and was easy to pass as with no weight penalty the need for brake upgrades and chassis stiffening are negated . This bypasses a lot of the BS you can get caught up in when registering a modified car for road use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half cage welded in . <p> Have great mates who helped a lot , and some great people on rollaclub to chat about things with that have been playing corollas for decades . <p> Happy to answer questions <p> jewbaka421 <p> 03-27-2016 , 08:33 AM <p> Looks pretty sweet in there . What is that clear tubing for ? <p> littleredspirit <p> 03-27-2016 , 08:54 PM <p> The breather to an oil catch can that I horizontally mounted .

The rear end , I am assuming , is from the ' 73 Corolla with a standard diff and drum brakes .

Anybody out there have a complete rear end ( for the car ! ) they desperately have to , or want to , part with ?

Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated . <p> Welcome to the boards ! Yeah T-series powered super 7 's are very common .

They are saying it will be a member style track , I fear that of the the proposed track in the okanogan . That said it sounds promising that with proper planning and a business plan I may have something setup with them allowing other events to take place on there grounds . Everything is very loose right now but I 'm going to be meeting with them in awhile . 
@@8344726 @1544726/ @qwx111434 <h> Birch 's RA21 GTS <p> A new thread on my 73 Celica project . <p> Started with a 73 Celica my father-in-law gave me . It had been sitting on his acerage for years and the rockers were completely rotted out . Aside from that and a few dents and surface rust , it was in surprisingly good shape . <p> My plans for the car changed several times . Everything from a VG30T to 4AGTE to 22RTE transplants , even a AWD conversion . I finally settled on a mild , modern autocrosser featuring mostly AE86 components . <p> First off , I stripped it down to a bare shell and stripped the entire interior and undercarriage of rust . I coated the new metal with POR15 , followed by truck bedliner . <p> Cut out the rockers and replaced them with 2 X 4 steel , 1/8 " thick , and welded it into the rear subframe . Also stitch welded the interior crossmembers . <p> The rear suspension was stripped and refinished with POR15 and then converted to rear disks using AE86 parts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sports were fitted . An adjustable T3 Panhard and all new Poly bushings hold it all in place with new Grade 8 bolts . Rebuilt calipers are fed by Braided stainless lines , and AE86 E-brake cables are fitted . I still have to weld brackets for the AE86 rear sway bar and traction brackets to correct the geometry . I also have a Cusco 1.5 way LSD waiting to go in . <p> Front suspension was refinished using AE86 struts with Koni Sport inserts and Megan drop springs . Everything was , again , stripped , refinished and loaded with new Poly bushings , ball joints and Grade 8 bolts . New AE86 rotors , calipers , master cylinder , proportioning valve and SS brakelines , as well as new hardline finish up the brake system . I have T3 camber plates that will be installed after the car passes insurance inspection . <p> The engine bay was cleaned up and resprayed with Tremclad Flat Black , as was the interior . <p> A new wiring harness replaces the 30+ year old factory harness , adding a couple circuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some gauges are controlled by the new chassis harness . The engine will run off a seperate harness in case I want to change motors somewhere down the road . <p> The steering column from an AE82 was welded to the Celica dropbracket for use with the AE82 manual steering rack , which is a perfect width for the narrow RA21 . AE86 inner tie rods were paired with shortened and fully threaded outer tie rods . and a custom crossmember was required . I made the crossmember with 1 X 2 box steel and 3/16 mounting plates . <p> Placement of the steering rack , combined with the RA21 crossmember and the 4age oil pan , demanded a custom pan for proper fit . I cut the bottom off the 4AGE pan and bent up some sheet steel to form the new mid-sump pan . The finished pan was sprayed with bedliner . I still have n't solved the issue of how to modify the dipstick for accurate reading . <p> Next up was new motor mounts to set the 4AGE in place of the retired 18R . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found some new mounts using poly bushings while I was gathering parts for my 4runner 's engine rebuild . I made the crossmember side of the mounts using 2 X 2 box steel and 3/16 plate . The passenger side cast mount on the 4AGE block was too long to allow the engine to sit level so I made a new shorter one . The engine now sits low and level in the bay , and is a lot lighter than the 18R . It will be interesting to see what the weight balance is like when It 's done . <p> Rollin 's got a set of those wheels for sale , that you depict in your artists rendition .. <p> Thanks for the heads up , but I 'm short on the funds atm and I 'm pretty happy with the turbines for now . Also got a blown turbo motor , 22RTE , for the 4runner . My rebuilt 22RE will come complete with kung fu grip + boost in the semi near future . Too many projects .... <p> Bit of progress on the steering rack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate and cut out sections of the frame rail so the plate could be inset and sit flush with the cross member flanges . There are two layers of steel sandwiched to make up the frame rail in that section and I will be adding gussets to tie the rack plates into the engine cross member 's rear bolt , on top of the frame rail . This car should be stiff as hell after all this . <p> Need to put in the engine again to check clearance from the oil pan , but measurements say I 'll have over 1/2 " clearance between the pan and the rack . Now to make a shaft from rack to column without interfering with the starter or exhaust <p> Also found a supplier in England for universal steering rack boots that are made out of really stretchy rubber . They cost 23 Pounds shipped as opposed to the $65 for a set of plastic aftermarket boots here in Canada . www.bailcast.com <p> No part # , they are universal . I got them already but I ca n't comment on fitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . They are very pliable though and come with a cone thing to stretch them over to fit on the rack . I 'll post pics when I get around to it in a couple weeks . <p> Finished the steering rack mount by welding the plates into the frame . Seems to be very solid and rigid . Now I need to decide what to do with the column and shaft running from column to rack . The Corolla column I was planning to use has clearance issues with the brake pedal so I 'm considering an aftermarket ( Flaming River or something similar ) column . The Bailcast rack boots fit great were easy to install . <p> Started work on a Ninja-chic e-brake . Not sure if I 'll actually use it but its a fun little project . <p> Not much time for car stuff lately but I got a bit done on labour day . Decided to go with the column from my 4runner parts truck , it 's almost exactly the same length as the Celica column . Picked up some u-joints from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiem joint and the hacked up 4runner shaft to join the rack to column . Had to offset it a bit to keep the u-joints in the 30 degree range and also to clear the 4age starter . 4 turns lock to lock on the AE82 rack , and everything seems smooth .

I only want to post here a short version build thread of my actual AE86 . Not so many people here ( in Canada ) know about the amazing 2RZ/3RZ engines . So my goal is to show you there is another swap possibility you can consider . These engines are very popular in US ... mostly in professionnal drag racing . Many RWD cars are swapped with RZ engines . The two main aftermarket suppliers are LC-Engineering and Paradise Racing . <p> So let 's start with the car . It 's a Corolla SR5 1987 . I bought it in 2007 december , from an old lady that bought it new . When I get it ; it had 78,000 km on the clock . <p> 78000km ! nice score ! what numbers are you hitting with the 3rz setup ?

I think everyone here is dying to hear about the RZ setup <p> At this moment , I wanted to change to something more bullet-poof , and able to bolt to a transmission stronger than the T50 . The last few years , I was breaking 3 trannies by year ... always destroying the 2nd gear . I was now annoyed by the low torque and narrow powerband engines ... and I was also really missing the wide powerband from my old Supra 's . Even if I love JZ engines and know them well , I did not wanted to swap a six cylinders ... just wanted to stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it run . <p> A friend called me because he needed help to do the wiring of his new swap in his 84 4Runner . I saw that ugly motor with a strange intake manifold ! I was now curious to know more about RZ engines . So I did some research on the internet . I was very impressed by the power output potential of the RZ engines ( 2RZ : 2,4L and 3RZ : 2.7L ) , and discovered that there was many performance aftermarket support . <p> Due to a frame recall ; there is many Tacoma/4Runner in the junkyards . So the engines are not expansive , and come with a W59 transmission . Because it 's a truck tranny , the gearing is not ideal for a sport car ... but I knew the bellhousing would bolt-on directly to a W58 tranny . The W59 have very short 1st and 2nd gear , and fall too low in rpm when shifting 3rd gear . Then , the 5th gear is not ideal for highway cruising/high speed . The W58 is simply all the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> well , bullet proof and proper headgasket and such would have prevented the other failures perhaps . just a mistake , not so much a bad motor per say . RZ is more bullet proof though , and wider powerband and torque . <p> well , bullet proof and proper headgasket and such would have prevented the other failures perhaps . just a mistake , not so much a bad motor per say . RZ is more bullet proof though , and wider powerband and torque . <p> Not saying 4AG are bad engines ... I owned at least 10 4AG in the past 15 years ! lol They are really fun to hear and to rev . Some lasted longer ( up to five years ) , and others less longer ( one weekend ) ... and at the end , no one survived . I keep very good memories with all those 4AG/7AG ... but they were not anymore what I wanted in my car . Just wanted something different . <p> Test-fitting the engine to know which modif should be made to clear everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hole was made to fit the T50 shifter . The W58 shifter ( from a Celica-Supra ) is a little advanced , but the shift knob is in the right position . A W58 from a MK3 Supra would have the shifter base 2 inches backward . <p> There is more than one method to fit the motor mounts . Most people modify the subframe to clear the sump like this : <p> At this moment ; I did not wanted to go this way . So I had to put the motor a little about 2 inches forward . The downside was the crank pulley was interfering with the front sway bar . But since I did not need the power-steering pump , I removed ( de-bolted ) the front part of the crank pulley . On the other hand , putting the engine a little forward permitted the stock down-pipe to clear the fire-wall/floor . <p> So I welded plates on the subframe to bolt the stock RZ motor mounts . Because the 3RZ is about one inch taller than the 2RZ , and because I use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subframe near 2 inches with spacers . Anyways , the RCA/NRCA put the lower conrol arms in the ' ' same ' ' angle than before . <p> The 3RZ oil pan has an extra hump on the bottom that sticks down way too low in a car ! So I bought a 2RZ sump with onl pick-up at the Junk-yard for 60$ . It was bolt-on . <p> Now that the subframe is lowered , I needed to lower the tranny mount ... and also the driving-shaft center bearing . The W tranny use the exact same mount/bushing than the SR5 auto tranny . So it is also possible to use the SR5 auto tranny crossmember . The SR5 auto tranny slip-yoke fits exactly in the W tranny output shaft . I used a complete driving-shaft from a Celica-Supra , it was bolt-on . <p> I bought the intake manifold/throttle-body teflon gasket set . Teflon heat isolator kit keep the power-robbing heat away from the intake air by keeping the heat out of the intake manifold , so the incoming air is cooler . <p> wait .... so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotating assembly ... and then buy steelies in wide sizing ? whatever you may have lost in weight , you gained back ten fold with those rolling rocks

@@8344737 @1544737/ @qwx111434 <h> Interesting Engine Swap Idea 's for my 75 Celica ? <p> My 75 Celica needs more power . It currently has a 20R with Mikuni side draught carbs , header , and exhaust . It is decently fast as is , but constant carb/ignition problems associated with a 35 year old car are starting to get me down . The car is very competitive at autocross , but I 've missed too many events this year due to the car being broken . Time for a change . <p> The first ( and most realistic option ) is to fuel inject the 20R with megasquirt . I 'd get to stay in FSP with a nice PAX factor . The celica works awesome in FSP , PAXing #1 out of 65 cars at Super Slalom last summer , so it would be nie to keep it in FSP . <p> However , the allure of something different is compelling . 1UZ would be awesome in this tiny muscle car . The $1000 cost of a custom bellhousing and flywheel is a big turn off though . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is light , revvy , moves the weight back in the engine bay . But what RWD tranny 's does it bolt to ? Prob needs a custom bellhousing too . <p> 3RZ ? 177lb/ft , 150hp stock ( according to wikipedia ) .. still some fab work to be done , but less space concerns than a 1uz swap .. I 've seen it done in an RA4x before .. expect there 's at least a couple 1st gens running around with them .. <p> One of my favourite cars in this forum has to be Paul 's Mango , and as of now , I daydream a lot about old cars with period correct mods . I forgot if you can stroke in Prepared class . Would be rad to have a 25R frankenstein engine ( stroked and bored a lot ) In any case , Cams Carbs and Compression definitely would be mondo fun . FOr better drivability , ditch carb for computer - still in keeping with the triple C 's . Lastly , it 's right up your alley too ! Been with Toyotas forever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would totally discourage you from mad swaps . It would put you in an unfavourable pax . Go mad scientist and you 'll end up something something mod . SM if you keep interior . EM if you do n't . You might be fast , but you 'll hate yourself once someone shows up with an open wheeler . Well , actually Gord usually shows up with an open wheeler , but you still clean up . <p> all said and done a 1uz with a 5spd behind it , in your car and running without any labour included but " done right " would be about 5-7k <p> i 've got about 3500 into having a complete and properly working engine , 1100 into the bellhousing and flywheel , 600 for a clutch , 600 for driveshafts , 500 for headers , another 600 for decent exhaust , then there 's belts , air intake plumbing , wiring fuel pump , fuel hoses to convert to EFI etc etc <p> I personally think the 4agze block would be sufficient for the APPLICATION . Looking at the work involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its needed based on what you may be using the car for . The 4AGZE is easy , and you can turbo this block ( sseing as how its a bit stronger than a regular 4age ) . <p> With this said , I should also say that I know nothing about your classic and what you use it for , but I think that looking for the best bang for buck option would be best suited in this case ....

I think I could stay in FSP that way . <p> If only the 1UZ were readily available with a manual tranny . Life would be much easier . Heck , if toyota would have used some of its other cool engines with a longitudinal orientation with a man trans , life would be much easier too . <p> Anyways , with all of that said , I do remember seeing a RA60 celica with 18RG at an autocross event when I was 12 years old . That was 20 years ago . A guy I know knows where the car is now ( I think its been sitting on a farm or something for a looong time ) . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to get that info from him . The 18RG is one of those engines that would put me in a ridiculous class for autocross and not have much of a performance gain over my 20R , but would be very cool ( and era specific ) to have . It probably would n't solve my celicas current carb and ignition problems though . : P <p> if you also want i have very good lead on a very cheap 2jz with 5spd out of a sc300 that was hit in the rear . car belonged to jared petryk ( sp ? ) gold colored rear driver 1/4 got backed into by a semi trailer while parked <p> for hp to weight . ls1. it weighs less than your 22r. often came with a manual transmission , and would produce ludicrous power . <p> if you wan na stick with 4 cylinders. do a turbo 3tc. or a good turbo 4age. there is a reason i 'm sticking with this platform .. for the power i want , this is the lightest cost effective platform avaliable ... and bolts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the more common 4 cylinders ) the typical limiting factor is there are only four rods and 4 pistons , therefore we are limited in hp production by the strength of these rods and pistons. as these are prone to failure before any other part of the engine under boost and revs. i say put a good set of pistons and reasonable headgasket into a lightweight platform and aim for 250 hp. and do n't  ' break the bank with sillyness like .. OMFG the f20c revs to the moooooon. yeah . boat anchor . torque output to lbs , is so low , i could n't limbo that ratio with a broken back and my ex girlfriend sitting on my chest . <p> if I was drag racing , the 2JZ would be awesome ! HUGE power , but physically too large and heavy for the front of a classic celica . Handling would surely suffer . I saw pics of Jered 's SC300 on 306motorclub .... sad . <p> Probably too heavy , but a 3.0 or 3.2 Yamaha V6 from a SHO would be a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down they are about 400lbs though . Both are 220hp but the 3.2 has 15 more torque at 215ft/lbs . Would be a pretty involved swap , but has been done into a number of rwds .

Good luck . <p> thanks for all the replies so far ... have you ant pictures of them installed lads ? <p> I have an old fish net recaro and i put in it for mock up and i found the front part just under your knee is raised up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure before i lash out 300euro on a good set of seats ! ! <p> i removed the lower seat mount by drilling out two spot welds then cutting the rivets that hold them to the sliders . Then located where the holes should go on the rails/sliders and bolted the recaro seats on . On the inboard driver side bolt that holds the seat to the rail i used a longer bolt and shimmed it between the rail and the seat to accommodate the extra pressing in that side of the floor for the exhaust ... I 'll take a pic of it tonight . It sits lower than stock . <p> Thanks lads that 's a good help I 'm pretty sure they will be sittin high at the front wondering now could I shim the back to bring them up a bit . . . I.ll take a few measurements of my own and see how these ones compare . . . <p> I 'm going to paint the middle part black . They are a bit high honestly but that 's because i 'm using stock sliders &amp; brackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you take some time to modify them , it shoulnt be bad ! ! <p> Ok man thanks for that think I 'm more certain about what I 'm going to do now all posts are a great help . On painting the middle bit black I had some cool mats that were an awful shade of blue so brought them to a guy who lives right beside me who valets cars and he died them for me jet black maybe that be handier than painting or replacing them for ya <p> Should have some evo vii recaro 's home tomorrow guys , the ones with blue centre , grey and then black on outside . Will suit the interior of my Gtv as the original seats were blue grey and black ( going from bottom to top ) I 'll post up some pics tomorrow hopefully . . <p> Definitely let me know how the painting goes on your seats . . . I went to look at the seats which were supposed to be " perfect condition with no tears rips etc " but when I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hanging on by a thread such a waste of a 2 hour drive to see these . . . Waster . On the up side I should have some nice recaro srd 's lined up for less money and their black so prob will go down the route of dyeing or spraying my back seats black to match . . .

After a little while of messing with a magnet I decided to flip it over ... Hemi head so should dome and the washer should come out right ...

After taking out each rod and inspecting them , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all moves nice and smooth , curious indeed . Could it have come from the fuel pump ? The pumps cam lobe is somewhat scored . Ps : The washer came out . <p> The plot thickens . I removed the head and pulled each cam follower , all are fine . Push rod for number 4 exhaust valve is much more worn than any of the others , which leads me to believe it was the one that broke ... And it was replaced without removing the old broken parts from the pan . The cam lobe for that valve has some impressions in it , like it was tapped several times with a ball peen hammer , not so bad though and not chewed up ... I would have thought a failure like this would have damaged the sleeve that the follower sit in but it seems to move rather smoothly . The other thing that I found when removed the head is crazy domed pistons ...

I would not run aluminum on a 3tc. @qwx111435 <p> All M-series flywheels are 6-bolt . The 7M-GE and 7M-GTE use the same size input splines and I know people have interchanged the 7M-GE and 7M-GTE clutch discs .

Remember to heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it cool down very slowly by placing it in a fiberglass bag or something like that . <p> Cast Iron and steel should not be welded in the case of suspension . You can not see it but cast actually stretches on a molecular level to the point of being very brittle and ready to snap . <p> Instead , try making new steering arms using regular steel . You can cut a new arm out of some 1/2-3/4 " steel which will be very strong and you can make them to any length you want . But before doing so you may want to read up on the effects of ackerman angle . <p> QFT . <p> If you 're not a certified ( licensed ) welder , I would n't try it at all . <p> Answ3r where did yo uget that formula ? kinda comon sence once you have an idea of what you are looking at .

On a ae86 , it seems that going shorter than PS knuckles might be too short . I still need to mess with it more until I can conclude . <p> I just do n't feel like writing a super long theorical post as it would require technical drawings to be clear , and he probly would n't even listen ... I 'll still add a bit more info ... <p> The point is that the ackerman effects is not linear thru the whole movement of the steering . Since you are increasing maximum angle with spacers and other mods , you end up with way to much angular difference between both wheels . When shortening your knuckles , it 's important to move the tie rod pickup point close to the ball joint axis ( horizontally , in the direction perpendicular to which you are shortening ) . As I said in my last post , moving it from half the stock mesurement is a good rule of thumb . The exact optimal mesurement could be figured out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly in a 3D CAD software . <p> Drader , since you still have a KA in your S13 , I tend to believe that angle might not be holding you back that much since even at stock full lock a car slows down pretty quickly . If you are talking about small curves , maybe , but I 'd be surprised to see you drifting a high line in a bank at full lock ... <p> I spent a lot of time 2 winters ago messing with the length of steering arms , rack travel , the point at which the outer tierod conects , and rack placement . I did a lot of tacking stuff in place and then measuring of the wheel angle left vs right , at different amounts of lock . I got mine set up to be 5* ackerman at about 90% lock , the last 10% it increases a bunch , which is hard to get rid of due to the nature of the angles and arms . <p> I went as far as putting the left arm on the right side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting results , and HUGE angle , but way too much ackerman . <p> Depends on what it is , I made a trans adapter recently . But the copies I 'm getting made by someone else ( time/cost effective ) . Sometimes it 's cheaper/easier to buy it than DIY . <p> In any case , you can always copy . IF you look closely you 'll see they rotated the tie rod end mount point a little as well . In any case , goodluck with it . They 've got some good info in that post on how much they dropped the mount point vs stock , 3/4 " . <p> Just to dump it out there , I have never made any modifications to steering knuckles ... <p> But is n't Ackerman caused by the difference in the length of the steering rack ( pivot points on the ends of the tierods ) in comparison to the length from the tip ( pivoting point ) of each LCA ?

Just drill a hole closer and throw some spacer on the inner tie rods and do an alignment . **** the rest of this **** . Drive the car , and the wheels turn more .

@@8344753 @1544753/ @qwx111434 <h> Serendipity 's comprehensive AE86 Rear End swap . <p> While in the midst of searching for parts necessary for my 5 speed swap LONG ... my Dad and I found a late model ( Kouki ) GTS rear end . It was missing the Lines and Fittings , and was pretty rusty , but we decided to grab it . <p> PROJECT LENGTH JAN 2011-PRESENT <p> For helping me find parts , and for consultation , thanks be to : <p> Warren Pitobread Brian JayWhit DugWillis DiscoQuinn VISean <p> And thanks again to my Dad for his supervision and contribution to the project . <p> I brought the Rear End Assembly to Bullfrog Transmission , the shop that did a wonderful job of rebuilding my T50 . Unfortunately , the bearings were seized , and so they recommended that we take it to Thompson 's Machine Shop and have them handle the disassembly . Seized bearings are not uncommon for a factory Rear End that has n't had it 's axels removed . <p> Using their Hydraulic Puller and some heat , the Machine Shop was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Axles were in straight and in good shape . I also had them check the trueness of the bores . Why ? <p> I read the information on Wier Performance 's website , and called Spence to corroborate what I had read . He has seen many Toyota 6.7 " Rear Ends , and found that they occasionally have flaws in the trueness of the bores . The machine shop proved that the bores were true . <p> The next step was to Have Bullfrog Transmission tear down and inspect the Third Member . As it turns out , the Differential was in good condition . The Ring &amp; Pinion was also in good shape . However , both went to new homes as I wanted an LSD and a taller Final Gear . <p> The last bit of Machine work was done by Rod at Key 2 Auto . In days of Yore , that was the machine shop which Metro Toyota dealt with . Rod also did an excellent job with my cylinder head rebuild , and restoring my 4AC flywheel . I had him check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As the saying goes , " In Toyota we Rust . " Considering that there were bearing surfaces I did not wish to alter or damage by media blasting , I had Victoria Plating treat the parts in a " Pickling Tank " ; a tank with a solution corrosive enough to remove the oxides , but not the metal . <p> Since I would not be finishing the restoration right away I also had them Silver-Cadmium Plate the parts to prevent the from oxidizing . Doing so also coated the inside of the bearing surfaces , reservoir area , and threads , etc . " Thank you Captain Obvious " you say . Restoration is also about prevention . <p> Thinking ahead , I considered how I would clean up the Differential Housing &amp; Carrier , and whether I would Powder Coat or Paint it . I consulted Spence Wier . His advice was that Powder Coating would be best if the Rear End was going into a Show Car , but that it was best to Paint the Rear End of a Performance Car . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Differential would be best Powdercoated to protect it from all the debris it 's subject to , and that a Show Car would be better to paint , as you could easily repair it , and add a nice clear coat . I do however , understand what Spence means . In the hands of an inexperienced Powder-Coater you could be playing craps with your Diff Housing . <p> He went on to say that during the process of Powder Coating , the item to be coated is placed in an industrial oven to off-gas . If the company sets this temperature too high , the heat may relax the welds in the fabricated part of the housing , resulting in a warping . <p> In his experience , some Differential Housings had returned from the Powder Coating shop just fine , and some needed to be straitened ; it really depends on how hot the off-gas temperature is . <p> I called both local Powder Coating businesses in Victoria to find out what they set their off gas temperatures to . <p> A second choice is to paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Gloss Black ) from Rondex . My favorite restoration shop Coachwerks uses this on their Powertrain restorations , Gas Tanks , and anything else going underneath the chassis . They used it to paint my gas tank . <p> Conclusion : <p> I had Island Powdercoating finish off my Diff Housing Parts . It looks great , and is an industrial strength coating . I could smack it with a hammer if I wanted to . <p> why ? It cost money , it could cause issues if the paint did n't hold and got in your diff/oil . As you mentioned powder coating is for show cars , are you going to be pulling your diff at events so people can see your internally coated diff housing ? This idea just seems to comprehensive for me <p> why ? It cost money , it could cause issues if the paint did n't hold and got in your diff/oil .

@@8344755 @1544755/ <p> Alright , so I bought a silvertop 20v from a jdm ae101 levin . The motor never came with a MAF sensor , but had a denzo MAP sensor on the harness , so I assumed it was a map ecu . After tracing wires I found it was a MAF ecu . soooo , I 'm looking for your opinion on how I should run this engine . It 's going into a JDM 86 , so right hand drive . Must to be open trumpets on the itb 's because an enclosure wont clear my brake booster/master cylinder . Can I run a blacktop 20v ecu and harness ? standalone ? What do you suggest ? <p> jimmyhoffa <p> 02-09-2013 , 06:04 PM <p> If you want open trumpets the stock silvertop ecu is out . From what I remember there is a fair amount of difference between the vacuum piping on the blacktop and the silvertop , as well as a few wiring differences , so running a blacktop ecu , while possible might be a bit of work , and the difference in compression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as it could . For the least amount of headache your best bet is to try to get a complete blacktop ( engine , harness , ecu ) and sell the silvertop ... <p> A fair number of standalones will run ITB 'd cars well , but when I had my silvertop on a Megasquirt 1 ( in like 2005 , before the fully developed and tested their ITB settings and Hybrid alpha-N ) it was a giant pain in the ass to tune because of the total lack of MAP resolution between 30% throttle and 100% throttle . With the throttle closed at idle it would pull 30kpa vacuum , at 30% throttle it would read 90kpa and at WOT it would read 100kpa ... <p> Anything can be made to work . It just depends on how much time and money you want to spend beating your head against the wall . <p> Mclevin <p> 02-10-2013 , 09:18 AM <p> Haha I have tried to tune an itb 'd car with megasquirt before .

It 's looking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> jimmyhoffa <p> 02-10-2013 , 10:42 AM <p> If you 're using standard speed/density off a MAP signal on both ECUs there will be zero difference between tuning with a MS or Haltech . It 's a function of MAP resolution vs throttle position inherent to ITB setups . MS has had hybrid alpha-N and ITB settings for years now , where at lower TPS values it will use speed density for good idle and low load cruise , then in the upper TPS range it does TPS based fueling , or a combination of the two for more accurate and responsive high-load operation . <p> flipkc <p> 02-10-2013 , 12:40 PM <p> I highly recommend giving Bill @ The Independent Speed Shop a call . A Haltech Sprint 500 is very affordable and can be tuned to run any 4AGE setup ( or any 4 cyl engine ) really well . Also they are upgradable if you need more inputs/outputs for extra injectors/racepak dash/etc . <p> jimmyhoffa <p> 02-10-2013 , 07:54 PM <p> Everyone I know on the west coast vouches for Bill too . <p> billiam <p> 02-10-2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ITB turbo cars on haltech . Due to the way the ve map works you can tune in alpha N and map is working in the back ground for the final fuel calc .

During the time of table switching , there seems to be unsmoothness .... Though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete tune so it might be better than I give it credit . -MS ITB mode with correctly set up load points : this mapping method is very similar to SD switching to AN ( and work about as well ) but based off of only one fuel map and another map for load switching points . I found this system overly complicated after trying the next two methods . -SD + AN : 1 map in speed density added to another map in alpha N. I felt this was the most consistent and best method until I tried Multiplying them . -SD x AN : 1 map in speed density multiplied by another map in alpha N. This is by far the smoothest and most consistent method I 've tried for tuning ITBs . I did , however , spend the most time on this method hoping to not have to redo it again . <p> *Speaking only of fuel and these methods tried over the course of a couple years on MSII and MSIII . <p> I have to say that I love haltech 's software and ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience on their products . Vipecs have always interested me the most , but mostly for the sake of their options . Based on price , I ' d say go with MSIII or sprint500 , which are very similarly priced but their difference is in options and quality . If you 're not installing , setting up or tuning the car yourself . You should take into deep consideration the recommendation of the guys doing those services for you and NOT ONLY the price . <p> dhall0519 <p> 02-14-2013 , 12:40 PM <p> I 'd say check with Andy &amp; Paul at Neetronics .

Where is the fuse for the fuel pump located ? <p> If it 's the fuel-pump itself , how do I go about replacing it ? I recall you being able to replace the fuel-gauge thingie by means of a secret trap-door in the coupe , but does that include fuel-pumps ? .. but anyway , I have a hatch . I guess I 'm just asking out of curiosity . LoL . <p> Lastly , anyone know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel-pump ? Canadian Tire ? Princess Auto ? Toyota ? ... And anyone have any experience replacing a fuel-pump and can give me a hand ? I 'll pay you for your time . Case of beer , dinner on me , or something else we can work out .

" - Ben ( Soulibrium ) <p> I bought mine from Autovalue here in Calgary . You can not access the fuel pump from the trunk ( I have a HB , so ... I 'm not sure if coupe is diff. ) you have to drop the tank . Basically , drain the tank , undo the tank straps and be very , very careful on the lines going to the fuel pump . You 'll have to jack the car up quite some height for the gas tank to drop ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines ) and drop the tank . From there you can access the fuel pump . Mark the lines , pop the new one in and you 'll be good to go . <p> I 've never done it - only read about it and have seen it done . Seems straightfoward , the lines are probably going to be the hard parts on the job . Also - if you have the tank out , get it professionaly cleaned and the pump , if fails - will be warrantied ( via reciept for cleaning ... ) . Also - when my pump went it gave an on + off acceleration for a while and then just stopped . The car would not turn over . <p> There 's a FP test point in the kouki diagnostic port , if you jumper FP to ... B+ ? I think it is , it should bypass the control circuitry and power the pump directly .. then check the pump wire @ the harness plug and make sure you 've got voltage .. <p> if zenki , I 'd say check voltage while someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem upstream , if you 've got voltage and no pump , then yeah , your pump is toast , i 'd figure . <p> if trying to drop the tank with the lines still attached ( probably the only way your gon na be able to do it in an ontario car , even my BC cars hi pressure line had the nuts rusted solid .. ) I 'd probably undo some of the line brackets up along the way in the trans tunnel , so that you can get a little more slack in things .. <p> my fuel pump gave up on me during winter . There are 2 connectors in your trunk ( where there 's the oval plate ) the large rectangular connector is for the fuel pump and the other one for the " gas level sensor " disconnect the wire for the fuel pump and check if there 's any voltage when you turn on your key . this will indicate if there 's any electricity going to your fuel pump . If there is , then it could be the fuel pump itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it off , unbolt the 2 straps that hold your gas tank . Just be careful when taking the tank down because 20+years old gas line are fragile . See where there is 3 hoses that goes in the tank ? That 's the fuel pump support . Mark which hose goes where . unscew it from the tank , carefully remove the support and you should see the fuel pump on the support . If there was voltage from the connector , plug your fuel pump directly to check it out one more time . underneath the fuel pump there a small hole where the fuel is aspirated . If it 's working , you should see the helice inside turning . In my case , the fuel pump was dead . I changed it for a walbro ( some ppl say it 's ) Put everything back in place . so far so good . the pump is quiet , barely noticable . <p> Some tips : It 's always better to have a almost empty tank to work with . because it 's a pain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strap it back on . Some people cut a rectangular in the trunk right on top of the fuel pump support to make it more practical for this kind of job . Last but not least , make sure the connectors are well clipped . Because while drifting , it might disconnect and you 'll be there like wtf <p> So it IS possible to lower the tank if I undo some of the straps holding up the fuel lines ? <p> First , diagnose your non-running fuel pump . Check for power at the connector in the trunk . The one with two wires ... check for both +12 and ground . <p> If you have power and the FP does n't spin , try smacking the bottom of the tank with a mallet , 2x4 or whatever . I 've used boots to kick them when there was nothing else available . Sometimes smacking the tank ( not hard enough to dent it ! ) will make a sticky pump spin . <p> Yes , you must drop the tank to get the pump . <p> General procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high as possible . <p> Undo the filler neck thing . Unplug the two connectors in the trunk . <p> Support the tank and then remove the two straps . If you 're LAZY you can just pull the 2 pins , but it 's much much better to undo the 2 bolts . Lower the tank just enough to undo the screws holding the pump bracket in place . Lower the tank some more , then r&amp;r the fuel pump while the bracket is still 1/2 way in the car . I support the tank on the jack + 2 stands , or whatever . <p> On a truly rust-free car you can sometimes undo the fluid lines first , then lower the whole thing to the ground . <p> first check all your fuses realting to EFI , one of them is for the fuel pump , i 'm not sure which one though . there should be 2 ( one 7.5a , one 15a ) efi/ignition related fuses in the engine bay and 2 ( one 7.5a , one 15a ) in the drivers side kick panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . <p> if they 're all good . test for power at the pump . disconnect the harness by the access panel and test for power there . if you have power , its the pump . drop the tank , pull the pump out . if not , check for broken connections or shorts in the wires leading up to that harness . <p> for dropping the tank : jack up on the axle , place jack stands as far outwards as possible . make sure you jack it up high enough to get the filler neck out when you drop the tank . disconnect sending unit and fuel pump harnesses from up top . take off the filler neck plastic clip ( 4 screws ) , get underneath , undo 2 of the fuel lines that you can see , the last one you have to disconnect when the tank is slightly dropped since it disconnects overtop of the tank ( at least that 's how it is on mine ) . put a jack under the tank with a piece of wood in between the tank and jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the front of the tank ) and drop the tank with the jack . only drop it halfway and undo that last fuel line and then drop it fully . unscrew the fuel pump assembly and pull it out . pretty easy . <p> as for replacement , i used a walbro 255lph pump and it works fine . but i do have a 20v silvertop. if its a stock 4age that might not be the best choice . there 's lots of oem replacement pumps that you can get with a lower lph. search ebay and whatnot. and swapping out the pumps is pretty much by the book . strainer , 1 hose , 1 power wire , 1 ground wire . <p> keep in mind , if you test the pump outside the tank and it works . just change it . i 've tried that and gone through this whole fiasco many times before giving up and just replacing the pump and having the new pump work .

He s got a 1990 AE92 with a small port engine and he s thinking about swapping in a 20v black top . I tried to research as much as I could about it but there is n't too much information out there about the front wheel drive swap . <p> Here 's what i know : bolts in directly with ae92 engine mounts exhaust manifold needs to be custom or 16v manifold needs to be drilled <p> Here 's what he wants to know : where to get replacement parts for it do the coolant lines all match up is there any linkage or custom work for the 6 speed does the intake box bolt in wiring all in general will it pass aircare <p> I checked around club4ag and there seems to be a lot of helpful links and diy for the ae86 but I have n't found anything for the ae92 . I 'd really appreciate any information anyone has on this subject seeing how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the information . <p> yeah ive searched all over for information about the ae92 blacktop swap and havent found too much . i can only assume its because its fairly straight forward , and if it were up to me , i 'd just buy the engine and figure it out as i go but my friend does n't  have the time or room to risk that . i found a little bit of info and just wanted to share in case anyone else comes across this swap . on the 6 speed you do need the axles ( not sure from the ae111 specifically but most likely ) since it uses a half shaft to prevent torque steer . unfortunately the blacktop i 'm looking at does come with a 6 speed but no axles. as for the coolant , it turns out people use 4afe radiators because the top hose outlet is in the center . thanks for the info though , i know there 's not too many ae92 's out there on this board but any info is helpful . <p> Check TN as there 's quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of threads with info including one with the 6spd swap and what you got ta do to fit it on an AE92 ... basically you need to fab a mount for it as it 's longer . I prefer the C56 5spd over the C160 6spd swap as it 's direct and the C56 is stronger . <p> Hope your 20V comes with the manifold already , they 're not hard to find though as I 'm sure someone with a 20V into an AE86 would have all that stuff left over . I 've seen a few 20V manifolds for sale on TN also , yes the 16V manifold is a go if you drill for the one hole I believe . <p> Yes , you will need an AE92 SR5/Sedan rad for the 20V as the 16V has the outlet to the left ... I think the 20V has it in the middle , like the 4AFE 's . <p> Mounting points match just like any A motor ... but I think you 'll have to play around with the mounts to see which ones fit better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix of 16V/20V mounts . <p> yeah i was reading quite a bit from toyota nation but the one guy redirected me to 4age.net and there were tons of info there . those australian boys really like the hatch ae92 though i do n't  understand why . i also looked at the 6 speed conversion post on tn.com and it was really helpful but again no shafts. i wish i bought that c56 when someone was selling it for 100 bucks <p> Notes : The stock axles will work . I 'm using them and have for about 50000km so I do n't see why they do n't . I just got one with the support bearing and when it arrives I will be able to comment on the difference . I ran the c160 with 180whp for two years on those axles and it was reliable . The linkage all works but for reverse you will need to notch out the lower right side of your shifter assy to be able to get the lever over far enough to engage reverse .

@@8344775 @1544775/ @qwx111434 <h> Mechanic 's gloves and brake fluid ( long , gruesome safety story ) <p> Okay ... <p> So in the fall I basically rebuilt my entire brake system sans the hardlines from the master cylinder to the flex lines . As I had new calipers and a master cylinder , I had to bleed the brakes over 4 days to get all the air out . I finally did , but went through liters of brake fluid some of which ended up on my black Mechanic 's gloves . <p> Christmas comes around and I end up toasting my engine upon which I had a newish one installed . Engine works great for about a day until the water pump gives up the ghost and I blow a front wheel bearing . This all happens days before I 'm about to leave for Mexico for 10 days . Weather outside is nice , but long term forecast says when I get back TO will be much colder and whiter . So , I decide to do as much work as I can ( outside in my parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return and work on it after a relaxing trip . So for the two nights prior to leaving I am working on the car for about 6 hours each night with my gloves on . I get it mostly done with only a little work left when I get back ( filling up the coolant , as I FIPG 'd some stuff and wanted to ensure it would cure in sub-zero temperatures ) . <p> Leave for Mexico . About 2 days in , my hand start to peel . Literally , the skin on my fingertips is peeling off . Not very deep but basically all the skin on my finger tips is sloughing off . " Must be the **26;260;TOOLONG or some combination , " I think . Goes away after a few days but leaves my fingers very tight . <p> After Mexico , I end up putting the gloves back on and filling up the coolant , replacing the oil cooler , fixing the wiper arms and replacing the other front wheel bearing . I performed this over 2 evenings with my gloves on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have red skin on my palms it is so thin . My hands hurt and look like ass . <p> Safety message : Brake fluid is not only a suspected carcinogen , it does n't like skin . If you have gloves saturated in brake fluid , throw them out and buy new ones . <p> I 'm guessing it was Dot 3 or 4 brake fluid , ie hygroscopic . It will absorb the water from your skin , making it dry out , slough off etc . Nasty stuff , i hate brake fluid with a passion , but it does help you stop . <p> As for the nitrile gloves , been using them for a couple years now . No more axle grease imbedded under my finger nails . Was using plain latex gloves but they did n't  stand up to the sovlents in the parts washer . <p> Jump up and down , waving nitrile gloved hands in the airme me ! /jumping <p> I wear those under the mechanix gloves . <p> also notice that mechanix gloves will DISINTEGRATE if you subject it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it ..... it could have been because it was steaming hot coolant mix but still .... do n't trust those glove for jack . I keep my nitriles on all the time . <p> nitrile seems to be easier for you to breath thru it too .... maybe I used looser ones ... nitrile ftw . <p> Nowadays I 'm using these SAS Pawz ( or was it Paws ) work gloves for everything , its basically cotton gloves with a thick nitrile coating over them , found them at CarQuest . Much cheaper than Mechanix gloves too . <p> mullet : you do n't really have to throw your mechanic gloves away , just wash them thoroughly with water and soap , but just toss them in a bucket of water to dilute the brake fluid .

Considering the displacement of a rotary of this size is more akin to a 5L engine that 's sort of ...... street like . <p> Another relative term is " fuel efficient . " Maybe in 1991 this was efficient but it only had to meet the requirement at worst to consume 50 liters of gasoline per 100km of driving . <p> The telescoping intake is an interesting invention but a couple stepper motors with megasquirt could do this too . Not very practical when you consider packaging constraints in a normal vehicle which they did n't have to worry about . I mean they admit that its a cat 2 vehicle meaning pretty relaxed rules . If you could find the room in your engine bay it would be cool to see what it would do . I think you need variable cam timing and lift to take better advantage of it though . Wait , we have that now ! <p> They also do n't mention how big of an oil reservoir they had to have to keep those fancy apex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Oil consumption is the major reason why the rotary engines days are numbered . They are simply too oil thirsty and are an emissions nightmare . But you have to give them credit for pushing the envelope . <p> Haha . I had to jump in on this one . As for the ban , yes , its was banned out right because it was viewed as an advantage . There was no signs of wear , and it was extremely fuel effeicent . It hada 4 plug setup per a rotor , but before you go getting all mad , many engines were running 2 plug on hemi heads also . As for oil consumption , it was actually less than its piston counter parts due to the ceramic seals mazda developed that are almost self lubricating . You would be suprised how much oil the piston engines use in endurance racing due to larger ring gaps and dry sump systems the require crank case and head pressure to be controled and bled off . Also 400 ftbs was a huge step compaired to competitiors . The porsches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trq. think about that . short stroke engines are favoured in endro racing and they do n't  make **** for torque . the Corvette stuff does , but when they actaully finish.lol . At the last test session i was at , i was told by a friend who was driving a Grand Am spec rx8 , the the engine they put in had 200 hrs on it . That 's insane when it comes to motorsports . I 'm not just talking jib either . <p> 9 rotors of furry as view from our pit stall in the second test session in daytona. 
@@8344787 @1544787/ @qwx111434 <h> Engine Fuse Keeps Blowing <p> Was driving along and noticed a sputter in my accel and turned out a spark plug wire was loose cause the battery was not fastened properly . So pulled over and put it in snug but as i was moving the battery back , the positive terminal touched the metal and cause a huge spark and destroying the battery . When I was trouble shooting , boosting and push starting the car would die if i turn the lights on in neutral . So I parked it and got a new battery today , installed it and good it starts every time , but every time i throw the key in the on position the engine fuse blows . Went through 3 but it would start with a blown fuse , just alittle weaker . <p> I 'm not too mechanically inclined and any insight on why the engine fuse blows would help me out a great deal . I drive a 87 Corolla coupe with a blue top . Thanks <p> lol ... admit it , you unplugged the battery and connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive terminal on " the metal " is beyond me . <p> Strap your goddamn battery down , it costs $5 or less . You 've got a short in the system somewhere , probably a melted/exposed wire . Tape or cover your pos terminal on the battery so it ca n't short again . <p> The ENGINE fuse in the eng bay box is for charging system and emissions . I would unplug the alternator wire and make sure it 's not grounding out somewhere . <p> i did n't  disconnect the battery and and connect it wrong and the metal it touched , was the battery holder that broke free cause of the rust on the underside , so when i pulled the batt back into place i accidentally touched the meta to the positive terminal . thanks for the input <p> dug deeper today and changed all grounds . checked a ton of wires and all seem to be okay no melting anywhere that i have seen . but the engine 10amp fuse keeps going . Not the EFI fuse . No codes being thrown as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> did something fall down on the starter contacts like a screwdriver or bolt ? @qwx111436 @qwx111433 <p> Try unplugging the 3 wire connector on the alternator and see what happens . The engine fuse is in the power input line from the main relay to the Alternator . It 's possible that you shorted a circuit in the alternator when you grounded the batttery by mistake . <p> And to those who judge harshly , what comes around goes around . Dentman <p> If the alternator trick did not work , you have two wires in that circuit that have melted together somewhere . The wires in the circuit need to be probed for continuity with a voltmeter . Please let us know what the mechanic finds . Dentman <p> Mechanic said he would call back 3 times and never did so , me and my buddy went at it . I tried the alternator trick and that did n't work , so pulled a lot of the dash out and found a melted wire that goes behind the cluster but not sure where it leads too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i believe the ticks means its a ground ? But it was n't connected to a harness or anything .... gon na trace it back and see where it leads too then go from there . <p> Brown usually means ground , could be wrong though , but for the sake of argument .. A missing ground wo n't cause you to blow fuses . Did you get the right fuse ? And if you 're blowing fuses even with the alternator unplugged then I got a theory , might be complete crap but try starting the car without the starter ? Just push start it and let me know if it starts without blowing any fuses <p> i do n't  think its a missing ground i think it may be a melted wire touching another caused by the spark . My buddy is tracing back the wires from the alternator now . If this is n't it ill try the push start , but what is this theory ? ? ? the fuses are correct . If none of this works could i have ruined my ecu by sparking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks does not always mean ground . If they are paired together ( like in a speaker wires set , that may be the case ) . Some Toyotas use white wires with black stripes to indicate ground . You need the proper wiring diagram with the wire colours to know what wire goes to what . Without that , you will likely melt another circuit . The melted wires behind the dash could be the alternator charge light circuit that is also blowing the fuse . Dentman

Even when my sensor was disconnected , it was still on dim . It happened after I switched out the gauges , then put my old ones back in , and it never did it before ... Maybe these types of problems are n't in the car so much as the gauges considering I had the exact same problem , just a different light ... I too had the dimness when it should have been totally off . I took the bulb out of the back of the gauges and have never had a battery problem or anything since then .

Gears are pretty tough and might be okay , you 'd have to check them carefully after cleaning .

Fortunately , it 's not audible from the outside of my car , although it kind of drowns out the sound of the engine . <p> I 've driven it at 70 mph ( 110 km/h ) down to my family in a city near Seattle , and that was about 170 km each way .

I shipped a whole 4.3 pumpkin to a guy in Chicago recently , they 're damn hard to find out that way apparently . <p> mre , the carrier bearings are pressed onto the differential , but the outer races just sit on top of them so they can be replaced with just hand tools . What you could easily do though is pick up some new bearings ( Toyota has em , a little pricey , I can get you the bearing numbers though so you can buy them from any parts store ) , pop the carrier assembly out , take it to a shop with a press and get them to replace them , then you pop it back in . Technically the lash can change from changing side bearings . If its off you need to swap the shims that press against the races to bring the pattern back to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . Again from my experience ( which is n't huge , torn apart a few of these and rebuilt a couple now ) the lash usually only changes if the pininon gear 's position changes , as it can when the preload is set on the crush sleave . It did n't when I rebuilt my diff , and I 've swapped just carrier bearing races a couple times now with no i 'll effects . <p> You can get the carrier assembly and change the side shims with the diff in the car ( though I 've never done it that way ) , but it is much easier to dump the carrier assembly out when the diff is removed . Once you pull the side shafts only pressure holds the diff and ring in , but its a fair bit . Placing 2 peices of 2x4s on the ground and banging the diff against them with the guts facing the floor is a good way to persuade them to pop out ( put some plywood or a rubber matt down too to prevent damage to the ring gear ) .

I just need a vacuum box and some kind of standalone ecu ... : S <p> I 'm also planning to sell a bunch of things . <p> mhiscott <p> 12-14-2009 , 10:26 AM <p> Nice to see you 're still at it . I thought you were done with Corollas when I saw you selling the primered one on the arms board . That was you was n't it ? Hopefully mine will be done soon . I keep buying tools instead of finishing the car though lol . Lincoln Mig welder , PA sandblasting cabinet , etc ... Ugh : o <p> BARKER <p> 12-14-2009 , 10:33 AM <p> I was n't giving up on Corollas . Just culling the flock so to speak . That hatchback needed a lot of body work . I 'd rather turn wrenches compared to sanding and painting . <p> But of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " rebuilt " head on and it looked like it needed to be plained and definitely cleaned . But the big kicker was that the cam caps were missing . I searched through every box I got when I bought the parts in Moncton and there are none to be seen . Grrrreeeaat . <p> So , I 'm just doing what I should have done in the first place . I 'm going to take my smallport head to get tuned up and use it . It 's what I wanted to do eventually anyway . <p> I also picked up a couple of 2 " exhaust flanges and a length of 2 " pipe . They 'll be used to make a test pipe to go between the TRD header and the Buddyclub exhaust . I 've machined a bore in the flanges so that they will accept a doughnut gasket instead of a flat one . Once it 's all welded up it 'll be powder-coated by myself . <p> Got to order a couple more parts from Toyota today . They 're for the smallport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the block . I 'll also have to drill a hole in the block to accept the piping . The smallport 4a-ge 's were the only engine to use this . Supposedly it helps ( or altogether solves ) the problem of oil pooling in the intake cam cover , during hard left hand turns ( which leads to excessive oil being sucked into the intake track via the pcv line ) . The 20V engines had a much better head design ( in regards to oil returning from the head to the block ) , so they deleted this return pipe on the later blocks , like mine . : ) <p> Fun stuff ! <p> Brian <p> 03-03-2010 , 10:17 AM <p> missing cam caps = useless cylinder head <p> oil drainback hose and pipe fitting can be ordered from Toyota . <p> hole size is about 19mm ( 3/4 " ) and we seem to need to jb weld them every time ; ) <p> BARKER <p> 03-03-2010 , 10:54 AM <p> missing cam caps = useless cylinder head <p> oil drainback hose and pipe fitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 19mm ( 3/4 " ) and we seem to need to jb weld them every time ; ) <p> Yeah . I 'm still going to contact the guy that sold me the head to see if he just forgot to put them in the box . That way I still have a usable largeport head if I need it ( or just sell it ) . <p> I 'm going to attempt the drill and jb weld of the pipe . <p> I 'm not sure if I 'm going to buy a new one or not though . If I have to jb weld it anyway and the original pipe is ok looking/fitting , then I 'll probably just use it . I 'll check it out tonight and order the new one if I think I need to . I do n't think they 're too expensive .... <p> BARKER <p> 03-04-2010 , 03:47 AM <p> I took the head to the shop today . Should have it back in a week or so . <p> They asked me if I wanted to go with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MKIII Supra nut and knew that some people use them . He even suggested that they are what TRD used for the 4a-ge big valve kits ) . I 'm holding off though . I ca n't really see any advantage to using the bigger valves unless I have waaay more cam , fuel , and compression . <p> Yes ? No ? Maybe ? <p> They also made some suggestions for porting and knife edging certain areas . I have to do a little more research before I commit to any of that though . <p> Rastaracer <p> 03-04-2010 , 06:28 AM <p> Do it man , do it all ! Every little bit helps when we are dealing with so little to begin with . Get the bigger valves , the porting , and definately the knife edging ( and do n't forget to get the entire rotating assembly balanced ) . <p> BARKER <p> 03-04-2010 , 07:20 AM <p> ( and do n't forget to get the entire rotating assembly balanced ) . <p> Done already : smilewinkgrin : <p> As far as the valves go though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only needed in the 200-220 hp range . And if you were to use them prior to that , you would actually lose power ... <p> Special K <p> 03-04-2010 , 09:31 AM <p> billzilla ftw , i do n't have any experience with race engines but it makes sense that air velocity would go down with bigger valves unless you had the cam duration ( 288-304 ) to match it . <p> BARKER <p> 03-05-2010 , 04:00 AM <p> Even though the motor building is on hold , I 'm still working away . <p> Last night I test fitted the Buddyclub spec II exhaust . I was n't surprised that it did n't quite clear the rear bumper ( seeing as it 's meant for a JDM car ) . I notched the metal on the underside of the bumper to accommodate it for now . Then I took my measurements for my test pipe . I 'll get it welded up tonight and powder coat it , when I go back to work next week . <p> If anyone has a decent JDM rear bumper and brackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to PM me . <p> I forgot to take a pic of it on the car . But it 's exactly what I was after . <p> You can imagine how loud it is just by looking at the design . But ... <p> Holy sweet little baby Jesus it 's LOUD . : bigear : : yikes : : yikes : <p> The silencer helps ... a little bit . I 'll be adding to the silencer though . It is a true racing exhaust . <p> It 's a " slip-fit " though , : idea : so I might just fab up a removable true muffler . <p> I 'm not too worried about the noise level personally as the car is a weekend toy and autoslalom/lapping rig . More worried about attention from the po-po to and from events . <p> td-civ <p> 03-06-2010 , 03:03 PM <p> looks like a great build keep it up <p> BARKER <p> 03-15-2010 , 08:57 AM <p> Pics of the head re-freshening .

I measured over 100 of them and still do n't have quite enough to perfectly adjust the valves . <p> My valve clearances were pretty bad in spots . I 'm not sure if it has more to do with my aftermarket PDM cams . <p> All in all , things went well though . <p> And too boot , I now own a house ( my first ever house ) , so I will have lots of room to enjoy more old Toyota junk/projects . : D .... <p> and waaay less time to do so : ( <p> AhBra <p> 03-24-2010 , 05:16 AM <p> nevermind . <p> BARKER <p> 03-25-2010 , 10:10 AM <p> Thanks to hondakill3r I now have a JDM Kouki rear bumper .

Cell phone pics do n't do it justice . <p> The tube in the pics is for the pcv system . It 's in the wrong location in the pictures . The line will eventually go from the back of the reversed smallport intake manifold , to the T-fitting just after my MAF sensor . <p> I plan on going back today and installing the oil pan , windage tray and oil pick up ( hopefully I 'll get to the fuel injectors and rail ) . I think I 'm going to end up using the dizzy and rear water pump housing that are on the car already . I know they are both in good working condition . <p> I 've got the rear bumper primed too .

Installed : <p> - Oil pan - Windage tray - Oil pick up - Rear oil seal and retainer <p> Also prettied up the oil pan with a fresh coat of paint . <p> I had a moment of stupidity though . I managed to break a bolt off that holds the retainer to the block . Luckily it was easy to remove ( but a pain in the butt nonetheless ) . <p> EDIT : Just decided to order a T-50 transmission rebuild kit . It should be here by the end of next week . : D <p> Wideband sensor location on the left , but the ECU is still being sent a signal from the factory narrow band sensor on the right ( for now ) .

Its only 12 screws and 4 bolts . <p> I 'm also in the process of wiring up a relayed fuse panel that can supply 6 devices with a switched 12V source . An existing switched 12V source activates the relay , which will then allow power directly from the battery to the new fuse panel .

Car runs kind of lean at idle ( 15.5ish on the air/fuel ) but I 'm pretty sure that lean at idle is normal . <p> B&amp;M Fuel pressure gauge is also installed . <p> Unfortunately though , I discovered a ton of rust from the inside of the car on pretty well every section of the floor . <p> It looks like water had been getting into the car for quite sometime behind the passengeres seat ( perhaps since I re-built the car 8 years ago ) . For the most part it was just surface scale . I had one very tiny pin hole that went straight through , but more than likely , the sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next couple of years .

You ca n't quite see it in the picture but I installed my Autometer temperature sensor in one of the removable threaded caps ( and yes .. It 's on the cap that is part of the oil outlet line going to the cooler ) . You can kind of just see the cap underneath of the power steering bracket ( it 's the tiny gold spec ) . I had to notch the power steering bracket in that same area in order to get everything to clear . And yes ... *sigh* ... I did mark up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hooked up the drive-shaft , clutch slave cylinder , a few transmission bits , and started putting the electrical back together .

I got tangled up ( literally and figuratively ) with installing some missing heater hoses and replacing a bunch of hose clamps . Then filled the coolant system with a coolant system pressure tester ( uses compressed air , helps to prevent air lock ) . Very slick tool . <p> Also had a few broken bits of polution control that had to be deleted ( after I figured out what they did ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and starter are all that 's left ) . I decided to replace the contacts in my starter . One of them was n't even tight in the starter housing and , because of that , is now extra crispy burnt ! ! <p> So the next time I can get to the garage , I 'm going to hook the exhaust , starter and battery up and then see if it will run or not . : D/ I 'm just not sure when I 'll get there again ... : ( <p> BARKER <p> 09-24-2010 , 05:38 AM <p> IT 'S ALIVE ! ! ! ! <p> After 2 years of collecting parts , and 10 months of putting things together , the rebuilt and improved engine finally roared to life two nights ago . <p> I did n't post the news then though , as I had only started it for 30 seconds due to a lack of oil pressure reading on my factory Toyota gauge and it 's crappy oil pressure sender connector . <p> Last night though , I reconnected the gauge , cranked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle moved on the gauge . So I started it up . I 've never had a car start as easy as this thing does . You barely touch the key . <p> It sounded a little lumpy at first , but my Dad was there and he started timing it by ear , as I was looking for the timing gun . We went from pig rich ( about 9:1 ) to scary lean ( about 19:1 ) just during idle . After a while we got it running beautifully , but still a little on the lean side with 15.3-15.7 a/f at idle . There is room for improvement here . <p> Oil pressure looked great . At one point I could hear the air bleeding out/oil entering the cooler of the full flow oil cooler system . <p> I have yet to take it for a drive , but I 'm already making another To-Do list : <p> it should be pretty happy with the 210s back in , but I doubt that has anything to do with your idle issues . 4ags are finicky for getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got it right after awhile on the one I did though , with no issues in the end . it could just be a combination of a normal vacume leak and a slighlty out of spec o2 sensor but I 'll run through a few things that I can recall from the swap I did LONG ... <p> I see you 've blocked all of the vacume ports on your throttle body . The EGR ones are a no brainer , but I kept the one hooked up for the Idle up VSV ( had to constantly readjust the base idle as the seasons and ambient temps changed ) , and also another for one of the vacume ports on the back of the head LONG ... Theres 2 blue two port vacume switches back there . Ones for EGR but as I recall ( and it is foggy ) , the other was for something important like the charcol cannister and it should be maintained . <p> Somewhere though you 've definitly got too much air getting into your intake at idle if you have to adjust the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how your throttle plate is adjusted . You should adjust the stopper so its just a hair past the point where it starts to bind when closed . High milage TBs can leak too from wear . But I would n't be suprised at all if your problem is related to the POS cold start idle valve these poor motors are saddled with . That piece of junk on the bottom of the TB is notorious for misbehaving with age . Might want to try another one if you ca n't nail down your idle problems . <p> Like I said though , I 'm going to try the old injectors out and see what kind of numbers I get . <p> I found my oil leak too . I just need to tighten up my oil temperature sensor . <p> Rastaracer <p> 09-28-2010 , 06:34 AM <p> Those would be nice AFRs if you were boosting <p> BARKER <p> 09-28-2010 , 06:41 AM <p> After reading through the FSM a few minutes ago and read in the EFI Trouble shooting section ( under the high idle topic ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cause high idle . <p> When I swap the injectors , I might kill 2 birds with one stone so to speak . <p> Cueman <p> 09-28-2010 , 06:58 AM <p> When I swap the injectors , I might kill 2 birds with one stone so to speak . <p> I think so .

The engine stated but ran like crap . Turned out that I had a bad injector on the number four cylinder . So in went the spare . The engine started and ran , but was giving high a/f ratios ( 17.0-18.0 ) at idle no matter how much I messed with the timing and idle mixture adjustment screw . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the high 13 's Full throttle : never richer than 12.0 , usually fluctuates between 12.0 and 12.3 <p> The car feels much better to drive . <p> And in non-engine related news , my brother is hooking me up with an AW11 steering rack so that I can convert my AE86 to manual steering !

I think I 'm going to mess with the timing a little more yet . <p> BARKER <p> 10-12-2010 , 06:15 AM <p> Well this engine is working out pretty damn well ( knock on wood ) ! I found a couple of vacuum leaks and corrected them , AND because of that I set my base timing again . Before it was set at 5 degrees BTDC ( only because that 's where it seemed to run well at ) , now it 's at 10 ( which is the factory spec ) . <p> The old tired engine averaged around 20-24 mpg which I knew was bad . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting between 26-30 mpg ( and I 'm still running a little on the rich side ) ! ! ! <p> It all depends on how I 'm driving of course , and I 've not been driving to save on gas .

It sounds and feels incredible at 6000 rpms . <p> SupraFiend <p> 10-12-2010 , 09:39 AM <p> awesome . the highcomp smallports really do give up nothing to the old TVIS bluetops , if the af numbers are good they make more power and torque everywhere it seems . <p> BARKER <p> 06-13-2011 , 04:19 AM <p> Got some work done this weekend : <p> - Seam sealed a couple of leaks that I found around the passengers side door opening . - Installed new clutch master cylinder ( still have to adjust for engagement point ) - Installed the largeport fuel pressure regulator . <p> Going to the largeport FPR was a good move , as it helped get my A/F ratios a little higher . I had the higher pressure FPR ( from a smallport 4a-ge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . Swapping the regulator cured some of the odd idle hunting I was getting too . <p> I plan on rebuilding a set of fuel injectors soon to see what kind of improvements can be gained there . <p> BARKER <p> 07-05-2011 , 04:52 AM <p> Here 's the latest on the AE86 . <p> Transmission tear down is on it 's way . Removing the gears is a tough job , but it 's coming along . I 'm just installing new synchro 's , bearings and gaskets . I 've got some Redline MT90 to help things operate smoothly . <p> 1-way Cusco LSD from deathblossom and freshly tuned up ( by 86tuning ) . It was already installed in the pot , so all I need to do is order some Motul 90PA differential fluid . Which I ca n't buy locally . The tuning shops in Nova Scotia have never even heard of it . And the bike shops can order it , but their supplier has it on back order until October . So I 'll probably end up buying it from Motul Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have worked out well . No leaks from either pieces . <p> The engine lost about 1/2 a litre of oil since the rebuild . I 'm attributing that to a small leak that I found where I installed my oil temperature sensor .

@@8344815 @1544815/ @qwx111434 <p> I had to improve the rad , so I bought an aluminum one , two row .... exactly like the Mishimoto . <p> I was now ready for the first road test ! But it was very short . I discovered rapidly that the GTS fuel pump was not flowing enough from 3,000 rpm WOT . The engine was literally dying . I had a fuel pump in the garage coming from a Lexus SC400 ( V8 4.0L ) , so I installed it . Externally ; it was identical to the GTS one , so a direct fit . The Denso part number is #951-0003 . It 's the same pump for all NA 6 cyl Lexus/Toyota and V8 . The only 4 cyl application is the supercharged Previa . <p> Second road-test : <p> It was impossible to not spin the tires in first gear , it was pulling hard in 2nd gear ( when tires were not spinning ) . But at that time ; my diff ratio was 4.10 ... and with the low rev 3RZ it was a real pain ( cut-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the gears were so short , that I was always shifting . And when up-shifting during a pull , on the next gear the rpm was falling at the end of the powerband . It was really frustrating . Like the low rev 5ME MK1 Supra , I needed a 3.73 diff ratio . <p> So I found a third-member geared 3.73 from an old Corolla . I took care to swap in my spool . <p> Yeah ; it was a REAL improvement ! Now the gears were steeper and it was so much fun for spirited driving . Only until this moment , I was entirely satisfied with my swap choice . The car was pulling much harder than my ex Supra 's 5MGE . It was pulling harder than a Volks VR6 and 1.8T ... and faster than about any 200hp cars . <p> Staying longer in each gears showed another ' ' downside ' ' . From about 4,800 rpm to redline ( 5,900 ) , there was a dead spot . I tought the stock cams were in cause . So I ordered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them soon ; I started to play with the AFC Apexi Neo . <p> I found the A/F ratio was way too rich from factory between 4,800 rpm to redline ( 10.3-10.5 ) . It was really killing the performance , creating that dead spot over 4,800 rpm . I corrected the A/F ratio to 12.8-13:1 and the difference was day and night ! The engine was now pulling hard all the way to the cut-off ! <p> The car was VERY fun to drive . Every people that was doing a ride was really impressed . I LOVE the torque and the wide powerband of this engine . At this time , my brother 's beater was a MK3 Supra turbo at 11 psi ( 7MGTE ) . He was unable to keep up with my car . It was so frustrating for him , that I had to swap a 1JZ in his cleaner MK3 Supra ! Haha ! <p> The installation was very simple and easy . On Toyota 's GE heads , cams lobes generally points one toward the other at TDC . That creates overlap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlap to get the maximum torque possible a low rev .

This is a dyno video from LCE on a 3RZ with almost the same set-up : <p> On Toyota 's GE heads , cams lobes generally points one toward the other at TDC . That creates overlap .

My boss gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company that I would repair the car myself ; they would have gave me a smaller amount ( something like 14$/hour ) . Telling them the garage was to repair it , they were giving 40$/hour ! <p> I found a good deal for a pair of seats . My wife 's brother bought them to put in his Civic ... but crashed it . So he sold me his Corbeau seats for a fair price . <p> Since the first day of the 3RZ swap , I was dreaming of a TRD supercharger . But I did not had the budget to throw 5,000$ US on a new one . So I registered on some Tacoma/4Runner forums hoping to find one used at a cheap price . I finally found one with the 8 PSI pulley , fifth injector , Unichip ECU pre-programmed with 2 different fuel/timing maps , etc . <p> So I added some color to my car in memory of the rally Celica . This was at a car exposition . I was with my son that was 2 years old . At this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Now that the winter was over , it was time get a ride with my new beast . The sad thing is that the Unichip ECU did not work with my engine ( 2000 8 port ) . This Unichip computer is for a 2003-2004 2RZ/3RZ ECU . <p> With the stock ECU and the AFC Apexi piggyback , all was OK when driving normally . But in WOT , there was not enough fuel from idle to 3,000 rpm , and it ran very lean . I tried to add more fuel with the Apexi Neo at +50% everywhere between idle and 3,000 rpm . It was not enough ... even when raising the fuel pressure in the ramp . <p> So I connected the 5th injector ( 650cc ) on the S/C to the 4th injector . Now it was WAY TOO RICH under all conditions . So I even tried to connect the 5th injector to the VTEC control output of the Apexi Neo . It was a little better , but too hard to control under some conditions and causing misfire . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of the stock ones ( 245-270cc ) . Now it 's way better ! <p> The car was pulling great ! I know so many people with turbo cars that get very impressive numbers on the dyno ... but have a very shi*ty powerband for the street . My set-up surely does not have impressive numbers ... BUT the powerband IS amazing . There is ALWAYS power EVERYWHERE in the rpm range . This engine have instant throttle response ... even if i 'm cruising in 5th gear as low as 1,500 rpm . The S/C give me instantly 5 psi of boost ' ' on the tap ' ' from idle to about 3,500 rpm ... and 8 psi from 3,500 rpm to redline . And do n't forget that a Corolla is feather-light , so the power/weight ratio is phenomenal . <p> No dyno at this time . May be next summer ! According to LCE 's tech ; my set-up at this time was supposed to produce around 270 hp/tq . <p> I enjoyed driving my supercharged car about one week .... until the ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drinking coolant at idle . Maybe it was a little risky to push 8 psi of non-intercooled boost on a high comp engine ! So I bought another 3RZ engine and removed the stock head and did a little cleaning/porting , port-matching to the S/C , and a new valve job . The head gasket/head swap job was easy and took only a couple hours . The car was still running GREAT , and had no other problem .

I 'm not going to get into too much detail now , but this build will be ongoing through the winter here in preparation for the 2009 racing and drifting seasons . <p> My ultimate goal for 2009 is to have myself and the car ready to run the GT support race at the Edmonton Indy . <p> Here is how the car started out when I bought it back in 2005 . <p> All that was done at that point was the MKII Supra wheels and a crappy Ractive intake filter . <p> I drove it that way for a few months , then lowered the car on some Eibach springs and drove it that way for most of the summer of 2006 . As you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter with the help of Glenn ( Supradevil ) the car was boosted and received a few suspension changes . TRD shocks , ridiculously stiff AFCO springs for the rear . It drifted , but it was n't pretty . <p> So in the summer of 2007 the car underwent a transformation . The engine popped in the fall of 2006 from my being a dumbass and overloading it at low RPM on the highway . So that engine came out and another stocker went in , with which I spent a little more time paying attention to the A/F ratios and it ran solid for the next two seasons with a LOT of track and street time . <p> The majority of the transformation was cosmetic in 2007 . The car received new paint , real suspension ( coilovers in the front , Swift springs in the back , Tokico Illuminas all the way around , Cusco anti-sway bars , fender braces ... and the list goes on ) . Also thrown into the mix were some 15x8 0 offset Sportmax 002 wheels . <p> At the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day just before a drift event , the stickers were put onto paint just 16 hours old , this is how she looked . The kit is v-speed , cheap , but it works . <p> The car stayed that way through the 2007 season and held up quite well , save for an exploding ring and pinion . <p> The car has gone through some changes , for sure . But nothing compared to what 's currently happening . The car has been stripped down completely in preparation for sandblasting and a basic primer before it comes back for all of the fabrication work . <p> Glenn prepares to cut out the trunk floor and panhard mount . I 'm not sure I 'll ever want to work on a car on the ground again after this . <p> Here we can see the mounts for the rotisserie . There is another plate sandwiched on the inside of the frame rail . This unit is solid ! <p> So the trunk floor has been cut out and it was dropped off at the sandblasters to test how well the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it stripped completely bare to ensure optimum contact and strength in all of the welds . <p> Going off what the sandblaster said there should n't be any issues with blasting this thing right clean . After that there will be a bit of rust repair and some panels will be cut out and/or welded up . First thing will likely be figuring out positioning of the rear subframe and suspension . Once positioned the roll cage will be tied into all of the mounts . By the time the cage is finished the hope is that the parts will be here from Australia and the engine and tranny positioning can begin . <p> Nice non-corolla , there will be lots of real done up rolla 's in Edmonton this year , that really do n't contain much of what we would consider a corolla . Turbo 's and rotaries and wheels wider than a barn . Should be fun . <p> wow nice project ... very ambitious . I hope this is your full time job cause getting everything done you listed for 2009 is gon na be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get stuff done that 's about 5 years work lol . Hope you can pull it off , should be sweet when its done . <p> Wow Matt you have a full plate this winter eh ? This should be awesome ... love the rotiserie , I sooo wish I had done that to strip all the undercoating on my car . So your getting it blasted ? Is n't there some place in Edmonton that does chemical dipping ? I thought I saw an add a few years back in the Quicktimes Classifieds. @qwx111433

I 've done the spark plugs for both my smallport and bigport 4AGE and I was under the impression that both motors used 0.43 or 0.44 for gapping . Well reading both manuals was useless because the manual only stated the gaps for 4AF and 4AFEs but not for the 4AGE , this gives me the impression that I 'm not supposed to gap the plugs which I usually buy NGK Platinum . I also measured the gap on the original plug and I believe it was 0.31 or 0.33 or so , ca n't remember off hand but it was somewhere around there . <p> Do you guys gap your plugs to a certain number or just use whatever gap came with the plug ? it seems that the manual and dealers themselves are more inclined to the latter which is confusing me . <p> i think it was brought up before that you actually get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for longer life ? ? <p> Yup . Platinum is used because it lasts a really , *really* long time . It fits the " set-it-and-forget-it " mentality of North American pop culture .

Not all spark plugs are created equal , and getting the wrong one can do serious damage ( if you 're really unlucky ) . <p> Second : Make sure that you understand just how effective a Toyota ignition is . You probably wo n't notice a difference in power just by changing plugs . <p> Third : Know that copper plugs only have a life of about 5000km , after which they need replacing . <p> Fourth : There are " performance " copper plugs and regular copper plugs .

Got the MOMO hub on , no problem , got the NRG quick release adaptor on both the hub and the wheel , no problem . When it came time to put the friggen horn on ... problems . <p> Took a look inside the Nardi box the steering wheel came in ... nothing . Argh , where 's the instructions ? ! Anyways , was hoping someone could help me with this . <p> Need to figure out where to ground the yellow and black wires and how to basically get the black screw cover on and horn . Please see below <p> Here 's the horn <p> Here 's the screw cover <p> Here 's an adaptor ( which i think came with the quick release , and this little ring thing . <p> Ok , it may look hard but it 's really not , so be patient and figure things out . You drive an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how i installed my Personal steering wheel , Tom 's horn button , NRG QR hub , and Momo hub . Do at your own risk . <p> 1 ) Make sure horn button fits hub . There are contact points on the back of the horn button , they should touch the NRG hub when the horn is pressed into the hub . If there is play between the inner diameter(ID) of the hub and the outer diameter(OD) of the horn button , you 'll have to make a spacer . <p> 2 ) Once you know the horn button will fit , take your OEM steering wheel and look at the back of it . See that bronze circle that 's screwed down . Unscrew it and remove the wire connector attached to it . <p> 3 ) Take the probe connector ( bronze circle ) and place it on the back of the Momo hub . Does it touch this diameter ? <p> If yes , then you need another spacer ! This time made of plastic or anything that does n't conduct electricity . I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut the top off and use the plastic ring left over.Now tape it or secure it to the bronze circle like this : <p> 4 ) Now connect a 5 " wire with 2 female connectors that have plastic sleeves ( They should 've came with your NRG hub but if you lost them or NRG wanted to take a dump in your Corn Flakes , you 'll have to use electrical tape ) . And connect 1 end to the bronze circle 's tab . Feed the other end through the hole at the bottom of the Momo hub and slide the bronze circle on , like so ( Make sure no metal is touching ) : <p> 5 ) Take the male part of the NRG hub and decide which contact you want to be positive(+) , through the magic of elimination the other will be negative(-) . Now mark it on both sides . <p> 6 ) Connect the 5 " wire 's female end to the positive . <p> 7 ) Cut a wire 1.5 " long and attach a female end on one side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connect the female end of the wire to the negative on the NRG male hub . <p> 9 ) Next put your Momo hub on the steering column ( i do n't have a steering column in my bedroom so you 'll have to imagine it ) . Torque down the nut that holds the hub to the steering column . <p> 10 ) Either sandwich the circle/bolt connecter between the NRG hub and Momo hub or use a bolt to secure it like i have and install the rest of the bolts . <p> 11 ) Take a look at the dimples on the male part of the NRG hub and the balls inside the female part of the NRG hub . Once you 're done snickering , notice the NRG hub will only engage when the balls line up with the dimples . Also notice that the contact points of both the male and female line up . Mark the connecter that lines up with the positive on both sides of the female part of the NRG hub . <p> 12 ) Cut a wire 1 " long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle/bolt connector on the other . Attach the female end to the negative on the NRG hub and the circle/bolt connector to one of the little screws sticking out from the NRG hub . ( see above pic ) <p> 13 ) Bolt your steering wheel to the NRG hub , slide the rubber sleeve back on the Momo hub , and press on your horn button . YOU 'RE DONE ! <p> You 're welcome and thanks . I wrote that at 4:00 in the morning after work so hopefully i got it all right . One thing i did forget to mention was that the Momo hub i used was from a 93 Celica , i do n't see there being a difference between this one and one for a Corolla . Maybe length ? Anywho , enjoy .

I 've noticed it happens once the engine has warmed up . The issue is the truck will start to hesitate like mad - no change if more throttle is applied . If I 'm just cruising at a consistent rate and let off the throttle the truck will start to buck/shutter ; almost as if I 'm braking then giving it gas over and over really fast ( hope this makes sense ) . But will also buck/shutter once I 'm back on the throttle . It 'll do this in any gear and does n't appear to only happen at certain rpm 's . <p> Any idea 's of where to go from here ? I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get it replaced asap ; though given this issue is n't consistent I 'm having my doubts a new filter will help .

Hopefully going to get around to replacing the fuel filter tomorrow if it 's nice out . <p> Tried another fix my dad suggested a while back and have been running it like that for the last month with no return of the hesitating issue at all .

It does not have to look pretty but I do n't want to duct tape a garbage bag on it . It 's not a show car . <p> Ideas I 've had so far : -drill holes for bolts and nuts , use some type of flexible plastic cut to fit with silicone -some type of adhesive with flexible plastic cut to fit ? <p> I do n't want to get get metal welded in , cost is a major factor , just need it done cheap to get the weight off the roof . <p> I would cut to size and layer ( cross the grain ) some of that 3/16 " corrugated plastic they use for election signs and **** , maybe add a piece of sheet metal for stiffness if needed . Stick them together and seal it in with urethane . Snug like a plug . <p> Perhaps a pre-fitted piece of 3M styro. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , painted and sealed in . <p> I strongly disagree sunray , I 'll post the weight of the moonroof and its assembly and the weight of the replacement " roof " to this thread when I 'm done . <p> A sheet of aluminum that large sounds expensive . Well , not that expensive but plexiglass or lexan sounds cheaper . Where does one get butyl rubber ? What form is this material in ? <p> Darren , I do n't want to plug it and bondo it over , I just want to seal it . Corrugated plastic is an interesting idea , but the way I would do it ( one sheet on top ) probably is n't suited for that material ( the center will catch air ; friction ) . Plus , it probably wo n't be able to distribute pressure evenly from the nuts and bolts to form a seal with the silicone or this butyl rubber thinger because of its flexible characteristics . <p> Thanks for the input so far , it 's looking like lexan/plexiglass and bolts so far . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone knows where I can get a sheet of rubber gasket type stuff ? <p> I was hoping to get more input on stong " automotive " adhesives . There was once this guy who told me about how strong this stuff is , and can hold metal together ? <p> I have a 24 ga . aluminum panel riveted in place of my sunroof ... weighs much less . Drill out the oversized panel then use it as template to drill out the top of your car . Use extra long 1/8 aluminum rivets . You have to make sure the rivets go through both body layers there ( although if yours is a dealer optioned moonroof it may not be double layered ) . When you rivet it on use sealant ... silicone or weather seal .. sandwiched between . Then ... and this is the important part ... seal the edge where the car meets the new metal from inside the car . Any fabrication shop should be able to help you with the aluminum . Mine fits well at 33x17 ( but mine was a factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a crime . <p> You could use windshield sealant , 12 bux last time I did my windshield at autovalue . My guess is lexan or plexi will be more expensive than anything up to 1/8 thick aluminum ... which is about 3 times as thick as you 'd need . <p> An electric sunroof off an older Celica or Supra weighs 22 lbs including the motor and entire frame assembly which is glued to the inside of the roof . I suggest that you cut a small sheet of 22 gauge steel the exact size of the opening , brace it up flush to the roof from underneath with a couple of thin aluminum ribs ( like from an old window screen frame ) that attach to the old sunroof mounting points and blend the new panel into the roof line with a bit of body filler and paint . It will save you 10 lbs. , wo n't flap in the wind and it will look good . The rivet idea is also simple and easy . Just bevel the rivet area before drilling and fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flush with the roof line . Personally , I would just weld in a panel . It will take 15 minutes of welding once the prep work is done . Dentman <p> Just keep the metal part of the sunroof and weatherstrip in and just take fiber glass and put it around the outside then sand it like a whore Nd then some bondo sand like whore Nd take the metal frame thing off on the inside to save ur weight Nd then just put some Fiberglas Nd bondo on the inside too it will hold with that ... But the that part is only about 20 pounds or so .... I guess if you do it this way you do n't need to buy anything and it will still look pro Nd natural ... You probably do n't even need to fiberglass Nd bondo the outside of the car if you put brackets <p> Pro Form Pliogrip is hands down the best epoxy I 've ever used . It 's automotive adhesive and it 's stupid strong if you prep right . It 's used for bonding body panels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricy at $50 a tube , plus you need mixing tips .

In the end my 16 dollar hose cost me almost 60 dollars . <p> If you 're in/near to a border city you can actually tell the courier you 'll be self clearing and have them hold it for you , then you drive to their location , pickup the paperwork , drive to customs , fill out some forms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show them paperwork and take your package .. <p> but , from a hazy memory , I believe this all has to happen at the packages first entry into Canada , so if it lands in a Vancouver sorting center and then gets forwarded to Victoria , it has to happen in Van .. but I could definately be mistaken .. <p> I just paid for a XTD clutch from aimco clutch on ebay , about 2 days ago . I got an email today saying that they already started shipping via UPS ! ! ! wtf why are they using UPS if they know us canadians are going to get owned with customs fees ? <p> BTW the guy from aimco i messaged said " alright we will put gift on the form " , little did he know i already have received the confirmation email with the ups tracking number . <p> Most ebay sellers/suppliers have UPS accounts so it 's cheaper for them to ship via Brown instead of USPS/Fedex .

@@8344834 @1544834/ @qwx111434 <p> Howdy , So I 've got the 4agze swap for sale . This is a COMPLETE DROP IN SWAP to an ae86 . It includes almost everything under the hood , clutch , transmission , and all required harnesses wired by Rob at Project Omega Speedworks in Edmonton . This is a low kilometer ( 65,000km ) JDM smallport 4agze from an ae92 ; it has the sc12 supercharger , 8.0:1 forged dished pistons and rods , DLI ( Distributorless Ignition ) , and tons of other fancy stuff . The engine has been compression tested , and I performed a leakdown test that showed excellent results . The supercharger is in exceptional condition , it spins freely by hand , the supercharger oil is super clean , and the supercharger clutch engages/disengages smoothly . All gaskets are good with no leaks , oil pan is mint ; even the oil pan bolts still have the goldy galvanized shine to them . The engine previously belonged to Rokubes , who purchased and hand picked up from JDM Source a while back . <p> I have no problem shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buyers responsibility , obviously . If the buyer picks up I will include two spare 4age motors . One needs a rebuild and the other is in good shape with 240k . I can also toss in a whole bunch of other free parts that I 'm sick of having lay around . <p> My reason for selling , I 've got the opportunity to put a SR20DET in my Corolla , and I 'm not turning it down this time . <p> As of right now the car has a hunting idle , it will idle up and down between about 1100-1300rpm . It is pulling code 41 for the TPS . I removed the TPS when I flipped the intake elbow 180 degrees and re-installed the TPS at full tilt the one side , so I 'm confident this is my issue . Nothing serious , it just needs to be reset to the proper position and if the TPS is shot they can be found on Toyota Pickups with the 22re . Also , the engine is off timing and will need to be timed , somehow my timing gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to get around to this issue as well . <p> If anyone has any questions or concerns feel free to PM me , or call me on my phone . Like previously stated , I have no problems shipping the setup on a pallet , but of course it will be the buyers expense . Like said before as well if you pick it up locally I will include two spare 4age engines , and a whole bunch of other parts I can throw in . I feel that my price is fair , if you have any negative feedback address it via PM . <p> Nice setup and very good price . This will be a good deal for whomever goes for it . <p> Are you sure it 's a smallport head on there ? Everything about that motor looks like a largeport version to me .

I usually just leave the pump in the hole just pulled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap door open .... then stick it back in and keep filling ...... but it usually shuts off in a couple of seconds ... do it a couple of times and eventually the gas starts to seep out the top of the filler hole . <p> It is possible that there is some kind of build up in the tank taking up valuble room for fuel ... similar to like putting something in the toliet bowl so it does n't use as much water . but to account for a 2-3 gallon difference would mean there 's a bunch of junk in there .... and I think you 'd have lots of other problems . <p> So the most likely assumption is that your gas gauge reads faulty , and when it says empty it is really still got a quarter tank . though I would n't count on that last bit of gas until you can truly prove it by driving till the enigne wont start LOL ..... take a gas can with you LOL . <p> now in regards to your gas mileage you getting an estimated 20.75 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly though is 24 miles per gallon . when I first got the car it was soo badly tunned I was getting like 18 . <p> I run all my tires excessivly high on psi ( pounds per square inch ... incase you guys use a different measurement ) the door jam sticker called for like 30-32 psi I 'm currently running about 42-46 psi ... harder ride , in the rain easier to loose control but also a tad bit easier steering and the car feels ( not factually proven ) feels a bit more zesty <p> anything that can cause a drag or drain on the engine will make your gas mileage go down ... some will be noticeable some will not . I 've replaced my wheel bearings and completely repacked them when I first got the car ......

Other light rims would be rims from vehicles built to be econmical .... the civic VX/HX rims I hear are light , and I know for a fact the 1st gen prius rims are incredibly light .... 2nd gen prius quite a bit heavier .... plus 5 bolt pattern . <p> moving on ..... Lubrication lighter weight easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mobil 1 synthetic oil . lightest oil I 've seen is rated at 0-5w ... some say this is so thin that it will easily seep out of any holes you have . some people say that thicker oil will fill in old bearing gaps better and make your car more torquery .... personally I keep using mobil 1 you can even add oil additives if you like ..... I 've used the MOA from BG it 's good . you can even use the seafoam treatments to get as much gunk out of th emotors as possible . <p> other places of lubrication would be your transmission ..... make sure the gear oil is at it 's recommended leavel and the oil is fresh . most recommend I think the 75-90w stuff . I have n't yet tried the synthetic out , but I want to try it . I tried the lucas oil thickener addtive and was n't really impressed . the rear diff another place for gear oil . I have n't been under teh car in a long time but I think the driveshaft has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pumps of fresh grease in here might not be a bad idea . <p> would make sure your rear brakes are n't over adjusted .... that will cause a significant drag on your engine .... make sur the front calipers are functioning properly and not dragging as well . <p> the a/c compresor is a drag .... I have compeletly removed mine but mostly due to the fact that it leaked not for power .... I would much prefer having a/c in southern cali climate . your clutch fan also counts as a small drag ... minor really but if you wanted to you could remove it and hook up electric fans that are controlled by a tempature switch . but since your using more power it causes your alternator to work more thus you get some of the drag back which is why I encourage the temp control switch because it will turn the fan(s) off at times . <p> make sure the power steering pump ( if applicable ) is full too .... if that pup does n't have to work double time it 's less of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during hard turning like parking lot turning . <p> fresh coolant too for the same reason of keeping ps fluid in the ps resivor. make sur the water pump is functioning correctly . keeping the engine at proper temp and moving smoothly in theory would help with efficeny <p> moving on ... yet again ..... having a clean fuel filter is a good idea though does n't really help much but a carb that is running rich or leaking fuel will cause your mileage to go down . make sure your APP diapgram is n't leaking .... stand on the passenger side ofr car look at carb with air cleaner removed a small circle device is sxcrewed to the side of the carb with 3 screws and has a vacuum line coming out ..... pull the vacuum line inspect for fuel .... keep vacuum line attached to the app and either suck or find a way to suck if fuel comes out replace that diaphrgam. if you 'd like too run seafoam through the gas tank and through the carb as described in another post ... in how to 's .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dead on normal running is ( with vacuum advance disable ) at normal operating temp 5 degrees before top dead center . you said you replaced spakr plugs good ... make sure they are gapped properly even if they come pregapped I 'd double check . if your spakr plug wires are old , cracked whatever ... get some new ones if you 'd like you can replace your distributor cap and rotor ( simple tune up stuff ) <p> Go throuhg your vacuum lines make sure they are fit snuggly and are cracked or leaking .... replace as needed <p> now on to the last section ..... a bit more complicated section . When was the last time the valve lash was adjusted ? I think adjusting this is a good thing ..... toyota manuel calls for it to be done about once very 15 to 30k miles depending on how severe the driving is you do . will need a vavle cover gasket to get this done . if valve lash is too tight then the vavles are nt closing completely and you could be loosing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is used to push the piston down . though mostly you 'd probably be experiencing other issues as well . <p> next would be mechanical timing ..... my timing belt tension gernaded on me and caused the timing belt to skip a tooth and thus my car ran like crap could n't go above 55mph and used gas like crazy . replaced the blet and tension ( recommended to be done ever 60k for out cars ) and that was a big help . <p> with how old our cars is I 'd do a compresion test and a leak down test .......... these together give a better indication of the engine then they do by themselves ..... could determine if you have internal problems with like vavle seats or pistons rings and stuff . there are also some vacuum tests you can perform to do a similar function ... though not sure where my info on that procedure went . <p> you said you already did the air filter you could try geting more air in there but this could just cause more fuel to get sucked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lid over so a bigger area of air gets to the filter . some like using the K&amp;N filter . <p> if you want to you can advance your timing though with 87 octane pump gas I would n't go farther then 28-30 degrees before top dead center with vacuum advance attached . <p> I purchased a 8 dollar park called a fuel master from harbor fright ... basically its like 2 magnets that go on teh outside of the fuel line heading into the carb and supposedly ionizes the fuel to make it easier to burn ..... you can get it if you like though it does n't appear to perform as advertised .... big suprise LOL. there are a multitude of products out there that claim to get better mileage like the tornado , another device attachs to all your spark plugs wires another device from the description creates a regulated vacuum leak and thus thins out the air mixture a bit , another devise perform like the fuel master but goes on your coolant hoses . I have yet to try any of those products but who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and get that fuel milage up . <p> p.s .

Weld ( JB weld can work if do it right ) it to the throttle arm for the weber carb in the appropriate orientation . Put welded component onto weber carb . Use all the stock throttle cable attachment points and thread the throttle cable in the stock fashion . Setup the cable as for stock .

There are two wires that activate the fuel cut solenoid on the stock carb , one power and one ground . The solenoid is activated by grounding it through the EFI or emission computer , depending on the vehicle . My 76 Celica with a 20R had a problem with that solenoid circuit somewhere in the wiring harness . Whatever adapter you use for the linkage , make sure that it opens and closes the throttle plates all the way during its range of travel . I had trouble with this on a 32/36 weber installed on my old 1990 p/u . If you can adapt the linkage plate from the stock carb onto the weber , it will probably work best . Dentman <p> Ok , sorry about this . All I have is my iPhone , and I had a lot to do today . I will do my best with what I have . <p> Here is your typical 32/36 DGEV carberator .

It has a detailed little drawing inside , showing how to use the pieces to recieve a cable . <p> As far as jetting goes . I ca n't remember what comes in the carb from the factory . However I am using the stock jets for now on my 2T-C , and it runs great . On the carb there is a single vacuum source .... Do n't use it . It only has a vacuum signal when the primary opens a touch , making it a poor signal for your vacuum advance on your ditributor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carb/carb mounting plate .

Out of the box it was wrong , and can cause you a lot of grief . With the bouncing around in the box it can go out of adjustment . <p> It is a good idea to carefully inspect the float bowl and brass jets for small metal shavings/dirt that may have fallen in during assembly . I had several small metal slivers in the bottom of my float bowl that could have plugged a jet . <p> Also webers do n't like more than 3psi of fuel pressure .

@@8344860 @1544860/ @qwx111434 <h> 195/50r15 or 205/50r15 + wheel fitment question <p> So I 'm looking to get some new wheels and tires for my car for the upcoming motorsport season . I am thinking for Targa I will be running 225/45r15 Hankook RS3s , but until then I 'll be looking for some cheaper tires to beat around on for the summer . It seems most people with AE86s go with 195/50r15s , but this seems like a very skinny tire for a wider rim . <p> Next comes the question about rim fitment . I 'm getting custom steelies from Diamond Racing Wheels . I was thinking about 9/9.5s , but because I will be running Targa and will be limited to 6 wheels and tires , I do n't think a staggered setup is a great idea . Instead I 'm hoping to run the same size all around ( perhaps with a small spacer in the rear ) . <p> People again seem to run really wide wheels on these cars , but with the tire options available , the fitment looks pretty silly as the tires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go with something like 15x8s with -15 offset or so , the stretch would be reduced . Would the 195s be the best plan with this sort of width ? Should I maybe run a bit more wide wheels instead such as 15x8.5s with a -10 offset ? <p> Need some input guys . I do n't  want any rubbing as the car is going to be at sustained high speed in the road rally . The car has stock fenders and rear 1/4s with a lot of the arches cut out and wide flares fitted . I need to figure on the tire size , and the rim width/offset . <p> In the following pic the car has 16x8 wheels -0 offset with a 30mm spacer in the rear . <p> Oh btw , the car is under hard braking in that picture above , it does n't normally have huge rake like that . Also , yes I 'm aware that my car looks like a rice bucket with all the carbon . Yes I know it needs a paint job , and yes it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that matches stock sizing , so that 's one of the major reasons why ppl run that size . <p> as for your targa wheel set up , since you 're running in a competitive race just run as fat a tire as you can fit under those flares. for 8 " , a 205 or 215 would be nice and meaty . not sure how a 225 would drive on an 8 " wide wheel . for 9 " , 225 for sure . that 's assuming it will all fit under the flares w/o rubbing . <p> OP , how worried about cool fitment are you ? i 'm guessing you 're a grip racer so i 'll give my opinion so . I would stick to 8j . The tire sizes you 're dealing with will be fine for that not to mention cheaper and less rotational weight . as for offset , i would do -12 or zero and run a spacer in the rear if you 'd like . do n't go more negative because i feel it detracts from handling in the front . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that i just typed . to some of us , looking cool is half the battle . <p> Well after checking into a few things , I 'm planning on picking up 6 Diamond Pro Series 15x8s in -12 offset . I might run a small spacer in the back , like 15 mm or so . For tires for now I 'm thinking a set of 205/50R15 Nitto NeoGens . I 've never tried this tire before , but appearently its a decent mid range tire . For Targa I 'll swap on some new gripper tires like Direzza StarSpecs . <p> As far as fitment/grip , I 'm looking for something that will make the car handle well over look good . That said , I 'd like to get some decent fitment if at all possible . I rather the car not look silly with sunk in wheels . <p> Until Targa in September I 'll use my extra two Diamond steelies for my new M/T full drag slicks .

Its what i 've been running on the V8 for the last coupe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XS this year <p> Thanks for the input Steve . The reason I 'm running the same size all around is because you 're only allowed 6 wheel/tires for Targa , so I pretty much need universal fitment front and rear . I 'm going to be looking for a set of street wheels some time next winter , so I 'll likely pick up a set of 9 inch wide Works then with more agressive fitment . 
@@8344861 @1544861/ @qwx111434 <h> " Project Turquoise " aka Tommy 's little peanut ... <p> Like some of you might already know , I exchanged my 1977 orange TE31 for a new ( older ) 1974 KE20 <p> Body wise , it 's pretty neat , only holes are in the rockers ... <p> And I need to correct a past repair on the front driver fender for it to fit perfectly <p> So overall , it 's pretty decent . There is a couple of bubble starting to appear here and there , but nothing rotten . The goal was to not have a lot of body work to do in order to not have to spray the whole car . Coupled with the fact that the blue paint is a lot more " fade resistant " than the orange that was on the TE , I should be able to get away with local repair ( those that have already been done really blend well with the original paint so it should n't be different with my futur repair . <p> ... and you guys better get use to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strut towers because I have no intensions of swapping it out <p> It has a front aftermarket sway bar .... <p> ... and a rear <p> Inside is pretty decent ... <p> And I even carried my old steering wheel . I have a 3 mecanical gauge pod that fits like a glove in the original ashtray hole , so no puzzle with that ! <p> What 's worst with the car is the floor <p> I really elieve that it wasn , t worst that that before the repair ... luckily , there is no rot or hole like in the TE , but htere is a lot of surface rust inside and out , so I 'll need to take care of that fast before it really gets ugly . Both frame rail by the tranny are shot like on the TE ... like they say : been there , done that ... even got the t-shirt ! <p> And there is a little rust under the driver fender , on the support and the lower rad support is shot , but one again , nothing visible so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The car currently has a 4 speed K40 tranny , but it came with a 5 speed K50 ... ( nice difference next to the W40 ... and I 'm not even talking about weight ) <p> The problem is : the dude who sold me the car was probably unaware that cast alloy piece are not strong and if the holes are not aligned , it 's not a good thing to torque the bolt to try to force it ... <p> But it was in need of a rebuild , some of the bearing inside are very noisy and the yoke bushing is not in good shape ... so it 'll probably turn out as my winter project ! <p> So the plan is to start with what I already have : the suspension ... <p> The car as a shot front hub . The last owner probably did n't take car of a shot bearing and now the race is shot and the bearing are loose inside . Anyway , those KE came with 8 " solid brake disk and 4x110 bolt pattern .. so the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front suspension swap , along with the 9 " 1/4 vented disk . The diff is probably a 6 " U diff ( although it could be a 5.7 " B diff since I do n't have the vin plate in the engine bay and their is no real way to identify them visually without taking them apart ... ) . All that I know is that it has a 4.222:1 ratio and 4x110 bolt pattern ... and that my TRD LSD does n't fit in . So the plan is to find a narrow 6.38 " S diff and rebuild it with all the bearing that are already chilling in a box here ... and slap my LSD at the same time . <p> That 's it for all ... futur plan are not decided yet . I have an aftermarket cam for the 3K and I have all the intensions of using it but hte rest is unsure ... although an old plan could rise again form teh depth : the stupid silvertop intake that has been gattering dust in the basement for close to 10 years ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the suspension , rust and tranny ... the rest will come later ... <p> Looks good . That 3k is super tiny ! Haha I 'm getting used to the way the 3sg looks in my mango , forgot how small the old engines are . Big cam , itb , efi ! ? ! ? ! ? <p> Hey , I 'm used at seeing a 2T-B in there and I 'm supprised every time I pop the hood ... good thing is that the engine and tranny must weight something close to 200lbs . But yeah , that 's exactly the plan <p> Originally Posted by sunray <p> 150e ? ? Lol <p> Damn , that would be my dream ... but I think they made under 20 of them and half are resting in museum ... but if you have one laying around , I might be intereseted lol <p> On a other note , I have that strange cam here ... here goes the story ! <p> When I brought the car home after the trade , the last owner threw a bunch of junk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some kind of cam designed for an Opel that supposedly fitted the 3K ... I was doubtful but hey free stuff is free <p> So I investigated that .... nowhere have I read about the use of anything other that K cam in a K engine . So I ended up opening the packaging and got the cam out . Surely it looks like a K cam , cam lobes fit the valve arrangement , their is a center gear desinged to turn the distributor and even the cam for the fuel pump is there . I have no other 3K cam laying around , but I compared it visually to some example I found on the interwebz and I swear , it looks really like a 3K cam ( I 'll take picture later ) . What I do n't have is a shop manual ( the one I bought has n't showed up yet ) so I have no standard journal dia or cam lobe measure to compared it to . I also have no spacing between the cam lobs or bearing journals to compare it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ... and here is where it gets weird ... There is a marking on one end that reads : " E-11 ENEM " . So I googled that thing and sure enough , I came on a wed page in norwegian or something I have no idea how to read and here it is , cam grind for Opel CIH engine ... but " CIH " stands for " Cam in Head " , so I googled a couple image of those cams ( stock or what ever ) and like I thought , there is no provision for a gear in the center since the dist is placed near the belt cover , and there is no cam for the fuel pump since the engine must use an electric one . <p> The company ( ENEM ) makes a ton of cams , but the E11 code only show up in the Opel CIH cam listing ... <p> So I 'm pretty sure that 's not an Opel cam and I 'm pretty convinced it is a 3K cam ... ENEM does n't make anything else that 3S-GTE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have a 3K regrind following the specs of that E11 ENEM opel cam . I 'll need to crunch some numbers to find out first , but that would be my best educated guess ... <p> Bumping the compression by going 0.060 " over with stock flat pistons and by shaving head/block/both ( what ever is the most cost effective ) and throwing some ITB running off a MS2 I have in pieces in the basement could make that cam pretty neat ... I 'll just have to go though head work first like I did on the 2T head ... here I go again lol <p> P.S. anyone has a spare skinny 71-73 KE20/TE21 rear bumper what ever the condition ... I 'm in the market for one <p> And here is how an Opel CIH cam looks like ( the cam that those marking are supposed to go with ) <p> Apart from being an other non-crossflow engine with the same valve arrangement , the rest is just wrong ... journal placement and all ... so it 's not an Opel cam like I was told ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure looks exactly like that ... here is that top picture just to be able to compare them ... <p> So I 'll have to setup to measure lift and duration on that cam in order to find out what those numbers are for real ... but if someone took the time to mark them with some kind of code that 's linked to an aftermaket Opel cam grind , I guess it must have something in common with it ... <p> Uniqueness I guess ... but crappier ? Depends how you look at it ... with a stroke of 73mm using the 4A rods , you end up with a rod/stroke ratio of 1.67 instead of the 1.58 in the stock 4A for even more rev happiness ... will it be more powerfull with 100cc less displacement ? I doubt it . But it will probably be a little less heavy to compensate ... I 'd rock one for sure <p> Well , I 've been on vacation with the family so nothing really happened here . <p> I sourced AE86 hub and PS knuckles to go with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear S 6.38 " diff with 4.1:1 ratio so I can use my LSD and dump all new bearings and brake on since I already bought them . I just need to go get that stuff . <p> So nothing has been done on the suspension . But last evening I was alone so I ended up tearing that ST intake manifold apart in order to clean those throttle bodies that have been gattering dust here for too long ... problem is they gathered humidity to , so they need quite a cleaning . <p> I have a little questions on the TBs themself : <p> There are some vaccum port on the underside that end up right under the throttle plate in a very tiny port . Those ports are normally connected to a common vaccum rail and seem to be part of the EVAP system ( although I have never worked with 20V so it 's more of an educated guess ... ) <p> But 2 out of the 4 throttle bodies also have a vaccum port on top that emerge behind the plate where the TB meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work on the throttle opener and FPR but 2 of the TBs have undrilled holes . <p> The question is concerning how to get a MAP reading . Is it possible to use the lower tiny port ( although I do n't think it is ) or do I need to drill the 2 extra upper port and use all of them on a common rail to plug the MAP sensor on ... <p> - On a BT , how is the MAP connected on the TB ? <p> - For those that run BT ECU on ST , what do you do to plug the MAP ? ( and do n't forget that I 'm not running the stock manifold with injector/fuel rail and the other vaccum port ) <p> Well , been very busy but got a hold of my AE86 PS knuckle and hub , clean the heack out of them , now they are ready for paint . I need to figure out if I can press AE86 ball joint in my KE20 LCA , as soon as I have a definitive answer on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the T3 adpater bushing for my stock balljoint . That the only missing piece of the puzzle for the suspension . <p> Apart from that , I was trying to figure out how the heck I was going to mount some injectors on that 3K . Siamese intake port spacing makes for a real headache in trying to find a fuel rail that will fit ... <p> ... and then having to fab all the lower manifold with bungs and all , not what I call simple ... so I wet with the idea of going with standoff injectors but one again , mounting hte fuel rail and all was going to be a real nightmare ... and then while looking at a picture of the 150e engine I got an idea <p> Just mounting the injectors right in the velo stack with no fuel rail in the way , makes for a really clean look ... then I remembered my old days of dealing with S12 ... <p> SOHC CA engine like the CA20E and CA18ET use really weird injectors ( the same as on the EFI datsun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but have a barbed tube that is used to plug a hose to link the injector to the fuel rail ... <p> So I thought : " Hey that could be much easier to fit on there " ... plus if those injectors can fuel a 1.8L turbo engine , I guess fueling my 1166cc N/A should n't be much of a problem ... <p> Just make a nice bracket to hold the injector in the velostack and mount the SOHC CA fuel rail some other place and just link the 2 together with EFI hose ... <p> So I mocked it up ... OK , it 's only a cut up coat hanger , not the real bracket ... it 's a sidefeed injector from a silvertop 4A-GE and I have no velo stack ... yet . But let 's just pretend those were all the right things ... and here is how it should look ... <p> Well had some time today to play on it a little ... well really , I only painted my knuckles and hubs , but in between the coat , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that was slack ) for two reasons : <p> 1 - Inspect why the heck it was loose <p> 2 - To gain better acces to the balljoint and measure it to compare to an AE86 balljoint in order to find out what I 'm going to do with this . <p> Well guys , when a bearing gets noisy , donc do like the PO , change it ! <p> Here is what must have happened ... bearing blew , nobody cared and drove on and it welded the inside to the outer race . Tthere is a brand new bearing in so I have no idea , but it 's pretty easy to figure out by looking at this ... <p> The inside of the hub is melted and now the outer race is loose and you can push the outer race a good 1/4 " inward since the lip that holds it in place has melted and was pushed inwards . And unlike what the PO told me , there is nothing to rebuild here , unless one wants to weld 2 inchs of metal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the spindle took a beating too ... <p> This is where the seal sits , it 's all f@cked up and the metal has turned bleu cause of the heat . The section of spindle that is between both bearing has heated too and the metal also changed color . <p> Good thing I did plan on reusing the whole stock suspension ... <p> Apart from that , the definitive anwser on the balljoint is that you can not use a AE86 balljoint in a KE20 LCA . The part that is pressed in in 36mm dia on my KE and I measured 41mm on a spare AE balljoint ... and even if I wanted to machine my LCA 5mm bigger , the LCA itself is n't wide enough so it 's a no go except if I wanted to do major fab work , which is not worth it IMO for what it is . <p> So I 'll have to order some T3 bushing adapeter ... if I had a mill here I 'd make some , but I do n't ... so it 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has some 3/4 " stailess rod and wants to machine me a set for less ... <p> So that 's all for now , I hope to have more time to play on the KE in the following week . <p> ball joint are not the same on my te27 as they are on my ae86. joint is smaller on the te27. lower arms are longer on the te27 &amp; shorter on the ae86 . I suspect your lower arms and ball joints will be the same . note ; on my te27 the ae86 struts bolt straight on the te27 knuckle no problem . just swap over the te27 strut top to the ae86 strut . hope this helps . Gary <p> Thanks Gary , I know all about that . We indeed have the same balljoint ( 12mm bolt and tapper ) and 335mm or so LCA ( about 30mm longer than AE86 ones ) ... But TE2X have a 85mm knuckle to strut bolt spacing , the same as all other TE and AE86 as my KE has 80mm lower bolt spacing so AE86 suspension does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours so I also need to swap it but it will bolt on no problem ) . <p> If I could get a hold of TE2X knuckle , it would be bolt on , but all I could find were AE86 PS knuckle which are closest in length as the E2X ( 115mm from balljoint to tie rod , stock is 110mm ) but use the later 14mm bolt and tapper balljoint . T3 sell adapter to fit over the E2X smaller balljoint and fill the gap in a knuckle that bolts on the bigger balljoint used on all other Corolla after 1974 . <p> But if someone has TE2X knuckles and could get them to me for less than 60$ shipped , I guess I could redo the painting job on those knuckles and sell my newly painted AE86 PS one to someone else ... <p> at this point i would just use the ae86 lower arms and knuckles . get some ae86 lower arms and lengthen them to same as your ke or this also gives you an opportunity to add extra length for more camber. i use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arm to strengthen . I know you can , i have seen your wheel welding projects . <p> I think you are going to have terrible economy and low end driveability with the injectors that far away and on the other side of the throttle plates .

I had two other builds that had been here for a while needing completion , as well as two critically rusty pinch welds behind the front window on two of my daily drivers . I 've managed to also secure a better job ( albeit with much longer hours ) about three months ago . <p> Where I 'm getting started on is the front hood and also the rear hatch . These are the last two key components to finish before I can bodywork the metal . The bumpers I plan on finishing closer to the completion of the metal panels as then I 'll know where exactly the lines are supposed to follow . <p> As far as the hood , I need to reconnect the new portion around the head lights with the back edge as you can see below . It should just need a bit of a triangle with a mild curvature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . I also have to sort the pinch weld along the edges as well as tie in the side frame area ( probably all has to be done before I finish that back triangle area ) . Inside the hood scoop needs a small panel to finish it off , then any other structure on the back side I find necessary . <p> The back window I 've decided to ditch in favor of a smaller one . This has two benefits : easier to make hinges/latch for the hatch , and adds more structure to the firewall . I 've just mocked it up with paper for now , I 'll have to decide what shapes to use , where to add bends for structure , mounts for hinges , hinge design , etc . <p> I spent a lot of time debating the blind spot aspect of this modification , but it actually does n't affect any visibility that is n't already removed by the addition of the hatch . <p> I found some new hinges at the junkyard and made mounts for them , still going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slim and pretty way of putting hinges at the top of the hatch . I 'm going to run a dual latch that 's on the interior of the car for the top of the hatch edge . <p> I also decided to re-purpose an old piece of reinforcement I hammered out before redesigning the trunk . I 'm thinking I can roll it out pretty nice on the english wheel . Tomorrow I 'll work on the hinge mount to hatch area . I hope to finish the inner hatch structure this week . <p> Hinges are from the trunk of an Audi A6 . They look to be the same on the A4 . The style allows the trunk to raise entirely before pivoting , rather than just hinging at one point . Very necessary in order for the hatch to go up and then over the filler piece that will be between the tail lights . <p> Last week was super busy for me , I have alternating long and short weeks at work so it was the long one , that only left me with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the inner hatch structure designed and the two primary rails for the hinge mount fabricated . They are ready to weld on together and then weld onto the hatch window frame . I cut the old trunk design off and got a 48 " x20 " sheet to roll on the English wheel for a new trunk . I got A LOT of time this weekend so I want to get the hatch to open and close by Sunday . I may or may not start the trunk skin this weekend .

A car guy is not meant to daily a duramax and enjoy it In 2011 I had a 1995 JDM STi that was amazing , but the deal of a lifetime came up to acquire my ( eventual ) first rally car . So I sold the 95 STi and went down to the states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck and trailer , so I bought those , limiting fun summer toy cash . After crashing ( rolling off a cliff ) the rally talon ( $$$$ ) , I picked up a 2002 WRX rally car with a completely V8 spec C STi swap ( $$$$$$$$ ) and raced that . After blowing up a clutch , and then crashing into a tree in the winter of 2012 , costing more $$$$$$$ to fix , 2013 was deemed a " break " year . And then in 2014 , life was pretty hectic so I did n't do a single event . I 've always said that owning a race/rally car will cause you to want to have a completely boring daily driver , and that 's exactly what happened to me ... for a while . Money , time , and ability has made the racing schedule much easier along with life in general , which leads me to now ... <p> This past summer the itch has been strong for a toy that can just be driven , not worrying about perfection for a race or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor like the truck . I 've been browsing Kijiji on and off , but I really wanted something CHEAP and COOL . A tough combo to come by in this province . As the picture above shows , I think I found what I was looking for ! <p> The car has a 3TC in it rebuilt with hi-comp pistons and dual weber sidedrafts that have actually been PROPERLY SETUP . It sings ! Great bottom end too , love the 3TC . I had a 1981 te72 probably 8 years ago that was a piece of crap , but did a couple of TSD 's in it for fun and really liked the car . This car is a better version of that in every way ! <p> I do n't really know what I am going to do with the car . It was in a hit and run that wrecked the passenger side taillight and pushed the rear valance in a little , so that needs to get fixed . It definitely has some tidying up to be done . I 'll either clean the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or it gets a 2.0L ecoboost swap next year . I 've been seeing a lot of success with them in the states in various cars , and Ford Racing now offers a standalone control and wiring kit for them . Who knows , I certainly do n't ! I 'm just excited to be bombing around in this Corolla , it makes me extremely happy <p> It was for sale for approximately a gazillion dollars ( aka $5500 ) . Then it was rear ended , and the owner just wanted it gone . He had it advertised for $3500 at the beginning of the week . We ended up agreeing on $2300 , which to me is a great deal for a rust free anything , let alone a corolla And boy does it put a smile on my face , this thing is hilarious , could n't stop running it up to redline <p> Originally Posted by Spence <p> Looks sick <p> Thanks Spence !

Any higher than that , and there were plenty of other cool cars I could buy . It was a very different buying experience , not wanting any car in particular . This just worked out really well , I am really falling for this car ( good replacement for the ex which I dumped in the spring lol ) <p> I am awful at this build thread stuff , I need to remember to take pictures <p> Fiddled with the idle adjustment screws on the webers , carbs are so easy to tune its not even funny . Car idles really great when hot now , its actually smooth ! Also cleaned the re-usable filters and oiled them , as well as did a general cleanup ( do n't want to say " detailing " as there is still goobers here and there ) around the intake assembly so I could find any leaks easier . Seemed like all of the carb to intake runner nuts were loose so I tightened the **** out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The header collector gasket to the rest of the exhaust was blown out and the bolts were loose , so I went to JBs and got a new gasket . Installed that last night , along with welding on an additional exhaust hanger as the front flange was being used as a support which puts WAY too much stress on the header . <p> Car is much less ghetto-bucket sounding and only the good noises . Unfortunately the header gasket needs to be replaced as some of the bolts came loose and blew that gasket out So at lower rpms you get the distinct ticking of a header leak . <p> Final fun fact , I thought I ran the car out of gas as the previous owner said that the gas tank is " empty " at the 3/4 empty mark . I was still above it , but after firing the car up while working on the rallycar , it died and I could n't get it started again . I filled the tank with some old race fuel ( VP MS109 ) and tried again but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into a bottle , seemed awfully weak flow . So I bypassed the filter and it fired up I also took out all of the spark plugs and checked the cap/rotor for wear and tear . The front two cylinders are " probably " running lean , the back two rich . Additionally , the rear #4 cylinder spark plug boot came out with a loud " BLOOP ! " and lots of oil ... I think the valve cover gasket needs to be replaced I cleaned it up as best as I could and put everything back together . I 'll be replacing the fuel filter with one off a 5.0L Ford truck/mustang , a trick I learned from the good ol ' turbo firefly days for a nice , long lasting high flow filter for dirt cheap ( like $6 ) <p> Only pic I have is at my garage where the madness happens . Two Subarus ( one the rally car ) , a Suzuki Swift GTi road race car , the dmax car hauler , and the Corolla . I think I have a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have to be in great shape , be properly sized/jetted , and if the carb is worn out/has vacuum leaks , you wo n't get anywhere . <p> Then follow the guide exactly . The beauty is you do n't  need to use special tools ( except synchronizing ) . The only real " art " to carb tuning is using spark plugs for monitoring how lean or rich you are . A wideband would be ideal , but it never hurts to run a little rich .

Swapped over the shift shafts and forks for the tailshaft housing that fits my car . The 20 spline shaft has a locknut on the rear bearing , and the 22 spline shaft has snapring . So there are some differences in the shaft other than the spline count . I might strip them both down to just the shafts and measure the bearing races . <p> I 'm almost tempted to just use the 22 spline shaft and get the driveshaft modded .

@@8344880 @1544880/ @qwx111434 <h> Weber 40mm DCOE install on 2T-C <p> Hello , <p> I bought a Weber 40mm DCOE setup for my 2T-C powered TE27 . <p> The kit came with a pair of Weber carbs , soft mounts , linkage , Cannon intake manifold , and a good assortment of jets . I purchased a fuel filter / regulator also , bringing the grand total after shipping to $1300.00 <p> Like a kid on Christmas . I quickly unbolted the old intake and carb and tossed it aside . A few hours later ( I was doing this for the first time ) I had the surfaces cleaned , gaskets in place and carbs bolted to manifold through soft mounts , which was mounted to the head . Installing the linkage was easy , but time consuming , as I wanted it perfectly lined up . Because there is no common vacuum source , I had to remove the little springs in the distributor to make it permanently advanced . According to some people I was talking to , a stock 2T-C is fine with 40mm carbs with factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my new filter/regulator then to the carbs.With some minor carb adjustments , and some new timing , I got the car to Idle . <p> Here Is where I ran into some problems <p> 1 . ) Engine vibration makes using the stock throttle linkage attached to the fire wall impossible . My Dad and I are in the process of making a new cable setup . 2 . ) The Carbs backfire like crazy almost no matter what we do for carb adjustment . 3 . ) Aside from the backfiring through the carbs , the engine sounds and runs decently the front two header pipes are cold compared to the back two . <p> After hearing the sound of the engine I got a stiffy , but i had to shut it down because of the carb backfires . I went to my local NAPA dealer and bought new spark plugs , wires , points , rotor , and condenser . I also purchased a high quality under hood in line fuel pressure gauge , so that I can make sure that the adjustable regulator is set to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet because I have not finished the tune up . <p> Has anyone had a similar problem with their webers ? I should add that the stock carb did not have this problem , and it was running up until the webers went on . <p> " stock " jets on a weber dcoe are NEVER correct for any engine especially not a 2tc . The idle jets are particularly lean usually and I bet the chokes are all wrong . <p> The cannon manifold requires that you fab a brace from it to the engine mount otherwise its going to crack . <p> Fab linkage yourself and all will be well . <p> If you drive a lot on the street you will need filters or at least some filter socks otherwise your bores are going to get raped . <p> If you are running a factory mechanical fuel pump then forget about it . Install a good electric pump without delay . Wire it so it has a relay that gets a ground through an oil pressure switch ( like a holley one ) and set the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past 5000rpm . <p> Hooray ! Carbs are very expensive and tim consuming to set-up but can feel pretty good once you get it . @qwx111435 <p> 1 . ) Vacuum advance only works under vacuum which you do not get when you put your foot down . Its just for fuel economy and maybe a little bit more smoothness at the first few % of throttle opening . So put the springs back in , set to around 8-10 degrees at 900rpm . Leave vacuum advance unhooked . <p> 2 . ) Buy a carb synchronizing tool . Get the engine running at around the idle speed you want , and make sure the airflow or vacuum ( depending on what tool you buy ) in each barrel is the same . Adjust the throttle stops until both carbs are matched . Make sure the carbs are unhooked from the linkage while doing all this . <p> 3 . ) Play with the pilot screws until it runs smoothly , and readjust throttle stops , and play with the pilot screws and back and forth until you have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go more than a few turns out on the pilot screw your jet is probably too small but you can still get it to idle nicely . <p> 4 . ) Adjust the linkages so both carbs come off the throttle stops at exactly the same time when you give it throttle <p> Chances are your pilot jet will be wrong , but you ca n't hope to figure that out until you have everything perfectly balanced and the pilot screws set right . Once you get the right pilot jets you can start playing with the main jets and air correctors ! <p> I did some more internet searches last night . According to some 2T-C / Weber users on 3tcgarage , people using webers on an almost or stock 2T-C use : Main jet - 115 Air jet - 200 Idle jet - 50F9 Pump jet - 040 Pump exhaust - 050 <p> A stock Weber 40mm DCOE comes with everything on that list except for the Idle jet . The stock Idle jet is a 45F9 . I phoned up Overseas Auto in Vancouver and ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case . They should be here tomorrow . Because I am currently tuning at sea level , I think 50F9 's should do the trick , however back in Edmonton at over 2100 feet above sea level , I may have to step back down to the 45F9 's . As far as having the Cannon manifold crack , I have never heard of this happening . I am running soft mounts , and even with two carbs hanging off the side of the engine the whole setup does n't seem to weigh much more than the stock manifold and carb . Plus the Cannon intake seems to be well made compared the thin , brittle stock manifold . Sadly I cant use a Carb balancer , due to the lack of room between the velocity stack and the inner fender . This lack of space makes putting a proper filtration system in place difficult . I may have to source out some " socks " for them as I like my pistons to fit snug in their bore . Although I am running the stock fuel pump , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper RPM 's while in the shop , but a road test will be required to make a final conclusion . I do n't want to put an aftermarket fuel pump in the car until after I have installed a racing fuel cell , and relocate the battery to the trunk . That work wont happen until the car gets rebuilt , as I plan on having the car dipped , body worked , and repainted the original colour . As far as the distributor advance being locked out , I did it to create a stronger idle . As of right now the advance is sitting around 30 or so . It makes the engine very snappy coming off idle . <p> Even though the idle jet seems too small to me a more important consideration is what choke size do they have ? I think all these jets and the chokes need to be verified visually before proceeding further . @qwx111435 <p> Backyard , el cheapo carb balance tool . get a length of heater hose , hold one end in front of a velocity stack , hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same at idle if balanced correctly . <p> Gary <p> I have heard of this method , and I may try it once I can get the thing to stop backfiring . I just do n't want to blow my ear off , the backfires are violent . <p> As far as my Choke goes . Choke size on an out-of-the-box 40mm DCOE , is 30mm , and the aux Venturi is 4.5mm . I have checked the jets and emulsion tube , and although not dismantling the choke , I can verify that it is a 30mm . <p> I will have to wait and see , I think my new Idle jets will be here today . I will keep you posted on what happens next . I really want to get the thing going for the car show in Penticten this next weekend . If I do , I will get some vids of the car and how it sounds now with the new carbs . <p> Buy a piece of abs plastic plumbing 90 at a hardware store . Wrap some tape on one end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you have a nifty 90 degree sync tool . <p> Until the carbs are synched you ca n't really tune properly . Then its jetting time . And locked distributors do n't really work properly , not for the street . At 30 degrees btdc its really likely to backfire . If you removed the springs from the counterweights in the dizzy then that was a bonehead move . If you removed the vacuum advance weights to advance the timing then that was also silly . You DO NOT want that advance added to you base timing and your mechanical advance under load with WOT . <p> Its been about 14 years since I ran points and sidedrafts together but they ran strong to 7500rpm depending on the spring tension of a given set of points . @qwx111435 <p> I sync 'd mine by ear and they were spot on . Make sure to constantly pull the plugs to check mixture . <p> Wow , nowhere near that bad , I just did a new tune up . New plugs , wires , points , condencer , cap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get my hands on a set of 50F9 idle jets . So I put in the 55F9 . Now I know that these are too big , as I have my mixture screws almost closed now . <p> Funny thing is when I accidently left my rag draped across the carbs with an elastic holding it , the engine fired up , and ran beautiful . No poping , and it idled at a nicer rpm . I removed the rag and the rpm increased as well as the engine began to pop . I took it for a good thrashing last night And layed about 50ft of rubber . She deffinatly has more power and likes to be driven hard . Anything off idle and it runs like a champ . I am confident that the setup will make it to and from penticten . About 800km round trip . I will be making regular stops because the guys I am rolling with all drive Detroit iron , and have such crazy motors we will have to stop for gas at every station . <p> Funny thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an elastic holding it , the engine fired up , and ran beautiful . No poping , and it idled at a nicer rpm . I removed the rag and the rpm increased as well as the engine began to pop . . <p> Your car is definitely running on the lean side . <p> Those books that say that the idle jet affects the idle mixture screw adjustment are really silly . The idle screw needles have fuel no matter what the jet . Between the idle jet and main air corrector it affects when the main jet kicks in . The idle jet controls tip-in and low-mid rpm mixture . How high it goes depends on the main air corrector and to a lesser degree , the main jet . <p> Want to see how high the idle jet can take you ? Remove the main circuit air correctors , all of them . Then do a road test and part throttle and wide open . See how high it will go . This will let you know how high the idle jet is working . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlap with the idle . @qwx111435

@@8344887 @1544887/ @qwx111434 <h> Lotus Europa with 4AGE <p> Hey folks , <p> I 'm nearing the point of installing the 89 redtop 16v 4age ae92 in my 67 Lotus , and have run against a bit of a brick wall . I 'm hoping that I can find some help here . I have some basic , but important questions about the engine wiring . ( And wiring is not a natural skill for me , so please be patient , there are probably some pretty lame questions to follow . ) <p> When I bought my engine , it came with the engine wiring harness , the computer , the small fusebox containing the three fuses ( 30 , 40 , 80amp ) , and that 's about it . There are some components missing . <p> I 'm trying to figure out what additional electrical parts are required for the EFI and general functioning of the engine . For instance , the wiring diagram shows a cold start injector time switch , ( Toyota no longer carries the switch , and it 's proving to be difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering if a regular relay could be used . ) <p> I have recently picked up the coil , ignitor , and O2 sensor . <p> What else is needed ? <p> The car has been completely rewired , so the original fusebox for the motor may not be required . Not sure though . Again , wiring is not my forte . <p> You will need the COR and I still have one kicking around you can pick it up or pay for postage . When I installed my silver top into my car I lost mine in the build and used a regular relay for a while . I do n't remember wiring in the injector time switch . I THINK It 's wired to the start circuit on my car . <p> Nice clean work on that 4a . I 'd have just jammed it in there as fast as possible and started whipping around town . <p> I had lots of fun simplifying my largeport 4AGE . I traced every wire , drew my own diagram starting at the computer , and ended up getting rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run at WOT though , so it is n't crucial to have some elements . I also removed the cold start injector completely , and anything else that I could get away with ! Next it will be Megasquirt , but till then just having fun . <p> The cold start timer is a temp sensor located under the intake manifold . It 's Brown I think and is mounted next to an identical one that is Green . It just tells the cold start injector how long to stay on . They should be easy to find on any Toyota engine but try to get one from the same year and model if possible . You also need the AFM , if you do n't have it , you did n't mention it . I think they used solenoid resistors on the injectors , so you 'll need one of those ... Depending on what gauge you are using , you might need a speed sensor signal , which is generated in the speedometer , but if you 're not using a toyota speedo I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what was neccessary , was to get the pinout for your ECU and figure out every circuit that the ECU interacts with . If the ECU does n't use it , it 's not required . Club4ag has a bunch of pinouts in their reference section , or you can take the cover off your ECU and read the pinout right off the board . <p> Nice build ... the Europa is one of those cars you either love or hate , it 's like the cool/ugly girl no one wants to date but everyone is friends with . <p> True . Kinda like the MR2 . Or the original Minis . <p> I got ta say though , the S1 Europas are quite beautiful in person . There are some angles that do n't flatter it , but they are few . When Lotus started cutting down the sides , straightening the front fenders , raising the headlights , adding big protruding turn signal warts between the headlights , window pillars , man ...... that 's when things got REALLY weird looking . <p> It 's like comparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What the hell happened ? <p> When I started looking for a Europa , I HAD to find an S1 . Very few have survived though . I think the registry is up to about 70 S1A cars ( which is what mine is ) . There were lots of S2 , TC , and a few JPS that were showing up for sale , but my sights were set on the S1 . <p> I ca n't wait to get this 4AGE installed . The conversion kit is made by a guy in Texas named John Pels , and is top quality . He sells the adaptor plate , header , second idler pulley , motor mounts , and assorted bits and pieces . I also picked up a cable shifter from him . This replaces the sloppy mechano set that runs from the shifter to the transaxle . <p> A lot of helpful folks have been involved in returning this little rarity to the road , and hopefully it will be one of the best S1 's out there . Fast , reliable , and able to out-handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jim <p> I think you will find that it will be much easier if you can pick up the main fuse box assembly . I assembly a Lotus 7 using a 4AGE and you will need the fuel pump and the main injection relay and fuse which is part of the main fuse box assembly . The three fuses that you got with the engine are really the fusibile links in the Toyota wiring harness . You can probably use the old Lotus links . I only used a 40 amp and a 80amp links . I found a good schematic on the 4AGEclub web site for my 1987 EA86 blue top motor . I would also install the cold start , it will make life a lot easier . Before starting the wiring on the car , I strongly suggest that you draw up a complete vehicle wiring schematic . Take your Lotus diagram and the 4age AE86 diagram and blow them up on a copy machine then cut a paste the parts of each diagram that you will be using . Then draw the connecting lines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codes " you will need it for trouble shooting " also if you can buy one of these cheap label makers ; you can label the ends of the wires or buy the electrical stick on numbers . If you use numbers , mark them on your diagram . Last hold off on the final wrapping up of the harness until you have checked all circuits . Just in case , I learned the hard way . When testing just put in one fuse at a time , check the circuit 's function , before going to the next one . Leave the negative battery post connection lose , just in case you have to do a " Quick Disconnect " . The 20 hours you put into the wiring diagram will be the best investment you will make on the rebuild project . Believe me when I say , you will be looking at it way too may times . Even in a simple Lotus THERE IS A LOT OF WIRES ! <p> Took me about 10 weeks you do all the wiring for a complete Lotus Seven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black tach wire . <p> I have to agree that the early Europa 's look pretty cool , i really like the look of the 47 's . Had plans to make my old S2 into a 47 , but sadly sold the car . Mine was the very early S2 , basically the same as you 're type 46 but with the removable frame ( no door handles , no signal blisters but it had power windows etc ) . <p> Before starting the wiring on the car , I strongly suggest that you draw up a complete vehicle wiring schematic . <p> Thanks for the reply . Some great advice . The rest of the car 's wiring is complete . Lots of relays , and a modern fusebox . Only the engine wiring remains . <p> One of the challenges has been figuring out where some of the missing parts were located . Is the cold start switch one of the sensors on the thermostat housing ? <p> cs3tcr , you probably had the best of both worlds . The earliest S2 's were essentially S1A 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a huge gain in accessibility for repairs .

I have to clean everything , oil cooler , lines , filter plate , pan . I 'm almost thinking of pulling the engine so I can blast inside with wd40 and blow out anywater .

@@8344889 @1544889/ @qwx111434 <h> FS : AE86 Must have - Thermostat housing upgrade <p> I have several OEM Toyota thermostat housings available for sale once again . <p> These updated housings provide two significant benefits : <p> 1 - replaces the factory ae86 housing that uses a crappy and leak-prone paper gasket which must be changed every time the housing is removed for a housing that instead uses a foolproof rubber o-ring to all but eliminate the possibility of leaks . <p> 2 - this updated housing comes with a built-in oem Toyota thermoswitch that can be wired into the vehicle to turn on an electric fan if one has been installed . Essentially you 'd be using Toyota parts to operate your cooling fan automatically only when needed . I have had my car set up this way for years and it works perfectly . <p> just curious migs , are these new or re-manufactured ? or junkyard pulls . I 'm sure you 've looked into it , how much does Toyota want for the housing and switch ? And did you find out anymore info on the hyundai switch ? 
@@8344891 @1544891/ @qwx111434 <p> Also , if you 're saving up for a motor swap- wheels should be your last priority . The swap will cost a lot more than the cost of the motor , trans , and parts . Lots of hidden costs in spare parts , afterthoughts , fluids , tune up , screw ups , etc . <p> Ya , i 'm just antsy and want to make the project move along faster haha . I did buy an engine hoist today . Possibly buy headers and some mounts this week too . Right now its just a waiting game . Got ta wait a month and a half to get the engine and everything . <p> Thanks , I 'm really hoping things will work out . Hard to tell , just got to keep with it . I read a bit of that thread , it says he used a mk1 supra rear end . He s using a hockey pucks for mounts ? He s also using the 3vz flywheel and clutch and some adapter . Also using the w56 trans . Do n't  know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorse using pucks for mounting . They are in mine more for figuring out engine alignment and getting everything else fitted . Stock LS400 mounts should work fine for me . <p> Okay update time . I 'm going to be ordering a walbro fuel pump , headers , and possibly a rad . I found adaptors for the 1uz swap that would probably work but shipping is 170.00 so I said **** that . I can get adaptors made by my buddy . I have to figure out dimensions and if the oem one will fit . If I go aftermarket I have to figure out trans cooling for the auto . That 's because the auto cooling lines go to the rad . That or get a trans cooler . Uggh , so many decisions haha but I have n't lost hope . <p> So I 'm looking at going with rack n pinion vs keeping the steering box . There is going to be clearence issues with the steering box . Anyways , what could get swapped in instead . I do n't  think I want manual rack because if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell most likely . Any opinions are welcome . I know very little about steering setups . <p> is it possible a later model supra or cressida crossmember will fit , or can be made to fit ? then you can have the power rack&amp;pinion steering . <p> for auto trans cooling just go to the wrecking yard . any 2002 windstar has a nice cooler loop right out front it uses for the auto . that should be enough for the toyota - usually coolers that are internal to the radiator are just little tubes not much longer than your hand . <p> windstar parts for the win ! i just found that the skirts on my ' 02 limited winnie fit pretty nicely onto the supra wheel arches . <p> I 'm sure its possible . I do n't  think it should be too much of a problem getting the supra crossmember or cressida to fit . There 's no info on it being done , so I cant say for sure other than going on a limb and trying it . Which may be my best bet at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cressy today . Who knows if i 'm a dumbass but I broke my engine hoist . The post that connects to the frame that holds the pivot arm broke . It warped and the nuts on the bottom went through the metal . So i 'm going to have to rent one now . Tuesday probably , that 's when I have my day off . Other than that , no real updates . <p> So , upon stumbing across this thread . This guy put a 1uz in a celica supra and the steering knuckle hit the headers . So , I think the best route is to do the steering rack from a celica supra , just buy a remanufactured one or whatever and get some custom headers made so i 'm not having clearence issues with the steering . That way I can get rid of the steering box and not worry about headers being in the way . So currently that is the plan . <p> I can tell you in my 82 supra there is about 3 " of clearance maximum between my steering rack/steering shaft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chop up the drivers side factory manifold to make it clear for a time , and fabricate custom headers later on . Do n't expect rack and pinion to give you too much space . <p> Also when installing your rack and pinion , do make sure that the length from the centres of the inner tie rod ends matches the length from your control arm pivots - you do n't want your tie rods and control arms moving through different angles , you 'll get silly steering . <p> While you 're at it , since you 'll have to fabricate your own mounts for the rack ( right ? or am I missing something ) you could try mounting the rack further towards the driver side than it normally goes to get ooooodles more space .. of course you would have different lock angles left to right , and that might end up being really bad depending on the rack and the car and such , but if it worked out it could be awesome ! <p> Ya , I do n't  know , maybe I 'll modify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a better option but if I can save some money and modify the stock ones . Thanks for the info on installing the steering rack . Dixnt know that . As for installing it further to the driver side , I do n't  think i 'll do that . I do n't  want more lock on one side than the other . <p> Sparkie , If I do mount it closer to the driver side to save some room , is there a way that 's proven that I can use to increase the lock on the pass side . I read a bit about tie rod spacers , ive heard they do n't  work . The more space the better but if I cant have equal or close to steering lock on both sides there 's no point for me . I saw those links in your thread about the header tubing , they look pretty good . I may have to pick up a set and get them made . It seems better to do it now then doing it later down the road after . Those mounts look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sure I could do a similar set up to yours . Also , do you know what your doing for your rad ? I do n't  know what 's going to fit in mine yet . I am interested if its possible to regain that steering lock on the one side if I do mount it closer to the driver side . Oh and btw what you 're doing is pretty awesome . I hope everything goes smoothly with the install . 1uz supra= awesomeness

@@8344897 @1544897/ @qwx111434 <p> The aluminum baseplate is blank , so you 'll need to cut the openings to match the throttle bodies . The female stud receptacles are mounted to the baseplate and they allow the filter frame to be secured to the baseplate . If you have a heater valve , you 'll need to install a 3/8 " spacer between the baseplate and ITB to clear the heater valve . See picture below : <p> All machine work on my ITG setup was done by AMT . <p> Cheers , <p> Marvin <p> ***************** ( story behind it ) <p> When I decided to upgrade to 20v blacktop , one of my concerns was air filtration for the ITB . Some popular options I have seen are sock-type ( Uni-filter , Pipercross ) and cone-type ( Garage Annex , Jubiride ) filters , but neither option looked too promising , from a mechanical engineers perspective . <p> Sock-type filters are directly over the velocity stack inlet , and they tend to get sucked into the throttle bodies . Sock-type filters are also known for robbing horsepower . <p> Cone-type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I call it a pipe because it does not have a bellmouth inlet , which is crucial to the design of velocity stacks . I do n't  know how good an ITB system is without proper bellmouth inlets . <p> ( Garage Annex kit ) <p> In my search for a " better " air filter , there was only one inspiring setup in Akira Iidas famous AE86 : <p> Featured in HyperRev Vol. 48 . It says Formula Toyota use air cleaner . <p> As you can see , the entire filter fits over the velocity stacks ( well , actually you cant see the velocity stacks ) . The filter is big enough so that the filter element is not in contact with the velocity stacks . This setup is superior to the sock-type and cone-type filters in different ways : <p> You can run proper velocity stacks , and the fluid dynamics of the bellmouth inlet is not compromised . For instance , with JC40-100 and T3 velocity stacks , there is an inch of space in front of the velocity stack inlet . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw air , thus the air velocity and pressure drop are much lower . <p> Since the entire filter is reinforced , there is no chance of sucking the filter into the ITB . <p> With the help of a good machinist friend , Adamturbo , and a bit of trial and error , the ITG filter was installed on my 20v blacktop . As far as I know , this was the first ITG filter setup that appeared in AE86 forums . <p> Concerns : <p> The stock washer bottle does n't  seem to fit . You can either remove it , or use the one from a SR5 . <p> Air filter oil , which is gross and sticky , will unavoidably get on your arms and engine bay while installing the gigantic filter . You can use dish detergent to wash it off . <p> When using it on 16v ITB , will the 3/8 " spacer be enough to clear the heater valve ? Will it be needed at all ? I have no clue ... someone can try it and let us know .

Remember , it has to be high enough to clear the height of the fuel filler neck once the tank is on the ground . <p> Place a jack under the tank with a piece of wood ( a 2 by 6 about a foot long works good ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place snug without exerting so much pressure that the rear of the car starts rising . <p> There are two straps that pivot from the rear of the car and are bolted up to the floor in between the front of the tank and the rear axle .

Now the hard part : You will need pliers and a couple of wrenches , I cant recall the sizes . Safety glasses are a good idea too to prevent dirt from falling into your eyes . Crawl under the car towards the front of the fuel tank and undo the fuel pressure line with the two wrenches . Be careful not to damage the mating surfaces of the two unions . With the pliers , depress the clips that secure the vent hose and the fuel return hose and slide clips several inches down the rubber hose so that you do n't lose them . After that undo the rubber hoses from the steel lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which line then it is probably a good idea to label them . <p> After all fuel lines and hoses are no longer secure , lower the tank as far down as you can while keeping the straps out of the way so that the tank will slide out towards the back of the car . If not you will either have to raise the front of the car to get it out the front or you will have to undo the straps from the back of the car to get the straps completely out of the way . <p> Slide jack out from under the tank and allow it to gently drop the rest of the way . After ensuring nothing is interfering or still attached , slide tank out from under the car . <p> Never just drop the tank straight down . It must be lowered while being pulled towards the rear of the car . If not you will bend the fuel pump hardline that faces the Front of the car . <p> edit : If your doing this to replace a fuel pump its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal around the cap where the sender unit/fuel pump plugs go in , At most you need to cut only an inch or so and can be done w/ a dremel . <p> Is n't there danger of spark when cutting metal with a dremel tool near the fuel lines ? <p> Ron <p> Originally Posted by Georgia-GTS <p> Also** <p> Never just drop the tank straight down .

@@8344899 @1544899/ @qwx111434 <p> Ready to Install in the Car . It Bolts into the front upper mounts for the old 4 link suspension and also 4 bolts through the Frame Legs . <p> Then Drive the Car <p> After Thoughts : If I was going to repeat this process I would have used a S13 R200 LSD and then I would have gotten two short side S13 rear axles . I then would have looked at narrowing the Subframe the correct amount to work with those axles. the Drive Shaft Shop Axles are very nice but also fairly pricey with exchange and duty etc . I also would have tried to put a loop in the lower Subframe reinforcement so that an exhaust pipe would fit thru . Side Exit exhaust became a necessity . The Celica required very little trimming of the sheet metal . All the original mounting points for the Solid axle are currently retained . The Subframe is mounted the opposite direction in the chassis than which it was in the miata . This allowed the offset upper control arm to clear the frame legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to line up with the original spring mount in the chassis . The Subframe could easily be mounted taller in the chassis if one did not want their car to sit so low . I could easily raise my car without negatively effecting the geometry . <p> The Handling and Ride Quality of the Rear of the Car was greatly Improved ! <p> Very very cool ! Can you tell us more about the axles that you used on there ? <p> I used custom Axles from DriveShaftShop.com " This is the 600HP Level 2.9 system for the S13 and S14 platform . The Level 2.9 axles feature an outer CV that is a ball &amp; cage type , a great improvement over the 240SX factory tripod style CV , our high-grade aircraft quality torsional center bars that twist more than a factory unit absorbing a great deal of the shock factor and a Porsche style 108mm CV with precision billet adapter plates and hardware to mount to the factory differential stubs " <p> They use Billet Adapters to go from the Nissan Flange to the Porsche 108mm CV Bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the Nissan 's they offset the differential to the driver 's side . This allows the input of the driveshaft to be completely straight . They then have a shorter Driver 's side drive axle than the passenger side Like this : <p> I Mounted the R200 differential in the center of the cross member . Both axles are the same length but the input of the driveshaft is offset a little to the passenger side just like in nearly all Toyota 's of this era . I used the R200 from a J30 because it was cheap low mileage and they all came with VLSD factory ( it has a different ( 5 ) axle flange bolt pattern than the ( 6 ) S13 ) . I attempted to use the Shorter Driver 's Side CV axle from the J30 on both sides of my car but it was slightly too long ... If I had started with a VLSD from a S13 I am almost positive that the Driver 's Side S13 axle would have been the correct length because they are a little shorter than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to try to do this in a less expensive way I would find a S13 LSD and Drivers Side ( Short ) axle before I narrowed the Miata Rear Subframe 12 cm . If running those axles meant Narrowing the track width slightly less I probably would have done this . Hub to Hub the Miata was 3 Inches wider than the original rearend . The 7.5 " Celica-Supra Rear Axle I had in the car which was 1.5 inches wider than original . 12 cm brought this back to stock distance from Hub to Hub . <p> If I was going to get Custom Axles made either way I could have either kept the 4x100mm Miata hubs or pressed in 5x114.3 Bolt Protege 5 front hubs which are the same spline as the Miata Instead of Machining down the S13 4x114.3 Hubs . I hope this clarifies things . 
@@8344900 @1544900/ @qwx111434 <p> Just in case you think I slowed down ... I cleaned up the frame rails and removed them from the front of the car , along with a portion of the transmission tunnel . Gearbox has been ordered and will be in tomorrow apparently , then I can start measuring things for final plans . These are my rough sketches along with approximate measurements for the plan . <p> I picked up the plasma cutter this morning . There is a big surprise though . I made an executive decision a few days back to change the design of the swap . Instead of cutting the firewall , I will be lengthening the wheelbase and moving the suspension components backwards . <p> The reasoning is this : Either way I have to cut vital frame areas of the vehicle to put the v8 in , and if I cut the firewall it means cutting into the protective cocoon that is designed to be the passenger cabin . Lengthening the wheelbase I only have to deal with essentially straight frame rails and my safety remains in tact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheelbase at least I would n't have to worry so much about having a v8 sitting inside the back of my face . Nor do I have to worry about excessive heat or noise from a home made firewall . I realize this means I will have to drop the motor to do any timing work but really , you think I care ? That 's what part of the fun is when owning a mid rear vehicle . <p> If you have positive comments please let me know because half way through the day I thought I had turned my $10K car into a $100 pile of scrap metal . But then the results of my prior forethought showed me exactly what I had in mind when I began this journey , except a few inches further back ( 8 " -10 " to be exact , there is still forward or backward adjustment as of tonight , will be decided upon tomorrow morning when I start worrying about suspension placement ) . The A6 front frame can bolt to the firewall and have enough space between the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . This gives me mounting points for the engine , solid frame rails from the firewall back ( where the meeting place will be reinforced as well as the moved strut towers ) , solves an issue I had with sway bar hitting the transmission and allows me to drop the engine tranny combo on the a6 factory subframe from underneath the car . Overall I think it 's a slick way to install ( and my engine bay looks badass WITHOUT a motor lol ) . As it sits tonight the front frame rails are bolted to the firewall in the right spots , the back is just hanging until I can get the suspension in tomorrow . <p> And this is where I finished tonight , the engine and transmission can actually bolt to this . Once I get my suspension set up I will add the right bracing to support the stretched wheelbase . I will update again as soon as I get some things sorted . <p> Another 14 hour day yesterday . Had to give the plasma cutter back today so I needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2 days is a good head start on this project haha , and I 'm quite pleased with what I 've accomplished so far . There were/are a few snags and nothing is connected or finalized or even close ( everything is in position and just braced for a few more fitments and measurements ) . I initially started with the audi frame on the ground and tried making the strut mounts fit over top , but the whole thing was too unstable . Instead I flipped the struts upside down and built the whole thing from the bottom . This allowed me to work with the cross members as well as the two frames to see what was going to be needed . I still have n't decided on how to tie everything in but I have a few good ideas in my head . I 'm always open to suggestions as always , I will work with the best knowledge I have available to me <p> The biggest problem I have right now is that the rear tie rod mount is not even close to being useable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from the control arms . I 'm hoping to figuring these out tomorrow . Things seem to other wise be shaping up nicely . Tomorrow I 'm also hoping to figure out what metal bracing and tie in plates I will need to make this all happen . I 'm pretty excited for the side profile as the length of the wheelbase is looking to be exactly where I would like it . <p> Also on a side note : Today I will finally get some sleep . It 's been kind of crazy being in the garage for 14 hours straight , consuming massive amounts of monster energy drinks and pizza , coughing black wads of stuff from the smoke buildup due to the plasma cutter , dealing with the literally crippling reemergence of my carpal tunnel syndrome , and I 'm sure there are other less interesting whiny things I could write of ( plasma burns ... ) . Just a little insight into the pains of a project like this : P <p> I 'm really keen to see what this is going to do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular shape and balance between front and rear . 8-10 inches is A LOT !

I 've designed my primary structural components and have all the metal here , spent most of the day on the strut tower running pieces . The plates that are welded on and bolted through at the firewall are 10g steel and the strut tower running pieces are 14g steel sheets . 2x2 " 100 wall steel tubes are being used as my primary triangulation pieces . Since I have all day tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on putting in some serious hours . I hope to have the frame rails attached to the car by the end of the day .

I 've used shine 's products before and was satisfied by their workmanship and personal Relations.I had made the initial transaction thru P.A.S.S . Racing and had some issues that were rectified by Shine.The Jblood front skin i had purchased was suuuperlight weight and extremely flexible , fitment-well i did n't  really care at the time so i did n't  pay attention , just expect all kits to suck for fitment . <p> I believe they can only fit 5 kits per box at a flat shipping rate of $170 per box to a U.S. adress . I would get the box shipped to Seawings Express in Blaine , Washington . Seawings brings it to victoria.I clear the shippment thru customs myself and duty is split amongst the group buyers according to the cost of buyers items.The shipping price is divided evenly , unless someone decides to order 3 kits in the same order or a paticular bumper costs more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes kits for all different chassis , I do n't  see why one could n't order a kit or bumper for a Soarer or s13/14 , it should cost the same . <p> Shine 's AE86 section of their website has been un-updated for ages but i have spoken with them numerous times in the past 6 moths and they do still make and stock the ae86 **30;422;TOOLONG I am awaiting a call back from them to confirm the small details of ; -how many items/kits per box -excactshipping price per box ( incase rates have increased ) -availiblity <p> unfortunately i am not willing to ship any items anywhere , its just a pain in the ass . So this limits the group buy to picking up items only in victoria or the odd vancouver trip . <p> This purchase would be put on my personal credit card and would be done soley by me.I am hoping to order 1 ae86 front bumper.There is no personal gain for me , except that i would n't have to foot an entire shipping bill myself-wich i refuse to do again . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to reply to pm 's to keep people in the loop . <p> I 'm planning to have the order in by Friday , May 27th . We need atleast 3 bumpers to make this order worth it . I will require a non-refundable deposit of 50% of the purchase price of the desired item by May 26th . Victoria posession date would be set for June 17th.I will only accept Paypal and EMT <p> if runfree is desired then i 'm going to assume that its the same as what PASS was trying to sell , seeing as they were their bodykit hook-up.maybe visit the PASS Racing thread a few threads below to see what pic is displayed or hear it from the horses mouth and email Shine directly <p> Just want to let everyone know about my Shine Auto experience . I contacted them directly , and I 'm sure i placed my order through PASS because Shine would not take orders from customers , just suppliers . When I got my package everything was packed safely , but when unwrapping the goods I found out I was sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their customer service was great , and after emailing them a photo of the sideskirts I recieved they rushed me out a set of J-Bloods free of charge , and I was able to keep the Goodline skirts . Also , the fitment of the products would be considered as excellent in my books . My TRD wing and my J-Blood rear add-ons fit perfect with zero prep , I was truly amazed . The side skirts fit very good as well . If I were to order another kit , I would be sure to bust out the extra buck with Shine Auto for proper fitting , no fuss aero from the get-go . <p> If anyone wants , I can take a bunch of photos of my aero and post the HTML links for the photos ? ( HTML links would cause much less thread clutter ) . I did not order a front or rear bumper from them , but still . <p> Ill second what King Spence said . I purchased from Shine and everything was great . Product fitment , packaging , customer service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffuser , side skirts and front bumper on my MKIV are all from Shine and I coudlnt be happier . Ken is a great guy to work with .

@@8344910 @1544910/ @qwx111434 <p> I considered my options when I bought my lugs . For Durability ... especially if you are going to use an impact gun many times , steel lugs are a better choice . <p> You can buy a set of wheel locks like McGard . I had a set on my Jeep and they were very nice . There are actually BMW factory McGard locking wheel bolts . They are strong but the keys are pressed together and they eventually break when used with an impact gun many times . I assume the McGard aftermarket keys are the same . Its a good idea NOT to use an impact gun with the locking keys . I did like the glossy black finish on the McGards though . <p> I like open ended lug nuts a lot for the track . 1 . They are usually slightly lighter than closed end ( Not a huge difference ) . 2 . You can buy longer studs and wheel spacers if you change wheels or decide to space your set up or whatever and you do n't  need to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowest lugs I could find so they will fit basically any wheels , even ones with deep recessed seats and narrow holes . <p> I got a new set from garage 5 ( I do n't  know how DKers feel about them , I have a good relationship with them even though I do n't  see them that much ) Muteki narrow , opened , steel , black , SHORT lugs . After seeing these I like them a lot more than the long version that would stick out on some wheels . They were $75 new at garage 5 These would get my vote for a track set up . I have gone to horsepower freaks in Portland and even those guys recommend Muteki studs and lugs on their 1000hp - 1300hp M3s <p> For stock rims use factory lug nuts with the built-in washers . If you need these I 've got buckets of them . <p> For aftermarket rims use cone seat lugnuts . Ceco makes inexpensive one piece spline nuts in both open and closed end style . You can get factory Toyota locking nuts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a road trip with a broken key , any dealership can help you out without damaging your bling rims . Factory wheel locks are made by mcgaurd but use a specific key type different from aftermarket ones .

Anyways Here 's a few pics when i got her home : <p> A pic taken with my buddies AE86 and my girlfriends pink AE86 right after we got her home <p> Since then the car pretty much went into stealth mode , I 've posted here and there for tips on fixing its many issues but that aside it has n't driven much at all , being tied up with my other projects i 've put 1500km on it in the 3 years since i owned her , the longest stint being taking it to bomanville track . <p> At some point I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't get me wrong i love the black and white panda , but the more i see red AE86 's , the more i think I should have left it red , regardless I did all the work myself painting the car including prep and paint , turned out ok , not perfect but pretty decent for a do it yourself . <p> Made it out to a few meets and autocross here and there <p> Last year i took her to neetronics where they did a proper tune , car starts up in the cold now and runs pretty decent . <p> Still i get the odd issue here or there where the engine would cut out for no reason at all , pull up to a stop light and the engine just dies , one time i was crusing down the road and went to accelerate , no response , look down , 0RPM , WTF ! ! , the engine just cut out mid drive . i 'm guessing loose connection or something , it fired right back up but still very odd . <p> Anyways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I just pulled her out to take it for a spin today , ran great and sounds amazing . <p> I 've decided I want to actually drive this car more and not have it just be a waste of money but before i can do that , i need to fix a few problems . <p> 1 being an insane amount of vibration on deceleration , it literally vibrates through my ass and up the seat . I have no idea what 's causing all the vibration , my suspicion would be the exhaust rubbing up against the body but i do n't see any obvious spots . <p> The other issue being the wiring job in the engine bay , the car starts and runs so i cant really complain but it just looks so bad and i just envision something vibrating loose at exactly the wrong moment . <p> Here 's a few pics : <p> I 've held off on sending it to a shop to get fixed thinking i 'd get around to fixing them at some point but I 've been so busy I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner wired in a sh*t ton of relays and hacked the harness up , i took a look and it looks like the rear harness is still SR5 with just the nessicary wires run to turn on the fuel pump , i 'm guessing they did the same with the engine harness thus all the relays . <p> I might look into seeing if Dr.Tweek or someone else can build me a harness that connects to my setup , I 'm guessing if that 's the case I might have to change all the body harnesses ( under dash and such ) . Is there any easy way to tell if i got a GTS or SR5 under dash harness ? The other option is just find someone who knows their sh*t and get them to clean up the wiring , even just tucking away the ugly wiring would be an improvement . <p> Video of me test driving it today ( Do youself a favour and fast forward to 1:40 , before then is just me blabbing on ) <p> Footage of it on the track last year <p> Footage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ever taking the car out to any event , i was chicken sh*t to push it <p> My blood is all over this car lol . Those are my old wheels that were terrible . To fix the engine bay you should just rewire it from scratch completely . The reason for the relays is A , fans , B it was carbed . My advice is now that you have it running leave it the **** alone . The second you start rewiring , messing with grounds I promise it will run like **** . That copper ground bar is genius . <p> Does this car still have heim four links on my diff ? Brians gon na vomit when he s sees you panda 'd his car . Gj getting it running finally . <p> PS : Buy a painless efi fuse/relay block and build from there . Leave the rest alone , the entire body and dash has its own power source from the battery to the under dash fusebox . <p> As you change the wiring , you will change the voltage seen at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injectors and ecu so there is no voltage offset .

Looking at that wiring in the engine bay makes me ashamed . When I first had it running it was a lot tidier , but then I changed a few things and had more interest in driving it than making the engine bay pretty again . Then I sold it and a lot of wiring was altered . The Honda igniters made a big difference in how it ran after that . If I were to do it again knowing what I know now I would definitely do echo an COP setup like I now have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the **** tons of relays . Headlights are relayed straight to the battery , fan is on a relay , pretty sure I had to put in a relay for the fuel pump since the 4A had a mechanical one . The ground strap/bar is something I 've stuck with through pretty much every car I 've modded and has never let me down . Clean grounds are key ( as I learned through trial and error ) . If anything I should have extended the grounds from the passenger 's strut tower to the front left corner and put the ground bar there . Totally rewiring the car with a painless kit would be the best way to make it clean , but will take forever and will likely be a big PITA . <p> If anything this car was a long series of lessons of trial and error and how not to do things . I like to think I learned a lot and fixed a lot of things along the way , but looking back at it now there was so much more I wanted/needed to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good hands .

I 'll have a full 85 GTS to swap parts from so would it matter ? <p> Also , any differences in visuals from the early years and from a TE72 vs AE71 . I keep seeing these badass quad lights but I 'm guessing its a JDM thing ? <p> So there is n't too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search function already and the most info I got was out of build threads . Thinking about picking up a cheap daily driver but I know nothing about this car . <p> Its a 82 TE72 with 140 , xxx kms , automatic 4 door sedan <p> The 3t-c engine is pretty much bullet proof for one , it also has a bigger displacement than the 4age and lots of torque in low RPM 's for better take-offs .. It 's a great engine for DIY mods because of its classic simplicity and unlike an ' 85 GTS motor , it already fits perfectly ! <p> That being said , it would be a lot cheaper and easier to just swap the auto trans for a T-50 and fit in your clutch pedal . <p> More about the 3t-c : Yep , it 's a hemi ! All 1.8 liters of it haha .. Carbeureted , 2 valves per cylinder , overhead valve pushrod configuration instead of this new , fancy-shmancy DOHC stuff I hear so much about these days .. I read somewhere that they put out something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not 100% , but those figures are what i remember ) .. Power gains are easy to bolt on yourself , and are quite noticeable because of the car 's light weight . I do n't see why one would want to waste such a thing of joy without really getting to know it first .. <p> I could go on , but I do n't need to rant at this hour , lol .. just wanted to give you good insight and a good reason to keep the stock engine . <p> Oh yea , I also heard that you can raise the compression ratio by putting a 2t-c head onto it for next to nothing . Just sayin ' .. <p> TE has the " T " series ( 2TC&amp;3TC engines ) , and the AE has the " A " series ( 4AGE&amp;4AC engines ) . Naturally an " A " series engine would be the easy swap into an AE chassis . Cross member , exhaust and drive shaft are the biggest modifictions that have to be faced when putting an " A " series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " T " engine into an " A " chassis . <p> Although fun to wrench the 4age swap is a side step to the 3TC , it is not an improvement . The 3TC provides much lower torque , they pull very hard . With a nice carb and exhaust your laughing , and throwing a camshaft in one is no big deal . <p> Swapping the subframes from an AE is a bolt in affair , except the steering components . The firewal between an AE7 and a TE7 are different , this affects the steering column , brake pedal , brake booster/master etc . The funny thing is , unless your steering box is warn out , there is no gain from switching to a steering rack in a TE car . The Steering box gets tons of steering lock with almost no modification other than unbolting the steering stoppers on the knuckles . <p> The driveshaft differences between an AE and a TE is the length of the front half shaft . The TE and AE though very similar and possibly work well enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the two motors . Basically slight design differences in the T and A engine blocks resulted in slightly different locations in the motor mounts and different bellhousings , which can affect the length of the driveshaft . TE manual driveshaft may work on an AE and vice versus , but they do have different part numbers . An Auto drive shaft does not work on a manual . ( The auto rear half is the same as the the manual rear half , it 's the fronts that are completely different ) . <p> The GTS rear axle will bolt up to the TE rear 4 links without a problem . You will need to use the GTS e-brake cables as far as I know . This too is a questionable upgrade as the drums on the back of the E7 's work decent , the E7 e-brakes work very well and the GTS 's are notorious for needing rebuild calipers . Switching to a 6.7 " differential is an upgrade in strength , but sourcing 6.7 " diffs is becoming difficult , where the stock TE 6.3 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really having issues with them , even on mildly upgraded 3tcs . However , good tires will destroy the 6.3 " diffs , so if your running falken Azenis 's and other auto-x-able tires on a welded diff you may have issues if your drive the snot out of your car often , but it 's an increased risk but not extremely common . <p> Basically , buy the sedan , swap a manual transmission into and enjoy it as it is. a 4age swap is possible , but it 's a waste of time and money , as it produces the same amount of power as the 3TC , but you have to change the entire electrical and fuel system to match it , as well as the front steering system , and then you 'll spend more money building the 4age up for power than the afternoon wrenching and the few handfulls of change getting the 3TC to put out more power . <p> Quinn said it all right there ! I knew I had some good points , but Quinn knows these cars more than anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty hard , especially after a carb upgrade ( I stuck a weber on mine and it really goes at WOT ) <p> As for an exhaust system , I 'll be building my own , I have numerous sketches and diagrams laid out because there are n't any new aftermarket ones that I can find .. The 3t-c also came with one of two different exhaust manifolds : One was this ugly 4 to 1 thing where it collects the air from the cylinders and just dumps it down one pipe , and the other was a more header-style 4 to 2 to 1 that was much prettier-looking .. <p> Listen to Quinn , buy the sedan and enjoy the 3t-c , and with the combined knowledge of everyone who has done one of these motors up , you 'll be laughing in no time , with enough cash left over to buy another and do it again ! <p> And 140 xxx km 's is still quite a young motor , as far as these ones go .. <p> 3tc ftw ... i run em and honestly if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... why go for less displacement . i too was once confused like you . my 3tc pulls allright. bored out and has a carb ( not tuned well ) but if your wanting to swap in something more advanced my advice to you is to watch for ka 's for sale or something along those lines ... why swap in something that 's not much of an improvement <p> well ive heard so much good things about the 3tc even before this but this just confirms it , only problem was i hoped to pull the 3tc out and put it into a te21 later on but looks like i 'll just source out another 3tc <p> We had this discussion a while ago . Japan has at least two things ( there are more ) that we do n't have : 1 . - Small flat tracks that offer plenty of room for momentum entries . 2. - Small width tires that make skinny 8 " wheels have mad stretch . Try and think of all the other unique opportunities they have that make the 4ag more attractive . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through some of the brackets and stuff they offer as well . <p> The motor fix cars are not a great example . They are track only builds and have nothing to do with a daily driver . Same with my 12a . Why did I go 4ac to begin with ? I had the parts to make a 4ac run , and not the ones to make a 4ag or 3tc run . Why did I go 12a ? Because I found an entire Rotary Corolla drivetrain for $100. 3TC or KA if I blow this 12a . Hell , I put a 3AC in my daily driver for now , since it 's all I had that ran . <p> The subframe from a S13 basically bolts in . Have to build a custom steering column extension , but it 's not the end of days . <p> stock 4ag and stock 3tc make roughly the same power , now do the math of power additives to make more horse with a 4ag . Then add on the costs of converting to fuel injection , and sourcing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does n't already need rings/rebuild . Plus add the costs of finding the AE7x firewall , steering column , and pedal set . Just to have the same amount of power ? <p> More about Motorfix : Japan had very few 3T equipped cars , a majority of their E7 's had K series engines . 3TC 's were extremely uncommon , oddly enough 2TG , 3TG 's and 3TGTE 's were more common , though still very rare , and have very little parts for them . The 4ag was EXTREMELY common , and have had a strong aftermarket following for them in Japan since the late 80 's . You can scoot down to the wrecker and grab a black top for peanut , then run over to Up Garage and build it up for even cheaper . Another factor is the Japanese 16v 's had a higher power output than North American ones , almost 15 more horse . That 's a huge difference to our ****ty blue tops . The 3TC has been a racing engine in the circle track scene since the 80 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor outside of the corolla crowd . Since it 's literally half a V8 , there are tons of engine build shops that are familiar with getting power out of them . We also got them in droves in our E7 's . People have worked out how to fit VW pistons in them for higher compression for cheap . Simple lumpy cams , and used V8 carbs for great power gains . The problem is the young corolla crowd is still sold on the 4ag , and people throw out the 3TC not realizing in the long run , with all considerations , it 's a much better engine for an E7 . Add in a better tire size selection , more momentum based tracks , and generally lighter chassis 's than North American versions , and bam. 4ag makes sense for the japanese and not for North Americans . <p> I am driving my wagon to JCCS in september ... and I am on a tight budget to make it " decent " to drive there . It MUST be 5 speed , and must have enough power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keeping it 3tc for the summer is very appealing to my budget . My motor runs great , and not converting it to EFI is very attractive . I need to 5-speed swap it , a carb , and a header/exhaust . Maybe a cam if I can find one local . <p> SO ... for 3tc tuning , what is the best way to make it 5 speed . e7 clutch pedals seem to be impossible to find ... but I do n't mind making an 86 one work . t50 ? adaptor with a w58 ? <p> Then what carb is a simple cheap option ? I 'm an ex nissan guy ... and I know literally nothing about carbs . I want real experience if at all possible . I 'll be doing my research on the side , but I 'd like input from you guys first . <p> A lot of people run 32/36 which is a mild tune and not to spendy . Dual sidedrafts would be great but may as well start saving for a new engine for the price of a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I have an e7 clutch pedal but someone has already expressed interest in taking a bunch of my swap stuff as a package . <p> As for transmissions mark . 3TC 's came with T50 's , they just had a T series bellhousing instead of an A series bellhousing . <p> Clutch pedal , Ae86 's ones fit AE7x 's , I hacked up a tercel one to fit my TE7x wagon , though I 'm pretty sure an ae86 one should fit . Eitherway it 's a matter of a couple of bolts passing through a flat plate . Rocket scientists , stay home . <p> I have this for sale for $100 if either of you guys want it . I bought it off Rasta so I 'm pretty sure it 's good but he said a rebuild could n't hurt . All you need is an adapter from BRD Racing ( $40 ? ) and you 're good to go ! AFAIK the 5200 is a copy of Webber 's 32/36 . <p> Anyway , I was going to 5spd my low mileage 3TC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full GTS / EFI conversion instead . <p> I 'm in the middle of swapping a 4AGE into my TE72 right now ( literally right now , I just came in from the garage to grab lunch ) . <p> Pretty smooth sailing so far . The steering box and all the linkages clear a GTS subframe . At full right lock , the center link just touches the rack mount , probably about 1mm interference , so I just touched it with a grinder , but honestly it probably does n't matter . Gas tank does n't work . The TE gas tank does n't have a big enough hole in the top to take the fuel pump . The GTS tank filler neck is different . If I hacked out the area around the filler neck on the car side , it might fit , but hacking stuff up is n't how I roll . Working on a solution , I have a few ideas .

I was wondering if such trigger wheel could be used to trigger the 1zz COP , on would it only work with a EDIS module . <p> Thx <p> If your haltech as cam angle sensor input just grind a tooth off the cam gear and put a VR sensor to it to act as a cam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control 4 dumb coil to go full sequential since I 'm using carbs ... people are running setup such as this off MS v3 and up with great result .

I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds of it . And the bracket does n't have to be that fancy .

Also , I am a bit confused what is the difference between COP and sequential , is there one ? Ty <p> COP = coil overplug Sequential = a mode of firing were every coil is fired in sequenced , just like sequential fuel injection . <p> With coil on plug you could have different mode of ignition . Could be batch fired ( not supposed to work but still does ) where every coil on plug is fired at the same time . Could also be wasted spark where 2 coils are fired simultaneously at TDC no matter if on the compression or exhaust stroke ( is easier as you only need a crank trigger ) or could be sequential where only the coil of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired . <p> For sequential ignition , you are required at minimum to run a cam angle sensor but normaly is coupled to a crank angle sensor in OEM applications mostly to speed up starting event as you do n't need to potentially spin the engine two whole revolution in order for the ECU to get it 's timing mark right . <p> I was talking about sequential in opposition to using an EDIS which uses wasted spark ignition with the une of a single crank angle sensor . <p> Trouble with wasted spark is that every coil will fire every revolution as opposed to once every other revolution so you have less coil dweel time and thus theoritical rev limit lower than sequential . <p> Which Haltech are you planning on ? If it 's a sprint500 , then it already has 4 spark outputs and does n't need EDIS . These coils have an igniter built in to each and therefore can be driven directly from the Sprint . <p> Furthermore to what Tommy said : You ca n't compare COP and Sequential . Sequential is the manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Batch fire . Firing Sequences timed to engine rotation--&gt; Sequential Fires : 1,3,4,2 Wasted spark : 1+4,2+3 Batch : 1+2+3+4 <p> To run the 1zz COP , do I only need the cam angle sensor or do I need both the trigger wheel on the crank and the cam angle ? Also , I am a bit confused what is the difference between COP and sequential , is there one ? Ty <p> You would only need the one sensor if your ECU allows you to do that . I picked up a AEM infinity 8H recently and was planning to use the single sensor setup but the ECU only allowed for preset Trigger/home arrangements so I had to switch back to the original distributor to match their preset . MS let 's you do any custom wheel arrangment and I believe that the Haltech Sprint does too . <p> If you get your timing only from the Crank you can only do wasted spark firing . If you get your timing only from the Cam you can do Wasted spark or sequential . <p> Many cars have sensor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timing works but then again there 's a lot of info on the net about it . <p> If you get your timing only from the Crank you can only do wasted spark firing . If you get your timing only from the Cam you can do Wasted spark or sequential . <p> Many cars have sensor on both . <p> In OEM applications the PCM uses the cam sensor to establish TDC#1 ( or whatever other phase angle it 's calibrated to ) and uses the crank trigger for timing related calculations . I believe the assumption here is that there 's less jitter in the timing signal from the crank , lacking the timing belt coupling . <p> of course a quality belt well tensioned probably would n't affect the timing that much

If you remember the tech articles from Sport Compact Car , these guys wrote them . <p> " A TRD thick and strong Formula Atlantic valve cover was also used for this reason as the valve cover is also designed to strengthen the engine assembly in a Formula car chassis . These reinforcing parts should greatly increase the bearing and crank life as these were always marginal in the racing versions of the 4AG due to block flex at high rpm .

You 'll also have to start thinking about getting some ' shim under ' buckets , which have the valve clearance adjusting shims as a small 13mm pellet shim , rather than the 25mm dia shim that sits on top of the cam buckets . This is because with cams bigger than the low 300 's and roughly 8mm lift , the ' shim over ' buckets will occasionally catch the edge of the shim with the top of the lobe of the cam and spit it out the side , thus RAPIDLY destroying the bucket and most likely a fair chunk of head in the next few milliseconds . " <p> lol i was thinking that too , I have the exact set $75 from ebay . In the vid it has toda one 's though . <p> ps. this is a sweet engine , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mike Kojima # Mike Kojima Friday , January 15 , 2010 7:40 AM The very best TRD Atlantic engines would put out 230 crank hp over a very narrow powerband . This was with a better header . Header technology is even better now days with stepped primaries , true merged collectors with venturis and reverse megaphones . Considering that this engine has milder cams than a typical Atlantic engine , the power output is right in line . Technosquare ended up running 304/304 TRD cams which was considered to be a rally combination . Atlantic and GT engines ran 320/304 but this was for lighter true race cars . <p> The engine is a little over 13:1 like Atlantic engines . <p> The head on this engine is n't so great , especially the worn sunk valves . The valves are really on there last legs with the margins knife sharp and the 45 on the seat below the CC deck ! They are two valve job past usable but the owner did n't want to spend the money on new valves . Hasselgren has a huge rep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched it up but could only build to the owners budget and what he ultimately wanted to do . There is a lot of power lost in the head .

@@8344926 @1544926/ @qwx111434 <h> Wolf Steel Restorations AE86 Panels GB <p> There , we made some lists of who is interested in what . Now I need to know who is ready to buy what parts , who needs clarification on what the parts are , and we can sort out who is interested in being the distribution for their area . Once we start getting some people ready to put down a 35% deposit I will talk to Robin again and try and see what kind of solid prices I can get from him . His mentality is I could sell them at retail and get a deal on the stuff I need/want . That is n't my goal , I wanted a few things and I would rather help the community over saving a couple bucks . So once I get some commitments and deposits I will try and work us a deal . Things however could stay at the prices they are if we do n't get much interest . <p> I 'm going to make a few posts after this one . One for the BC guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ontario crew . Hopefully that covers everyone . The other people might have to look at heading to one of the major centers to pick up or have their parts shipped to them direct .

But 80% of you have never met me and I completely understand if you have issues with sending me cash .

I used a big wash basin and some Purple Power and scalding hot water to degrease the head , let it soak for 6 hours ( I would n't recommend more than that to be honest I will get into that in a minute ) and then using my home made soda blaster cleaned it all up nice . <p> Cost me about 30 dollars ( 20 for the purple power , 5 for the soda and 5 for the hose . I already had a blower nozzle ) <p> Made a simple suction style blaster nozzle using some 1/2 ( you could use 3/8 or whatever you like ) If you have a sandblast nozzle by all means use that . <p> and picked up a big box of this , you can also use washing soda which is a bit more abrasive . I like the baking soda best unless you need the extra abrasive . You can buy giant boxes of it . <p> Result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purple power does funny things to the oxide layer of the aluminum . Mainly stains it a dark color . But if you are soda blasting it who cares that layer will be gone anyway . I checked on mine every hour or so to make sure it was n't doing irreparable damage so use at your own risk . My head turned dark greyish and started getting white spots and that is when I pulled the plug and rinsed it with cold water . Also about the baking soda , It obliterates plant life . Do not use it on your lawn or near anything green you want to live . Do it on your driveway or a big tarp . <p> I also did some very rough porting . Mainly removed the meat of the metal I wanted to clean up and now will finish it all up at home . <p> Set screw style . Going to pick up the screws and some 5/8 thrust washers tomorrow at Fastenal . Not sure but I may make another set and do it pinch style but the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These should work just fine . <p> 1 . ) Set screws should be fine but you may gouge the rocker shaft a little bit . Just something to keep in mind when disassembling . <p> 2 . ) I wish I could get the 69-70 style chrome fender mirrors in North America <p> 3 . ) Use a MAF to make a flowbench ? Thats F'ing genius . What are you going to use for vacuum ? It has to be strong enough to get flows somewhat similar to engine operation . Intake side of a leaf blower ? ? haha Are you not also going to require some sort of metering device to maintain a constant vacuum source ? <p> Shop vac , measure voltages at MAF at different valve heights , put into a chart then graph using my TI-83 . Not my idea and not entirely sure how well it will work overall but if it at least gives me rough measurements of flow before and after that will suffice for my needs . The guy that has done it says it works pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see . Next closest DIY option is $500 , this will be next to free . I just have to pickup some PVC piping , laminated shelving and some dowel rod to make the top surface . <p> Yeah , Smoothing out the combustion chamber , removing ridges and high spots in the casting that can cause hot spots and detonation . <p> The valve faces are actually terribly rough from the factory . I had to chuck them up on the lathe and do a skim pass on them then polish afterward . You could n't get them smooth otherwise . Again to help with hot spots ... Going to make a radius tool and do the backsides of the valves too . I Do n't want to spend money so I am just tinkering with stuff . <p> Yeah I looked at some DIY manometer flow benches but even those were around $500 to build and too bulky .

This I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I please . <p> Good to know about the Fords , Although the guy who did this said he was using an older Ford MAF , I have 2 here now one off of a older 5.0l Chev van which I think will work great and another off of a newer 5.7l which is a bit too large I think . <p> Head is gone to the machine shop , did n't have any listings for OS valves so I got new stock sizes , seats recut and resurfaced . Then today my aluminum carbide burrs showed up so I could have worked on it on the weekend .... figures . <p> FYI there is a certain Subaru hot wire MAF that you can buy brand new for about $70 . I do n't remember the part number or application at the moment ( i think it was like MY2000 Legacy or something ) but I could probably get the part number if needed . The guys at Ottos Subaru in Ottawa used to sell them to me en masse . Dirt cheap , super accurate , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've installed them in Mazdas , Nissans , Audis and Subarus with zero issues . <p> It would probably be perfect for your flow bench if your budget allowed , just supply it with 5v ref , ground , then chart out the signal . I think it had an integrated IAT as well which you could use to ensure that your air temps are steady ( not that it really matters for a flow bench ) . <p> I 'll definitely be calling you next time I 'm out in PEI . I 'm usually there about once a year .

@@8344944 @1544944/ @qwx111434 <h> Intake Resonance Pulse Tuning : How to Choose Stacks ! <p> Had a lot of questions about this subject over at toyota3tc forums lately so I wrote this and figured I 'd post it here too . Let the brain hurting begin ! <p> Lots of people have been confused about this topic so I figure I would share some of the basics of intake resonance tuning here . This is a large subject in engineering filled with lots of physics variables and equations that I do n't  even know so treat this as a very basic guide and nothing more . <p> Imagine one intake runner going into your engine at wide open throttle ( WOT ) and naturally you can visualize that there is a column of air moving very quickly to the combustion chamber , pushed ( not sucked ! ) by atmospheric pressure outside the intake . <p> Now imagine that we suddenly snap the intake valve closed for the compression stroke . Well what happens with that air ? It does have a mass like any object so it does not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against the intake valve . This piling up actually creates a sort of shock wave . This wave then bounces off the intake valve and pulses backwards through the intake toward the atmosphere . Sorry about the hand-drawn crapness . <p> Now why do I care right ? Well , depending on if you have a plenum or open individual runners , that pulse eventually meets another force and bounces back towards the still closed intake valve . This bouncing can occur many times in fractions of a second until the intake valve finally opens . <p> Now here is the REALLY interesting part , If we can time it right , we can actually have the pulse bouncing back towards the intake valve as it opens , this effect tends to " ram " a little extra air and fuel into the combustion chamber increasing the volumetric efficiency . New idea ? Hell no ! The car manufacturers have been engineering this into their intakes for a very long time . <p> How do you do it ? Math ! If you cant bear any math , close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting our intake runners to be ideal length to make the pulse timed to push air into the valve . There are other factors but they are beyond the scope of this write-up . Here is our equation : <p> Engine rpm 60 seconds = engine revolutions per second <p> Engine revolutions per second X 360 degrees of crank revolution = Total crankshaft degrees per second <p> # of crank degrees that intake valve is closed crankshaft degrees per second = total time the intake valve is closed at this rpm <p> So as an example , we have a T series head with a cannon intake manifold and mikuni 44s with no stacks . <p> The distance from the intake valve to atmosphere is 10.5 inches ( no I did n't  measure it perfectly so do n't  use these numbers ) and I have a cam that I want to produce its real pull peak at 7000rpm . My cam has the following specs : intake opens at 39 btdc and closes at 81 abdc . Given a four stroke takes 720 to complete a full cycle this means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its closed for 420 <p> 7000 60 = 116.66 revs per second <p> 116.66 X 360 = 41997.6 degrees per second <p> 420 41997.6 = 0.0100 seconds the intake valve is closed at 7000rpm . <p> So it gets worse ! The pulse we discussed travels at roughly the speed of sound which is about 1125 feet per second/ This means 1125 X 0.0100 = 11.25 feet the pulse travels ! ! Our pulse needs to travel 11.25 feet to arrive at the intake valve when it opens again . How does this happen without a massive intake pooping out from under the hood ? By getting this 11.25 feet to be divided neatly by our intake runner . 11.25 feet is also 135 inches . Our intake right now is 10.5 inches . <p> If we divide our pulse distance by our intake runner length right now we get an even but not rounded number of 12.857 bounces . We want an even number because even numbers will see the pulse returning to the intake valve . 12.8 would see it getting there just a tad late . Imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The first bounce is " 1 " and the second is " 2 " when you catch it ( if you decide to catch it ! ) In our tennis ball visual , YOU are the intake valve . <p> We would like to tune our intake length so that 12.8 becomes 10 even or 8 even . How ? Let 's say we added a stack 3 inches long . Now we still have 135 inches for the pulse to travel . But now we have a total intake length of 13.5 inches . <p> 135 13.5 = 10 MAGIC ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> We have a perfect even number . The pulse will bounce 9 times but theoretical tenth would be it meeting the intake valve ! ! ! ! That pulse will now push just a tad more air to fill our cylinder . <p> Now this is fine and dandy now how about if I have EFI and a plenum ? Easy and actually more effective ! <p> The plenum actually acts like a spring . When the pulse comes up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that air " springs " the pulse back into the runner much more efficiently than ITBs or sidedrafts with stacks . Sorry guys , its a fact . This is why so many new cars have those crazy wild intake runner lengths . Adding stacks inside the plenum helps this effect and can make it feel like quite a boost indeed . Note in the picture below that the plenum has a stack inside it . That stack 's length would be tuned for an ideal pulse . <p> Have I written enough ? Have I made your head hurt ? I bet ! But remember to take this with a grain of salt as there are other variables and only trial and error will reveal the best set-up for your machine . Experiment with inputting different engine rpms , cam specs , and runner lengths . Enjoy ! ( or not ) <p> Last edited by sunray ; 02-15-2009 at 10:19 PM. @qwx111435 <p> Holy shiznit .

It made sense , but i did n't  know why . Thanks Chris , you old farts may have more use then just funny drunk ramblings afterall . <p> The only downside to this knowledge is the fact that it is hard to get different length air horns . And it gets frustrating knowing it could be better . There is also maths for figuring out the ideal location of the throtle plate and injector location relative to the intake valve . Some of this theory can be seen on the Hasselgren FA 4ag , if you have seen pics of it with the injectors mounted outside the air horns . Good stuff . Thanks Chris , now I have to do a bunch of math ! <p> but my question is do you want to boost peak power or tune for a more even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak power . The only way to try and have the best of both worlds is to use variable intake runners . Toyotas first attempt at this was TVIS . Modern engines use two sets of runners that are switched by a throttling valve . And some wild ford designs on the focus have runners that are telescopic . <p> One thing I forgot to mention ( because I decided to join Brett 's experiment ) was that ITB 's and sidedrafts benefit from this pulsing effect much better by creating an airbox for them that is roughly 60% of the volume of your displacement . @qwx111435 <p> I have another request though : Do you have anything on exhaust theory with regard to scavenging , etc. that you could post up ? <p> Well that is a neat subject that has some very recent new theories people are talking about . I 'll see what I can come up with . The conventional ideas about exhaust tuning are changing but so far everyone is agreeing about the basics of scavenging depending on head design . @qwx111435 <p> The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to get different length air horns .

Thanks Chris , now I have to do a bunch of math ! <p> Paul , rather than changing horns everytime , just fab up some spacers for the base of the horns . As long as they meet smoothly , it will achieve the desired effect . <p> Now those injectors outside the horns is usually used in staged injection . The idea is to try an give the air and fuel just a little bit more physical time to atomize together and increase tubulent at higher rpm . At say 10,000rpm there is very little time for a port injected fuel charge to mix . @qwx111435 <p> If you 're making you 're own intake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Remember guys that TVIS was a very early and crude attempt at finding a low end velocity combined with high end volume . It unfortunately was not as effective as today 's designs due to it dispensing with port tuning . Also , variable intake runners work best today thanks to variable cam timing and lift to match rpm conditions . <p> This does n't mean we should not use some of this knowledge to develop our older engines further . Sort of borrow some of the engineers hard work in r&amp;d . @qwx111435 <p> Well that is a neat subject that has some very recent new theories people are talking about .

Go to the library check out Scientific design of Exhaust and Intakes systems book by Smith and Morrison . <p> They used 16 variables , including valve opening , exhaust timing , interference actions and air temp etc. for the tuned intake resonance filling .

I had them redo that Supra windshield 3 times and it still does n't look right . <p> When you remove the glass , Toyota recommends leaving as much urethane on the body as possible , so you should not be coming near the paint . <p> You 'd think , but the paint ALWAYS gets damaged when cutting with piano wire .

Also , even though I had painted them long ago , I dropped my valve covers off and had them powder-coated instead and spent a bit of time painting the letters back on yet again today . I also had the ( modified with a hammer to clear the GZE CPS ) exhaust header heat-shield ceramic coated which should match my TRD 4-1 header excellently : <p> I might give the letters a second coat , and I still need to stick the spark plug caution label on as well . I 'll post another couple of pics when I do . I think I 'm going to like how the powder coating holds up , though the colour is n't quite as perfect as I would have liked , but that 's what you get with powder coating . Still pretty good though . <p> Time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's actually been since I dropped this engine in . Over 2 years ago . Madness . Inside the engine bay is basically done now . Couple small things need to be done , but I finally got everything mounted properly and some hose clamps and vacuum routing done . <p> The intercooler piping and air box pipe will both be powder coated satin black along with the intercooler brackets . The valve covers have been powder coated silver and the exhaust header heat sheild was ceramic coated . Crucially important also is that the throttle cable has been connected . With cruise control . I win . <p> Might make a new bracket to hold the igniter so it does n't need to be removed to change the air filter . Future project after I get the piping coated . <p> Intercooler still needs hose clamps and I need to wire up the bumper lights . It really does need the pipes coated , it will look so much nicer when that is done , IMO . You can see that the windshield has been removed . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . I will be prepping it to be installed in the next little bit . If all goes according to plan , I will have the car drivable and on the road this month and if that happens I will finally get those quarter panels installed this winter with fresh paint for the spring . <p> Thanks , it 's looking pretty good . I need to get a battery and fire it up today/tomorrow . I want to get the ignition timing set and see how well it will run . I 've only had it running twice , neither time for very long because I did n't have everything in place yet . <p> Hey Jeff , from the pics it looks like you have no heat protection for your alternator . Ignore this advice if you do , but on my sc car , I killed a few alternators before adding a heatshield between it and the exhaust . On mine I just added some heatshield coming off of the header heat shield that went behind the alternator . It worked like a charm and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard that a couple of times . I do n't have a heat shield in there right now beyond the factory one . I figured with the ceramic coating on the headers it would keep enough of the heat away from the alternator . I may build a heat shield for the alternator , we 'll see . <p> That being said I tried to start the car up last night and it struggles to stay running , in fact it wo n't really keep going . I 've got consistent spark now , so I 'm thinking it 's either camshaft timing or the MAP sensor . I 've got a few spare MAP sensors and I will check the camshaft timing tonight/tomorrow . I 'd really like to get this thing running consistently . If it 's not either of those issues I will have to start checking into other things again . 
@@8344948 @1544948/ @qwx111434 <h> 85 Celica GTS , what to do with it ? <p> So I might be daily driving my 85 Celica GTS soon , and I do n't know if I want to run the stock engine . Is there something with decent power , easy swap and maybe better fuel mileage I could put in there ? Looking for the best balance of fuel economy and power ( for the fun factor ) . Ideas ? <p> Haha truck motor , do people actually still think that way about the ka ? <p> no , right now it 's the choice of teenagers ... my generation all teens had Civics , now all the teens I see drive around in some thugged out , fart canned 240 with stock KA 's , positive offset wheels and fluorescent paintjobs . <p> no , right now it 's the choice of teenagers ... my generation all teens had Civics , now all the teens I see drive around in some thugged out , fart canned 240 with stock KA 's , positive offset wheels and fluorescent paintjobs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RA65s .. 2/3RZ is probably best bet for easiest fit .. but you 'll still have to F around as , from what I remember when I looked into this years ago , they 're a tall motor , exhaust is on the opposite side to 22R .. <p> I have thought about this myself for my ST so here are some of the options I was looking at . <p> A Cam and megasquirt looked like an easier/cheaper alternative than a swap , until I started looking at getting a rebuild with RTE pistons and adding a turbo . The engine is dated technology but has been one of the engines Toyota built their reputation on . Not exactly performance oriented though . <p> The RZ engine are great , they are bigger , make good power/torque and you can find a bell housing to bolt up to your existing tranny , so no drive shaft modifications . As already mentioned they 're tall with the 3rz being the taller of the two since it 's gain is displacment is due to a longer stroke . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more since they tend to be newer and are most often found at a wrecker . ( There is a guys celica-gts that has done the swap . ) <p> Cost is one of the benefits with the KA motors . They seem decent , make good power ( especially with boost ) can be found CHEAP with a trans and ecu/wiring from someone doing an SR swap . Or you could do an SR swap your self . <p> JZ , 7M , UZ , or other V8 swaps do n't really fit the " fuel efficient " daily status . Mitsubishi 's 4g63 turbo does n't really either but at least it 's a 4cyl . There is a guy on celica supra that did the swap and I bet it 's a fun car to drive . <p> The one swap I 'd actually like to do the most , especially for a commuter , is a TDI . Mostly for the awesome mileage you could achieve but also for the WTF factor , if there is such a thing . VW diesel 's are pretty popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type 's . So much so that advance adapter 's and a few other companies make adapter plates and engine mounts to bolt these engines to factory drivelines . If you search you could probably find a drawing somewhere , it 's just a simple peice of 3/8 " plate . One thing about the TDI some people may consider to be a drawback is that the injector pump timing is computer controled , but there are companies that can rebuild them and make them mechanical . VW 's in-direct injected 1.9td is already mechanical and performance pumps are available ( not cheap ) . <p> Best I 've been able to find , this engine ( AAZ not AHU TDI ) with a warmed over stock pump will make in the 100hp , 150ft-lb range and a rebuilt performance pump around 150hp and 250ft-lbs. and still get better mileage than the 22re ! <p> Oops , some turned into ALL the options I was looking at , lol . Hope you at least find it useful . And decide to go DIESEL . <p> Thanks for all the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options , I 'm not afraid of custom engine mounts , custom exhaust or custom driveshafts , I just do n't want to have to do prefabbed bellhousings like niteparts ( so expensive ) or anything along those lines . I was wondering why nobody has ever done a 4age swap into one of these , is it not enough power for the weight of the car or something ? I imagine a 20v or 4agze would have more power than the 22r . I really wish I had an mk1 mr2 with a 4efte as a daily driver lol . I 've looked at quite a few of these with the 1uz swap but that 's not fuel efficient ( although it would be fun and is still highly appealing ) . Plus I 'd rather do the work to put the 1uz in my mr2 before I 'd let it go in the celica . <p> How easy is megasquirt to work with and what kind of gains can you get out of a cam on the stock motor ? Any off the wall motor ideas I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Corollas are already slow enough .. It 's not a case of power , but torque .. and 1.6L just is n't doing much torque NA , and for all the work of swapping a GZE in , you 'd at best get 10-15ft lbs more than a 22R and only if it were a late model smallport gze .. <p> Ask Steve about his Levins mileage .. just because its a V8 does n't  mean its going to suck down 5 mpg or something .. you need to work it less to get up to speed .. 1UZ is definatey one way to go .. <p> 2RZ is , from the experience of my friend who repairs strictly Toyotas , an extremely good engine ; much better than the 22R/RE 's . He had one in the shop with over 800K on it with no major repairs needed , that was pretty much the clincher . I know you said you cant find a complete harness , but how hard have you looked ?

@@8344954 @1544954/ @qwx111434 <h> Let 's talk AE86 Aftermarket intakes <p> I read alot of stuff online in forums about how different aftermarket intakes have their pros and cons and I thought it would be interesting to break down a few Aftermarket Intakes into one discussion . <p> The Injen Intake <p> I read that there 's no benefits to this Intake on an AE86 for how overpriced it is even . Not sure if this is an official Toyota Product but I 've seen some dealer websites selling these online . <p> K&amp;N Intake <p> Read that there 's some gain with this installed . Seen a few of these on some Cars . <p> HKS Racing Suction Intake <p> Crazy pricey if you can get one . Do n't know alot of information on these . See a ton of them installed on import AE86 's <p> ARC has two different type of intakes for the AE86 that are supposed to be rare but they 're posted online for crazy money . <p> Not sure what the difference is but the Super Chamber Intake looks massive . Looks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners on them . One guy 's car I 've seen a Custom intake box taking up nearly half his engine bay on his Ford Focus , it was jokes . <p> I researched a lot when I built the intake for my race truck . I found some wicked technical info on some really good forums . In a nutshell intakes are pretty simple , the length of the runners determine where your peak torque is , and its based on the time it takes for resonant pulses to get from the intake valve when it closes to the plenum back into the open intake valve . I shortened my runners from factory by about 4 " and it was proven on the dyno that peak hp and tq was raised about 1000rpm from stock . Its pretty cool how it works . <p> That said , if an intake has velocity stacks in it .... it will outperform one without them greatly , plenum should be about the size of the motor in cc . Tapered runners going from big to smaller from the plenum is great or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned , but those are some real facts you can use when looking at intakes . <p> Like TTC said . there is no need for a fancy intake . The intake helps the car breath better and that 's it . Ways to increase aftermarket filter performance are to isolate them from heat and/or place them in an airflow path . <p> That is provided we are talking about intake filters , not manifolds/runners . <p> but whateva maybe i 'll ad my piece of super sick knowledge ... foam filters are garbage , disintegrate over time ( long time ) and harder to clean ( if you even can ) cone filters can be cleaned easy and do n't  disintegrate <p> the ARC and HKS kits you posted are for MAP equipped cars . I believe Apex-i also has one for the AE86 , again for MAP . <p> the Injen intake is supposed to make some extra hp as well . looking at the design of it , it certainly looks like you can get good airflow going on that set up . yes , K&amp;N FIPK makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in person or even a picture of it before . does anyone have one so I can see what all the hype on this product is about ? <p> the K&amp;N intake for the AE86 has a velocity stack built into the filter adapter plate ... and appears to be the absolte least restrictive intake available for north american AE86 's as the filter has a very very large surface area ( cone ) and the plate has a funnel ... also , the K&amp;N filter is a proven high quality filter , that actually catches debris ... i 'm not too sure about most of the other dry or wet type filters ... <p> yep . The filter plate was radiused into the AFM opening to get the benefits of a velocity stack . And the filter is huge , not just a round cone , but oval as well . I had two , sold one to a friend . And the other with my motorset . <p> Here 's a pic when I did n't have it properly mounted , and your looking at the ' thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger side was ' flat ' ) . I eventually came up with better brackets and found a shorter 75-80 degree elbow off an early/mid 80 's camry that allowed me to put the AFM more level . I never took a pic of it though . <p> An intake is exactly that , an intake . There 's no hidden mystery or science when it comes to the power the 4AGE is putting out . <p> Choose a filter that has the best of both filtration qualities and air flow . This is usually K&amp;N . Do n't use sponge filters . Ever . They do n't filter . <p> Build an intake for yourself . It 's easy , and once you 're done you 'll join the majority of us that do n't understand why others spend the time to even research " intake kits " made by big companies that are $$$$ to buy .

Line wrenches are also useful , but can still round off the fitting . If you ca n't get them apart , cut the hard line with a pipe cutting tool or hacksaw near the old fitting . You can replace the fittings with new ones . Hope this helps . <p> Tonight , I 've successfully removed the gas tank !

I am debating whether I should keep the flares or not . So my question is , **29;454;TOOLONG wise is there any advantage in having wide wheels with a lot of negative offset or is it just a form thing ? <p> No keep it stock . Years down the road if you have the car it will be worth more and easier to sell with out molested fenders . A set of negative offset wheels in a conservative size will smarten up the handling , making it feel more stable but its never worth it if your cutting up a perfectly good car and going such extremes as CBY . I know . <p> Agreed . If your fenders are trashed and you have tracking in mind where wider wheels would be beneficial its worth doing but if they 're in decent shape and you already have the Supras just keep on keeping on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels/rubber and 4age 's is generally a big ol bummer as there 's not enough power to break traction . If you feel like selling your flares for a decent price get at me , I might take them off your hands . <p> Go wide and low ... if you ca n't break traction or it handles like a pig , fix that too . Sorry I do n't always agree with keeping it conservative . I like my cars clean too , preferably without fender flares , but sometimes you just have to pull the trigger . <p> Yeah , well I want to keep it a street car but I will probably bring it to the track from time to time so I would n't mind wider tires . I just checked the flares again and they sure look like CBY flares but I think they are probably a copy because there the rear are 30mm and I think CBY are 50mm ... I think I will probably end up keeping them just because I kinda like them and the fenders underneath are a little bit rusty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Do you guys have a trick to help determine what wheels size and offset would fit best ? I was thinking about using a measuring from the hub to the fender but I am not so sure if that 's the best way . <p> I think the biggest problem with CBY flares is that you ca n't get a quality replica . " TOYCOOLROLLA " was making and selling sets years ago and sold a lot if them . You probably have a set of his or a mold from a set of his and none that I owned or have seen have ever been decent fitting or quality . Anyway , yes most sets were 50mm , if you want to style a car around a set of flares then go for it . <p> Here is a picture of my old car with CBY 's <p> Diamond racing rear 15x10 4 " back spacing , front 15x8 4 " back spacing ( 3/8 " wheel spacer as well ) .

@@8344975 @1544975/ @qwx111434 <p> I appreiciate what you are saying , And understand . kinda . The swaybar was custom made by Gary , and is proably a pretty good replica of the stock te27 bar . But at my ride height and castor* the endlinks are not very perpendicular , that is part of the reason the shorten the sway . Also grip and drift are wierd , Quentin theorised on his blog about transitions and initiations the most important part of a turn for drift realy. the more bite you can get on initial turn in the faster/harder you can rotate the car . In steady state cornering I could see a stiffer front bar making the car push a bit more mid corner , but when you are already wildly oversteering , will that allow you to push it that little bit further ( possibly crossing over into the drift dimension ) and not spin out ? <p> I 'll try it out , if it sucks it will get changed back . I think roll stifnes is pretty important in a DRIFT car , the more abrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get . <p> No , my car at autoX , not so capable cant even keep it staight ! haha , but I still love it . <p> ONe more on swaybars , Devin says hardcore Japan does n't  run rear sways . I took mine off to autoX last year and cant say it made a major difference . I may take it off for some drift practices too , and see if that will also give me that little bit more rear grip to attain ultimate angle ! <p> *note on castor . I do n't  like castor , not lots anyway , I have my car set up with the bare minimum , just enough to clear the footwell . less castor=quicker turn in . And more rubber on the ground at full lock . Again better transitions . <p> Ok so the bar was shortened to correct the the link angle , I assumed the arm was shortened to increase the rate.I 've done some drifting with my corolla back in the early days with it , I doubled up the rear bar with some custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've not read this Quentin 's thread ( no idea who it is actually ) but agree that front grip must be optimised-its the same for all forms of motorsports really.My opinion on the bar set-up is that while for the most part the sway can make the car feel sharper in transitions it is n't necessarily offering any more grip.Thats why we try different things , maybe with your car the bar might be the best comprimise but without trying you do n't know . You say roll stiffness is important and that 's correct for sure , a different way to look at it is what makes the tire the happiest ? the set-up with the most rubber on the ground ( at differing steering angles/body roll angles ) and the least weight transfer side to side will offer the most front end grip.I know the cars look ok with the nutty amount of static camber used by most people but I doubt it offers the best set-up , tires not flat at any time on either side of the car and braking power is comprimised which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minimum castor setting , you need enough to provide feel and self center but that 's it and any more is not helping . <p> I am still convinced that running near similar camber and castor keeps the contact patch on the inside tire perfect at lock while the outside tire has next to no contact patch helps for cars with a lot of angle exageraring your wackerman . <p> With that said camber sucks ass for anything other than styling on Honda 's ... <p> Du n no , the outside tire is the 1 the should be optimized for grip as its obviously carrying the most load.From what I 've read , written by people far smarter than I , is that additional ackerman provides more grip than expected considering the relatively lightly loaded inside wheel . My steering rack on the new weapon is mounted so it can be spaced fore/aft to increase/decrease ackerman.Hopefully I can find the sweet spot . <p> I do n't know that I ever said gigantic front sway bars are great ... but I definitely love lots of front roll stiffness on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high front roll centers are sweet .

I know that the mid engine cars should use stiffer front roll stiffness compared to the rear , think of a fwd turned backwards and the set-up that 's proven with them.Did n't think that stiff would be the hot set-up however , I suspect braking grip will be comprimised with a less weight transfer due to front dive . Big front bar is the conventional set-up for a front engined rwd car while keeping the rear springs quite soft for corner exit grip , I found the opposite however.Yes you still need to provide high roll resistance at the front but springs only worked best for me , went back and forth several times in testing and the front bar consistantly caused understeer even on the softest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dampers are custom valved Koni race . If I remember , the car is currently on 800lb springs with a front bar .

Another thing Steve does is to run toe out all around , my mind says this is the way to go and soften the front to keep it biting after intial turn-in but like I said I ai n't no expert . My new car will run barless and only enough spring to keep the roll to about 3 degrees , will likely also try a little rear toe out for wicked rotation in the tight stuff ( its only an 81 " wheelbase and 900lbs so it 'll turn regardless but still ) <p> I ca n't help but think that steve needs to use rear toe-out to overcome the push associated with such high front rates .

There is a couple good DIY on the MS website . <p> looks awesome , you might wan na look at those instant touch solder guns , so you do n't burn the board as much . <p> That burn mark was a MOSFET explosion from a digital amp project . the whole board is jankey from years of abuse , but it 's my widest one , and i need the width to hook up so many ICs . <p> and as for knowing how to do what I do , well I 'd hope 9 years of post secondary education is good for something , not to mention being a nerd ( read : virgin ) straight through high school . So my loss ( or lack thereof ) is your gain , I GIVE YOU SCIENCE ! data/address bus is hooked up , verifying timing now . <p> Super happy update : I have successfully read out the code from the micro , and disassembled it , and sure enough it looks like real code . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second ( I went slow to make sure there were n't any errors ) <p> So here 's the files ! I suppose since this is starting to become technical and relevant I should close this thread and start a new one in the right section , or just get this one moved.cap.bin - the binarycap.asm - The disassembly of said binary . <p> now I do n't expect everyone to make use of these , but they 're here .. I also need better file hosting . <p> Well when you get to stage 2 , and want to attempt a small port , I volunteer ! Also , you can pull apart the spare ECU I have and see what is actually inside if you want . I can bring it when I get back to Canada and come over to get my block drilled ... That sounds dirty for some reason ... <p> Sparkie , I have a 1990 GTFour jdm Sard-tuned 3S-GT ecu if you wanted to dig into it . I 'd want it back though . <p> this sounds a little interesting . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8x processors , and if your sard tuned pcm is a factory pcm that has been modded there will be a daughter card on top of where the cpu mounts with 3 or more chips soldered to it , the eprom would probably be socketed as well for tuning options . would you be able to take a picture of the inside of the ecu for me ? <p> part of the reason i 'm working with the bluetop stuff is that it does n't  seem to be well hacked like the later ecu 's , and again because they 're cheap as dirt and I want to train myself up to working with the more important ecus . also you bluetop boys still need some tuning options for cars that have to pass emissions inspection . <p> so i 'm not alone and in the dark , infact it almost feels like im standing on shoulders when i go to work on the newer stuff , but i 'd like to get a simple , inexpensive tuning option available quickly , which is something i do n't  feel is coming from the other guys .

Jump the B+ and Fp pins in the 17 pin connector and your car should fire right up . Check on your wiring diagram for the wire between the COR and the AFM and repair it . <p> ya , the fuel pump is definitely getting cut , from memory it 's behaving exactly the same as if you tried to run it without the AFM connected to the intake ( if the flap does n't stay open power to fp is cut . ) .

Listen to the fuel rail and you will hear fuel pulsing in the rail if the fuel pump and circuit are working . If not , then you have a FP relay to IGN that is not wired up right , as was suggested above . The shop manual diagrams posted above also show you a test connector on the AFM harness that does the same thing as holding the AFM flapper door open . You bypass the door with a jumper wire on the connector . You should also test fuel pressure with a gauge mated to the cold start injector supply line , not by opening the fuel filter and setting your junk on fire . Good luck . Dentman <p> So it 's a stock Bluetop now and not a gze ? Why not just buy an engine harness or body harness to replace it with ? Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intake manually through the pcv hose to check if it 's a fuel problem ? Squirt enough and it 'll start . <p> I 'm not trying to be rude I 'm just trying to say that your labour is worth money too , getting a new used harness would save you a lot of hassle and stress

A tall order but we got started <p> here 's the crumpled corner . Amazing what a tree will do to a car <p> 4AGE in all its filthy glory . Needs a bit of a detail I think lol . The least of our problems <p> Jeff seems to be getting friendly with the driver side wiring harness . <p> Woo ! Passenger side wiring harness removed <p> In the midst of removing all the relays for the front lightbar . So much ****ery involved with this step <p> Here I am cracking the power steering lines loose . <p> Progress ! The whole engine bay wiring harness is out at this point .

That said , the repair was likely done in the middle of a rally somewhere so I guess I cant really hold the poor repair job against them lol . <p> Here we are pulling out the strut mount slightly with the frame straighter . Everything aligns pretty well now . <p> Here I am trimming all the old metal away to prep the seam for its new inner fender support . I like air tools . They are the proverbial **** . <p> Checking panel gaps ... Carbon fiber hood is not in yet , so were using a spare hood . Note the space aged prop rod . <p> Now I focus my attention on preparing the new upper radiator support and fender support . First off I ground off all the welding points , followed by some sketchy media blasting . I take the " cabinet " design of the machine as a " loose suggestion " . <p> Jeff peaking around the dusty car Perhaps media blasting right next to the car was n't the best bet to keep it clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface rust is gone wooohooo ! ! !

The engine could do for a pressure wash I think . <p> be sure to run an electric fan . the fan that was on that engine , ( the blue metal fan ) pulled so hard that it literally came off the spigott and almost ate the rad. i remember helping at the service point in leading tickles and getting that blade back on . it was a biatch. what did you end up getting the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Rob to bring the car back here so i could fix it and do an engine swap . <p> You would n't even run the blue fan temporarily eh ?

You can , just like I did , put a AE86 strut assembly , complete with the better brakes , into a TE72 but you must use AE86 springs BUT use the TE72 strut bearing . Its not a big deal but it is not a direct bolt-in . <p> the wagon has a leaf spring rear so it does n't drop direct in that but all the other bodies do . also not every te7x has the sway bar location on the fram rails , but you can drill and tap to put the new axle 's sway bar on . or just take off the sway bar <p> Originally Posted by JDMoran <p> Wow , that 's awesome !

I found after installing the kit , that the bulb flickers quite a bit when on . This was because Dodge/Chrysler uses a 55 Watt draw going to their stock bulbs . I fixed this issue with the customer by getting a relay ( two ) that stops the flickering ( it cost me $70.00 from my distributor ) -- but that 's what fixed the issue . <p> Oil : These bulbs , when installed - should be done wearing some kind of glove ( I wear rubber gloves ) - since the bulbs contain a gas , the oil from our hands and fingers can foul the plug and cause it not to work . <p> Bad Grounds : That Purple Civic up there has issues sometimes with the RH side light going off - it 's the ground on his stock wiring harness clip . It 's dirty ( splash shield is gone ) so the plug has corroded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by stripping the stock plug off , and hard wiring the HID bulbs in . <p> You ca n't just buy the HID Bulb - because it needs the whole kit with the ballasts to give it power .

@@8345009 @1545009/ @qwx111434 <h> Spring Setup <p> I have a daily driver that needs some new springs , so why not upgrade ? What do you recommend for improved street and possible XCross use ? i do not intend to own a track car , so I still need the ride to be comfortable enough ; no hemorrhoids please . I have also thought of buying lowering springs too . What are your thoughts ? <p> This is a post that I did on the 510 Realm , and while we were talking about a fellows particular 510 , it does pertain to understanding your suspension . As a GTS is slightly heavier than a 510 , the spring rates need to be slightly higher , at least in my opinion , depending on what you want out of the car , or to be more specific , what type of handling . I know you drift guys may take exception to my comment on oversteer , but you have to look at the context of the speeds involved , and safety issues , when driving on real road/hiway situations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for those of you trying to really understand your supension ... and to keep yourself safe . The " BLUE " 510 I mention , was one of our Australian memebers , who had just finshed building his car , lots of power .. but maybe did not figure out the handling thing , in a safe enviroment . Long story short ... he came down a slight hill , likely had trailing throttle oversteer , and went into a tree ... killing himslef . As we all jump in and buy this stuff , it is important to UNDERSTAND what we are doing . <p> I guess I pretty much agree with Okayfine . This is where it does get a bit tough , as to how do you quantify what it both " feels " like , and , how is the car actually handling . <p> The actual shock valving is the big key here , and that may be what you are feeling . I think it is in agreement here , that a 50/50 bump/rebound rate , for the most part , works very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most shocks do not specify that rate . I had my fronts custom valved by Bilstein , and my rears ... , they are what I needed . Too slow a rate in the rear , will cause the car to jack down , which causes evil handling , as the shock does not let the suspension springs to actually work . And yes , the shock if too stiff will give you a tendancy to either over/understeer , depending on which end is too stiff . Koni shocks were really bad for this ... I been there . <p> You do n't want to use the shock to set the over/understeer characteristics . <p> Bumpy .. jerky ... that gets to be a ride preference thing , balanced with the reality of what is the car really doing ... on a given road surface . Things are always a trade off somewhere No matter what , under whatever condition , things are kinda right , if the wheels are staying on the road , IE the car does not feel skippy on the surface . You need to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both your ass , and your hands on the steering wheel , is staying in intimate contact with the road surface , under all but the most severe conditions . Again , say under very hard braking on a short frequency bumpy surface , you may feel the tires almost locking , under the brakes . <p> Suspension " stiffness " , should not be confused with lack of CONTROLLED suspension travel . As some of us use very high spring rates , that is still matched to a shock that can control the whole package so to speak , AND , the resultant weight transfer , both fore and aft , and , of course body roll during cornering . <p> The other thing to not forget , as we all throw money at all this trick suspension stuff , is how hard are you using the car ? ! If you are just farting around , you may find the ride is going to feel stiff , with all the stuff you have bought , from reading this site . But , really get the car up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , and that is when you really do find out how things are working . What feels stiff now , is sure going to start to feel a lot softer as both the g-load and speeds go seriously up . And that is said with the fact that the anti -roll bars will effect how things work , as much as anything else . As some of you know , a bunch of us run NO rear bar , as our rear spring/shock rate , plus our 1 1/8 " front bar , gives us a slight terminal understeer condition at the limit , but .. below that the car is totally drivable with the throttle . And never forget .... WHAT IS YOUR DRIVING STYLE ? <p> Personally , as the speed gets up there , I have never found a oversteering car very fun to drive . At the slalom , or other controlled area , fine . But , in our real world of canyon runs , scenic tours , bumps , gravel on corners , yada , yada. , you kinda need that thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get out of the throttle , on the brakes , in a corner , blah , blah . Again , get the car reasonably balanced , with the throttle to control the over/understeer tendancy , and you will have a fun package , that will keep you safe . <p> With todays adjustable shocks , not that the valving is perfect , you can at least run the thing at a reasonabale ride , and try to use the spring rates to control the handling aspects , plus tire pressure , plus wheel spacing , can all fine tune things . <p> All things considered , my car does not really ride that harsh , at least according to some of my passengers , but then I have lived with the things for 30 years in this mode . I actually have my GTS set up the same as the Datsun , and as it is a heavier car , could actually be a tad stiffer in the spring/ant-roll department . If you are the type of driver that really toss'es a car in , this requires that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , as the instantaneous g-load can really ramp up there . I measured my 510 once at almost 2 g 's on a quick toss in . <p> I to can not comment on the rear springs , as wheel rate needs to be figured . You are on the right track , for you , and , as you have already seen , there is no one magic setup for all conditions . It is all about comprimise , you just have to figure out which one you want to sacrifice , for the type of driving you want to do the most . <p> EDIT : as i thought about this some more , what we are talking about here is the spring frequency , which is what we feel in our seat of the pants . A soft spring has a low frequency , so we just wallow along . As the spring rate goes up , that frequency goes up , so we end up with a ride that feels " jerkier " . That is the trade off , for both better roll control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to my earlier days of experimenting with springs and shocks , ride quality became secondary to roll control . No brainer there , but , with our 510 's , as most of us have found , we have needed to run quite STIFF , so as to minimze the rear toe change , which is the worst of the handling quirks . In using shocks built for heavier cars , we do have to be careful that it 's bump /rebound rate and the speed with which it can react , is close to the stiffer spring rates we use . Other wise , it will just plain be too harsh for our needs , unless we are really pushing the cars suspension . <p> I know in the case of my GTS , I really went for the stiffest antiroll bar I could get , and just upped the spring/shock rate a reasonable amount . I went with 300# springs up front , and Tokico adjustables . I can soften the shocks up for rain and snow conditions . I live in this thing everyday , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The rear I left maybe a tad too soft , but , that solid axel and four link I neeed to be ok on some gravel roads that I go on . Again , a comprimise . <p> Any time a car " feels " like it is going to take off , makes me wonder if you bottomed the suspension ? ? ? ? ? .. maybe just touched the shock bump rubber ? ? ? ? That is one thing to check for sure . You may not even hear it , or feel any THUNK , but , it just might have touched , which makes the car almost , specially the real feel like it is going to pitch UP quite dramatically . <p> I have lived this one ! Just something to check at any rate . At 85 MPH , and in a good bump/dip , that gets the enertia going enough to eat up lots of travel , more than you might suspect . <p> There is a point , depending on spring rate , and some types of bumps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner , that may feel like the car is pitching back up . This is just one of the things that you have to live with .... given the ability of the shock to be able to control things on REBOUND ... specially on the rear . The stiffer spring that we put in , as it compresses down under a severe bump , and on the LOADED side of the car , has a lot of energy stored there , and it wants to " Spring " back very fast . Who knows what the Mustang shock 's rebound rate is . If it is on the faster side , it may make the car feel like it is pitching up . <p> Yah , I think you have the " steering with the throttle concept " ... it is all about being SMOOTH ! Period . Sounds like that is exactly what is required .... you can lift ( in varying degrees ) , to get the rear to come out a tad , then feed power on again , without hardly putting any steering input in ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just trying to keep you guys SAFE ! <p> In the extreme , which is what I preach about , is that in our 510 's , you want to be able to even snap right out of the throttle ... in a corner ... with a late apex in mind , that will get the weight transfer to the front , , , instantly .. which gets the rear helping to rotate the car ..... WITHOUT THE THING EVEN THINKING ABOUT TRAILING THROTTLE OVERSTEER ! I do this quite a bit in my car , just at the speed you have been at . It gets the front to bite even harder , for turn in , then as soon as the rear gets the car rotated , your back on the power , transfering the weight to the back . Do this in a nice smooth fashion , and the twistys just become so much fun , and safe . <p> Sure , there is a point where stiffness would comprimise the handling of the car ... if the suspension is NOT doing it ; s thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a go cart at that point . Yes , if the shock is too stiff on rebound , that causes weight-jacking ... the suspension will compress INTO the bump ok , but , upon EXIT , it will pick the whole rear end up , as the shock kept the spring from rebounding ok . It can be a subtle thing to , as the car may have hit small bumps progressively , thus jacking the rear down , then you hit the BIG one , and it feels like it may be pulling the wheel off the ground ... which it is . <p> You are at the point now , of fine tuning how YOUR car feels to you , for your style , given that you have enough travel . <p> Not sure what to say about changing the spring yet . Play around with what shock settings you have , and again .. bloddy make sure you are not hitting the bump rubbers ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Preachy ... yes on this one . Crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> it sounds like that may be the problem , worth ABSOLUTLEY eliminating any chance of that ! Bottoming is one of the most dangerous conditions your suspension can throw at you , usually at the most dramatic times too . <p> I think I have told this story before .... I was at Westwood race track , 1978 , when I came up out of the hairpin , when , I was halfway through the s 's , when I hit the BUMP . As it turned out , after forensic analysis , I had blown through the travel , and hit the stock bump rubber on the rear control arm . This sudden loss of compliance , coupled with the turning input , caused me to spin out , into the tire wall , all at 80+ MPH . I was lucky , as it took all the energy and dissapated it pretty good . It took us awhile to figure out what had happened of course . <p> I had tried a bunch of shocks , one of which was , at the time , to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car jack DOWN . They were one of the worst I ever tried , at least in the context of the time period , 70 's and 80 's . <p> When you have a shock out , try pulling it out fast . As the rebound rate goes up , of course this gets harder to do . So , imagine you hit a compression bump , which knocks the shock in 1 " , and then it only rebounds 1/2 " before you hit the next bump ( or transient toss ) and you drive the shock in another 1 " , and again it only comes out another 1/2 " . the net effect , is that the travel is reduced each time , and at some point , on the next toss , the shock is so far in , that when the car is tossed in the next direction , it pulls the wheel off , or it just gets really light . so , yes you got it right . Just watch a 510 at the slalom with this probem , very evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertaining to do , is the best in my opinion , start with the softest setting , then , work up to the point that ... well .... what does it feel like ? that is exactly the best way , as you want it as soft ( relativly speaking , as you can get away with , but , not have any wallowing or pitching ( which is a bit of a function of the front/rear spring frequency ) but , you get the idea . I have actually tuned my mountain bike the same way , with those wonderful Fox fork and shock . The new fork I have , has a small bump sensitivity adjustment , which I have found quite amazing when you think of it . I could really drive myself crazy if I had this on my car . <p> I hope I have made sense of all of this for you all . The complete suspension package , on any of our 510 's , is a sum of the parts we have chosen . There is no perfect setup , for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our total driving window , or , sacrifice something , ride qualty , whatever , to excell in one area . Due to my racing , I have chosen ultimate cornering and CONTROL , above all else . The steering is quite heavy ( at low speed ) due to the castor , but , at high speed , and in fast , tight corners , it is a dream of predicatability , same with the rear . Is that not what a good suspension is all about , predictabilty , in most , if not all situations , that also keeps our 510 's nice and shiny . I still have that pictures of that poor young fellow in Australia , with his blue 510 wrapped around that tree . Not that that can not happen to any of us when we drive hard out there , but , we sure want to balance the odds in our favour .

@@8345016 @1545016/ @qwx111434 <h> exhaust note tuning <p> Is there a way to change the harmonics of an exhaust note coming out of muffler ? <p> My car is semi loud .

I really hear it when the exhaust echos off of buildings or when i drive along side something . <p> That " rasp " sounds like a bad honda exhaust on a civic . LIke a " tinging " noise if that is even a word . It reminds me of a cheap buddyclub system on a honda CRX . Its loud but sounds like shiz . <p> My system is 2.5 " stainless . NO cat . I 've recently installed a 16inch resonator in the mid section . My twin muffler also have resonators in them . <p> Is there somthing i can do to reduce the rasp noise at that certain point in rpm ? More resonators ? Is this happening because of the stainless system ? <p> The most important factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damping but do n't totally change the uninterrupted length since they are straight-through . What you need to do is put an obstruction ( cat or baffled muffler ) somewhere in the middle of the exhaust . If you put the obstruction in the middle , you should end up with that resonance showing up around twice the rpm , but not quite as loud ( because you introduced a muffler ) . You can also stagger it by placing the obstruction , say , 1/3 the way down the exhaust , creating 2 somewhat weaker resonances at 4500rpm and 9000rpm for example . <p> The most important factor is the length of uninterrupted pipe .

I 've heard a few straight pipe systems on a 16v &amp; 20v and most of them sound terrible even during engine breaking . <p> I tihnk my setup is pretty uninterrupted , under axle ... but could it also be that its going from 2.5 " to twin 4 " outlet tips at the end ? Maybe that " Y " shape before my twin mufflers could be causing that weird rasp at 2300rpm . <p> Does the thickness of the pipe make a difference ? Stainless has a different sound from steel ? <p> What I 'm saying is that you DO have a long uninterrupted pipe . Resonators take care of damping high frequency sound , but do n't really interrupt the pipe . Thickness and type of steel have very little to do with it , nor would the dual tips . Those make small qualitative changes in the sound . <p> You know how you can blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make sound with a frequency dependent on how long it is ? The air column inside begins to vibrate with a natural frequency . Your exhaust does the same thing when it is excited by the motor . If you want to change where that happens , you need to change the uninterrupted length of the pipe . You can do this by putting a chambered muffler in the exhaust to break up the air column into two seperate ( higher ) natural frequencies . <p> Now I 've reread your post and I thought you were talking about the " droning " sound that I always hear . A higher pitched tinny sound could be caused by a lot of things ... <p> Its a common sound because nobody ever puts a muffler in the middle of the exhaust lol <p> I did .

That 's getting pretty fancy ! <p> I am over the top right now with how good my exhaust sounds . I have cheap obx catback and it sounded just ok at low rpm , kind of deep and growly , idle not so hot , great at wot but it had this annoying resonance from 3300-3700 rpm where I spend a lot of time on my commute . I had pretty much decided that if I was going to drive the car on my hour long commute I was going to have to change the canister for something else or build my own exhaust from scratch . <p> Well on a whim I measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The obx has about a 5 " deep outlet , I tried the silencer at the extreme outside of the tip and then all the way in . All the way in it sounded like a completely different car , almost stock with a little throatiness so that 's where I fastened it . The cheap silencer only came with 1 bolt and it would vibrate so I drilled it out for 3 bolts and mounted it good and solid . <p> Got it out for it 's maiden voyage yesterday and it sounds fantastic , I ca n't believe it , so quiet at idle and just plain nice the rest of the time . Still has a decent roar on WOT yet now I can here my cool induction sounds , suction and spool . Very happy with it , I would n't change a thing . I 'm making the same boost and what not but maybe it creeps a little slower , but I was actually expecting I 'd lose a couple psi and a bit of power ... I 'm sure I lost something but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple in your tips ? You certainly have lot 's of depth to experiment with . <p> If anyone else is running the OBX I highly recommend you try this before you ditch it . <p> With two tips you also have the luxury of being able to tune by staggering the tip depth . <p> but seriously , is there anything wrong with using 2 mufflers ? i got 261 cams in my coupe and with an obx muffler it just pisses everyone off . i never have to honk or call when i pick someone up though . i was thinking since the obx was 2.25 i would upgrade to a 2.5 but put a mid muffler in and the same one at the end just like the oem piping . <p> @ neil i ran the silencer in my obx , you get some noticeable performance loss ... its pretty much like having a 2 " exhaust system . <p> I was pretty certain it was 2.5 " you know what I 'm going to have to go out and measure it with the calipers . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2.25 " PDM hi-flow cat . ... yes I have that restriction too so maybe that 's why I 'm not sensing a difference . <p> I was n't worried about performance loss , I still ca n't keep the tires glued in 3rd and that 's with sticky rubber , still have to be gentle on the loud pedal lol <p> You know how you can blow across the top of a piece of tube and it will make sound with a frequency dependent on how long it is ?

So as per Bill Sherwood 's beams swap site , the beams wants to run 62psi constantly , the factory beams setup is fuel pump intank , with regulator at 62 psi intank as well . So it just dumps it right back in , I want to do something similar and I will look for a stock beams fuel pump and reg setup . But if I ca n't find one , I want to run an inline walboro 255 , to a reg I can set at 62psi , with a return from the regulator running to a pre pump resivior .

Its a fair bit less expensive than the vipec unit , and they have a base map for the beams with itb 's from running and tuning a few of them . <p> Hmmm , I know the guy who builds crazy beams motors says even the stock manual motors are slightly choked off with 45mm ( blacktop ) ITB 's . They actually are a slight choke point in the design of the intake tract with the trd/trd copy manifolds . BUT I did n't feel like dropping another 1200 for some 48 or 50mm modified ones he makes . <p> I just liked the **27;485;TOOLONG of the Vi-PEC more .

I was under the impression the bt ones were 45mm and I was positive that 's what I measured them at . I 'm gon na feel awful if I was wrong dude .. <p> Ya the set I got from you turned out to be silvertop itb 's . The best way to tell is the back side of the itb 's where they bolt to the manifold , the silver top is perfectly round , where the black tops are a strange shape that is not round . <p> That 's fine , I used them to trade for the blacktop parts .

Before that I did everything in a portable car shelter , even in the winter , so it 's a nice change <p> Yesterday I reattached the rear panel and frame rails where the bumper bolts in , I also spent a great deal of time making two pieces of frame to attach the old frame to the new frame and make it look pretty . I anticipate that I need to make 2 more frame rail pieces per side and use one more 2x2 steel frame tube to get the rear section finalized . Then I will do the bracing on the inside of the cabin . Some aesthetic steel will be welded into the engine bay to give it a nice feel but I 'm leaving non-structural pieces till the end . Still waiting to hear about the cross member , looking for a local one because shipping on these things is a royal pain . Ok so we all love pictures : <p> It 's been a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a few hours of my life today . I managed to almost completely weld in two more frame pieces , it 's looking pretty sweet .

It 's a bit of a whoor of a job , especially when it 's -17 and you are doing it on the snow . Fortunately my dad shipped up his trick tool for me. all it is is a piece of pipe with a spindle nut ( 54mm i think ? ) welded to one end and the other end closed off with a grease nipple on it . Take off the first spindle nut , thread this on , and pump grease in . This forces grease through the splines and all the way out the back to the bushing which is inaccesible without big-time dissasembly otherwise . The hard part is pulling cv shaft back into place so you can get the c-clip back on . It gets forced back by the grease pressure , some grease will get behind and it 's a bitch to squish that grease .

Then its just a matter of tightening the bolt a bit , spinning the whole hub and rotor assemly , tightening it some more and repeating until the stub is in its proper location and you can get the clip on . you might be able to just tighten the bolt to suck it in without rotating anything but it 's not a high grade bolt , and by rotating it you help the grease smoosh out and distribute evenly . <p> If your front hibs are making terrible screeching noise this is likely what you need to do . There is also a needle bearing kit from toyota to replace the bushings , but it 's not a high load area , and this does n't have to be done often . Problem el solvedo.

On my KP the rear bumper was completely rusted apart , so what I did was replace it with just a piece of square tubing welded to the stock brackets .

If I had taken more time the fitment on the wrap-around portion could have looked nicer , but I still like it a lot better than stock .

I am glad to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reviews say to check if the head is leaking , rear axel seals , and to make sure its had the timing belt and water pump changed in the last 90,000kms .

It gets the same MPG as the 3.4 but is as fast as the 22re . <p> My starter is going on the 96 , the shocks are blown , and the rear window fell off the track so it wo n't go down but other than that it 's been very reliable over the 3 years I 've had it . Bought it for $3800 and I think that was fair . I 'm torn between throwing money at the 96 and making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land cruiser . <p> 22re 5spd was super fun .

@@8345037 @1545037/ @qwx111434 <h> Dimming stereo lights at night in an AE86 <p> ( ready for a LONG read ? ) <p> Hey everyone , I know this topic recently came up , and I was a little confused by the simplicity of the response . The question was how to hook up the dimmer/illumination for any aftermarket head unit so that the brightness can be decreased/turned down so the display is n't so blinding at night . Ideally , this would work the same way , as the dash lights when you turn them up/down . <p> The response from people here was that there is a dimmer/illumination wire in the OEM harness to connect to ... but I was quite certain that there was more to it , otherwise I would have been hooking my decks up to it all this time . <p> This weekend I finally got around to messing with it and figured out why I never bothered hooking up those wires before and rather opted to put the project on the shelf with countless other small tasks to take care of whenever the time arose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control all the instrument lights . Sorry if that does n't make sense , but what I 'm saying is that the 12V positive output is n't what 's regulated in order to dim the lights . The output signal from that particular wire in the radio harness is in fact the right one , but when it 's made active by turning on the marker lights and/or headlights , it gives a full 12V power source all the time , regardless of the position of the dimmer switch around the headlight switch . <p> The audio head units I 've used over the years are setup to work with a more simplistic ( probably domestic HAR HAR ) setup , which would require the 12V positive current to be regulated directly , instead of the seemingly complex approach that Toyota was taking with cars like the AE86 . <p> What I did was stop by Radio Shack and picked up a potentiometer ( basically what an analogue volume control is , or the dash dimmer switch for example ) to put between the connection of my head unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radio Shack carries about 5 potentiometers , all with ranging resistancesneither myself nor the guys that worked there had any idea which one I would need for my application , so I did what I always do when I 'm at Radio Shack ; look for the part that can handle 12VDC or more . Cost was less than $5 CAN . <p> I just hooked the switch up to my car during my lunch break and it works like a charm . There 's three prongs on the unit , one is the input , while the second seems to work as a permanent resistor and only puts out half of the power that 's input regardless of the position of the rotary knob thingy , and the third prong gives output just like the dimmer switch for the dash lightsturning the rotary knob thingy either reduces or increases the brightness of the head unit 's display ( so you can adjust it to that perfect setting if you like ) . <p> I 'm sure there 's some way to unlock the mystery of Toyota 's dash light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For you electronics eggheads reading this , if you think I should be concerned about the resistance levels of the potentiometer I bought by all means let me know ! <p> I 'll put some pics up tonight when I get home . Up until now , I 've been flipping down the faceplate of my CD player when highway driving at night on long lonely roads.do n't have to do that anymore ! Yay ! <p> *Edit* After the discussion below some more research on the part of myself and Ryan ( yeeeah ) , it turns out I was right in thinking that Toyota 's dimming circuit worked in reverse to the more simple approach . The 12 GROUND is what is regulated by the headlight dimmer switch . <p> This means that anything powered by the POSITIVE 12 source in the dimming circuit will dim ONLY if it is also grounded to that same ground used within that circuit . On aftermarket head units , the only way you could properly have one hooked up to the ground within that circuit would require you also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chassis ground . If the deck is able to ground itself to the chassis , the electrical current will bypass the dimming switch and the lights will stay at full intensity . <p> why not run a wire right off the dimmer switch itself ? Most toyotas do n't have a line for the dimmer wire in aftermarket stereos in the stock stereo harness because the stock stereos do n't dim . <p> I guess it 's because the brightness level of the dash lights would be at a different level than the stereo lights , and it would be a pain to get both the dash lights and stereo lights at the level you want . One might be too bright/dim than the other , so you ca n't have both at a level you want . And so therefore , a separate dimmer would probably be best . <p> But then , where would you PUT this dimmer dial anyway ? Did you drill a new hole somewhere ? <p> - TVK - <p> " There 's A Vid In All Of Us ! " " Do You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New One . " - Ben ( Soulibrium ) <p> By running off the illumination line in the stock harness , you are basically running off of the dimming switch . It makes no difference if you connect right at the back of the switch , or at the radio harness , or even to one of the wires connected to the dash or cigarette lighter sockets ... it 's all the same circuit , and when the lights are turned on a constant 12V source is provided . <p> I guess it 's because the brightness level of the dash lights would be at a different level than the stereo lights , and it would be a pain to get both the dash lights and stereo lights at the level you want .

Drill a hole and stick it out , or just hide it at the back side of the radio housing where all the radio wiring is bunched up . <p> hmm .. you know ... I wonder if it would work if you just connected the head unit to the dimmer wire BUT grounded the the head unit to the same ground as the dash lights . It would probably work , but those wires are really high gauge . <p> With my Starlet I tapped off the illumination wire for my Autometer gauges , the principle is the same with an aftermarket CD player . No need for an addional potentiometer when there is already one from the factory . The factory wiring diagram shows what the factory pot does and how the illumination wire is hooked up . <p> As for making them both the same brightness ( dash and cd player ) , just add a potentiometer between the illumination wire and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightness and hide the pot behind the dash as it wo n't need to be adjusted again . <p> Besides if you buy a wiring kit ( eliminates the need to cut the OEM harness ) it does n't come supplied with an addional potentiometer to adjust the brightness of the CD player , but yet you can adjust the brightness with the factory dash light control . <p> Besides if you buy a wiring kit ( eliminates the need to cut the OEM harness ) it does n't come supplied with an addional potentiometer to adjust the brightness of the CD player , but yet you can adjust the brightness with the factory dash light control . <p> Not on my car ! I 'm using a wiring kit , and it connects the dimming wire from the car , to the dimming wire from the deck . Does absolulely nothing but causes the display to flicker for an instant when the lights are either turned on or off . <p> Maybe something is just wrong with my dimming circuit then , because that dimming wire does n't dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . The only way I was able to get the illumination of my head unit to dim was by putting that potentiometer in line . <p> Okay , I 've heard from a Supra and a Starlet owner ... anyone with an AE86 play with the dimmer wire before ? ? <p> I 'd still run a wire off the dimmer to the dimmer function on the CD Player though . I do n't see how it would n't work since the resistance chances in the dimmer knob , so it controls the amount of current ( IE : dim and brighten the lights ) . No need adding a 2nd dimmer knob when you 've already got one . <p> K .. Corolla guy with new Sony deck and a wiring kit .. When I turn my headlights on , the deck dims .. it does n't  , however , dim/brighten in step with the dash lights .. my deck does , however have an EL ( electro-luminescent ) display , not the old style of bulbs in condoms behind the buttons .. so that 's likely why .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wiring kit ..

That 's one of the lights that dims when you turn the dimming dial on the headlight switch . <p> The positive terminal read 12V and turning the dimming dial made no impact on the voltage whatsoever . <p> The negative terminal however ... varied between 5V and 12V when the dimmer was turned . So this should mean the dimming system is a closed circuit as I thought . The only way the deck would dim if it 's dimmer wire was connected to the positive 12V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground within that circuit ... but you 'd have to go without plugging in your antenna , because that acts as a ground to the chassis . <p> I 'm fairly certain that Toyota radios did NOT dim with the switch , they just have a " dimmer " setting which is triggered by the park light wire , which is located in the factory harness . As for the actual adjustable dimming switch , it is a 12v out not related to ground at all . The dimmer is actaully a variable resistor very simular to your aftermarket pot . You should be able to hook your dimmer input to to the dimmer switch and recieve the same results . Just find a wire that shows 12v in the parklight on position that drops in voltage as the dimmer decreses brightness . The drop should be significant .... <p> If the one wire that is supposed to control the dash lights is +12v all the time then the resistor which is in the dimmer switch ( called the rheostat in the FSM ) is on the ground side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have to find a place , and it may not be the OE dimmer wire , where the actual voltage varies with the dimmer switch . There also should be a dimmer ground wire as well as the power wire that controls the dimming . If that 's the case then you can not use the decks dimming function because it works oppositely to the way the new deck wants it to work . So you have to play with the wires to make it work instead of using the regular dimmer wire , so ... <p> the easy way of doing it is to go to radio shack and buy a potentiometer . any pot with a range that starts at 0 ohm ( most of them ) and goes to 1,000 or 10,000 ohm will work fine . <p> To me , staring at the wiring diagram in the FSM right now , that 's the only way that it will work . Unless you rewired the car , so that the rheostat is on the positive side of the dash lights and then ground the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to do all of the circuits that feed into the rheostat ( ashtray light , defogger button light etc. ) , but it will be just a matter of finding the correct two wires ( unless there 's more than one positive ) and reversing them . The components involved would take it no problem but you have to consult the wiring diagram and do some digging . I would n't recommend it . <p> So the deck wants a varying positive and the car provides a varying ground . <p> Your explanation is exactly how I understood the circuit myself , but something that nobody seems to be willing to believe . Because the ground and not the positive is regulated , the only way to dim the illumination is to put another pot to control the positive signal which is required by the head unit ( unless you want to get crazy using relays and such and such and such ) <p> If anyone else has a better suggestion to adjust the brightness of their head unit in their AE86 , please let me know ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i was like 10 years old . This thread makes me laugh . <p> Migs , the year of conrads celica is in his signature an in his web site . <p> The potentiometer in his celica works the same as all potentiometers everywhere . It has a leg with 12volts to it . This never changes . There is a leg with a voltage that varies depending on where the knob is set to . I beleive that since you getting a reading of a constant 12volts no matter where you set the knob to , that you were simply measuring from the wrong leg of the potentiometer . Simple as that . Putting the pot in the supply wire or the return wire makes no difference to the crcuit . Either way it regulates the current flowing through the circuit.So I guess you could say that it DOES amke a difference where you got your voltage supply for your stereo 's dimmer circuit from . <p> Choosing a potentiometer has more to do with its voltage rating . How many amps will you be running through it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will be so touchy that you will pretty much go from full brightness to full dark just by turning the knob 1 degree . Do a google search for " ohm 's law " to figure out how many volts you will have left from puting a resistor value X into your 12 volt circuit . <p> When you say ' high gauge ' do you mean high numerically ( smaller wire ) ?

The only sensor that I need a confirmation is the tps .. Do you think it can be fitted to 20v itbs ? For me this could work but maybe you guys have other opinion about it . I know a guy who got a complete electronic jdm conversion ( ecu , map , distib , iat , tps , igniter ect ) for sale and this would be a very nice and affordable solution for my itbs + 272deg 9mm cams setup . <p> Grennie and Steve maybe you are right . I 've made some calculation based on the cam duration and lift which have resulted in : a stock ecu can run this #$% ? but yes with a set of ST itb 's I will probably need a piggyback to correct and adjust some lean spot in the high rpm band and adjustment of the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can work ? Unfortunatly I do n't  have a spare 16v tps to test the thing on my ST itbs but I suppose a simple " bracket " between tps and itb " driving gear " can do the thing . The tps and itb 's need 45deg of play so I suppose theses 2 are mechanicly the sames ! <p> This solution would be the best for me in term of cost , reliability , and easy installation ! My first option was the old and good MS but for the same price I can get the JDM kit and a e-manage without the headache of building the unit , make the harness and " extensive " and bit more complicated tuning . The secound option was the powerFc which can be re-programmed to work with a map sensor ( I 'm not talking about the d-jetro ver. ) but like you probably already know these standalone worth alot of $$$$$ ! <p> Anyway if you guys have some doubt about the possibility of adding an itb 's setup to jdm 16v map ecu do n't  hesitate to post your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the 16v TPS wo n't work with the 20v ITB's. i 've had to deal with 3 different itb MS setups that did n't  have a properly working TPS , and its not as easy as just using the bluetop one . <p> although both styles have the same wiring , i 'm sure the 20v one would be compatible with the MAP ecu ... although you 'll have to wire the 20v TPS plug into your harness , its really strait forward <p> Okay ! If one of the hardest part of this swap is wiring a 20v tps to the 16v harness that would be great . At first I was sure that any bluetop tps could do the thing but if you said no I will take your advise . <p> As for the 16v ecu reading 20v tps signal if the 16v-20v tps have the same type of signal and voltage range that would be logic .. and even more interresting ! Hopefully I have some spares working 20v tps ! <p> Just for info about 16v tps to 20v itbs I was wondering if the setup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection of the tps compared to the 20v plate position ? I 'm not talking about wiring here but about the switchs positions inside the 16v tps if I can say it like that . For now that the only reason I can see ... The ecu read a position which not reflect the real plates positions . <p> Oh almost forgot here an example of what 's my friend have for sale , an ae92 red-top map ecu with electronics ( I 've made an error when writing the title ! so the ecu and stuff come from an ae92 but I do n't  think that change something in the end ) : <p> oh , yeah i missed that part . the 16v TPS wo n't work with the 20v ITB's. i 've had to deal with 3 different itb MS setups that did n't  have a properly working TPS , and its not as easy as just using the bluetop one . <p> although both styles have the same wiring , i 'm sure the 20v one would be compatible with the MAP ecu ... although you 'll have to wire the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward <p> i 've always run the ST20v tps with the bluetop ecu , the wire colours are even the same IIRC <p> IMHO , I think you would rather go standalone like Megasquirt or Haltech etc etc . There 's going to be more adjustablity with standalone anyways . Using a piggyback system on the stock system is like watching porn . IT 'S NOT THE SAME AS THE REAL THING ! <p> Might as well go standalone since you 'll have to tinker around with the piggyback a lot anyways . Plus you 'll have to mess around with your harness or swap a map harness in for the stock map ecu . With megasquirt , you just have to make a jumper harness . It 's basically plug and play so you can revert it back to stock without the trouble of messing around with the harness again . <p> LoL maybe using a piggyback on stock ecu is not like doing the real thing like you 've said but I 'm not totally conviced that the engine will really required this type of ecu .. Anyway the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here what I doubt : If you compared the stock cam setup about 198 6.73mm true duration and lift for the bluetop and remplace by 272 9mm advertised duration/lift cams which are about 228 8.7mm true duration/lift you will agree with me the engine is not a future rocket , the 30 duration will not really raise the peak powerband in super high rpm 's ranges . I totally agree some corrections would probably need to be done , but I do n't  think it will worth the investment in a standalone ... Basicly the buildup is simple 20v bt bottom end , 16v small port head , 20v st itb 's , cams , 1szfe buckets , 82mm pistons ect with some kind of handwork on rods , crank , head and such . <p> And in the end that a swap that I want to try , if it can work which is seems to be . <p> the stock ECU will handle those cams , but add significantly higher comression , bigger injectors ( necessary ) , a head with different flow caracteristics , no T-vis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOT of adjustment to get it dialed in decently. not to mention with the stock 7200rpm fuel cut you 're going to be cutting your fun short just as the power starts to level out . <p> i 've had quite a few different 16v combinations , and your motor sounds like a pretty ideal setup , but i guarantee you as soon as its running you 'll regret having used the stock ECU . you 're going to need to make plenty of adjustments with the piggyback fuel wise , and the ability to raise the rev limiter when your motor is capable of 8500 is worth the few extra hundred alone . <p> could you explain what you mean by " handwork " , I 'm assuming this is balancing/weighing , knife edge crank , port&amp;polish ? Do you do this yourself ? <p> so far I have complete itb setup , complete ae92 smallport , e-manage ultimate piggyback . I 'm on the fence though with the e-manage , it 's the best piggyback but I 'm leaning toward standalone . Would you want it ? : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Just for fun three years ago I 've ordered a Ms1 pcb2.2 just for the fun of building it and test . I was also well prepared and Ive done a conversion harness but in the end the main things I was affraid of is the fiability of the unit , starting with no base map and spend alot of hours and money on the dyno to get it running proprely and even there . I 've even considered and take informations for about 6 months on carbs banking like Mikuni rs40 or Keihin FCR to avoid ecu control . In the end I have n't take the carbs simply because the Mikuni rs40 were to hard to modified with work required on the throttle shaft ect ... and the Keihin FCR were to big at 41mm and a bit too small at 39mm venturi . So my best option from there were the st itbs with 40mm throttle plates . At first I wanted to use the blacktop itb 's , comming from my dissasembled bt 20v used for the bottom end . But the diamond shape of the bt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with the st one 's ! I 'm there for now I still need a set of pistons , finish the machine work on it , and get the simpliest ecu setup I can use to run the thing without investing 3000$ to control 4 injectors One of the main problem is that I have n't saw a setup like this one so basicly I do n't  know what will be not enought or just too much .. <p> Answ3r Yes you are right . Here how I see it Itb 's do n't  give anything more than throttle response , velocity and a bit of flow . So I 'm not putting itb 's on the car to just have a nice looking intake setup but more for the throttle response it can give . In my particular setup the addition of injectors bodies between the itb 's housing and the funnel will give a better atomisation of fuel particles in oxygen , by changing the position of the injectors way before the chambers and in the end a bit more torque in the curve ( here and there ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  really like standard manifold setup simply because there are too big which kill velocity .. alot So even without regarding at compression ratio and volume you can see big gains by using theses . <p> Special K ! ! Okay I will not explain each and every small mods I 've already done and the ones to finish but basicly by handwork I mean polishing , material removing and rebalancing of the connecting rods to get lighter but a bit stronger units . Redoing carefully the pistons rings gap . Polishing the interior of the crank case so the oil which stay on the walls will be able to return in the pan and in the engine a bit faster then on a porrous surface , reducing vibration of the crank assembly , trying to reduce the oil drag but NOT BY KNIFE EDGING THE CRANK ( I hate this practice ) . Works on valve shapes , porting the head , itbs adapter plate , exhaust manifold . Reshaping the combustion chambers by removing only " joggles " areas near valves seats , blueprinting(definatly) and such ....... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 3 years of learning , work and fabrication I 'm still doing it by myself ahahaha Basicly I have every parts needed to complete the buildup but I still have some work to do . For your emanage I will take some time and think about it .......... again <p> Thanks alot guys and please do n't  look at every English error in this small text ! ! lol Hugo <p> I 'll tell you right now , the whole " there is tons of throttle response " is n't 100% true . It 's true if you 're driving 4000RPM - 7000RPM , but you will love all of your low end to mid end power . It will all be up high . <p> While this might have been good for drifting and getting attention , but was n't good for my purposes ( track days and auto-x where you need to get out of corners fast ) . I would suggest getting the setup running well on stock cams before you add aftermarket cams to the mix . <p> While they sounded cool , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ du n no , maybe I 'm too old now . But i thought they were really loud all the time , and I got a lot of " unwanted " attention . You also needed to warm up a lot int he mornings , and I just did n't have the patience for it . But that 's up to you . <p> Panda86 , if I understand well you have run a similar setup with stock cams ! I 'm sure with a set of bluetop cams that can be nice Basicly a type of setup with " just enought power " to keep the pedal to the metal ! ! ! <p> But to tell you the thruth the only thing I do n't  like with the stock cams is the lift ... That only due to the potential power of the 4age .......... In fact if you look the configuration and flow caracteristic of a red-top head for example ( Which is far from great considering the ports are sidedraft ) those heads need a lot of lift and a powerful lift integral to get that big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " small port " version ! ) In the end there is certainly a low velocity problem on ports of that type due to the shape and the big size ! So it need high lift and unfortunatly high duration cams to let the magic happen . That true to say that i 'm talking about potencial power but with such low lift you 're losing a lot of high valve-lift flow potential . Let say that a 272 9mm is a modest setup for the 4age . <p> But yeah like you 've said this type of engine is suited for high rpm which can be not very good for few applications . In fact my car is builded to do uphill/downhill and small circuit races . I basicly do drift or grip depending on the fastest technique for the curve ! Also that important to say that the vehicule is a occasional daily drive maybe 2-3 times per weeks . But in the end you suggestion of running the stock cams can be a good option for testing.I will probably try it since there will be not additional cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can give . <p> Also you 're totally right to say that aftermarket cams will bring attention and " poor " drivability atleast in certain rpm 's range . Like you , I do n't  like getting attention , and that why I have a ae but I think im addicted to " high " power n/a 4age ! As for the warm-up I usually do it everytime I start an engine , but can I ask if " warm up a lot " mean really really long or a normal 3-5min will do the job ? ! <p> Also thanks for your offer about the t3 manifold but the porting job on mine is finished since few months now and that was a lot of work ! ! !

The chassis is one of the first 2000 SW20 's ever manufactured ( #1650 , actually ) and started life as a G-limited . <p> Purchased this car with a bone stock ( other than MBC , 2.5 " D/P and a couple other small bolt-ons ) , swapped motor , blown head gasket and some other issues 2 years ago . First year I bought it mid-winter and spent my time swapping the head gasket ( with a TTE 1.4mm plated steel unit + decking the head ) , installing some ARP headstuds , cleaning up the issues , wiring , and added some bolt-on goodies ( 3 " downpipe , boost controller , GReddy sidemount intercooler , polished intercooler piping , ARC thermostat , BRIDE vios III driver 's seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <p> Anyway , it was a very capable car last year but I got used to the power ( 300whp ) and decided I needed to step it up a bit . <p> As with any car I 've built , put together or lightly modded ... I like quality , period correct , rare parts . First thing was first for more power - and that meant a bigger turbo . Being a mid-engine , rear drive car with great handling capabilities ... and the fact that I daily drive it in the summer , so it spends most of it 's time as a street car , I wanted to squeeze a lot of power out of it without losing all my low and mid-range jam . Again , I also like period correct parts from higher end JDM manufacturers . I decided to pick up a Blitz K3T 3070 kit to build off . From there I built the head , and picked up a ton of goodies to go with it . <p> I 'll just let the mod list speak for itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll fill in descriptions for the pics once I have a minute and post some updates tonight . <p> Today I have to pulled my alternator + bracket and fitted the KU/JUN intake manifold ( had to shave off some of the ridiculously thick flange to accommodate clearances of the alternator bracket ) . <p> Got the manifold fit and got the measurements for the custom throttle body ' stay ' bracket ( as the factory throttle body actuates in the opposite direction of the Q45 TB ... due to the fact that they are facing the opposite direction of the throttle pedal from their respective factory setups ) . <p> Head is built and assembled , all wiring is run and on the last leg of finishing things up ( minus stereo ) and the cams will be degree 'd Wednesday . <p> Last stretch . <p> Re-booked my tune with Reg at RCTS in Calgary for the 10th . After so many headaches , shipping **** ups , and everything else ... Ca n't wait . <p> With everything added up ( cams , valve springs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TB/intake mani , DP/exhaust , water meth , etc . ) I should be able to hit right in the area of 450whp pretty easily , based on the research I 've done on these Blitz setups . An unopened , bone stock , 3rd gen running that 2.25 " downpipe and factory fuel system chasing ignition issues made 363whp at 18psi ... so I think I should be sitting pretty much exactly where I 'd like to be . <p> 300whp was a blast last year ... so really anything over that will put a smile on my face regardless . <p> Today I picked up a new steering wheel ... 320mm deep corn suede ( with top indicator ) with anodized blue spokes . Traded my buddy a bit of braided SS line for it . Might use it , might not ... I 'm not the biggest fan of the momo wheel I have aesthetically , but it 's so tiny and nice and chubby ( that 's what she said ) , so it 's got great feel to it . Plus I bought it when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the imports I 've ever owned . I 'll post some pics of the new wheel soon . <p> Gunna run to Mopac and pick up a new AEM map sensor and hopefully go pick up my GReddy Water Temp gauge from my buddy shortly after . <p> Glad you guys like it . It 's definitely a little bit of a different formula than the average SW20 out there . <p> Local guy named Paul who works at Project Omega here in Edmonton just made over 400whp on his s14 sr20 with the same Blitz setup as well . So I 'm looking forward to getting this thing finished up and seeing what kind power I can make . <p> Thanks , haha my uncle has owned ( and was head chef at ) a bunch of restaurants and then got into food distribution so I get Italian soda syrup through him . I do n't mind it by itself though actually . I 'm actually a sucker for S.Pellegrino carbonated water ... used to think it tasted like **** and now I crave it constantly . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why most people hate it . <p> And yeah , as for the S14 he 's running the same turbo / wastegate .

I had a smallport 4agze from one of those cars in my AW11 , and it went good ! What year is your car ? <p> I made a lot of modifications to my engine . By far the best modifications were : - Scrapping the top mount intercooler and going with a high efficiency intercooler with a fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal - I removed my throttle body , and bored it out to 55mm , and I put in a throttle plate from a 4age . This made a HUGE difference to throttle response . Really woke up the engine . Top end power improved too . - If your car is a MAP engine ( has a boost sensor instead of AFM ) , do n't push the boost much past 12psi , or you 'll get out of the ECU fuel map and it 'll cut your timing back . You loose about 20hp at 5500rpm and above . - A standalone ECU would be an excellent modification if you really want to release the potential of your engine .

It should be fine since he told me there 's no dead cells but .. my concern is for charging it regularly if I have to down the road again and my ****ty Canadian Tire motomaster charger ca n't charge it .. <p> What Battery charger is good for this type of application ? the Part source guy says my battery charger might be restricted to only charging my battery at certain minimum volts and not a entirely depleted one . <p> Read on the Q&amp;A questions for this charger from Motomaster that they recommend that the battery 's no good if it falls under 2.5 volts , which it has in this situation . That does n't sound right .. since the Partsource guy told me his charger was charging my battery . It seems more or less that this Eliminator Charger sucks . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I connect my Motomaster Eliminator Charger to it . Battery 's now in " Reconditioning mode " wtf ... it did n't do that before . Guy said at Partsource it would n't charge past 5v 's .. so maybe they wanted my battery out of there ( not wanting to fully charge it , even thou I bought some Windshield fluid there and I regulary buy **** there ! ) .. but the Part source guy told me it was flat out dead and would n't charge past 5v 's .. <p> I 'll let the battery charger at home do its work and see if it gets it past " reconditioning mode " if it does good , but then I 'll still have the same orginal problem with the charger maybe not being able to charge it with no voltage which should n't happen in the future but I never owned a battery like this before .. so I do n't know . I just do n't understand why when I tried it before today it did n't go into reconditioning mode directly ? and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charger and they told me it 's flat out dead even thou their battery tester said it 's got no dead cells . <p> I do n't know if this is some sort of special battery , but but if a plain-jane lead acid battery gets discharged past about 1/2 charge , it wo n't ever come back to full 12V . General rule of thumb is to never let a 12V lead acid cell discharge past 9V . That 's the lowest you can reliably bring it back from . I 'm not saying it 's impossible , but it 's not very likely ... <p> I do n't mean to be rude but buying a second hand battery is a dumb idea ! If you absloutltly must meet the person at a partsource or someplace that can test it before buying . Sounds like you bought a dud . <p> Thing does n't seem to be getting out of reconditioning mode , more likely it 's gone forever . If I had doubts about this guy I would n't have bought the battery , just a pain having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure the guy will give me my money back . I know where he lives and I doubt he 'd want some guy bothering him over a couple of bucks . <p> that reconditioning mode is designed to desulphate lead plates .

Get a boring old regular charger 2 or 5 amp trickle charge and get it back up over 12 . <p> The problem was too much to waste further time with given the voltage was really low . I just returned the battery to the Owner since i had two failed attempts with other chargers . Surprised my charger did n't do it on 2amp mode . <p> This battery was n't a necessary thing to have so down the road I 'll get another one . <p> The problem was too much to waste further time with given the voltage was really low .

@@8345063 @1545063/ @qwx111434 <p> No modifications are going to be done to this motor , I 'm going to run it stock for a little while and just get used to it . More power will come in the future via larger displacement replacement motor with upgraded stronger transmission But alas that plan is still far off ( although I 'm already parts shopping lol ) <p> Spent a few days in the garage this weekend just finishing up a few little things with the frame . Today I had to baby sit at the same time so work was slow , also started classes again last week and I need to spend the next week/weekend working on the bmw so I probably wo n't get anything done for a week or so on this . Most of the engine bay is done as far as welding and cutting goes , there are a few seams/joints that need to be welded but nothing major . Next up is the crossmember plus engine test fit ( how did I know I would n't get that far this weekend ? lol ) , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After that I will clean up some of the welds , do a bit of bodywork in the engine bay to get it looking really nice and then I 'll seam seal and paint the engine bay . I sprayed some paint on the bare metal today to keep the surface rust at bay and the white makes it easy to see what needs to be grinded , filled , etc . Overall I 'm really happy with the current progress . <p> Slow progress due to school . I 'll keep this brief and add a photo or two . <p> I found a nice set of rims for the car , I 'll need to get two more tires and also paint the rims gloss black . I also took the torque converter off the engine in preparation for flywheel/clutch/bearings test fit . <p> I 've been thinking a lot about the quarter panels and what I will be doing there to bring it back to life , nothing inspiring yet but I have a few ideas on how to make it pretty . I 'm as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the air comes in through the bumper and rad and out through the frunk hood . This will allow me to upgrade to a larger rad , better fans , eliminate some piping , and hopefully streamline the cooling system to accommodate the v8 . Have already researched and chosen larger front/rear calipers , rotors . Final decision has been a headlight conversion , most likely custom ; and I have a few never-done-before ideas in mind <p> I know some will complain about the decision to stray from the oem mr2 design but my reasoning is that with the wheelbase stretch the car might look like a " funny mr2 " and I ca n't have that . If i want it to look like an mr2 I 'll buy another mr2 . So instead I 'd rather have people see the car and go " whoa , what is that ? it looks cool " . Hence a lot of things will be changed , but hopefully the end result is as awe-inspiring as I can imagine <p> Bought these used . The previous owner liked my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . 17x8.5 +41 and 17x10 +41 . The offset is kinda high but the widths kinda make up for that fact . No stretch here either . They came with a good set of 235/40r17 Nexxens that I 'll be putting on the front . I 'm not sure what size to go with on the rear , I 'm thinking 275/40r17 or 255/40r17 ( I 'm using these to aid my decision LONG ... , audi transmission is calculated for 205/60r15 ) Anyways here are the rims : <p> Did n't feel like doing any school work today because it 's over ten degrees outside , so I put my engine in instead . Literally took like 15min , slid in place like a baby . This is the first test fit of the engine , the frame is done ( save for the tension rod brackets ) . Looks like my measurements and calculations all came out well as there is still plenty of room for the fuel filler neck in front of the block . Next I 'll test fit the transmission and get to modifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tilt backwards a little bit , but as it sits I should have about 2 " from the top of the covers to the slanted firewall : <p> Enough room for the filler neck once I tilt the block back and install the transmission . I 'll need some serious dampeners to keep the engine from squishing the pipe though as I believe I only left 1 " clearance between the block and neck : <p> Just need space for hoses over here probably , nothing really on this side though <p> Finally , the oil pan ground clearance with reference to the original frame . Hard to tell in this picture but I have lots of room . <p> If you 're looking at the welds against the fire wall , yes they are ugly lol . Every time you hit that fire wall with a spark the rubber sealant leaks through and lights on fire . Those plates are also tied in nicely at the frame rails below and frame beside and will be tied in to a metal plate on the other side of the firewall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flux-core so can spatter a bit but the welds are clean on all other parts of the car . 
@@8345064 @1545064/ @qwx111434 <p> I really enjoyed my set-up all 2013 summer . The car is a blast to drive . It was impossible to do a ride driving normally . Always wanting to press the gas pedal to hear the wonderful whine song coming from the supercharger . <p> When you are used to shift near 8,000 rpm because you drove 4AGE powered cars for the last 15 years ; it 's frustrating to see the rpm needle stops under 6,000 rpm . <p> The stock 3RZ redline is supposed to be at 5,500 rpm . Mine revs to 5,900 rpm ( yes my tach is accurate ) . But one day I found on a Tacoma forum , a guy that hacked his 2RZ ECU .... allowing it to revs 6,500 rpm . He gave me his ' ' secret ' ' , so I ordered a 17.7 MHZ crystal clock at an electronic store . It cost only 70 cents . <p> So I changed the stock 16 MHZ crystal clock by the new 17.7 one . It took a few minutes . <p> It was working ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! <p> The A/F ratio became a little leaner , but the ' ' problem ' ' was easily resolved with the AFC Neo . <p> With this 600 rpm improvement ; I was able to use the more common 3.90 diff ratio , instead of the VERY RARE 3.73 ( do n't forget I still have a 6.38 ' ' SR5 differential ! ) . <p> I know the crystal mod creates a ' ' distorsion ' ' in the fuel and timing maps . I did not noticed any downside with the timing .... only leaner A/F ratio , that was corrected by the piggyback . <p> The guy that gave me this trick , run a 2WD Tacoma 2RZ ( 2.4L ) . He had the stock ECU with crystal mod , 440cc injectors , and a Mitsubishi Starion 's turbo at 21 psi . He compensated the fuel/timing distorsion with water/meth injection . He ran 4 years like this without any problem . <p> One downside of this TRD supercharger , is the lack of intercooler . It works very well without one , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyboy knows water/methanol injection works GREAT with a positive displacement supercharger ( roots , twin-screws ) , particularly when the water/meth solution pass through the compressor . It cools the rotors and S/C housing , and creates a little more boost because the mist increases the rotors efficiency . The rotors blend the solution , so each cylinder have the exact same A/F ratio . <p> Water cools the air charge drastically , and the meth acts like race fuel by increasing the octane level ... so it retards knock . The evaporative effects of the water , plus the octane boost of methanol , allows the motor to run more advanced ignition timing and/or boost to create additional horsepower ... with proper tuning . <p> So surprise ; I bought a water/meth injection kit . It was a used kit , so it was a lot cheaper . The plasic hose was not long enough to install the tank and pump in the trunk . So I decided to install it ' ' temporarly ' ' behind the driver seat . <p> When installing the water/meth kit ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because there was already an hole with the same size and thread . <p> But the downside was when the throttle-plate was closed ; the vacuum sucked w/m ... even if there is a check valve in the nozzle . So I 've put it before the throttle body , like it is recommended . <p> The AEM w/m kit comes with a progressive controller with an integrated MAP sensor . I set it to start injecting at 1 PSI , and set it to be fully injecting at 8 PSI . The delivery is progressive between 1 and 8 PSI . <p> In the AEM kit , there is three injector size . 130cc , 315cc and 550cc . The 130cc is rated for engine up to 200hp , 315cc from 200-350 hp , and 550cc for 350-600 hp . This is a general guide . In fact ; a supercharged engine without intercooler needs about twice the amount of w/m to do the same job . <p> Just to confirm ( and by curiosity ) , i 've first tryed the 315cc injector . I went for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the w/m gave me a richer a/f ratio on the wideband . So I installed the 550cc injector , and reduced a little the injection times at WOT with the AFC Apexi Neo . <p> I went again for a road-test ... <p> The a/f ratio was way too rich at WOT . I passed about an hour driving and stopping to adjust the a/f ratio the closer possible to 12.5-12.8 . When it was better tuned , WOW ! ! ! ! It was really impressive ! It 's hard to tell with my ' ' butt-dyno ' ' , but I 'm not afraid to ' ' guesstimate ' ' the gain to about 30 whp . I also gained about one psi more boost because the mist increased the rotors efficiency . I rided about 20 km ( very spirited driving ) . I opened the hood and touched the S/C . Usually it should be very hot after a ride like this . Now it was almost cool ... a big difference ! The difference with a laser thermometer was around 22 degree cooler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked into it and could n't believe it was so easy , so efficient , and so cheap . Let us know how much mix you 're going through . ( I 've got an M112 laying around , will probably go on my Tacoma some day ) <p> You can probably go leaner than 12.5 and get some more power . Now that you 're running so cool there is no reason to dump the extra fuel in there . EGT gauge would be nice so you can make sure you stay on the safe side . The AFC is always pretty ghetto ... You 're not doing much though , I think it 's okay to use in this situation . <p> More I 'm hitting boost , the faster I 'm going through the 4L tank ! It should be possible to not burn a drop of W/M without hitting boost . But the car is so amazing and exciting to drive ; it 's almost IMPOSSIBLE for me to not be WOT ! So a ride of very spirited driving on twisty roads takes about 3.5L @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' super high boost ' ' pulley , I ordered one ( 10 PSI ) . <p> My brother lives at about 500 km from me , so we do n't see each other very often . He passed a weekend at my house . So we installed the 10 PSI pulley , and went for a ride . He was extremly impressed how fast my car was . He was laughing out loud like a boy everytime I was hitting the gas pedal ! Unfortunately , while we were rolling at very high speed ( 200 kmh+ ) ... a front tire exploded . By the time I was able to pull on the side of the road , it was too late .... my rim was scrap .

Stock , it should be fine for like 350-400hp . Over that and you 'll start breaking axles and have to buy aftermarket . Lots of options though . A 225 is a skinny tire compared to what most guys run , it will hold up just fine . It 's been done , just go for it , you 'll figure it out . Matt Hasse on here has an old build thread with some detail ? ? , some guy from QC has done it too . It 's really not that difficult . <p> Devin that 's odd , There are dudes on Miataturbo.net pushing 350-550 HP Miatas into stock diffs that do n't break anything and run 225-255 tires/slicks .

Replace that and you are golden . <p> Also If you go Miata there are Ford 7.5/8.8 CTS-V IRS swaps you can do that would ensure longevity at the cost of weight .

Some of the LSx V8 roadster guys do this swap . <p> Miata rear end out of a car is literally a box and a nice tidy package . It is flat and has 6 mounting holes in a symmetrical pattern .

If the old Challengers and Barracudas could be supercharged , this little Corolla can too . <p> That said , my question is : Has anyone had experience with something like this , and can it be done ? <p> You 'd probably be better off with an SC14 than the little SC12 . SC12 is almost too small for a 1.6l 4agze never mind a 1.8l 3tc . SC14 is the same price anyhow ( used ) , and you 'll have to do all custom piping/brackets anyhow . You could probably setup a blow through setup so the carb is after the SC . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think this means the fuel pressure has to ride on top of the boost pressure . You 'd also need to make use of the stock air bypass valve . Jetting the carb may be tricky . Probably not all that hard with a bit of reading though . Do it ! ! <p> Alright , so after hours of research , I 've gathered this : The SC14 has a higher output than the SC12 by 220cc . It is used in a wide variety of aftermarket applications . Needs more space in the engine bay than SC12 ( no problem ! ) It 's pulley has an electric clutch for fuel efficiency ( turns off at idle ) . I 'll need an intercooler because it gets quite warm . I 'll also need to custom plumb and mount it . <p> Additional thoughts : I could pull a small intercooler from a turbo Firefly or old Volvo , as well as wire the E-clutch to a toggle on the dash so I could use it selectively . I would run a blow-through setup cuz if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the screws with the A/F mixture and cause damage . <p> In short , it 's a big job , but worth it in the end . There is much learning to be had in a task like this , and I am definitely thinking about it now ... <p> Thank you both for your input ! I looked at the pics from the rollaclub link and got a good idea on how I would go about this ; I have all sorts of new thoughts spinning around in my head ! Questions to come after i ponder more ... <p> Blow through = custom/marine carb . Ca n't use a stock/regular carb for blow through , you can with draw through . Carbs need vacuum to draw fuel from the bowls , with a blow through super charger or turbo , there is no long Vacuum at certain points in the revs , and often positive pressure , so the car will lean out and explode . You need a carb that does n't use vacuum to draw fuel . <p> Bike carbs are gravity-fed right ? would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just gettin my **** mixed up now .. <p> And by custom/marine , do you mean i should pull one off of my grampa 's outboard motor and side-draft it ? I know this is gon na be a big task that will need a lot of preparation before i go underway so I want to get as much info as I can as early as I can . <p> What supercharger would you suggest for a draw-through setup ? Could n't I build an airtight box around the carb and set my fuel pressure regulator to compensate for the extra pressure and vacuum loss ? I do n't want to have to ditch my Weber already ... <p> There was a guy on DK a few years ago who turboed his starlet with a blow through setup : http : **39;541;TOOLONG . You could email him and ask him what he had to do to make the carb work in this application . I 'm sure he 'd be happy to help . His name is Conrad . <p> Blow through = custom/marine carb . Ca n't use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . Carbs need vacuum to draw fuel from the bowls , with a blow through super charger or turbo , there is no long Vacuum at certain points in the revs , and often positive pressure , so the car will lean out and explode . You need a carb that does n't use vacuum to draw fuel . <p> Not quite true . <p> Carbs work because there is a pressure differential between the inlet side and the engine side . You 'll still have a pressure differential ( high pressure on inlet side , lower pressure on outlet side ) with a supercharger ( or turbo ) so fuel will still flow . <p> However , the carb has to have everything equalized to the " outside " which is now boosted in a draw through setup . That means all the vents have to be plumbed in AND you have to ensure that your fuel pressure will rise in response to the boost pressure . If you 're running 8psi of boost and 5psi of fuel pressure , well , it does n't work very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that control all sorts of other things on the outside of the carb that are referenced to atmospheric . You either have to seal them off or ensure that whatever they 're operating is referenced to boost . In short , I would n't do it with a stock carb . <p> It would probably be relatively easier , safer , and more effective to convert to EFI and then add some sort of boost-adding device . Might even be cheaper to Megasquirt than it would be to buy some fancy Holley carb that is designed to work with blow-through . <p> Of course , with draw-through , you do n't have those problems . Just new ones . <p> i think if your going to go this route , do the edis setup first ... that 's what my plans are at least if i ever get around to it <p> Ok .. I 'll bite .. <p> Why ? <p> I mean it sounds like he 's trying to do this on the cheap ( that 's kinda the only reason to stick with carbs these days ) , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at local yards ) and Megajolt ( 160 ) , machining and mounting brackets you 're into it for 300-350 .. and you 've gained a somewhat improved ignition , but you 're still fighting with jetting a carb on forced induction .. <p> do n't  get discouraged though dude , your webber carb is a good candidate for tuning and adjustments . it should n't be to hard to mimic someone elses setup for a forced induction motor , running that carb , and a similarly sized motor- just to give you a rough base . <p> For a blow-through set-up the bowls must be pressurized to respond to boost , like Ryan said . This means internal mods to the carb . You 'll also require a rising rate fuel pressure regulator that runs on low pressure . Very difficult to find . If you do n't know these things then webers , stock carbs , or sidedrafts are NOT the way to go for you . <p> If you are determined to go carbed with boost then the holley marine is the least expensive and most suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just need a manifold likely only available from brd . <p> Stand-alone efi is really the best solution . Best believe there is no such thing as cheap turbo set-ups . <p> Note** also agree with Brett , why is EDIS needed ? ? ? ? @qwx111435 <p> There 's nothing wrong with draw-thru with a supercharger , and you do n't have to do anything silly to the carb . How many big blocks do you see with carbs under the blower ? Not saying that EFI is n't better though . <p> Could n't you just get an ignition box with timing retearder ... Like a timing twister from msd. @ sunray ... I 've been wondering about that low pressure raising rate fpr ... Does Holley or edlebrock make one ? I have a Holley blue pump and it came with an adjustable reg but it wo n't change the rate via boost/vac . Not that I need one ...

I though I 'd sign up and post some stuff about my Toy . I have a 1972 Toyota Celica with an 3.8 SFI Turbo Buick Grand National drive train in it . I started an album with some random pics of different engines , and stages of builds , but will post pics here as well . <p> Thanks Guys ! History . I have had this car since around 1976 , ( yeah , I 'm old ; - ) , and I used to rally drive it hence all the fog lights LOL ) and have always had a couple of cars at the same time . I mostly had muscle cars , ( 69 Nova SS. 71 Cuda , 67 Dodge Coronet , ... ) and they came and went , but always kept this one . I did the basic engine mods to it when I first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannon manifold , and header , and aftermarket exhaust . I later added an " race " cam , and optical ignition , to replace the old points setup . It was a 4 speed when I bought it , so I hunted down a 5 speed . I then managed to find a couple of differentials with different gear ratios 4:36 , 3 : somethings ( I cant remember ) to match up with the 5 speed . After i got bored tuning that , and maxed it out HP wise , I saw an article in a Car Craft magazine about the twin cam 18R-GU that could pump out 500 HP . Went on a vacation trip in California and looked up TRD , ( Toyota Racing Development ) met the owner , and went for a ride in his " Toy " : - ) Wanted one like crazy , and I managed to get my hands on a DOHC motor and put 12:1 pistons , race grind cams , custom built header . Tie that to a 5 spd with a 4.36 rear end and 8500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I eventually hurt the motor , and was just growing tired of having to always tune it . Constantly having to play with the jets in the dual side draft carbs was a bit of a pain , so I decided to try a different swap . I wanted something that was easy to maintain , and was easy to get parts for so I started looking at North American engines , which I was much more familiar with . First choice was of course was a V8 small block Chev , I had one laying around , and tried to mock it up see how it would fit in the engine bay . I had issues with the oil pan , and stock Toyota steering stuff and K member , as well as it just sat too high , so that would have meant that I would have to cut a hole in the hood and put a hood scoop on . Did n't want to do that , and also the engine weight was around 550+ lbs so there was just too much of an imbalance . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stuff about the 231 Cu in Buick . It was close to 200 lbs less , and was not as tall , so hood clearance would be good . It also being shorter made for an easier fit . I found a dummy block for mock up and started making cardboard templates for motor mounts . I still had issues with the K member and steering , but was able to notch the oil pan for clearance , and pulled the stock steering box and all the steering components , and fit in a Toyota Tercell rack and pinion unit . Had to mess with the control arms and reverse the strut rods , welding mounts into the frame just below the firewall . After I got the basics sorted out , of how low , and far back I could get it to fit , I fabbed up some motor mounts , and went on to the transmission . I had a old 4 speed Saginaw sitting around from the Nova , but it would n't bolt up to the Buick block , so I had to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevy Monza . Got that sorted out , and relocated , and redrilled the mounting holes in my stock transmission support to fit the new tranny . I then had to adapt my hydraulic clutch slave to the Chev clutch fork . PIA ! ! ! trying to figure out how to mount it , and get the proper throw to get the clutch to operate properly . Had to mess with a lot of geometry , pivot mount points , to get it right , and had to make numerous beefier slave mounts , to stop it from flexing . Eventually got that all sorted out , and had to cut the tunnel open to mount the stick . Moved on to the driveshaft . I pulled the stock two piece unit , and chopped down a Buick shaft and welded on a Toyota rear yoke , so it would still fit the stock rear end . <p> Next came sorting out the electrical stuff . Having out figure the ignition and sensor stuff . ( i wanted to keep all my stock gauges , so I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Buick , like oil pressure , and temperature . ) I used the stock Toyota alternator for a bit , but then trashed the whole alternator/external voltage regulator setup , and did some rewiring to get the GM alternator to work . Stock Buick starter was too big to fit because of the cross member , so I had to source a smaller Buick starter . Cooling was just using the stock Toyota rad , and making some hose adaptors ( copper pipe ) to reroute the houses to fit from the engine to the rad . Because the engine was set back so far for better weight distribution , I had room to run a flex fan off the motor . I used the stock fuel lines with some fittings to hook up to the engine mounted fuel pump . Back to the transmission ... I had to do some creative tunnel butchering to create a mount for the shifter , and after that was figured out mounted a Hurst rubber boot . I had to loose the console for the time being . Exhaust started out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up the rest of the exhaust setup . <p> Basically ran the engine stock until I figured out all the bugs , and swapped out the Saginaw tranny for a Muncie. ( more usable gear ratio 's ) I then got Rid of the old shifter and installed a Hurst Vertical gate shifter . More tunnel butchering LOL ) Fun to drive for a while and never missed a shift lol , but realized that the 4.36 rear end with a 4 speed was kinda sucking . I then went to a Borg Warner T5 . More tunnel butchering and repair ... Stock shifter was really tall , and had such a long throw , so I went with a shorter short throw B&amp;M shifter. got to use my console again . ( modded ) Car ran much better now , so I started upping the HP with the usual engine mods . Edlebrock manifold and cam , Messed with the Q Jet carb for a long time , but ended up putting on a Holly 390 CFM unit . built some headers , and messed with the HEI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wanted to go with something that had some more grunt , so started looking at turbo 's . I had toyed with the idea of turbocharging the stock Toyota engine way back , when I saw that there was a kit available , but did n't have the funds back then to do it , so just forgot about it . I did like the idea of turbocharging the Buick , and did some more reading , and saw that they produced a factory turbo setup back in 79-83 called a " Hot air " engine . ( It was a draw through carb set up . ) I found a complete setup from an old Riviera , and as I was trying to install it , realized that I was really hating the Tercel rack and pinion setup , and wanted to install a better ratio Ford Mustang/ Pinto unit . This required different mounting , so I had to fabricate a new cross member . This new cross member , gave me better oil pan clearance , So I did n't have to butcher the pan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steering rack corrected the bump steer issues I had with the old rack and location . Took some messing around with " U " joint combos , but eventually managed to get the new steering linkage setup . I also made a better motor mount setup . I had to do some exhaust mods , and added a fan shroud , some better remote oil filters , and upgraded the ignition with a MSD box , and had to fab a cold air intake setup . Big difference in torque ! ! ! Almost a flat line . First couple of runs scared the crap out of me . I started to realize with this almost instant torque , that 1st gear was almost useless , so I picked up another T5 tranny out of a Camaro , and it had better gear ratios , than the older model T5 . Now I started to have clutch issues . The increase in HP and torque was just overpowering the clutch , so I had to try and find a beefier setup . Found something that fit the bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flywheel clearance , so I had to mess around making balanced shim/blocks , to get the proper clearance . Also had to go with a different clutch fork setup , and had to go through all that geometry/ pivot point crap again ! PIA ! ! ! finally got it all sorted out and was pretty happy <p> At this point I realized that the rear end was n't going to last much longer , so I opted for something bullet proof ... Ford 9 " with posi Trac Loc unit . I found a complete rear end and had a friend chop down the axle tube and axle to match the Toyota width , and re-welded the housing ends back on , re-splined an axle to fit the new width . At this time I also wanted to upgrade the brakes , so we went with a rear disk brake setup out of a 300 Nissan ZX . I also changed the front brakes to a 85 Supra setup , that had bigger brakes and larger rotor . The MA61 Supra has a strut very similar to the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( springs , top hat , and steering arms . and camber adjustment ) they fit . I also added a set of new shocks Also swapped out the master cylinder to another setup , and removed the stock proportioning valve to give me the proper brake bias . Made a new driveshaft to mate the Ford yoke to the GM front yoke . Before the rear end swap , I started messing with the 4 link rear end geometry , after I had read an article in a hot rod magazine about anti squat . I had made a simple mod that changed the angle of the upper rear control arms , by welding an extension plate on to the existing brackets , and that allowed me to drill different holes locations for the arms to mount to . This improved traction quite a bit . A jig was made to mock up the existing bracketry and everything was cut of the old rear end , and transferred to the new . so the Ford unit just bolted right in . Some plumbing had to be done with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brakes to work , but all worked out . I also changed out the old Bilstein rally shocks , for a set of Tokico adjustable units .

Some people have soldered their cells into series , but we all know soldering NiMH cells is a bad , bad thing because of the heat it generates . The common approach is to spot weld them , which means I 'm in need of welding advice . <p> I have a few options - there are some people on the interwebs who 've home-built battery tab welders using a car audio capacitor , momentary footswitch , and a thyristor . I 'm not above ghetto rigging tools , but I 'm not quite sure how much I trust myself , and it still works out to be kind of expensive , parts and time in . <p> So , my question is this - can I get away with using a cheap , used 110v mig welder ? It 's not like you need a terrible lot of penetration ; in fact , very little is required at all , so I 'm guessing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . <p> I 'm just thinking a cheap mig would be cheaper all in all than building one , and then if I really find myself with no use for a mig welder , I 'm sure I could just sell it again . <p> I do n't have to ask , I know the situation . I have an obsolete Toughbook with the same battery situation . <p> Using MIG could be really bad news . You may not need much penetration or heat but unless you 're really experienced and using a good unit you wo n't have all that much control over heat etc . It could really damage you if things go wrong . <p> I 'd probably try an electric soldering gun or the home made unit before trying MIG . <p> I had a sneaking suspicion that a MIG would be too powerful for the application . I might try a high-wattage soldering gun so that it melts the solder to the work quickly while applying as little heat as possible to the surrounding cells . That 's a good idea - I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything for so long . <p> I 'm hesitant to build the homemade unit not because I do n't think it would be most effective , but primarily because I 'm really quite lazy .

Notice how I added the upper mount for the clutch pedal . The previous owner did n't have this mounting point added ( the car was auto from the factory ) , so there was a bit of flex in the pedal with a heavy clutch ... I drilled out the spot welds holding the mount from a GTS manual trans car , and welded it on . <p> Various suspension peices after blasting : <p> AW11 MR2 manual rack installed : <p> I now have the supra intermediate shaft and tercel u-joint needed to hook the AE86 power steering column to the mk2 rack .

Center it and put your wheel on . It should be centered and should be equal turns .... I think ? ? <p> If you use a type 2 spacer kit it kinda moves off equal turns , I think .

I spent a ton of time getting it ready as did Josh G. from Stampede Toyota and my buddy John and I brought home the award for best restoration , which was definitely a fantastic feeling to be recognized for what I 've done with the car . <p> Thanks ! I feel like a lot of people really liked it , but mostly as a side note to the rest of the show , it was n't a loud car like the rest , lol . <p> Originally Posted by Sparkie <p> Congrats on the award ! <p> Forgive my noobishness here but how does a GZE swap still qualify as a restoration ? <p> Thanks , as far as the award goes , it 's a tuner show , so I feel there is a lot of flexibility on what qualifies as a restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not just a restoration , ( TRD parts , bumpers , etc. ) , but still , I was glad to get it . <p> The year goes on , I try to fix vibrations and show up at other car shows . Decent . <p> I got a set of Falken Azenis RT-615K 195/60R14 tires for the car in an attempt to fix that last bit of vibration in the car and it turns out that one of the wheels is actually bent . I am getting it repaired now , however I will also be looking for another set of Intra wheels as well . Both to replace it , as well as to have spares . Spare wheels are always a good idea . <p> I 've also decided that I do n't think the TRD engine and transmission mounts are for me . I will likely hang onto them just to have , but am going to swap out to new OE mounts . I am not entirely sure though , so maybe I 'll swap back once or twice down the road , lol.

I received them as a trade but now realize I have no use or time for them . One of the blue tops was pulled from a drift car last year and is still bolted to the T50 . The other engine has been bolted to a crate and has been sitting for a few years . Both T50 's are in good shape but are missing the shifter . Located in Edmonton , pickup only . PM if interested .

If you ca n't find any faulty wiring visibly or with the test light I suggest you go to Neetronics in Oakville . They deal with Engine Management tuning and they should be able to figure out the electronics in it . <p> ive tried taking a test light/and multimiter to a number of different places around the engine bay and i have basicaly figured out that their is no signals going to the injectors from the ecu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal actualy coming FROM the ecu but i took a miltimiter to the ecu 's injector part and the ecu is good . <p> I KNOWW i have to get some piks up i will most likely do that tonight : O <p> project-d <p> 09-15-2011 , 11:42 PM <p> C : UsersNimDownloadsphoto 1 ( 1 ) .

I 've had to jerry-rig a couple Corollas like that to rescue them from " dead " fuel pumps , when in fact the wiring had rotted through . <p> Both of those cars were hatchbacks too , and since the hatches tend to leak on these cars I would n't be surprised if that 's your problem here too . <p> project-d <p> 09-16-2011 , 02:29 PM <p> Hmmm that 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> coldstar64 <p> 09-16-2011 , 04:35 PM <p> Or jump power from you tail lights .

If you can get your hands between the intake and the block .. take off the fuel injector wires then loosen up the fuel rail bolts . 2 . Make sure you do n't lose or drop any of the those black spacer tabs that are on the fuel rail when you pull it . You can keep the fuel rail resting against the side instead of taking it right off . 3 . Then grab a rag and have it handy . When you pull out the injectors the fuels going to gush out so you can use your rag for that . 4. look over the injectors and they 'll most likely look bad with cracked rubber seals . Just replace the O-ring , the Cushion ring and Insulator and you should be good . <p> If you ca n't get your hands inbetween the intake and the block .. you 'll have to remove the entire intake which makes this job harder . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did this twice .. the first time I just looked at the injectors .. thought the seals were fine wiped the black residue **** off the injectors then reinstalled them . Turned the car on .. still gas was coming out .. <p> Part source sells BWD Fuel Injector kits with 3 - pieces in a box . The BWD kits are Cheaper and more Convenient than Toyota Stealerships because you need 4 kits and you do n't have to order individual quantities of each seal you need ... which IS FoCKING RETARDED ! ( The dealerships should have an option to buy them in kits ) . The Insulator in the kit I bought was shaped odd and if I ever have to replace them again I 'll get oem insulators just because the insulator with the BWD kit I bought I had to hard press it on the tip of the injector because it kept falling off while I was trying to invertly reinstall it . Also the design of the BWD kit was a flat ring spacer design and the OEM one is more like a Grommet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worse then that , his fule rail is some hack job ... I have n't seen where it is squirting yet , but I know that it really does n't look right ... I am trying to think if I have anything left over from my swap ... I should have a full set of injectors , and an OK fuel rail , I just ca n't remember if I used the AE86 stuff or the AE92 stuff ... <p> project-d <p> 09-21-2011 , 03:11 PM <p> thanx for all the help guys i will replace the injector seals and i 'll order it first thing tomorow morning .. blain check out if u have anything plz and thank you and SHOUT OUTS TO AcPtAbLeInDa80s , Jehuty77 , Brenty thanx that is ALOT of help .. that is EXACTLY what i was asking ( just a guide cause ive never done this b4 ) i noticed i also need the cold start fuel line aswell so if anyone has any lemi know on the thread or send me a pm ps .. is it weird for an indian guy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other thread .. that i made cause .. I DO NT KNOW IM JUST BOARD AT WORK OKAY ! ! goshh lol : ) <p> project-d <p> 09-21-2011 , 06:59 PM <p> just make up a list and ill get all the little stuff together that u need lol <p> well so far from what i can see i need the sending unit screws ( but do n't  trouble ur self TOo much i was gona run down to CT ) i need the cold start line with i think one screw .. that 's all i can really think of .. i 'm basicaly trying to get this car running before winter so i can get it to my new house i will have an indoor garage there and will have the time and protection from the elements to actualy work on it and durring the winter i will buy some parts here and their and hopefully get it running at 100% and THEN finaly the expensive kouki bumper and a panda paint job : ) sigh .. sorry that was me day dreaming any hoo i just need that line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little hole in it from the fuel rail to the tvis <p> Jehuty77 <p> 09-21-2011 , 08:43 PM <p> Wheres your new house ? <p> project-d <p> 09-22-2011 , 11:33 AM <p> gore and castlemore , brampton : O <p> and sigh ... i have bad news ... u know how u guys told me not to loose thoes rubber things ... i lost one of them ..

The next main thing now is to get the cold start wire from the intake to the fuel rail but more importantly get power to the back of the car to the connector for the sending unit and fuel pump and lights ect . I believe that will fix a majority of the problems . OHHH one more thing , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs a timing job FOR SURE . As time goes by and the more i 'm working on it i 'm noticing what i actually need to do to this car but my dad said if i get the little things like the dizzy and cold start wire fixed + the electrical it should fire up 1st crank . <p> another thing when i cranked it i noticed the rpm gauge was responding any one know what this means .. i know its good news but i do n't  know what kind of good news nor do i know what that means . <p> and would the car start if the sending unit is not hooked up and would it start if the distributor is loose ? <p> let me know what 's good guys any random info for me to take a look at would be greatly appreciated and hopefully by next week ( October 1st ) i will have everything i need to get it going and when people come over they can guide me on how to put the stuff on .. <p> on another note ... i was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car from gave to me with the car and i BELIEVE but not sure but i think he gave me some MR2 parts and i have allot of random ae86 parts that i will be selling once i get everything sorted out .. i know i have headlights and taillights and like the interior dash part but i will see what i need and what i do n't then let you guys know .. he also left me brand new control arms but i do n't even know if its for the ae86 yet .. anyways ill keep you guys posed and see you tomorrow cant wait to finally meet you 86ers <p> Jehuty77 <p> 09-24-2011 , 06:28 AM <p> Are you getting spark ? If you got compression , fuel and spark , you should be getting something atleast . <p> Test for spark . 1 ) Remove a spark plug wire 2 ) Pull a spark splug 3 ) Put the plug back into the wire 4 ) Press the threaded part of the plug against the valve covers or anything that will act as ground ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 5 ) Have a friend crank the motor 6 ) See if the spark plug has spark <p> project-d <p> 09-26-2011 , 05:58 AM <p> No spark my fellow enthusiasts : ( sad times <p> I 've been told by lex to check the timing I think I might just do that today or tomorrow . can you tell me how to check the timing once again I kinda forgot and I wan na get it right also is n't their a way to test if the dizzy is good I think mine is puked up I 'm like VERRY Shure I 'm not getting a spark but I'ma check with my dad once again just to make shure <p> Jehuty77 <p> 09-26-2011 , 06:37 AM <p> Your sure there 's no spark ? I would think even if timing is bad you would still get spark , <p> If you got no spark then i would focus on tracking down the root of the problem , <p> Bad Igniter ? <p> Copied these steps from another site , use them for testing : 1 ) If the engine has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the ignition key is on . 2 ) If there is voltage , the problem is on the trigger side of the coil ( pickup , crank sensor , ignition module or primary wiring circuit ) . 3 ) If there is NO voltage at the coil , the problem is on the supply side ( the ignition switch or ignition wiring circuit ) . 4 ) If the coil has voltage , the problem may be a bad high voltage output wire from the coil to the distributor , hairline cracks in the coil output tower , or cracks or carbon tracks inside the distributor cap or on the rotor . <p> Hey guys so I just checked out what 's good with the spark and I am infact getting a spark I just took a new spark plug to the end of the spark plug wires Nd saw a spark when I cranked it ...

Fuel pump not getting power , 2 . Fuel injectors not firing <p> When we ghetto rigged the fuel pump to a power source we got fuel up to the rail but for unknown reason the injectors would n't fire . Any suggestions would be appreciated . <p> My Suggestion : 1 ) Test those fuses/relays in the under hood fuse box , also check if your getting power at the resistor pack . Reference this : LONG ... <p> If it ends up not being a fuse issue review this : <p> There is either 2 or 3 sensors depending on the model of 4AGE . All three would be NE , G1 and G2 . They are either all in the distributor or one may be on the front of the crank . They give a number of pulses per revolution of the engine . If you are getting spark , they are most likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track enigne speed for accurate timing even while accelerating . The next one is a single pulse every time any piston comes to TDC to sync the sytem . The last one if it has a G2 is a single pule when cylinder 1 is at TDC of the power stroke . It is used to sync sequential injection . <p> The ECU uses these pulses to calculate when to fire the spark . A pulse on the IGT line fires the igniter/coil to make the spark . When a spark occurs the igniter then makes a pulse on the IGF line back to the ECU . The ECU will not fire the injectors if it does not get IGF pulses . This is a safety to make sure it is not spraying fuel into a dead motor . <p> One side of all four injectors gets battery voltage when they are not firing . The other side will also measure battery voltage when no current is flowing . The ECU uses a transsistor to pull the secnd side of the injector to ground to pull current and open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will measure 10 to 20 ohms across the leads , or low impeadance which will measure under 5 ohms across them . High ohm injector will be straight frmo battery to ECU and will have a full 12 volts acros them while spraying . Low ohm ones will have a resistor pack between the battery voltage and the injector . This is to limit the curent to about 1 amp per injector when open . Low ohm injectors operate much faster allowing shorter pulses so they are typically used on higher performance engines which need bigger injectors . Most 4SGE 's used low ohm with the resistor pack . <p> If you have a 12 volt test light , you sould be able to connect it to ground and touch each injector wire . It should light at all 8 wires when the engine is not running but the key is on . Now connect the clip to battery voltage and probe the leads while it is cranked . One side will probably never light ( the 12 volt side ) but may make a faint flicker on resistor pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ECU driver side ) should give a solid flash every revolution of the engine on non sequential , or every two revolutions on sequential engines . The pulses are very short . If you have no IGF signal , they should still fire a couple times and then quit . <p> During cranking , the pulses are basically fixed as the AFM will barely move until the rpm comes up . <p> Some cars ( not sure about Toyotas ) will turn off the injectors if the throttle is wide open during cranking . So a TPS problem may also cause no injection . This is the " clear flood " mode on GM 's . <p> So we tried getting her going , we got it really close but could n't get it going because the of 2 issues . 1 . Fuel pump not getting power , 2 . Fuel injectors not firing <p> When we ghetto rigged the fuel pump to a power source we got fuel up to the rail but for unknown reason the injectors would n't fire .

<p> Are you sure you 're fuel pump is working ? <p> Neither were working when we left last saturday . <p> Did you give the fuel pump power or is it still rigged to the brake lights , if its still rigged to the brake lights that could be part of the problem , it needs consistent power . <p> If its almost turning over , you should be close , it could be a simple timing issue ( Thats only if you know for sure your getting fuel ) . <p> If your sure the injectors are firing go to Part Source and see if you can rent a timing light , i know they do rent a tool . <p> You really need a timing light to make sure your ignition timing is set to 10 Before Top Dead Center ( Although if its not out a tooth , you should be able to do it by ear to an extent ) . <p> Assuming you have n't done this before , follow these steps : <p> To check Ignition Timing 1 ) Put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from trying to adjust the timing , to do this use a small piece of wire to jump T &amp; E1 in your diagnostic port . 2 ) Mark the Cranky Pulley timing notch with some paint ( most ppl use white or yellow ) 4 ) Clamp the Timing Light onto the #1 spark plug wire , also give it power off the battery i think ) 5 ) Loosen the Distributor slightly so you can rotate it 6 ) Have a buddy sit in the drivers seat and crank the engine 7 ) You Stand with the gun and point it at the crank pulley pull the trigger on the gun while he s cranking the engine 8 ) As the gun flashes you should be able to see where the little mark you made on the crank pulley shows up on the timing marks on the timing cover , if its not 10BTC , then gently rotate the distributor until it lines up to 10BTC , If no matter how much you turn the Distributor you cant get it to 10BTC , then your distributor is out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For Reference , when cranking the timing notch should show 10BTC , its the numbers highlighted in white in the pic below , also notice how they marked the crank pulley notch white LONG ... <p> If you cant see the mark at all , or its way off the timing marks , you know your distributor is probably out a tooth , if its pretty close then timing is n't your issue . <p> The first time me and my buddy put his bluetop back together , we could n't get it to fire up , it was n't until we checked ignition timing that we saw our ignition timing was like at 50+ After Top Dead Center , soon as we got that sorted out she fired up . <p> project-d <p> 10-05-2011 , 02:01 PM <p> my dad took a test light to the fuel pump wire and it was getting power as i cranked it and we also did that with the injectors and it was lighting up as i cracked it we also checked if the fuel pump is giving fuel to the rail by slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cranking it , and as we did that fuel was spraying out . as for the injectors like i said all we have is that they are getting power because we took a test light to it ... i belive it was not working because that 15 amp fues was blown and i changed it .... i am very sure it is the timing as well and i will check that tonight <p> THANK YOU VERY MUCH Jehuty77 you have been helping me SO much : ) much respect and appreciation . i will check the timing .. if u know anything else that might help me out let me know : ) thank u <p> project-d <p> 10-05-2011 , 08:01 PM <p> Do u guys l know the firing order u guys know ?

Those with extra money for brokerages and agents may be able to get around this , but for a young guy without much money the scenario goes a little something like this : <p> 1-go down to the US , buy a car , bring the deed , paperwork , etc , the US to initiate the export clearing process <p> 2-convince buddy to meet you at the border , cross into the US and drive to a somewhere you can park the car safely for 3 days , in my case in the middle of January during the coldest days of that particular winter <p> 3-drive you back to the Canadian border and wait while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the transaction , or in my case , wait while the border guard questions you endlessly about a terrorist event near the Vancouver Airport and someone named Andrew Chatworth and almost arrests the person I had coming to meet me , before realizing that I have the same name as someone flagged for questioning on the coast near Vancouver , and finally letting us leave after 3 hours , making it about midnight . <p> 4-three days later convince a different buddy because the first one is never going near the border again to cross the US border and drive you to the spot you parked your freshly bought car three days ago , chip the inches of ice and frost off it and hope it starts 5-if it does start , drive to the Canadian side , explain to the suspicious guards why you were just going over the border for 20 minutes and proceed with the taxing and duty stage of the import process <p> 6-bend over and accept the pillaging of your wallet by the government as they charge you tax and duty on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few thousand dollars , and then accuse you of fraud and demand more fees because the price you said you paid was lower than a book value they had on file <p> 7-finally drive the car home and wonder why the border guards for the country you are a citizen of treat you worse than the supposedly paranoid and crazy US border guards <p> That damn adventure has aggravated me ever since , but the car itself has been great . <p> Anyways , the following is the progress so far then after some pics of various stages : <p> -Bought car 147,9xx miles <p> -Installed new rotors and pads all corners , rear calipers ( OEM ) 148xxx miles <p> -Installed Falken Azenis rt615 195/60/14 on white supra wheels , required smoothing-enlargement of wheel wells to eliminate rubbing , which were then undercoated 159xxx miles <p> -Installed new radiator , replaced thermostat and housing with ae92 model ( has temperature sensor ) , removed engine fan and installed electric fan wired to turn on and off automatically at set temp. , also wired manual override switch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -Replaced valve cover gaskets 159xxx miles <p> -Installed Exedy stage one clutch , pilot and release bearings , rear main engine seal and stainless clutch line 159xxx miles <p> The next stage will be getting a proper diff installed and sorting the suspension out with a few more tweaks and bits ( NCRAs , adj. panhard , should be here soon ) and eventually a front coilover setup .

You should see this little shop ... it 's hilarious how small it is . I picked his brain for a good couple hours about POR-15 and it 's various products , which is why I 'm so adamant to use them . <p> Personally , I 'd only buy directly from the website to avoid paying middle man price markups . Everything is shipped out IMMEDIATELY but keep in mind that some products can not be transported by air due to certain laws . <p> If you buy POR-15 , keep in mind it is a 3-step process ! DO NOT try to take short cuts or you 'll be wasting your time and money . 1 . Marine Clean 2 . Metal Ready 3 . POR-15 paint ( 4 .

I still have 3 little cans left i think ! <p> for edmonton guys ... a shop in Spruce Grove carries them .. Eagle Motorcycle shop or something ... it is also a small shop and the owner uses the POR15 products to do resto work on motorcycles ... i went thru two small cans and a tube of por patch on my green hatchback ... all the areas that had POR15 on it lasted thru the winter .. only areas that started to rust out again were welded body work that i could not get POR15 on or undercoating .. <p> As Migsy said , for all POR15 paint , you need to top coat them if you are using them for areas exposed UV rays . This is only for cosmetic purposes only . It does not affect the paint , only how it looks. ( edit : not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint . Some products are designed to be used without top coating . ) <p> Blacks turn into a greyish off color Silver turns into a snot green to a brownish color <p> So , once you do your 3 step prep , your base coat will be 2 coats of POR . From there , once it dries , you can roughen up the surface and use a 1K high build primer . Then use your normal paint and clear coat . <p> As for those that have used POR , we all know it gets pretty messy if you use too much . So wear gloves , long sleeve disposable shirt , and a proper resporator if you are painting the in confined areas ( ie the trunk or hatch ) <p> For first time users , you 'll be amazed by the spreadability of this stuff . That is why I said it will get messy if you put too much on for the first coat . One dip of the paint brush will last longer than you think and will cover ALOT of area . Think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh and what ever you do do n't  get any water or sweat into the main bucket . One drop of sweat/water will ruin the paint and your XXX dollar paint ( depending where you get it ) will be litterally garbage . Take your time and do n't  rush ... the thing that will take the most time is the Prep work . After that is done everything else is a cake walk . Once you lay down the first coat give it overnight to dry then lay your 2nd final coat ( to get any pinholes missed by the first coat ) . After that , Jebus , this stuff dries rock hard and virtually impossible to remove , scratch or what not . I am a 100% supporter of this stuff and because I own a car that is prone to rust , POR15 is worth every penny I spend on it . <p> I 've used POR-15 on my car last spring . It really is amazing stuff . As JohnnyEngrish has mentioned , a small can will cover a very lage area . It dries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it dries it will leave no brush strokes . It dries to a mirror finish . It is impervious to water , oil , gasoline , etc . Wo n't crack , chip , or peel . Try scratching it with a screw driver . It 's tough stuff . Consider this : The next day , the POR-15 dried on the paint brush . It was so hard , I could literally lean my entire weight onto the paint brush ( 150lbs ) and the bristles were able to support my weight on it . <p> And as Migs says , do the complete 3-step process . Be sure to sand off ALL signs of rust , and the area must be completely BONE DRY before applying any POR-15 or oxidation will occur , leading to more rust , underneathe the POR-15 paint . <p> - TVK - <p> " There 's A Vid In All Of Us !

I ca n't wait to finish all the floors and interior . <p> I also used it on my wheel arches before bondoing over it on the outside you do n't  need the hardnose paint , you can use any paint or body fill overtop POR 15 , just make sure to clean the surface and rough it up with 100/80 grit sandpaper to get good adhesion . <p> Be sure to sand off ALL signs of rust , and the area must be completely BONE DRY before applying any POR-15 or oxidation will occur , leading to more rust , underneathe the POR-15 paint . <p> Just a tid bit of info , even if you happen to miss a spot and you see a pinhole rust spot start to reappear , POR15 prevents the rust from spreading . So all you have to do is touch up that area and your done . <p> However if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the prep work , then you have a greater chance rust coming back . ***DONT PAINT OVER NUTS AND BOLTS-They will not come off if you do ! *** <p> To add , you can use fiberglass with POR15 . So instead of using resin , you use POR . Its hella messy and the fiberglass does not melt b/c POR doensnt contain Styrene . But when it dries it dries just as hard . I recommend using the POR silver when doing fiber patches because it contains metal flake and fibers mixed in with POR paint to strengthen the area . Great stuff . <p> yeah .. i did the the fiberglass with POR15 method to seal off a rust hole in my inner rear wheel well .. locked out the water from entering the inner fender area ... i agree .. it dries rock hard ... harder than resin does ...

Thank you . <p> well i would n't have messed around with that afm , but its already done . did you try checking for the common issues : air pockets in your coolant system , vacuum leaks , sticky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you mean all the vacuum lines or just the hose cleaner ? my 87 mr2 use to idle exactly at 1200 after i cleaned out the throttle body and no matter how far turned down the screw was it was stuck at the low point of 1200. turned out to be a coolant bubble in the system ... and it consumed coolant due to a bad head gasket , but that 's just me <p> I have n't checked air pockets in the coolant system yet or checked the throttle yet , but I will now . All my vacuum lines and hose cleaner are fine . Although I do n't think it is consuming coolant . I will check on a regular basis . Do you know why the idle goes up and down when the idle screw is turned up ? I find that to be weird and never experienced that before . And how would I re adjust the AFM unit ? or would I have to take it to a shop ? <p> happens everytime i have a coolant bubble , but i do n't  know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just jumps up and down from like 1200 - 1500 consistently right ? for the afm i have no idea ... ive never tinkered around with it maybe someone else on this forum knows <p> Ya it jumps up and down within 200-400rpm consistently and it becomes faster the higher you turn it up . Can you bleed the rad fluid ? I was able to bleed the rad fluid on my old 87 honda accord to get rid of air bubbles . I did n't see anything in my hanes manual . <p> pop the rad cap open and turn on the car . wait until the thermostat opens and then top up when necessary . Should n't take more than 15 mins . If it takes longer than that . Then you need a new thermostat . <p> I do n't  know if this will help but my car idled around there too and the RPMs jumped up and down too , for the high idle problem it was fixed with a new TPS and now it idles around 800-900 and it does n't  bounce anymore .

@@8345111 @1545111/ @qwx111434 <h> Write-up&gt;EDIS : When you have no more love for the Dizzy ! <p> Pasted this from the new 3tc forum . Scared that I might have to re-write it again ! <p> So here we are with a little write-up on how to take that 2tc or 3tc ( or anything for that matter ) and rid yourself of the distributor using Fords EDIS-4 system . EDIS-4 is a nice crank triggered ignition system that is capable of a good 40,000volts max discharge , 57 degrees of total advance and an upper limit rpm of around 9500rpm . <p> Some of the things you will need to scavenge : <p> 1 EDIS-4 ignition module with connector available on some 90-93 Ford Escorts . <p> 1 controller to supply the SAW command for advancing the timing . I used Megajolt by autosport labs but other controllers are available . <p> You must decide whether your system will use a throttle position sensor ( TPS ) or manifold absolute pressure sensor ( MAP ) . I used a map sensor but given my camshaft right now , I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneven a idle . <p> So The first thing I did after gathering parts was to set about figuring how to mount my 36-1 trigger wheel . I got my trigger off a Ford Focus SPI engine by heating the trigger wheel until it was red hot and then just lifting it away with pliers . <p> I then machined a 1976 corolla crank pulley from a 2tc equipped with AIR ( air injection reaction system ) to an interference fit . This allowed me to install the trigger wheel onto the pulley the same way it was on the Ford pulley-with no welds needed . <p> The placement of the trigger wheel missing tooth relative to the VR sensor is the critical factor . The VR sensor must be 90 degrees BEFORE the missing tooth when the #1 cylinder is at TDC compression . It basically has you line the sensor with the 9th tooth back . This allows you some room for you to tailor the install to your project because they just have to maintain this relationship . <p> For mine , I did not want any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a simple right angle bracket that would bolt into the two AIR pump holes on the right side of any T block . A simple pizza box helped with figuring the original measurements . <p> One thing to consider is to make elongated holes to allow for fine tuning of the sensor gap which should be about 1mm and the sensor alignment with the trigger . <p> Note also that I have a gusset that you can see on one side but also a gusset on the inside of the bracket . This is try and stop any movement or vibration at high rpm which can create an erratic sensor input causing a misfire . Bad news ! <p> I also used the foil shielded wire for the VR sensor and the PIP/SAW wiring . Now the VR sensor is a simple ac voltage generator . The wires are polarized , one positive and one negative . Hooked up one way the system will work , the other will result in no spark . I suggest leaving this connection loose until you know which way will work . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The next step for me was to mount the coil . <p> After some playing around I decided I did not like the look of the Ford coil so I got two coil packs from an early 90s Toyota Paseo. ( toyota part # 90919-02213 ) They hook up the same way as the ford one as the ford one is just two coils as well . One common power Vref + and separate trigger signals for each coil 1 and 2 from the EDIS module . <p> In my picture of the engine bay , the wire closest to the front of the car on each coil is + and the ones towards the firewall are which go to the edis module coil outs . I used Toyota weatherprooofed connectors #90980-11246 quantity of 2 and wire splices #82998-12440 quantity of 4 . <p> Next you must remember that you still need to drive the oil pump which is accomplished by the distributor on a T motor . 4ag and some other motors do n't  need to worry about this so they can just seal the dizzy hole with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut down a distributor and filed it nicely leaving the threaded holes from the cap . I cut out a piece of steel to screw on as a cap for the new " Dum-dizzy " and installed it . One season later I have had no problems . <p> Looks like it needs a sticker ! <p> Once I had the oil pump figured I had to try and steady the vacuum signal from my individual runners . I have sidedrafts so I needed a signal from all four cylinders . No worries , I tapped a port into each runner using threaded vacuum fittings . <p> I hooked rubber hose to the fittings that joins to hard plactis hose from Vibrant . Vibrant makes a nifty alloy block that brings all these hard plastic hoses to a junction and makes a clean install . <p> The fittings are little pneumatic compression fittings so they are turbo ready ! I had to ensure that the hose going to the map sensor had allow enough spot to reduce the likelyhood of oil fouling the sensor . <p> Once I had that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EDIS module . The trick here is to be patient , use double wall heat shrink tube ( the stuff that oozes glue out the side after shrunk ) , and hook it up so that it will run without any controller the first time . This allows you to be sure that the basic wiring and module are working correctly before adding the controller as a variable . <p> Speaking of wiring , I use two 7.5A ato fuses-one for the edis module and one for the controller . That way if the controller craps out , you can still limp home with a fixed timing of 10 BTDC . <p> When you get the whole thing running , you can use a timing light to check the static edis timing of 10 btdc . If it is off by a few degrees do n't  panic . You can remember the variance and adjust your map accordingly . Side note** EDIS will do timing below 10 all the way down to 0 . The controller can be set to go that low if you need so do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also neat to see how accurate your stock tach IS NOT ! On the subject of tachs , most old cars have tachs that utilize the flyback pulse that results when the coil 's magnetic field collapses . This pulse is captured off the negative side of the coil . Modern cars use the pip signal generally for the tach . If you have an older tach you will need to harness the flyback pulse from BOTH coils or sides of your coil pack to get a useable signal . The trouble here is that if you simply connect the two negatives together via a junction then they will both fire at once-NO GOOD ! <p> You must get two 1N4004 diodes and one 15-18v zener diode . You will need to learn how to identify the bias ( google it ) so that the flyback pulse can leave the coils but not fire each other . One 1N4004 diode for each negative side of you coils . Then you connect them at a junction or splice and from there they both pass through the zener diode ( check the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should have a nice happy signal . <p> Then its time to start for creating a map . This is the look-up table that your controller will use to decide timing . You load a basic config to start your car from here : <p> And the base screen you will find is on the MJLJ configurator like this . <p> So much stuff to play with . You will likely want to edit the ranges on your load bins . ie : most of us do n't rev to 10,000rpm . <p> ADD-ON OPTION PART- The next thing I did was to wire up the rev limit module . <p> I wired the module inside the case of the megajolt unit but some of the wiring is external . If you decide to use the rev limit module you will want to plan ahead as both coil Vref+ feeds must go through the rev limit unit . The module is simple in design in that is a series of resistors that ramps the coil current at a preset rpm . And it works very well ! It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now the only thing I have yet to do is put my scope on the car running at high rpm and see how much reserve voltage I have left .

Then TIG welded it shut , ground it smooth and painted it . There was nothing left of the dizzy except for a 3/8 " thick piece bolted to the block . <p> As for break-up at high rpm , you can usually view that phenomenon with a scope tied into the vr sensor . You will get an erratic sognal at high rpm ..... due to a poorly constructed bracket moving or vibrating . Note the gussets on my bracket , one outside you can see and one inside you ca n't see . I 'll add this info @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 09:10 AM. @qwx111435 <p> I found two capacitors specified incorrectly on the BOM which causes the MS to drop out the RPM signal , after a lot of searching and scoping C31 and C32 I believe were to blame .

I am willing to trade for a decent driver side fender so I can make a good pair . These are Toyota fenders not some aftermarket garbage so they are a guaranteed fitment . <p> 1 Silver fender from a US AE86 $100.00 1 Black fender is from a BC AE86 $100.00 2 Silver fenders are from local AB AE86's. $80.00 and $100.00 <p> All in really amazing shape for their age . These are located in Calgary and shiping is not available . <p> i now this threat is from 2006 , but i need a fender passenger side to complete my rebuilded AE86 GT Apex . Can you still sell one of the shown part to me ? You have to consider that this part must be shipped to germany . <p> You may want to post a wanted ad in the wanted section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to ship you a fender for the right price . There is also a guy on here who either lives in Japan or travels there often and is always scrounging up parts and shipping them back here to Canada . So I 'm pretty sure it would be just as easy to have something shipped to germany . There is also a company called wolf steel here in Canada that makes new rear fenders and they are working on getting the front fenders into production as well . Not sure where they are at in regards to being able to make the front fenders yet though . I 'm hoping it will be very soon as I need a drivers side fender before too long . Good luck 
@@8345120 @1545120/ @qwx111434 <h> ae86 brake upgrades <p> Hey i 'm trying to get some info for a budy of mine I 'm just trying to find out what kinda option he has for a brake upgrades for his AE86 . He was thinking of trying to use 240sx brakes . any ideas on what he can do thanks in advance <p> offset has nothing to do with clearing the calipers . Its all on the size of the wheel . If you have a 13 " rotor with a large caliper it wont clear a 14 " wheel . Also keep in mind a more positive offset wheel sticks it out towards the body not the suspension of the car . A +45 offset sits more over the rotor/caliper . So this statement is all incorrect . <p> FC3S calipers will clear a properly sized wheel , as will any brake setup . All custom setups will need custom fabricatioin . The only real bolt on is the rear supra disc set from the 81 . Other than that it will involve fabrication . <p> I have seen GTR brakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setup , big brembos on a little ae86 . The biggest advantage would be the ability to use the brake upgrades for the car your swap came from . Imagine AP 6piston calipers on the front with 14 " rotors , and 4 piston 13 " rotors on the back in a car that weighs 2200 pounds ! Man talk about stopping power . <p> i havent had the levin on the track yet , but ive gone out and purposely tried to fade the brakes ( stock rotors/callipers , highend pads of some unknown kind , came on the car ) , and havent been able to fade them despite mutiple stops from 160-170 one right after the other ) <p> My Project Mu with sloted rotors held up just fine on the track when I was closer to stock with street tires . But with my DOT R-comps I 've decided I need to upgrade badly . I will post more when I 'm done with it . I 'm going with the RX7 kit . <p> I 'm using stock ma60 ( mk2 ) supra front brakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit inside 14 " rims . And they 're plenty big for my car , and should be plenty big for moderate ( say &lt;200hp ) cars . Over 200hp and you 'll wan na try some more aggressive pads to start . <p> With stock pads on ma60 brakes , I did not have any fading issues on Mission 's short-track up until around lap 5 or 6 when I began to feel fading at turn 2 which is after the hairpin at the end of the straight . But the brakes still worked fine , just slightly increased pedal effort . So lap 6 or so , I coasted a bit before hitting the binders at the end of the straight . <p> I could swap to a sport brake pad for track use , but that would be way too aggressive even for abusive street/mountain pass use ... <p> If you feel your brakes going away with ma60 setup , you 've either got more than 200hp , or you 're doing actual racing on a short brake-intensive track ... <p> stock rotors and pads stop excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over extended use ... on a shorter , technical track , i faded the brakes on terry 's inside line lapping day ... not a happy experience ... <p> i ran front : KVR drilled rotors hawk HPS pads <p> rear : amt slotted rotors hawk HPS pads <p> motul or elf ( i ca n't remember ) 5.1 brake fluid ... <p> 6th lap ... no brakes ... the pedal felt great ... solid and hard as rock ... there just was n't any stopping power ... at all ...

It has 120,000 kms on the wrecker tag . I started tearing it apart last night . Distributor needs replacing . Oil pressure sensor is bent . TPS is smashed . I have lots of donor parts though . <p> There is n't much of an east coast old school Toyota scene . I know of 2 fairly modified AE86 's ( one in Moncton N.B and one in St. John 's NFLD ) . There are a handful of TE 's and MR2 's ( quite a few turbo JDM imports ) as well as a few supras . <p> There is only one AE86 ( other than mine ) , that I know is on the road legally ( and auto slalomed ) in Nova Scotia . And two other project cars . I 've had a hand in these three as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them all . <p> This engine was bought from my brother . A few items were bought new locally . 2 big items ( cams and RWD smallport intake ) were bought from fellow DKers . The rest was all from the states . <p> - Block is ready to be checked out . My dad ( a REAL mechanic ) is going to help me ( REALLY not a mechanic ... at all ) with checking out the main and rod bearings . After that it 's off to the machine shop . - Head is ready to go to the machine shop . - NST Pulley kit arrived . Nice looking parts . - I might be picking up an electric autometer Oil Pressure gauge . I 'm not sure how much I trust the stock one . <p> The plan : - Uses the silvertop bottom end ( provided the crank and bearings all look good/measure good ) . Thanks for all the advice in my bearing questions post - Use the redtop pistons I took out of my original project engine . ( I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine into an interference setup ) <p> As for the ITBs who knows . Maybe next summer ( or 2 from now ) I 'll be rocking the quad throttles . I just need a vacuum box and some kind of standalone ecu ... : S <p> Nice to see you 're still at it . I thought you were done with Corollas when I saw you selling the primered one on the arms board . That was you was n't it ? Hopefully mine will be done soon . I keep buying tools instead of finishing the car though lol . Lincoln Mig welder , PA sandblasting cabinet , etc ... Ugh : o <p> But of course there was ANOTHER problem . We went to put the " rebuilt " head on and it looked like it needed to be plained and definitely cleaned . But the big kicker was that the cam caps were missing . I searched through every box I got when I bought the parts in Moncton and there are none to be seen . Grrrreeeaat . <p> So , I 'm just doing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to take my smallport head to get tuned up and use it . It 's what I wanted to do eventually anyway . <p> I also picked up a couple of 2 " exhaust flanges and a length of 2 " pipe . They 'll be used to make a test pipe to go between the TRD header and the Buddyclub exhaust . I 've machined a bore in the flanges so that they will accept a doughnut gasket instead of a flat one . Once it 's all welded up it 'll be powder-coated by myself . <p> Got to order a couple more parts from Toyota today . They 're for the smallport relief line ( oil drain back ) from the head to the block . I 'll also have to drill a hole in the block to accept the piping . The smallport 4a-ge 's were the only engine to use this . Supposedly it helps ( or altogether solves ) the problem of oil pooling in the intake cam cover , during hard left hand turns ( which leads to excessive oil being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The 20V engines had a much better head design ( in regards to oil returning from the head to the block ) , so they deleted this return pipe on the later blocks , like mine . <p> hole size is about 19mm ( 3/4 " ) and we seem to need to jb weld them every time <p> Yeah . I 'm still going to contact the guy that sold me the head to see if he just forgot to put them in the box . That way I still have a usable largeport head if I need it ( or just sell it ) . <p> I 'm going to attempt the drill and jb weld of the pipe . <p> I 'm not sure if I 'm going to buy a new one or not though . If I have to jb weld it anyway and the original pipe is ok looking/fitting , then I 'll probably just use it . I 'll check it out tonight and order the new one if I think I need to .

I ca n't really see any advantage to using the bigger valves unless I have waaay more cam , fuel , and compression . <p> Yes ? No ? Maybe ? <p> They also made some suggestions for porting and knife edging certain areas . I have to do a little more research before I commit to any of that though . <p> Do it man , do it all ! Every little bit helps when we are dealing with so little to begin with . Get the bigger valves , the porting , and definately the knife edging ( and do n't forget to get the entire rotating assembly balanced ) . <p> Last night I test fitted the Buddyclub spec II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite clear the rear bumper ( seeing as it 's meant for a JDM car ) . I notched the metal on the underside of the bumper to accommodate it for now . Then I took my measurements for my test pipe .

Unfortunately , the ring that actually has the words on it ( Slow , Fast , etc ) , is discontinued , and the number supersceded to the one without it , so I got another one of those , lol , whatever ... just sucks that I paid to get one from Japan , lol . <p> The wiper switch is of course meant for RHD cars , so the elctronics stick out the wrong way . I 've already modified it to fit in the other way for the most part ( It will mount and the ring fits correctly , I just have to change the main control knob now ) . I 'm basically just chaning it so it 's mounted upside down , but that means changing the control knobs to mount to the switch upside down as well ... oh well , it 'll be worth it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , so it should plug in , the circuitry is all in the switch itself . I do n't have my TEWD here though ( I 'm at work ) . <p> I 'll post some pics later tonight of the switch itself , and then of it in the car , hopefully it works . I ended up spending a over $100 to get it new from Toyota Japan , but it will be worth it , lol . <p> As you can see , they are basically mirrored switches , so I thought , why not just swap it upside down , get the circuitry onto the other side . Sounded like a great plan ! Of course it would take some modification . I used an exacto knife to cut the plastic that the adjustment ring fits onto , so that it goes on upside down . <p> I also used a grinder to grind the metal staft down on the other side so that the knob would fit onto it : <p> At this point , I was thinking great , I 'm all good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take apart the dash , try to put it in ... and realize ... the circuitry is too far down , if you look at the JDM one and imagine it upside down , it sticks down MUCH further than the original one ... crap ... I did a bunch of measuring and checking fitment , and decided to cut into my ( mint , no cracks , not deformed ... ) dash , to make room for the switch to fit . Man that plastic they use for the dash is freaking HARD , lol . So anyways I got it all cut out , and the switch finally fit , yay ! <p> Plugged in the connector , everything works ! ( I knew it would , but I was happy nonetheless , haha ! ) The variable intermittant is so sweet ! I can really slow it down . Full speed is about what the stock switch is , and you can go progressively slower than that . <p> They even had the connector upside down on the JDM one , so when I fit it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock one . <p> Stock connector : <p> JDM connector : <p> So I put the entire thing back together ( A lot more work than one would think , lol , I had the glovebox out , and the center stuff , so I would n't hit it when I was cutting , lol ) . <p> Lowest int setting : <p> Highest int setting : <p> It 's sweet ! I love it , it 's great . I just need to pickup a new knob for it and the headlight switch , the image is wearing off . ( It was already worn off the headlight one when I got the car , but then some windex auto ( good for plastics , etc ) , sprayed onto it when I was cleaning the windshield one day , and when I rubbed it off , it took off the image ... stupid windex , lol . <p> Another thing I 've noticed , is that it wipes the windshield when you spray it automatically now , and it does different number of wipes depending on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ) . It 's so great , lol . Worth every penny ... to me anyways . <p> I was dissapointed that I had to cut the dash up , even though you ca n't see it , nobody wants to do that to their car ( well ... almost nobody , lol ) , but in the end , it was still worth it . Good luck with anyone else who wants to do it . <p> If you watch the video you can see how long it is , pretty long , I do n't know the exact time . I 'll check though . <p> EDIT : Looks like the longest is 8 seconds , shortest is 3 seconds . Does n't sound like a big difference , but it really is , lol . Pretty sure stock is 4 seconds ( that 's what my EWD says , but I 'm not sure exactly how they measure it -- I was timing how long from when the wiper hits the bottom , until it starts to move again ) .

More importantly I 've never tuned an alpha-N car before , what is it like ? is 16x16 or higher required to get a good tune , or would 8x8 work well enough ( especially as it 's sort of riding piggyback to the factory ecu ) to get some good tuning done ? <p> I would definitely get on top of this , but the best I can do is program an arduino .

@@8345127 @1545127/ @qwx111434 <h> 4AGE Weber DCOEs that feel like fuel injection semi-how-to . <p> I thought I would post a thread about my tuning success with 40DCOE-151 carbs on a pretty normal 4AGE large port ... Mostly so future searchers will find it ... because most of the info about DCOE tuning is uninformed bullsh*t and most " tuned " Webers are n't that great . <p> I recently dialed this setup and I 'm amazed how close to FI it feels ... Why ? Because the ARF is a near perfect 12.5 to 13.25 right across the rev range .... from the idle circuit through the progression and on to the mains ... It feels way better than a single throttle body FI system if you ask me .... Better throttle response .... AND it gets fantastic fuel economy . It is myth that DCOEs use lots of gas . Sh*t tuning uses lots of gas . <p> The normal good Weber tune -- using factory jets and emulsion tubes -- is full of compromise -- with stumbles and flat spots and generally sh*tty fuel economy .... the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first started the tune , it ran pretty well and had good power but it got horrible fuel economy ( like 12 or 15 mpg ) .... It was set up like many 40DCOEs on a 4AGE ... 34mm chokes , F16 E-tubes , 45f9 idle jets , 140 mains , 175 Airs , 35 pumps , factory float height .... It had a little rich stumble from the mains coming in too early around 3000rpm , but it was n't too bad ... What was bad was the sooty exhaust , the sh*tty fuel economy and a slightly dull throttle response at anything under WOT .... I stepped the mains down to 135 and got lean stumbles way up the revs ... This is all very common and it 's the big reason people slag Webers ... Swapping to different Weber e-tubes just moved the stumble around .... and used more gas .... No matter what I did , AFR was stupid rich or it ran like crap . <p> Then I learned a better way . <p> I joined Keith Franck 's Yahoo group Sidedraft Central -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he knows jets and emulsion tubes better than the engineers at Weber ( if there are any ) . He also MAKES idle jets and emulsion tubes . After trying these , I would never use factory Weber parts again . He also knows how to tune , so I followed his method and ended up with amazing results .... <p> I wo n't go into huge detail here , but basically : <p> Get a wideband O2 sensor . I did n't have one until near the end and I wasted days and days . It is the ONLY way to dial the tune . <p> The normal way to balance the carbs is stupid and does n't work . Everybody uses the linkage screw to adjust balance between carbs at idle . This is stupid . The linkage screw is to balance the carbs at 2500 or 3000 rpm -- or wherever the most shaking happens ... <p> To adjust the balance at idle , use the air-bleed screw ( I 'm talking newer 40DCOE-151 or 45DCOE-152 carbs here -- on older carbs , you actually drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... that 's the traditional proper Weber way ) ..... ( obviously newer carbs are way easier to deal with ) . <p> Understand that the idle circuit is controlled by the idle jet and the progression holes and is active up to about 4000rpm . ( I could drive the car with the main stack totally removed -- running only on the idle jets and you would never know it under light to medium throttle ) . <p> I used Keith 's " Obert-tube " emulsion tubes ( #05 ) and Keith 's " Hypo-jet " idle jets ( .024 " ) . These idle jets have 4 air bleed holes to choose from and I used the biggest . The O-tubes need to be " clocked " in place so the holes face away from the passage that 's in there ... These emulsion tubes control fuel delivery way more accurately than normal e-tubes ... Weber 's way to do is the have the fuel much lower and use lots of bubbles to move the fuel up and out of the main circuit .... Keith 's way is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuel level ( float height ) needs to be perfect -- and not by some arbitrary measurement off the gasket surface of the carb top , but buy making the fuel level in the main-jet well 25mm down from the top of the well . Exactly 25mm . This puts the fuel 2mm below the main passage ... <p> Ok , so I did all this ( without a WBO2 ) and I stuck in the 140 main jet into the new O-tubes and went for a drive ..... Hmmm ... not all that different ... a better idle .... smoother ... but not quite perfect .... So I dropped to a 135 main , and it got better -- then I dropped to a 130 and it got even better .... Then I finally got a wideband O2 sensor ..... Way too rich .... So I dropped to a 125 main jet .... In the end , I ended up with a 115 main jet and a near perfect 12.5 - 13.25 AFR pretty much everywhere except a leaner light throttle cruise of about 13.5 to 14 ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 ) . Throttle response became razor .... and fuel economy went to over 40MPG on a 300km trip to Vancouver and back ( this is in a 700kg car plus two people and luggage , however ) . <p> There is no way 115 main jets would work with the normal Weber E-tubes and idle jets ... I doubt it would rev past 5000 for having no fuel .... <p> It is so good , that if it were n't for needing a computer to control the VVT and ignition on my 20V project , I would use 45DCOEs .... <p> The one downside is that with a perfect AFR , DCOEs run like crap until they warm up a little ( just a little ) .... When it was pig rich , it was n't a problem .... ( The cold-start circuit is n't hooked up -- and they 're not great to drive on ... just idle in the driveway ) . <p> Extra info : <p> Some DCOEs have a lean-condition off-idle stumble that happens just as the throttle plates move ... this is because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throttle plate ... As soon as it moves , the hole should start to uncover ... Different series DCOEs have different progression holes ... The fix is to make d*mned sure that the throttle plates close as perfectly as possible .... Any carb that has had the throttle plates taken out will probably not have been put back together super-perfectly ... If there are leaks around the throttle plates bigger than .001 " , it 's bad news . I used a piece of .0075 " aluminum foil as a feeler when I set the plates . Drilling a new , perfectly placed progression hole is the cure if that does n't work . <p> Also , older Webers ( that might have come from an Alfa or something ) have brass throttle shafts ( that can twist -- new ones are steel ) and leather throttle shaft seals that dry and leak air ... ( hard to get low idle ) ..... These old ones do n't have air-bypass screws , so balancing is a b*tch . DCOE series 151 and 152 are the current ones .... made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish ones being less good . Bullsh*t I say .

I wish I knew that when I spent $40 each . Hypojet idle jets are US$15 each . LONG ... <p> Some things to consider though , with heavier cams come the requirement for crappy driveability and terrible fuel economy . It is a fact that is only overcome by stand alone fuel injection .

Good write up , agree the adding an afm to monitor fuel mixture is a big help . I have mikuni 44 on my 2tg , it has 304/ 288 cams and is 3t crank with big bore , so it has lots of torque . With some carefull tuning it is very streetable in the lower rpm before the cams come on .

Something about moving the hole for the tierod this way or that , ..... I really have no clue what to do . <p> uhhh , drill the holes closer in . There 's no simple science to it other than making the arm shorter , so that the rack travels less distance for the same amount of movement for the wheels . That 's it , that 's all . Tierod movement is a bit annoying , but only if you adding steering rack spacers. if your not , then you just have to get an alignment done again if your new hole is not parrallel with the old one . simple .

You can not see it but cast actually stretches on a molecular level to the point of being very brittle and ready to snap . <p> Instead , try making new steering arms using regular steel . You can cut a new arm out of some 1/2-3/4 " steel which will be very strong and you can make them to any length you want . But before doing so you may want to read up on the effects of ackerman angle . @qwx111435 <p> First off , totally Illegal . Next , its pure awsome. then , ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attaches to shorter so that a given input ( from the rack ) makes it travel further in its arc . Creating more angle as well as faster steering imputs . Now it has been said that Japaneese manufacturers use a highcarbon ( ? ) cast steel for these parts which in general most mechanics would shoot you for cutting and welding , ESPECIALLY because its in the steering system . BUT it has been done time and time again to achieve awsome results . <p> I asume this is for your s13 , and I 'm sure you can find some pics of stock and modded s13 knuckles on line . Just look real close at what they do , and try to do the same . The ones I have seen incorporate some sort of bumpsteer spacer as well , aka they lower the outer tierod mount to put the tierod end closer to the optimal rack level . <p> You can take out the inner tierod , and where it threads into the rack add a washer or two . The Inner tierod has a large OD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going any further , you place a washer between the inner end and the rack itself , and it will allow the rack to travel further . BUT with power steering , I do n't  know how far you can go , the rack needs to be sealed . If you have too much travel the ps fluid will escape , and you will be corollaing ti around . <p> Here is a pretty good pic of the ones I was thinking of . you can see the stock location , and the new location the new location is closer to the pivot(balljoint) so the as the rack moves the angle of the arm moves more than when it was longer . <p> ? <p> Ya ? get it ? <p> As Chris said , Acckerman comes into play as well , and for that reason I do n't  realy like this way of increasing steering angle . I did a lot of theorizing and measuring before I came to my final setup . It seems to work realy well , for now But I think there is more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside tire realative to the outside tire . Most cars are set up so that the inside tire turns a tighter radius than the outside tire . this allows the car to make nice tight turns in the parking lot , without the front tires fighting each other . Much the same as a differential works in the back allowing the inside tire to travel a shorter distance than the outside tire . <p> Still there ? <p> Now , for max drift angle , do you want you front tires at different angles ? Do you care about parking your car ? I will asume no , SO you want to reduce the amount of ackerman , or the difference in angle between your front tires . <p> My guess is the larger hole thing is to run a bolt and rod end instead of the tapered balljoint . <p> What is that picture of , do you have a wider shot ? to me it looks the opposite of what I would do . what car is that from his gcb or what ever subies are called ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenght , steering arm length , the angle of the tierod hole vs the balljoint stud , bump steer comes into play as the steering arm goes thru its arc and all the wierd angles start raising and lowering the outer rod end . <p> ect . Basically , get some rack spacers/washers in the rack . and or make some knuckles like that dude on NoriYaro , His are just realy realy short . It works , but your steering will get heavy , and the short arm limits the actuall total angle . It sounds wierd , I have a theory , longer arm equals more angle , but still requires more work . Lots of indepth mods to make it work . like machining new racks ect . <p> Funny ... I was just talking to piggity and jrs about this yestrday .

You may be able to keep a higher oil capacity and slightly better oiling on the back two pistons ... Might be unicorn but at this point why not ... No matter what you do , start listening to the guys on here with 75+ cumulative years fixing , modding , blowing , DRIVING these engines , and setting goal that makes sense . In the end it 's your engine to wreck ... I say wreck it and see where it breaks ... That 's how everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the power of greyskull , then yes , an NA is not a cost effective build . However , for those who love the 4A-G engine , as well as the challenge of getting it to a high level of refinement , it is worth the effort . <p> Also do n't you need to molest firewalls to cram black/silvertops in an ae86 ? I 'm hesitant to do that right now depending on how the chassis looks when I pull it apart this winter . The rear fenders are pooched as <p> My budget is pretty much any money that I do n't spend on bills/living . Which is a decent bit all said and done . The car gets pulled apart as soon.as my room mate gets his pos bmw out of my side of the garage . And I would like it to be done for next season .

@@8345141 @1545141/ @qwx111434 <p> Alright guys , I did those calculation while driving and I think I screwed up ... lol <p> The combined was 8.9L/100km instead of 7.8L/100km ... which makes a little more sense to me . Although , I came close to 8L/100km on the second par of the trip which is pretty weird , because it was the only one where I drove in the mountains ... the first and third part of the trip was along the Saint-Laurence river on highway 20 which is as flat as you can get ... so my believing is that driving the car flushed out old crappy gas from the tank and may have cleaned the valves/combustion chambers , because it does n't make any sense any other way ... that or I 've been filling up at Petro-Canada all the time but my first gas stop was at a Shell station ... but I do n't believe that that V power crap could make that much of a difference . Btw 8.9L/100km give you a 562km range ... which is pretty well what Neil got with his wagon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a difference ... ca n't wait to make the calculation for the third part of the trip which was also done along the Saint-Laurence <p> First leg , on the flat ... : <p> 283.1miles ( 455.6km ) and filled up 42.55L for an average of 9.34L/100km <p> Second leg , in the mountains ... : <p> 222.2miles ( 357.6km ) and filled up 29.99L for an average of 8.39L/100km <p> if you make the global average , it add up to 505.3miles ( 813.2km ) on 72.54L for a global average of 8.9L/100km <p> I have made 168.7 miles ( 271.8km ) since and the fuel gauge indicates a little above 1/2 ... ca n't wait to fill her up to crunch some numbers <p> Well , been driving it for a couple of weeks now and it 's time to get back to work and get it done in the wheel/suspension department . <p> Si I 've setup to work on my widenend wheel v2.0 ... and while being there , mounted one of my 13x7.5 in the rear without spacers to see how it looked <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing is that it accentuate the fact that I REALLLY need a drop ! While doing suspension/brake work , I 'll change the rear drum and I already put a heat resistant lacker on them , so instead of seeing a old rusty drum behind , we 'll see the new shinny one ! Should look good ! <p> But while being there , I realized that I had more space in the back then I thought ... <p> So they will become 13x8.5 +14 <p> Oh yess , they get larger and larger ... <p> As you can see , I 'll have to mount tire upsidedown , I did n't touch the outside of the wheel so fitment with the fender should be like on the picture above . <p> In the front , nothing is changing , I 'm juste swapping the outside lip that are too large for skinnier ones and enlarging by the center so the lip gets where it is right now ( right flush to the fender ) but allowing the tires to be mounted like they should be . <p> Goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm also stoke at the performance considering that it is still the original engine , just with a 2T-B setup , making it officially a low compression 2T-BR . I ca n't wait to swap in my modified bigport head and 1.7:1 rocker shaft , should really wake it up ! <p> and signals do n't work ... lol hazard either ... but the bulbs are ok , and they work when I " beep " my alarm system , so I do n't know if it 's the relay that is toasted or the alarm system was installed incorrectly and the connectors that goes from the signal switch is cut up somewhere . I 'll need to diagnose this thing sometimes soon ... but normally I do signal <p> My JB welded speedo driven gear lost a tooth ... it was already off since it was designed for a 3.727:1 FD and I 'm running a 4.1 , so now it 's even worst ... I run 90mph just to follow the traffic ... makes it quite easy to max out the speedo The problem with that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest driven gear that can work with the drive gear ( the worm gear on the output shaft ) is the one I have , 19 tooth . In order to run something to suit my ratio , I needed the other kind of 6 tooth worm gear , the one that works on 19 to 21 tooth driven gear . Luckily , it came in the AE86 sr-5 tranny with a 20 gear driven gear to suit the 3.909 ratio . <p> One of my buddies here had a spare AE86 sr-5 tranny ( big bearing ) to use for parts . He gave me the driven gear , I just had to drive an hour or two to get to it and pull the extention housing to get to it ... <p> Now , I have no idea if it will work , but the original gear from my small bearing tranny looked like that <p> And the one from the big bearing looks like that <p> There seems to be the same slot for the ball that serve as a key , but the one on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear from spinning on the shaft , instead it slips over the output shaft spline which have 22 spline instead of 20 like the early small bearing . So I do n't know if it 'll slip in place of the one I have right now or if I 'll need to run it on a lathe to remove the tooths ... maybe someone here has any idea ... <p> After that is all figured out , I found the parts number for a driven gear that has 21 tooth and will run on that 6 tooth worm gear , which is exactly the right combo for my 4.1 rear end ... I just need to order it from Toyota . <p> Some of you will be pleased , but I fixed my signal issue I pulled the kick panel , exposed all the wiring and went along to test the connector under the steering ... turns out it 's perfect ... so I dig a little deeper following the wiring ... and what did I find ? Some one pulled the plug that goes to the flasher relay ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hazards ... lol that was easy enough ! The relay I heard clicking everytime I pushed on my alarm system remote buton was the position light relay ... that is why I got confused on that issue ... <p> I also separated my old auto front driveshaft from the yoke <p> because the thread that holds the back section on to sandwish the carrier bearing were ****ed and it was n't usable because of that , but the yoke could have a use somewhere down the line if the T40 blows or I go crazy and turbo the 2T ... <p> Hello W ! <p> Then I went along on my widdened steelies v2.0 ... for those of you that want to go along with this , I must advise you that you will spend a lot of hours to do a freaking boring job ... remove the centers in order to only use the barrels out of half of the rims ... You must grind away 8 big spot weld ( like 3/4 dia ) and since you do n't want to hurt the barrel , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nasty grinding job ... and you end up with 4 of those <p> After that was done , I took my time and aligned all those half barrel back on my rims and spot welded them square and fare ... and gave myself a big tower of rims <p> And since I 'm redoing them because they were a bitch to mount tires on , I decided to give it a go .. 2min with a flat screwdriver was all I needed ... it was almost too easy ... <p> ... But I think I 'll need ether sometimes in a near futur ... <p> Next step is to weld the seam on them and start with the priming , sanding and paint ... should be finished soon enough . <p> On the good side , I finished welding the seams on the wheels . I did n't grind the welds since they are unexposed , hiding under the tire , but I did brush all the wheels inside and out with a wiremesh wheel to clean everything real good . <p> And while getting ready for the sanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... so I bolted them on my front driver hub , steering at full lock and got a center punch clamped on an axle stand to get some specs ... <p> And here comes the bad sh ! t ... <p> None of them are perfect ... <p> 3 of them are not so bad but the forth one is not so good ... <p> Here are the specs <p> Front : <p> lateral runout : 1.1mm and 0.9mm out of round : 1.9mm and 1.6mm <p> Rear : <p> Lateral runout : 1mm and 4.1mm out of round : 1.1mm and 0.4mm <p> On one of the rear one ( the one with 4.1mm runout ) you can see it pretty clearly when you spin it ... <p> I have no idea what to do now ... <p> 1- f@ck it and scrap them , turn around and find other wheels 2- finish them , buy some tires for and pray that it ends up not to bad after balancing ( in the hope that I can balance them ) and if they turn out to be crap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my rubbers ... <p> I really have no idea ... maybe some guys here have an input on this ... following those specs ... but according to toyota , 3 out of the 4 are within specs on the runout side but out on the out of round , and the other is the opposite ... so none of them are really in specs ... <p> We 'll see ... if it does n't work , I 'll just make new ones in a different fashion , I already have all the bits of scrap here to make 4 others . But some guys around here told me that I 'm worrying for nothing and that a lot of brand new rims and even alloy wheels come far worst from the factory ... I 'll cook the paint on those , rim some cheap tires and have someone balance them , we 'll know for sure if they are drivable after that . <p> So following my legendary luck , some bubbles apeared in the paint when I cooked it ... and following the same luck , all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none behing and none on the barrels hidden by the tires ... so the paint is not perfect either . I wo n't be correcting it now , no point if the rims are unusable ... so I 'll mount cheap tires as soon as I get them and we 'll see if I 'll have to correct the paint on those one or start back from scratch ... <p> On an other note , I started modding my existing dash to accomodate for the TE51 I got from warren . Since it was n't from an SR5 , it did n't came with the tach so I started adapting an old RA21 tach to match <p> Got the center out , removed a couple of connector that serve on the " fasten seat belt " light and boom , dropped right into place ... <p> ... in the stock holes <p> Problem is that the stock face is 1/2 " too big to fit properly <p> It 's 4 " across <p> And the opening is 3 " 1/4 so the face needs to be 3 " 1/2 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call : <p> " if anyone has a tach face that would fit that thing and fit with the style of the dash , so preferably out of a ' 70s toyota of some sort , I 'd gladly take it ...

I 'm wondering if anyone here has done an oil filter relocation kit on there AE . <p> I 'm not a fan of the placement of the oil filter on the car and it woudl be much easier if i were to mount a kit . I 'm wondering if there are any issues in using such a kit . I do n't  have the car here to examine and make a judgement myself so any input would be great . Also , is it not possible to convert the stock oil cooler to a full flow by using a relocation kit ? Run the in line to the oil cooler , then the out line in the oil cooler to the filter adapter and the out line in the adapter to the in line in the block ? ? <p> I see that GReddy offers a relocation kit with all nessary fittings for $165ish USD . Does anyone know who in Vancouver is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system for the 2002 Civic . Which relocates it to the drivers side strut tower . <p> Now I know what you 're thinking , but the filtre on my Vic is the same size as the filtre for my AE86 ( which is pretty much the same filtre across all 4 cyclinder Toyota 's only diff is some are larger capcity - Longer ) . <p> So you could easily use that system on your Toyota vehicle and relocate as you see fit . There would be some modification needed as the lines may be much longer then you need . <p> Also the other thing you need to consider is with the relocation you may change the oil pressure ( slightly ) but should n't be a problem . <p> Is n't the point of a relocation kit to make it easier to get to the filter ? <p> That 's the exact reason for my reloaction fo the filter . Its PITA to do an oil change unless you have a hoist handy due to the header and starter location .

This is my first " Old School " car and kinda pumped about getting this build going ... I expect this will be a two year project , but here 's hoping it runs shorter . <p> The long &amp; short of this detailed build is to save this build for posterity and to help others who want to try this out for themselves ... I will try to take pics and explain the steps as I go along . I also need to give credit to Sheepers of New Zealand(Toymods) , who basically inspired me to take this project on . <p> I 've always been a fan of the 1st Gen Celica ... although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid. , but saw one for the first time in 2005 , and said I had to get one these . I did buy one a few years earlier like ( 2007 ) with an Automatic tranny(silver) and never got around to doing anything due to my other projects ( 96 SMG MR2 Turbo - Right hand to Left hand conversion ) , so I sold it to a friend of mine ... from what I heard he sold it before moving ...... <p> Oh well , I hated the fact that I got rid of it , so when I found one for sale in Arizona ( Ebay ) back in 2011 , I bought it sight unseen and had it shipped up here ... sad part was that I paid more to ship it here than I paid for the car . Anyhow I have a VERY solid non-rusted ( for the most part ) RA29 , which is now underway for a V8 swap with IRS ( Independent Rear Suspension ) <p> ok so here is the car I bought back on Dec 04th , 2011. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine and sold it to help recover costs of my build . The interior was pretty much shot as should be expected with a car of this age , but car was straight and rust free ( for the most part ) . <p> I gutted the interior , carpet , rear seats ( &amp; tossed them ) . I have a nice set of MR2 Turbo leather seats which I had recovered which will be a nice fit in here . I tried sitting in the rear seats and unless you are a small child , nothing else will fit back there , so rear seats were tossed also . The only thing that really needed to be replaced was the hood . it had some pretty awful dents ( see pics ) which would have been a real expensive to fix , so I was able to find a replacement hood from a guy on the 1st gen celica site ... it was an ugly yellow but straight . <p> so when looking for a solid axle to support the lexus 1UZ engine , the rear end &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow up before getting into 2nd gear . it was a real pain in the butt trying to find the right axle , so I decided to follow " Sheepers RA28 IRS swap " and decided to go with an independent IRS system instead which seemed easier than trying to get a solid axle , cut it down and then try to convert the rear to disc brakes and possible 5 bolt pattern . Sheepers used an Skyline GTR R33 rear axle set up , but up here those are hard to find and also looked like a more difficult swap to modify . <p> When trying to figure out which IRS to go with , I felt the best option was to go with MK3 Supra ( 1987 ) ... after taking a number of measurements at the wrecking yard , it turned out that the Supra rear subframe would fit nicely with little modifications ( as little as it goes with converting the rear end from solid axle to IRS ) and the fact that MK3 supras are sooo easy to find here in Canada these days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with a blown engine/auto tranny for sale on Kijiji and so I bought it . <p> sucky-part was I bought this whole car with hopes to part it out to help recover my costs but I told the guy that I was only after the drive train , and so he gutted the supra and removed everything but the drive train before I took possession , oh well that 's how it goes ... I only paid 300.00 for the car . I pulled the complete drive train from the car then drug out the carcass to the front of my driveway ... although I covered it up under a tarp , I live in a nicer neighborhood and i 'm sure I pissed off some of my neighbors ... Opps <p> this shell was also the repository for the parts that I took off the RA29 , so when the scrap yard came the hauled all of this away it saved me a tone in costs , since they haul away scrap for free ! ... ) The red hood was actually off my AE92 ... was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled the engine &amp; automatic transmission out of the car placed it in the trunk of the supra then dropped the entire rear cross-member , drive axle and front cross member . I thought maybe I could modify the MK3 Supra front cross-member to fit in my ra29 , but as you can see from the pic ... sort of a foolish idea ... oh well did n't really cost me anything to pull it and see , so I threw it into the mk3 shell for disposal . The front cross-member is actually from an AE86 which will fit my RA29 very nicely and accept the 1UZ engine ... That MA70 front cross member is incredibly heavy ... just the weight alone should deter anyone from wanting to use it . <p> here 's the complete IRS rear subframe which will go into my RA29 <p> it 's dirty and only has a little bit of surface rust from sitting which looks like a long time , but the real score was the fact that this car came with Limited Slip Differential ( LSD ) which was only an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that made up for the fact that I got screwed on this car ( mk3 supra ) . <p> oh yeah , when taking measurements on the rear subframe at the wrecking yard they had brought in a complete and in amazing condition mk3 supra with a standard w58 transmission . after inspecting this tranny , it shifted very tight so I had to have it for my build ... logically I got up early the next day and went to the yard and pulled the entire 7MGE engine and tranny to separate the transmission before anybody else found what I found . yes pulling the engine out is the easiest way to get the tranny out ... fast . This car was in such nice shape , it was a real shame to see it in the yard . <p> I 've gotten really good at pulling engines ... I was able to separate this engine/tranny assembly in 2.5 hours and placed it on the ground to grab the tranny <p> so now that the mk3 supra ( and all RA29 parts ) was hauled away by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear axle assembly gone . so I could spend my time trying to line up the rear IRS to the RA29 rear end . <p> The sub-frame fits so well that the rear Bolt positions almost lines up with the frame rails ... its out on each side by approx. 1/4 " ... the front 4 bolt positions actually fit exactly where the rear axle trailing arms fit this means the bolt position will actually bolt into the car 's frame so after a little reinforcing it will be VERY strong <p> one thing to keep in mind when converting an RA29 from solid axle to a newer MK3 supra IRS , the wheel base width is wider than Stock so you will need to flare the fenders . The wheel in this pic is actually a JDM wheel from an SW20 MR2 with a +35 offset on 16 " x7 " ... the wheels I will be buying are 17x10 with a +22 offset so will stick out an extra .5 " or 3/4 " further ( I think ) <p> next up : purchased 2 " x4 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to bolt the sub-frame to the RA29 frame rails <p> The wheel in this pic is actually a JDM wheel from an SW20 MR2 with a +35 offset on 16 " x7 " ... the wheels I will be buying are 17x10 with a +22 offset so will stick out an extra .5 " or 3/4 " further ( I think ) <p> yeah I just started working on this build about a month ago ( beginning of June ' 15 ) and have been picking away at it just about every 2nd day ...

I had the Cross beam drilled out to receive the axle bolts . Unfortunately the longest bolts I have will not go through the cross-beam and through the rear subrame , so I had to order up 6 new bolts which wo n't arrive until middle of next week . after mocking it up , it looks like more cutting is required . <p> The tire tub has a shield which hangs down about 1/4 " which need to be cut as well as a little more of the pan rod support , so that will be done in the meantime while I wait for the bolts to arrive . The Cross-beam still needs to have the weld caps welding on ... I anticipate being able to have most of the welding done next weekend <p> If you 're going to be torquing those bolts through the cross section of tube , it would be prudent to weld in a piece of round tubing large enough for the bolt to pass through . That way when you tighten the bolts , it wo n't squash the rectangular tubing .

The car had been sitting so long paint cans had exploded all over it , droppn loads ! <p> Over two days we ( I ) put the car together and got it running and driving . Just a boring GTS with tired bluetop and 2 way lsd , blown homemade coilovers . <p> At the time I was driving an 87 hatch pretty much finished up , running 4AG sidedraft DCOE40 setup and whatnot .

Pulled the eng/trans and scrapped the rest . <p> Pillaged a 7.5 " rearend from a Toyota LE toaster van that was at the firehall near my moms ' place . I had just scrapped my 4th gen hilux 2wd so I used the W55 trans and driveshaft from that . <p> Slapped the SR5 stuff back under the car so I could tow it down to BCWORKS to have it built by Warren and Joel ( Pitobread ) . I dropped everything off , said what i wanted and left it to them for like a year while I was away working up north . They tinkered on it during their spare time in between building countless other cars . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ported and polished the heads , planed them down for more compression , fresh water pump , timing belt , new gaskets and seals , new starter , yada yada . <p> Most of these photos are just stolen from Warren , but I doubt he minds ... I 'm basically making this thread to promote BCWorks . <p> Manual rack install <p> I had purchased Xcessive manufacturing engine and trans mounts . They were poorly manufactured and they sent me an E7 trans xmember instead of corolla one . So BCworks just modified an auto SR5 xmember to work , and modified the engine mounts to push the engine further back in the chassis . They also changed them to fit on cusco rubber mounts instead of just being hardmounted . Xcessive never responded to my emails , do n't buy their ****ty products . <p> They chopped up the exhaust manifolds to fit , not pretty but they work fine . Indyspeed headers will be an upgrade eventually , but I 'm really happy with the exhaust setup on the car . Sweet 2.5 " to 3 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the tranny , they bought a 3 " stainless exhaust for a chevy pickup for cheap at lordco . Chopped it up , and made it fit extremely well . You can drag the frame rails of the car without damaging anything really . It 's got a single muffler , with a sweet plug in silencer/downturn pipe for when you want it to be quiet . <p> Around this time I bought back a zenki GTS ae86 coupe from my brother . He had n't maintained it , which caused engine to lose compression , transmission wear , random gremlins ... <p> I swapped in new suspension , drivetrain/engine/trans , but the car still had intermittent running issues , probably a fuel pump voltage issue or something . Could n't be bothered so I sold it . Apparently it 's in washington state these days . <p> Once the guys got the engine sitting pretty in the car , they realized intake mani to hood clearance was n't great ( they did n't do any of that lame subframe spacing nonsense ) . <p> So they did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . And that 's why I chose them to build the car for me . <p> They cleaned up the threads on the Xcessive oil filter relocation deal which was horribly made . Now the oil filter resides where the battery used to be , more or less . An oil pressure sender sits on top feeding a mechanical autometer gauge for peace of mind . <p> The boys removed all the extraneous crap from the engine , TRAC system , emissions , they tossed the front timing cover plate from the engine and fabbed up a new deal . That probably saved 30 lbs at least . Made a cool swirl pot thing with alum piping for the radiator as well as an alum replacement for the plastic thermostat housing . Power steering gone , simple alt bracket and one belt off the main pulley .

Check em out from time to time here is a link to the thread on club4ag but the new stuff i will post here from now on as well . Thank you and also constructive tips and advice is always appreciated . For the first few videos i apologize for the crappy camera work and editing but i get a little better as time LONG ... <p> That rear end looks pretty . What drove the choice of an F-body rear end ? Will you be throwing more power at the engine in the future ? <p> Thanks ... and yes ..... i plan on more power .... i 'm thinking boost . But the main reason is because i did n't have an sr5 driveshaft to connect and my gts driveshaft is too short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end but here in the states in the midsouth it 's next to impossible to find one and i already got scammed by a guy telling me he 'd sell me his gts rear end ( got my money back though via paypal ) .

( what 's the deal with that ? ) Even now trying to buy ac and powersteering stuff people have ads for sale and tell me they 'll sell to me then when it comes time to deliver they do n't come through . So i just decided to do this on my own and go bigger since i am planning for more power soon . <p> Thanks . The widths are pretty close .... the gts rear is 54.8 and the gm 7.625 rear is 54.25 so about a quarter inch on each side shorter . I like that there is no cutting of the axle tubes like there is with the ford 8.8 . Brakes ..... i did a disc swap from a 99 blazer .... <p> as for lsd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard from a 99 blazer and it also has the locker rear end . Only crappy thing about it is it does n't engage over 25mph .... so it 's more for getting out of a jamb if you are losing traction on one wheel at lower speeds . But i swapped diffs for the 3.73 gears mainly . But if i wanted to i could search for lsd from a gm car maybe from a camaro or firebird or something ..... or i could just buy one aftermarket ..... there are a lot of them available yes and they are n't $1,000 either like some for the 86 . Much cheaper prices here . <p> Thanks guys .... yes plenty of brake . I went to the salvage yard today and i found a g80 rpo code out of a ' 99 camaro . What does that mean ? Well i have already a g80 diff from a Blazer but gm put the gov loc lsd in the blazers and they only lock up under 25mph ..... it 's more for trucks and suv 's not sports cars like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code in a camaro or firebird means true lsd or gm calls it posi trac or something like that . So i spent a little time and pulled it from the camaro and now it 's going in the rear end for the 8-6 . Got ta pull the gov loc diff out and Just got ta change the bearings ...... and i 'll put this baby in there . wish i could do all this stuff just once ..... but that would be too easy .

The little drill bits can be found in the Dremel attachment deparment at crappy tire , they come in a 5 pack from 0.8mm up , I think 0.8mm is the smallest and 1.2mm is the 2nd smallest . You might have a hard time finding a drill chuck that can hold the little bits tho . <p> Your oil drain sounds similar to mine , it should be fine . Mine is working great . I posted a pic in TTC oil drain thread not long ago . <p> Yeah , my bung sits further forward on the pan than I was actually thinking , in between the first and second bolt holes . It looks like yours sits where the stock return for the oil cooler goes . I have a feeling your turbo itself might sit higher than mine as well . I have the bottom mount on the SSAutochrome manifold , so the drain itself has to come forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In hindsight a top mount would have been a ridiculous amount simpler , both for design and installation purposes . <h> .. <p> mine is actually a couple bolt holes further forward than the stock oil return . That 's an SR5 pan with no oil return bung . It has a slight slope to the front , maybe 5 degrees off vertical . <p> I used a little oxy/propane torch from crappy tire , with some princess auto brazing rod . <p> Feral on the mr2 board and club4ag uses a brass fitting and he solders it up with a propane torch and plumbing solder then drills it . He 's got many miles/years on his setup and he 's had no problems . <p> I suppose if you had a steel fitting you could mig it closed then drill it , but it would be hard to control the bead . <p> Mine is more of a side mount , it 's tricky to do a top mount and clear the dizzy and brake booster .

I was looking at the oil drain again and it seems like shortening the actual piece exiting the turbo should gain me some elevation and increase the angle overall . Right now it 's only about 2 " long , but taking another inch off will still leave lots to have the line grab onto . Gah , what a pain in the ass this can be . <p> I 'm thinking now that relocating the bung to directly under the engine mount and then running the line through the mount might be the way to go .

I personally would not suspect the seals just yet , a slightly plugged drain can cause oil to spew past the seals , also too much piston ring blow-by ( exaggerated at boost ) can cause the crankcase pressure to get too high which interferes with the drain and can cause oil to spew past the seals , even if the seals are in top notch condition .

LSD . I would think it can handle the power of the 1jz just fine . <p> The celica guys say the limits of the 7.5 " diff is roughlky 300lf ft IIRC . The rebuild shouldnt add or reduce the max power of the diff . The pinons are what fail , l adn the rebuild has nothing to do with em . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it apart <p> The rebuild shouldnt add or reduce the max power of the diff . The pinons are what fail , and the rebuild has nothing to do with em . <p> I have to disagree with that , and here is the reason why . <p> The pinions do break , this is true , but it is caused for the most part because the LSD is 20+ years old and is worn out . <p> This first image shows the lower clutch member in the LSD casing . It fits very close to the slot in the casing . It is done this way by design . <p> This next image is of the upper member in the LSD casing . It fits with a gap , this is so the member can rotate slightly . This is done by design as well , it allows the members to push away from each other under load . This is what clamps the clutch plates . <p> The problem with a worn LSD is that the upper clutch member can make contact with the LSD casing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the one tire fire . <p> So , why does this cause the clutch member or pinion shafts to break ? Well , this is the simplest way for me to describe it . <p> We have all broken a branch or stick by placing something under each end of it then stomping on the stick in the middle with our foot . Snaps pretty easy . The stick represents the upper clutch member in a worn LSD . This is what is happening when the upper clutch member makes contact with the LSD casing . It places the pressure points on each end of the member and in the middle of the member . <p> The second sketch shows how the pressure points are applied in a rebuilt LSD . The stick representing the clutch member . The pressure is applied directly in the middle of the clutch member , the way it was designed by the brilliant toyota engineer . In this situation it is very hard to break . <p> I know some people will say this i pure bull , that I am only trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why they break . Another reason these LSD 's will break is due to the pinion gear making contact with the LSD casing . I have seen this many many times with the GTS LSD . Most people think it was the LSD breaking that made contact with the pinion gear but it is exactly the oppositte situation . The crush sleeve on the pinion gear fails , letting the pinion gear move in the housing and contacting the LSD casing . <p> The design of this LSD is very good in my opinion and when correctly assembled with the right clearances ( so the upper member can not make contact with the LSD casing ) it works fine and can handle way more power than people believe . We have rebuilt many GTS LSD 's which are the same in design as the Supra LSD 's . We have never had a customer call to tell us their LSD broke after we rebuilt it .

@@8345177 @1545177/ @qwx111434 <p> That 's how I 'm doing mine . With the new 5 angle grind , naturally , the valves sit a little deeper in the head , so rather than messing with changing shims , I 'm just trimming the stems to the right clearance . <p> The JZ are quite a bit larger , 7M are the same size , as are early 4A-F/FE engines ( Later 4A-FE and 7A-FE are larger like the JZ , IIRC ) . I believe there are some Yamaha motorcycles that use the same size shims as well . Apparently the 98+ Ford Zetec ( Contour ? ) shims are the same , as well as the CB750/CB900 engine family from Honda . <p> As for what sizes are still available , Toyota still sells all sizes of 4A-GE shims , they are expensive , but if you need one , you can get one . <p> Meh , grinding the valve tip is part of the recommended procedure when building the head , as per Toyota . As long as you do n't go below the minimum overall valve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Based on what else Brian said , he is obviously assuming the head is disassembled or near-disassembled , and grinding the valve tips is something that can be done properly . <p> Personally , I 'd just order the 3 valve shims I need and be done with it . <p> I had to do shimming on my engine when i rebuilt it and i just went to toyota and got the shims .

After that moment I would trust him with my life . <p> Agreed , I would move buckets and shims around well before grinding a stem , you want to leave that room there in case you need to resurface the tip at a later date , but if you were in a crazy pinch and you could still keep the overall valve height within spec , I reckon it could be done .

I think they are meant to be used as tie-rod ends on RC car ... they are slightly different ... here is a side by side picture <p> they use a 5mm ball which is smaller than what 's on the stock carbs , so I drilled through the old balls and welded the new ones in place for a cleaner look ( and less interference ) . <p> The metal end-links are a mm or 2 longer and the thread does n't go as far in as the plastic ones and the width of the assembly ( end-link and ball ) is 3mm wider ... it does n't seem much , but I had to trim 2 of the end links down because they were too long and prevented the main rod from going all the way back which in turn prevented the carbs from fully opening ... I had to bend a couple of brackets because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I ended up cutting 3 or 4 rods for everything to work perfectly . <p> It took close to 8h to set everything up ...

Thanks a lot again Sunray <p> *Edit* are you sure it 's not something like 21.4 ? ? ? because 11.4cc dome with 68cc chambers , a head gasket thickness of 1.5mm ( 87mm bore ) and displacement of 397.215 give me a CR of 7.06 , which is on the edge of " my engine does n't start " . 21.4cc gives me something around 8.15 which does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the headache guys , I 'm having a hard time understanding all that crap I wrote here lol if you do n't want to read it , that 's fine with me lol <p> ###### <p> To make sure we are both on the same page here Sunray , I 'm NOT discrediting the way you took those numbers or anything , I do n't know , maybe a 2 turned into a 1 when you transfered those numbers or anything . Although I would trust your number over many many others , I 'm not the kind to take something without asking questions and the more I think about it , the less sense this 11.4cc makes ... <p> I found a basic number : the height of the dome on a stock 2T-C piston , not the " golf balls " , but the same stock piston you had in your engine ... sorry for stealing your picture , but it 's the nicest I could find <p> so it says that the height of the dome is 5.8mm which seams to make sense , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thicker than 1 or even 3 head gasket stacked on each other ... <p> OK , the dome is tappering on top , but nowhere close to a " golf ball " piston , so instead of doing complicated maths and trying to figure out the tapper , let 's just assume that this dome is a cylindrical shape . And let 's forget those cut away , even if they are pretty deep cut ... <p> So I asked myself what diameter a cylindrical metal shape need to be to be 11.4cc and have a height of 5.8mm ... and it is 50mm ... so if I was to weld this thing to the top of a flat piston , it would leave 17.5mm all around it , which is over 40% of the piston top ... by ballparking this thing on the picture , it would mean that this cylindrical shape would go from the center to about the cut-away for the intake valve , but all the way around ... it just does n't make any sense . It seems to have a couple of mm around the piston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17.5mm for that matter ... and those cut away are big , but nowhere THAT big . <p> Ok , this dome is not a cylinder , but let 's assume the tapper is 45 ( number completely out of the blue ) .. that means that for the edge of the piston , you would have 14.6mm till you reach the base of the dome and from the center of the piston to the edge of the flat face on top of the dome , you would only have 22.2mm or about 1/4 of the total piston diameter . OK , I 'm not taking into account the valve cutaway , but as I said , they are big , but not THAT big . <p> I did the same exercise with 21.4cc ( which is a number out of the blue too ) but the CR ratio with this dome is 8.15:1 and the cylindrical shape that is 5.8mm high and 21.4cc is around 68mm of diameter , which leaves 8.5mm from the outside edge of the piston to this " compression cylinder " ... with the same 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... this is not accounting for the valve cutaway , but it looks a lot closer to reality than a 11.4cc dome that gives 7:1 CR ... <p> Also , think about it , the head gasket thickness is 1.5mm and it 's taking a volume of around 9cc and this 5.8mm dome with cutway would only take 2cc more while being almost 4 times taller in size and only maybe 10% smaller in diameter ... like I said , those cut away are big , but not THAT big ... <p> Anyways , let 's not beat that dead horse forever . I 'll CC my head when my valvetrain will be back in it and I 'll CC my piston dome when I 'll crack the engine open , that way I 'll stop guesstimating things .

@@8345192 @1545192/ @qwx111434 <p> This is interesting to me ... It seems like a lot more work than some other swaps , and a lot more Frankinstine-ish , but I really like the idea of it . Why is this such an uncommon swap ? It seems like a very good idea . <p> But where I am currently , I could get a whole car for $300 . SR 's are a little harder to find when there are 20 of those engines within a 1km radius of me right now . It is the fab work that looks like the hardest part , but it is something to think about . I am now studying this . <p> i like when people buss ass to get Toyota motors to work in Toyota car . keep that other stuff where it belongs . prolly gon na get flamed for that . <p> No flames required . I 'm the guy who built and owns the 2az-fe AE86 built from mainly stock parts in Australia . <p> Taka Aonos version uses a Nascar transmission that 's an expensive custom item and his motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines as evidenced by the custom valve cover finish . Its next level stuff , highly boosted 500ft/lb and 500hp plus . <p> I just wanted to fit one to a corolla chassis and try to do it on mainly stock Toyota stuff . It appeals to be because I do n't  mind doing extra work to keep it in the Toyota Family . Its basically about as hard as a fairly common fwd to rwd gen 1/2/3 3sge conversion is , which is reasonably common , with a couple of extra things to consider along the way . Its a challenge to do your own research at the self service wrecker rather than rely on other peoples ideas and patterns of thought . Its service weight is no more than a 4age , maybe even a touch less , and it has heavy after market support . If I ever get wealthy I can put a bc stroked 2.6 litre motor in and go nuts , although NA appeals more than boost as I 'm more of a purist about the ae86 ( even if that sounds contradictory ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ae86 should , with great torque response and some revvy character to the engine . The 2az is a passenger car engine with a lot of low down grunt to haul you and your family around in a Camry . It is a bit happier at higher revs than an rz engine , it suits the NA screamer punching above its weight ideals of the ae86 more than bigger and heavier truck motors , even if hp/l is potentially greater in a steel blocked rz , I care more about potential hp/kg , and the 2az has this in spades . The car does n't need 800 hp to do what I want to do with it as I 'm not trying to get too far away from the feel of the original . <p> Complex Problems : Starter motor location . Engine has no provision for starter unless installed bell housing side ala camry series . Has a large aluminium sandwich plate to connect to the transmission that blocks all access from traditional rwd locations . Unknown bell housing pattern or if any rwd tranny suits . <p> Motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and hitting the firewall with engine mounted . Unmodifiable high temp plastic manifold . <p> Motor leans towards inlet side in stock car but leans the other way 9 degrees ish when rotated and mated rwd . Oil pickup level changes . Sump drain not correct . <p> Very close to/touches top of firewall/tunnel union area . <p> Steering interference to clutch slave on required bell housing . <p> Shifter position a bit forwards of t50 stock position . <p> No engine mount bolt holes with thread anywhere <p> Stock belt system includes an extra 2 devices as I deleted AC and power steering from the motor . This creates interference issues where the belt wants to travel through the tensioner . <p> Solutions/Mods required to adapt it all and fit to chassis <p> Bellhousing was simlar to S motors , which is similar to Y , VZ , MZ , GR . I decided to use Y bell as I had the S as well baut it put the starter on the hot side and in a location that interfered with the main structural bolts holding the motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some superfluous metal that could be trimmed . I drilled , chipped and flap disced a spot for the starter to bolt in . There was only the dowels locating the housing and maybe one bolt . I drilled through and tapped a couple holes on the block and bell in turn and was able to get about a 5 bolt union that I was happy with . I had to make a couiple of plates and close up some redundant inspection holes on the union at the engine side . <p> 2azfe flywheel was machined down to fit the smaller Y ring gear and to save weight and to let the native location of the starter on the Y housing locate it in accordance with the ring gear . This natively gave the correct engagement and tooth set angle to get it to work . I just had to work out the correct face to face distance from starter to ring gear . My first attempt ( 4 washers precisely worked out fine and remains in place to this day ) . Flywheel is well under 10kgs now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its in my rollaclub thread if you care to read it . The 2az flywheel was retained as it has a unique bolt pattern at the crank and the economics and reliability of redrilling a flywheel is not ideal . Hence the decision to machine it down to suit a starter/bellhousing set from a stock vehicle . <p> The stock 9 inch camry clutch was used that came with the motor originally . I 've slipped it once pretty hard . Otherwise its been fine , held up great especially at the drag strip . I needed the clutch shop top make a custom throwout bearing carrier to adapt the distance offset by the odd fwd rwd mating of surfaces , so the throwout bearing is also way bigger than the Toyota parts that would generally operate this clutch , I think its a ford bearing from a much larger car . It was all as recommended by NPC , a pretty well loved shop here in Brisbane that does excellent clutch system engineering . I used a wider double row pilot bearing and tapped it to an ideal depth without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nose of the input shaft to the motor . <p> The belts were re routed slightly by modifying the tensioner to accept a stud and a different pulley . The belt then was set with a rose jointed arm that turn-buckle adjusts . A custom post was turned on a lathe to hold the lower edge . This clears the path along with some further relief of metal on the tensioner bracket itself to adjust the belt and have it function correctly . The idler pulley was swapped to a back of belt pulley to a grooved 7pk unit to allow the belt to wrap around the other side . Diagrams can be found in my rollaclub thread . <p> Mounts were custom and picked up some holes that I tapped on the block , Hot side is really wierd looking but wraps around the block to pick up a very low bolt hole and is cutaway to clear the disptick , the other side has a 3 bolt pattern as you would hope for . <p> Used cusco ae86 engine rubber mounts . <p> Made an itb manifold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( USA ) flange on the motor side and sam Q(Australia) made me the flange that spaced the throttles 10mm apart and modified my inks for me . I had a local alloy welding guru weld it up . Mick from Exotic exhaust . I hand formed the port transitions from alloy bullbar tube . SamQ supplied trumpets for me which he makes to custom specifications . Mine are 98mm plus they have 8mm spacers under them . Longer seems better . Total inlet length is about 340mm to valve I think . <p> Has a modified ra65 gearbox cross member to adapt the tranny in . Uses shortened mx13 auto tail shaft that came with the diff and had the correct w57 manual spline for some reason . Its one piece still with the stock 40 year old rubber join intact in the crush tube . <p> Motor slants left which has a few benefits . Keeps gearbox dead level . Allows longer inlet with less interference with clutch and brake master . Straightens out the early part of the exhaust slightly . Makes the motor more natively fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old K motor in the previous corollas , which traditionally slants left , although much more than this . <p> Sump was hand formed with a slide hammer and custom anvil recess to accept a new location for the oil pickup screen and drain bung . Dipstick was remarked at approximately double the level of original based off a dry oil fill and engine rotation to prime motor and filter . To achieve a new oil pickup location I custom designed a new oil pickup that I did a sloppy job planning but somehow got correct flange orientation first go . It was made from heavy steel steam pipe and welded by professional pipe welders at a boat engine shop . I faced the flanges and ported the pipe and polished the seam from the inside to enhance flow and reduce restriction . It gets oil pressure before it starts and I have not had a pressure loss while driving in any event or terrain , so it seems to work perfectly . <p> Last edited by littleredspirit ; 03-26-2016 at 08:48 PM . Reason : Spelling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top edge was simply relief cut slightly , hammered inwards a bit to create the required clearance , and then patch welded over the 2 splits . <p> Clutch slave was modified by being ground to sit lower and at a slight angle and the bleeder shortened to clear the steering . I do n't  recall what it was off but there are at least 3 designs of slaves to suit the Y housings over the years , i just found one that did n't  stick forwards too far and I cant remember what it was off . Clutch works great though . <p> Its a registered road car and was easy to pass as with no weight penalty the need for brake upgrades and chassis stiffening are negated . This bypasses a lot of the BS you can get caught up in when registering a modified car for road use in Australia . The car is stock weight at 970kgs with a half cage welded in.

Plus when I was trying to counter for the missing priming pulse , I ended up messing up my cold start settings . So now I 've got to do some work , upgrade to the next release and roll back my cold start , should n't be long tho . <p> I 'm using an aw11 brake booster with an mk3 brake master cylinder , i have n't yet verified that this will work .

But they are heavy and I was n't pleased with the added unsprung weight . <p> The Cressi brakes will fit the strut casings , but you 're going to have to run at least 15 " wheels to clear the calipers . <p> What I did with my MKII supra brakes was run just the regular celica gt steering arms , stock corolla ball joints , and a buddy on here shortened the celica arms by an inch . Huge steering angle with my stock power steering rack still . I am going to buy some t3 celica supra rca 's in the coming months .

Hope this one goes to a good home .. @qwx111436 @qwx111433 <p> Its not that I have to let it go , I simply want to build a car from scratch-the plans I have for the corolla are so involved that I might as well sell it as it sits and start fresh.If it does n't sell its not a big problem-I still have one wicked car to drive . <p> The cage should be legal for the sprints no problem , side protection is full nascar type intrusion bars and the tubing is sized for a heavier car , also the seat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case of a bad impact the seat stays with the cage and not the floor of the car . <p> actually 5-7500 would have been my selling price as well . what you asking sounds very reasonable . the only down side ( if you wan na call it that ) for some people is that you are running a set of carbs rather than itbs. some people do n't like carbs .

What is the easiest order of operations in this swap . what is the BEST and least labour intensive way to do this . to quote someones quote on this board " I do n't  want to learn from this " The story here is one great running gts hatchback with too much rust and one rust free sr5 coupe that does not run so great , both live in my garage . I figure the money I wont have to spend on bodywork will eventually manifest itself in performance goodies ( false logic ? ) if I use the coupe ( I also kinda like the coupe lines a bit more ) .

Strip the SR5 that is being used as the body for the swap . Start with the electrical harnesses . Remove the engine electrical harness , the under-dash mounted electrical harness ( do n't forget that the dashboard hides bolts behind the vents , so you 'll need to pop those out and be careful popping out the clock bezel , and the rear electrical harness which can be traced from the taillights . Take good note of how all the electrical harnesses were set up , putting them back in with the gt-s harnesses will be very similar . <p> 2 . Start stripping the engine to prepare it for being pulled . If you pulled your engine harness you 're off to a good start . Unplug vaccuum lines , unbolt the exhaust manifold , remove radiator hoses , anything that makes the engine attached to the car . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine on its own , which is fairly tricky but not too bad , or keep reading to remove the transmission along with the engine . <p> 3 . If you 're removing the entire driveline then jack the car up and put it on all 4 jackstands , remove the rear wheels and put a jack of your choice ( preferably a good one ) under the rearend . Start disconnecting the rear trailing arms ( all 4 ) at the axle , once you have these removed , unbolt the shocks from their supports , and remove them . If I recall correctlly , the axle should be ready to be put down on the ground now . Move further up the car to get to the center bearing that holds the driveshaft up to the chassis ( 2 bolts ) , undo those bolts and wriggle the driveshaft out of the transmission : now is a good time to have a drain pan below the transmission , it WILL leak gear oil ! Disconnect the parking brake cable housings on the underside of the car ( you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then take care of unbolting them and setting them free in the interior . Pull the rear end and put it to the side . Now you need to go further up the underside of the car and unscrew the speedo cable ( it looks like a big cap ) hose from the transmission . Disconnect the clutch slave on the side of the transmission , and trace its hydraulic line back to all of the places that it can be disconnected and removed completely . Put a jack under the transmission and from here you can either a ) unbolt all the bolts in the tranny crossmember except for 1 ( just swivel the crossmember out of the way ) and either remove the transmission along with the engine ( using a hoist ) , or unbolt the transmission and starter - do the starter first ! from the engine and pull them from under the car . IMO it 's less annoying to pull it from the underside , but I do n't mind a little roughhousing . Most people think pulling the engine with the transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you have the engine and transmission out of the car , unbolt the gaslines from the SR5 chassis 's frame - brakeline removal is optional , you can make it fit the GT-S rear axle with a little gentle bending . After you have unmounted the lines , go to the rear of the car and place a jack under the gas tank - unbolt the tank from the gas door , trunk floor , and all of its underside fittings . If you can get at it , unscrew the brackets that hold the hoses onto the gaslines and fuel pump fittings , before you drop the tank . Remove the tank , and now your SR5 is ready to be built into a GT-S . <p> 5 . Do the entirely same stripping process with the GT-S donor . If you can , take pictures ! Make note of where everything on the car is placed when you remove it . Toyota parts tend to be able to come off in clumps so if you can remove them like that , more power to you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel this is the best order to do things in , but the best thing to do is to pull things and then put them on the other car immediatly . However , that 's not always possible , so here is the best order of rebuilding : <p> 6 . Put the GT-S gaslines and tank back into the SR5 , put in all of the GT-S wiring harnesses ( sans engine harness ) , drop in the 4a-ge ( transmission optional , depends on your style . it 's do-able but I think it 's a pita ) , attach transmission , put the driveshaft ( if you 're using gt-s rear end , you HAVE to use the gt-s driveshaft ) back into the transmission , install the gt-s clutch slave on the transmission . Hook up the engine electrical harness , bleed all necessary lines and refill fluids , make sure all electricals are good , and then do timing if needed and hook the exhaust back up . <p> Nice ! thanks for taking the time to type that out , The wiring was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to re-wire the complete car or if it was going to be just the engine harness and under dash harness , now I know , I suppose it is easier to start at 0 and go from there . So to re-cap , I should strip sr5 completely ! as in nearly " bare shell " and then start transfering components as per the order as you listed . Fair enough . I think the electrical is what I find the most daunting part of this swap . I am sure I can swap from one car to another though , that should not be too difficult . Much thanks for the tips , I may contact you from time to time as I go if that 's ok with you . No start date firm yet ; It will be as wife permits ... er I mean time ... yea that 's it ! <p> Not a problem , this swap has beaten me black and blue so I 'm willing to lend a hand to any good fellow that 's trying to get through it .

I mightve left out a few things , so if you 're still confused , just let me know . <p> Thanks , I appriciate that , I am , and am not looking forward to it at the same time ! I am hoping to one day drive this car again , it has been awhile and frankly I like the driving better than I like the wrenching . <p> I think a cherry GTS would have been the hot ticket too , but since I tend to be fiscaly challenged , ( at least in regards to disposable auto-related income ) and all in at a cost of $800.00 for both ; my " not totaly shot gts " and my " crappy paint but no rust anywhere " sr5 and the fact that I tend to be " a cheap b@$tard " had little choice but to go at it this way ... it was devine intention is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sr5 to the bare shell as time permits , and since I really do n't  want to do strip this car down again soon , stitch welding is something I would like to preform at this stage as well ( this was part of the plan all along ) although I am unsure of all the seams to weld up as I understand there are some that should be left alone .... hmm prehaps that is a question for a new thread ? <p> I am just happy that I found this site , it 's so much easier than meowing up my car in the course of trying to figure out the correct way to do
