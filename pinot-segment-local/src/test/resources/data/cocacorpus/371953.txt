In the first article , we examined the balance sheet as a snapshot of your assets , liabilities and equity at a particular point in time . This article takes a look at the income statement , a financial report that details the money your practice earns , the expenses it incurs and the resulting profit or loss over a period of time . <h> Introduction to Income Statements <p> Your income statement ( sometimes called a statement of revenue and expense ) shows the revenue your practice earned and the costs associated with running your business . Although an income statement can be prepared for any interval , it is usually prepared annually . For example , an income statement that includes financial data for 2003 and 2004 would be titled , " Income Statement , Years Ended December 31 , 2003 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for shorter intervals , for example monthly or quarterly , it may include the total anticipated amounts for the year in one column , followed by revenue and expenses for the current period , year-to-date amounts , and current period and year-to-date amounts as a percentage of the projected annual total . <p> A sample income statement for the fictitious Springfield Psychological Services is presented below . <p> The layout of an income statement is simple to follow . Sales start at the top , expenses and other costs are subtracted as you go down the column and " the bottom line " tells you how much money your practice earned or lost at the end of the reporting period . <h> Sales <p> Sales ( sometimes called client service revenue ) reflects revenue from the provision of services or sale of products . Sales may be combined and simply listed on one line , or separated into subcategories to provide additional detail about revenue-generating products or services . <p> Sales are totaled and listed as " total sales " or " total revenue . " <h> Expenses <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These may include fees for consultants such as accountants and attorneys , wages for administrative staff , costs associated with advertising and marketing activities , depreciation of office equipment and furniture , rent , utilities , professional memberships , liability insurance , provisions for bad debt and other costs of doing business . <p> Expenses are totaled and listed as " total expenses . " <h> Operating Income <p> Following the expense section of the income statement , total expenses are subtracted from total sales to calculate " operating income , " your profit from operations before interest and taxes . <h> Nonoperating Gains and Losses <p> Revenue that is not related to the core operations of your practice is accounted for in this section . This may include interest and other earning from investments , donations and gains or losses from the sale of assets . <p> Interest paid on outstanding loans is also listed in this section . Some income statements detail both interest earned and interest paid , while others show only the total . <h> Taxes <p> The amount of income tax you have paid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the reporting period covered by the income statement . <h> Net Income <p> Finally , at the bottom of the page , appears the number everyone is interested in : net income . Also called net profit or net earnings , net income reflects how much your practice actually earned or lost during the reporting period . This is essentially amount of money remaining after all expenses are subtracted from total revenue . <h> Now What ? <p> Like the balance sheet , your income statement provides some of the data you will need to calculate the basic financial ratios that can help you track the performance of your practice , identify trends , and implement strategies to shore up your finances . With income statement data , you can evaluate factors such as your profitability and ability to manage your expenses . <p> Combined with data from your practice operations and other financial statements , your income statement allows for an even more in-depth understanding of your practice finances : <p> How well are you using your assets to generate revenue ? <p> How effective are you at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although the income statement represents a particular period of time , most income statements will also include data from the previous year ( or even multiple years ) to facilitate comparison and see how your practice is doing over time . <p> Compare the current reporting period with previous ones using a percent change analysis . Are your revenues growing ? Have your expenses increased exponentially and , if so , which expenses are out of control ? Is your practice becoming more or less profitable ? Are your biggest revenue sources changing ? Does a pattern of tax increases warrant seeking consultation with a tax advisor ? Are you spending more time on less profitable activities ? Calculating financial ratios and trends can help you identify potential financial problems that may not be obvious to the naked eye . <p> Developing a better understanding of your practice finances can give you the tools to set your own course to success and make well-informed decisions that benefit both you and the clients you serve .

@@101643930 @5843930/ <h> Transition to the ICD-10-CM : What does it mean for psychologists ? <p> Psychologists should be aware of and prepare for the mandatory shift to ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes in Oct. 2015 <p> By Practice Research and Policy staff <p> Update : This article has been updated to reflect the announcement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) that the transition to ICD-10 will take place on Oct. 1 , 2015 , rather than Oct. 1 , 2013 . <p> Feb. 9 , 2012 " Beginning Oct. 1 , 2015 all entities , including health care providers , covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) must convert to using the ICD-10-CM diagnosis code sets . The mandate represents a fundamental shift for many psychologists and other mental health professionals who are far more attuned to the American Psychiatric Association 's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) . <p> Most psychologists were trained using some version of DSM . For other health care providers , the World Health Organization 's International Classification of Diseases and Related Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental disorders " is the classification standard . <p> Over the years , efforts to harmonize these two classifications have resulted in systems with similar ( often identical ) codes and diagnostic names . In fact , even if psychologists record DSM diagnostic codes for billing purposes , payers recognize the codes as ICD-9-CM " the official version of ICD currently used in the United States . Since 2003 , the ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes have been mandated for third-party billing and reporting by HIPAA for all electronic transactions for billing and reimbursement . <h> Clarifying important terms <p> The ICD is the global standard in diagnostic classification for health reporting and clinical applications for all medical diagnoses , including mental health and behavioral disorders . The United States will be one of the last industrialized countries to adopt the ICD-10 , even though it was published in 1990 . Every member state of the World Health Assembly is expected to report morbidity and mortality statistics to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) using the ICD codes , but countries are allowed to modify the ICD for use within their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest version of the ICD once it is approved for use , WHO can not mandate when this will occur . <p> The International Classification of Diseases , Clinical Modification ( ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM ) is a modified version of the ICD created by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics ( NCHS ) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) . The CM versions of the ICD provide additional morbidity detail and are specifically used for medical coding and reporting in the United States . <p> The use of the ICD-10-CM should facilitate international data comparisons to track diseases and treatment resources . Its use may also decrease the need to include supporting documentation with claims as the ICD-10-CM codes ( just as the parent ICD-10 codes ) have greater specificity , such as severity indicators , within each code . The changes embodied in ICD-10-CM should result in more efficient claims management , fewer requests for clinical information and fewer rejected claims due to non-specific diagnoses . <p> The structure and coding for the mental and behavioral disorders classification in ICD-10-CM are different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categories of mental and behavioral disorders are much the same , but the new arrangement of categories and alphanumeric codes will be different from ICD-9 and the DSM-IV codes . For instance , major depressive disorder , single episode is coded as 296.2 in both DSM-IV and ICD-9-CM but is coded as F32 in the current version of ICD-10-CM . <h> Where does the DSM fit in ? <p> According to a 2009 news release from the American Psychiatric Association , the organization has worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and CMS to develop a common structure for the DSM-IV and the mental disorders section of the ICD-10-CM . The news release also stated that they are working with WHO to link the DSM-5 with the mental and behavioral disorders section of the ICD-11 , currently under development by WHO and anticipated to be released in 2014 . However , given that the ICD-10-CM is now being finalized while the DSM is still undergoing revision , it is difficult to determine how closely those two classifications will correspond . <h> What psychologists can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CE course , as well as 2012 Convention programming , to assist psychologists and other mental health providers in preparing for the ICD transition . Additionally , the APA Practice Organization will continue to monitor the revision process for both DSM and ICD and will attempt to highlight important transition points and identify valuable resources for APA members in anticipation of the Oct. 1 , 2015 transition date . <p> CMS has launched a new website to assist providers with the transition to ICD-10 . The step-by-step guides ( see links below ) are specifically tailored for small and medium provider practices , large provider practices and small hospitals . The guides contain information on suggested business processes , communication avenues and training , as well as potential difficulties to expect when making the transition . <h> What to keep in mind and expect in the future <p> CMS announced that there will be no grace period for the implementation of the ICD-10-CM . As of midnight on Oct. 1 , 2015 , any claims filed for dates of service ( for providers ) or discharge dates ( for hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because this is a HIPAA mandate , penalties for failure to comply will be enforced . Civil and criminal penalties may include heavy fines and imprisonment . For more information visit the HHS.gov HIPAA privacy rule site . <p> WHO will be completing the preparation of ICD-11 at about the same time that NCHS will be implementing ICD-10-CM . However , it is highly unlikely that there will be a similar delay in ICD-11 implementation in the United States . <p> Through a series of annual updates over the first few years following ICD-10-CM implementation , the U.S. is expected to bring ICD-10-CM in line with ICD-11 , so that the latest version of the ICD can be adopted smoothly and gradually without requiring a sudden and major change in the classification or how diagnoses are reported . 
@@101643932 @5843932/ <h> Billing for Your Services <p> Common Q and A 's <p> Q : When billing Medicare and private insurers for psychotherapy services , do I count only the time that I actually see the client , or can I include the time I spend writing up my notes after the session ends ? <p> A : Because the Current Procedural Terminology ( CPT ) code descriptors for psychotherapy contain the phrase " face-to-face with the patient , " you may only bill for time that you spend with the client . Report writing is considered an integral part of the service and is reflected in the payment level assigned to the codes . <p> Q : What type of assessment should I bill for if I am evaluating a client who has both physical and mental health problems ? <p> A : It depends on the predominant service you provided to the client and which CPT code best describes that service . If the majority of the time spent with the client related to a physical health problem rather than a mental health problem , you should bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see additional information about the health and behavior assessment and intervention CPT codes ) . If you spent the majority of the time assessing a client 's mental health problem , you should bill for a psychiatric diagnostic interview or a psychological assessment . <p> Because not all private insurance plans cover the health and behavior codes , psychologists treating clients with private insurance are advised to confirm coverage with the carrier or plan administrator . <p> Q : I am new to a managed care organization ( MCO ) panel . How can I find out what billing procedures to use when submitting claims to the company ? <p> A : The main places to look for guidance are your provider contract , the company 's provider manual and the " provider " section of the company 's website . The latter two sources usually indicate how to contact the company if you have further questions . <p> Q : My client is a subscriber to an MCO plan where I participate on the provider panel . The client has decided to pay privately and not submit claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and submits claims to the MCO , is there any risk that I as a panel provider will have to reduce my bill to the lower panel rate ? <p> A : In most cases , the answer is yes . Contracts frequently state that psychologists can not bill an MCO subscriber for more than the contract rate . In some situations , if a client or a client 's spouse decides to submit claims to an insurance company after paying privately , the psychologist may be required to reimburse the client for the amount that exceeds the covered panel rate . <p> Q : I have a new client who is a subscriber to one of several plans offered by an MCO . Though affiliated with the MCO , I do n't think I 'm on the provider panel for that particular plan . Will I get paid the higher out-of-network rate if I 'm not on that panel ? <p> A : When an MCO has more than one provider panel , psychologists often have difficulty determining whether or not they are on a particular panel . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract . It may indicate that you are on certain panels , or it may state that the MCO has the right to determine what panels you are on . Even if the MCO assigned you to certain panels initially , it may have sent you a contract addendum that adds to your panel assignments . <p> You may communicate with your network manager or other appropriate contact with the MCO to verify your panel participation status . It may be advisable to confirm in writing " for example , by e-mail " any information that is communicated verbally . <p> If you determine that you are not on the panel for your new client 's plan , you should be able to be paid the higher out-of-network rate . <p> If you find that the MCO considers you as participating on all panels , check your state insurance laws . Several states restrict MCOs ' ability to require providers to participate on all panels . <p> A : If you , or a billing service or clearinghouse acting on your behalf , electronically transmit " protected health information " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will trigger compliance requirements related to HIPAA . <p> Q : What steps must I take in order to treat Medicare beneficiaries and bill Medicare for my services ? <p> A : Medicare will not pay for the services you provide to a Medicare beneficiary unless you have a Medicare provider number . You need to apply for a provider number through the local Medicare carrier in your area . <p> You can find the local carrier 's contact information by going to the website for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services . Scroll down the menu on the left and click on " Contacts . " Then use the pull-down menus to indicate the state in which you are practicing and select " Carrier ( Part B ) " as the type of organization .

This article is the first in a series designed to assist you with making sense of your practice 's financial statements . In this issue , we start with your balance sheet . <p> Some practitioners are more familiar with financial terminology than others . You may find it helpful to consult a glossary of financial terms as you read this article . And though the subject of finances is tedious for many health professionals , it is crucial to be informed and to monitor the financial pulse of your practice . <h> Balance Sheet Basics <p> Your balance sheet ( sometimes called a statement of financial position ) provides a snapshot of your practice 's financial status at a particular point in time . This financial statement details your assets , liabilities and equity , as of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any date , it is usually prepared at the end of a reporting period , such as a month , quarter or year . <p> A sample balance sheet for the fictitious Springfield Psychological Services at December 31 , 2004 and 2003 is presented below , as an example . <p> The layout of a balance sheet reflects the basic accounting equation : <p> Assets = Liabilities + Owners ' Equity <p> with assets listed on the left side and liabilities and equity detailed on the right . Consistent with the equation , the total dollar amount is always the same for each side . In other words , the left and right sides of a balance sheet are always in balance . Note : Some balance sheets do not use the left-right format and instead list assets on top , followed by liabilities and then equity . <h> Assets <p> Assets are the things your practice owns that have monetary value . Your assets include concrete items such as cash , inventory and property and equipment owned , as well as marketable securities ( investments ) , prepaid expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payers . Assets also include intangibles of value , like patents or trademarks held . <p> On a balance sheet , assets are listed in categories , based on how quickly they are expected to be turned into cash , sold or consumed . Current assets , such as cash , accounts receivable and short-term investments , are listed first on the left-hand side and then totaled , followed by fixed assets , such as building and equipment . <p> The portion of equipment cost that is estimated to have been used up , based on the equipment 's estimated useful life , may be subtracted from fixed assets in the form of accumulated depreciation to calculate net property and equipment . Note : Various ways to calculate depreciation can have different tax implications . Talk to your accountant or financial advisor tomake the most appropriate decisions for your practice . <p> Finally , total assets are tabulated at the bottom of the assets section of the balance sheet . <h> Liabilities <p> Liabilities reflect all the money your practice owes to others . This includes amounts owed on loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similar to assets , liabilities are categorized based on their due date , or the timeframe within which you expect to pay them . <p> Current liabilities are generally due within a year of the balance sheet date and are listed at the top of the right-hand column and then totaled , followed by a list of long-term liabilities , those obligations that will not become due for more than a year . <h> Owners ' Equity <p> Owners ' equity ( sometimes called net assets or net worth ) represents the assets that remain after deducting what you owe . In simplified terms , it is the money you would have left over if you sold your practice and all of its assets and paid off everything you owe . Note : Valuing a practice can be extremely complex . Owners ' equity does not necessarily represent current market value and therefore should not replace a comprehensive valuation by an expert when considering buying or selling an existing practice . <p> Depending upon the legal structure of your practice , owners ' equity may be your own ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stockholder ownership plus the earnings retained by the practice to grow the business ( corporation ) . <p> Total liabilities and owners ' equity are totaled at the bottom of the right side of the balance sheet . <p> Remember " the left side of your balance sheet ( assets ) must equal the right side ( liabilities + owners ' equity ) . If not , check your math or talk to your accountant . <h> Now What ? <p> Your balance sheet also provides some of the data you will need to calculate the basic financial ratios that can help you track the performance of your practice , identify trends and implement strategies to shore up your finances . With balance sheet data , you can evaluate factors such as your ability to meet financial obligations ( current ratio , days cash on hand ) and how effectively you use credit to finance your operations ( debt ratio , debt to equity ratio ) . <p> Although the balance sheet represents a moment frozen in time , most balance sheets will also include data from the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see how your practice is doing over time . <p> Compare the current reporting period with previous ones using a percent change analysis . Do you have more assets ? Have you accrued more debt ? Invested in equipment and facilities ? Are your pressing financial obligations ( current liabilities ) under control ? Is the amount that payers owe you growing ? Calculating financial ratios and trends can help you identify potential financial problems that may not be obvious . <p> Data from your balance sheet can also be combined with data from other financial statements for an even more in-depth understanding of your practice finances .

Are you aware of APA 's Record Keeping Guidelines ? <p> by Legal and Regulatory Affairs Staff <p> September 30 , 2008 " " The psychologist strives to be aware of applicable laws and regulations and to retain records for the period required by legal , regulatory , institutional and ethical requirements . " <p> This statement introduces Section 7 , Retention of Records , of the " Record Keeping Guidelines " approved in 2007 as American Psychological Association ( APA ) policy . <p> As reflected in the guidelines , the amount of time to retain records depends largely on relevant laws and regulations . Many states - such as California , North Carolina , Tennessee and Connecticut - require health professionals to maintain records for seven years after the professional relationship ends . This time period typically does not start for minors ' records until the minor reaches the age of majority . <p> Yet some states impose different requirements or none at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children as well as adults for five years since the last patient contact .

In addition , retaining records over long periods may be challenging or expensive - for example , storing extensive paper records for numerous clients . <p> On the other hand , as stated in the APA Record Keeping Guidelines , an earlier record of symptoms of a mental disorder might be useful in later diagnosis and treatment . In addition , old records may provide a defense to psychologists who are sued or face a licensing board complaint . <p> Psychologists in institutional or organizational settings such as hospitals and university counseling centers need to follow any record retention requirements of the institution .

" Although I was able to fulfill my responsibilities at work , I was very stressed and exhausted . " <p> Midway through her post-doc year , Hom 's program director allowed her to reduce her work week to three-and-a-half days per week by extending her commitment from 12 months to 15 months . <p> " The extra day-and-a-half off made a huge difference , " says Hom . " It allowed me to take care of all sorts of family matters and take my kids to the park one or two days a week . The trade off was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more efficient on the days that I did go to work , but I was a much happier and relaxed person . " <p> Like Hom , many practitioners today are faced with juggling a multitude of demands in their professional and personal lives . From caring for young children and aging parents , to managing new technologies that can keep them " on call " day and night , practitioners are discovering the challenges and the benefits of balancing work , family and other responsibilities in their lives . <p> When work and family demands conflict with each other , the negative effects may include psychological distress , physiological concerns , decreased work performance and decreased job and life satisfaction . As related to practicing psychologists in particular , research shows that working in isolation and handling others ' emotional problems can lead to emotional stress , especially when patient trauma is acute or experienced over the long term ( Stamm , 1999 ) . <p> " We all have stress in our lives ; that 's to be expected , " says Nutt , director of the counseling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if our lives are not balanced , we increase our stress . Work-life balance helps keep us healthy-physically and mentally . " <p> How can practitioners today find balance amid multiple work and life demands ? Practitioners recommend the following steps : <h> Incorporate Self-care Activities into Your Life <p> Nutt recommends that practitioners tap into a variety of self-care strategies involving physical and emotional self-care . Research supports this recommendation by showing that self-care can help create balance and can contribute to good physical and mental health and improved quality of life ( Pope &amp; Vasquez , 2005 ) . <h> Know Your Limitations <p> Take a look at the amount of time you devote to work , family and other demands and consider how you can better balance your schedule , say practitioners . If your schedule is full , know when to say " no , " and know when to take a break . <p> " Nowadays with the information age it feels as if there is always more to do than one can truly accomplish in one day , " says Jonathan Huppert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Pennsylvania . Huppert and his wife , a cardiologist , combine busy professional schedules with caring for three children , ages 5 , 3 and 1 .

" <h> Develop a Social Support Network <p> Research has shown a correlation between social support and lower levels of work-family conflict ( Quick &amp; Tetrick , 2002 , p. 151 ) . Nutt advises practitioners , especially those who work in isolation , to seek out and develop social support networks at work and at home . " Find a supportive peer group , " says Nutt , who adds that support is available through peer consultation groups , informal sharing with friends and colleagues and personal psychotherapy . <h> Develop Outside Interests <p> Finding and nurturing interests apart from psychology is important , says Nutt . She recommends finding hobbies , volunteering or engaging in recreational activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Do n't Let Work Take Over Your Life <p> " We tend to form our identity around what we do as a job , " says Nutt . " Part of the point of work-life balance is recognizing that there 's more to you than being a psychologist . Work-life balance helps practitioners to avoid over-identifying with one role . " Nutt notes that the literature shows that those who identify with multiple roles that are important to them are healthier than those who identify with a single role , as long as the multiple roles are not overwhelming . <h> Embrace Flexibility <p> Practitioners agree that setting aside time for various responsibilities requires discipline as well as flexibility . <p> " One needs to set priorities , " says Huppert . " It comes down to protecting one 's own time and making decisions . Part of it is working differently .

" <h> Seek out a Supportive Work Environment <p> Research has shown that both employees and employers can benefit from supportive work-life balance programs , such as flexible scheduling and childcare or eldercare . Such programs can help workers balance the many demands in their lives ( Jamison &amp; O'Mara , 1991 ) .

" We all have different needs to balance during different stages of our careers , " she says . " Keeping things in perspective and creating a long-term balance is important .

It is therefore intended as a heuristic , and as an invitation to monitor and carefully manage one 's own personal stresses and needs , in order to ensure optimal professional functioning . <h> Stress <p> Obviously , everyone experiences stress at various points over the course of their lives . Stressors range from the minor " being late for an appointment , missing an exit on the freeway " to the major " loss of a loved one , serious personal injury or illness . Stress will induce physical , cognitive and emotional changes in the individual to varying degrees , relative to the individual in question and the level of stress . <p> Psychologists experience the stress of everyday living like anyone else . And , like anyone else , psychologists typically experience stress related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these universal stressors , there are specific occupational vulnerabilities common to psychologists . Such occupational vulnerabilities should not surprise us . Most occupations entail certain risks , hence the existence of hardhats , for example . These vulnerabilities are related both to the person and personal history of the psychologist , and to the nature of the work psychologists do . <p> An interactive model is helpful in understanding how the person and the work of a psychologist may contribute to professional distress and impairment in the profession . Psychologists bring with them to their work both strengths " knowledge , resources , life-experience , sensitivity and training " and weaknesses " historic emotional injuries , a tendency to over-identification , the need to be seen in a positive light , for example . In fact , vulnerabilities related to the person of the therapist tend to parallel their strengths and in many cases stem from the same source . For example , a person who has suffered loss in childhood will likely be more sensitive to such a condition in others , and therefore more able to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has suffered may also feel suffering more acutely , or be prone to rescuing rather than helping a client find her own way out of the predicament facing her . In other words , what makes us helpful may also make us vulnerable . <p> Work-related stress , for psychologists , includes that caused by the social context of the work " including the stigma associated with psychotherapy , decreasing financial rewards , limitations on service provision , for example " and those related to the psychologist 's role " repeated exposure to emotionally difficult material , the need for careful maintenance of boundaries with the client , the need to control one 's emotional response in the therapy room , an isolated work environment , and limited control over outcomes , for example . It is hard enough to hear about the often intense emotional pain of the client , but to also actively repress one 's own emotional response , and to have limited ability to ease such pain , can be wearing over time . The responsibility of the psychologist to protect the welfare of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these working conditions have been linked to burnout , which is more common in circumstances that fail to satisfy personal needs , where there is role conflict and ambiguity ( should I call the police or wait for the client to contact me ? ) ; responsibility for people versus things ; limited decision making power ; and upsetting , frustrating or difficult work ( Ackerly , Burnell , Holder and Kurdek , 1988 . ) There are many other examples of the ways in which the person and role of the psychologist may cause stress that are beyond the scope of our purpose here . These may be further explored by going to " " Occupational Vulnerabilities for Psychologists . " <p> Psychologists have an ethical responsibility to remain resilient in the face of such influences , and to know when they need assistance , or other alternatives , in order to remain resilient . They also have a responsibility to know when they can not do so . These responsibilities are a tall order , requiring psychologists to acknowledge their personal limitations , in some cases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for psychologists to acknowledge their own need for assistance at times . They may be uncomfortable in the role of the one who is helped , or they may , with the best of intentions , try to ' tough it out ' regardless of their own well-being . In these circumstances , the psychologist is likely to become distressed . <h> Distress <p> Distress , as discussed here , refers to an experience of intense stress that is unresolved , and therefore distracting and difficult to manage " a psychologist with a chronically suicidal patient , or with a child who is very i 'll , are examples . It may be surprising to learn that over 59 percent of psychologists have reported working when , in their view , they were too distressed to be effective , ( Pope , Tabachnick &amp; Keith-Spiegel , 1987 ) . The distressed psychologist may be ruminative , have obsessive thoughts related to the stress , experience sleep or appetite problems and so on .

To the extent these avenues lead to further problems and distress , the individual may become frankly impaired . <h> Impairment <p> Impairment here refers to a condition that compromises the psychologist 's professional functioning to a degree that may harm the client or render services ineffective " a psychologist who is chronically late or absent for appointments or who has developed a substance abuse problem and provides services while under the influence are examples . Impairment and improper behavior are not synonymous . But impairment implies that the functionality of the professional is compromised . Impairment is a condition for which the individual should certainly seek assistance . The impairment may also impact the awareness of the psychologist however , such that one is unable to recognize the seriousness of one 's condition . In this case , the likelihood of inappropriate , unethical or even illegal behavior is great , and the professional is now a potential threat to those who seek her services . <h> Improper Behavior <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the literature on impairment ( Gabbard , 1991 ) . Although much of the early focus was on sexual improprieties with clients , it has been noted that other improper behaviors " dual relationships and fiscal improprieties , for example " may be at least as damaging ( Schoener , 1995 ) . <p> The modal impaired professional has been described as a middle aged man , in the midst of or following a personal crisis such as a divorce , who gradually erodes the boundaries of the therapeutic relationship in an effort to meet personal needs through the client . Variations on this theme are endless , and this circumstance creates an unsafe , therapeutically ineffective , and potentially abusive condition for the client . <h> Summary <p> The continuum of stress to improper behavior may be thought of as a " slippery slope .

As a therapist you will want to prepare your clients for the fact of conception by anticipating the effect that visible pregnancy might have upon the therapeutic alliance . At the same time , it is important to take appropriate steps to care for yourself . <p> Regardless of theoretical orientation or treatment modality , sound clinical decision making will allow you as a professional psychologist to enjoy your new focus on parenting while attending to the client 's needs throughout the pregnancy ( Fallon , 2003 ) . <h> Planning Ahead Is Good Practice <p> There are personal , professional and business concerns involved as the therapist begins to plan a family .

( Haber , 1992 ) <h> Creating a Comfortable Working Environment During Pregnancy <p> While the psychologist may be accustomed to presenting as a pre-pregnancy model of health and energy , she may be surprised to find this replaced by physical symptoms of nausea and fatigue during her work day . It is important to make adjustments in the work environment by : <p> Communicating with your employer and colleagues about special needs during your pregnancy <p> Attending to the creation of a comfortable and ergonomically supportive office environment , such as pillows or footstools . <p> Paying special attention to maintaining a professional presentation in attire as the pregnancy progresses and becomes visible . ( Futa , 2002 ) . <h> Emotional Self-care During the Pregnancy <p> Pregnancy may stir intense feelings in clients . This may result partially from their feeling intense rivalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and also from viewing their therapist as a sexual being . Observing their visibly pregnant therapist may be the first time clients have even considered that their therapist has a life outside the consulting room ! <p> Such reactions may serve as a catalyst for change in treatment , perhaps helping the clients resolve issues of loss , sibling rivalry or oedipal conflict ( Cullen-Drill , 1994 ) . Further , the reactions may engender discussions regarding the length and course of treatment and perhaps motivate clients to maximize their time in treatment . <p> However , emotional changes in the therapist herself due to hormonal fluctuations of pregnancy , fatigue and a growing sense of vulnerability may reduce her functioning as a therapist . Impending parenthood may also cause emotional changes for male therapists , that could become problematic if left unaddressed ( Guy , 1986 ) . <p> It may be important that the psychologist enter her own psychotherapeutic treatment during this time so that she is able to distinguish her unresolved issues from those of her client . ( This may similarly be the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Objectivity can be difficult to maintain during the heightened sensitivity of pregnancy . Regular supervisory sessions or peer consultation can also be helpful in identifying personal issues and maintaining appropriate boundaries within the therapeutic session . <p> Special challenges in interacting with clients might include : <p> Personality-disordered patients who may vacillate between hostile and affectionate attitudes toward the pregnancy . <p> Female clients with a miscarriage history may experience renewed feelings of loss when the therapist reaches the gestational stage at which the client lost a pregnancy . <p> Jealous patients who view an anticipated maternity leave as abandonment . <h> Parental Leave <p> Careful planning of the maternity or paternity leave will allow the therapist to protect her or his privacy as well as help provide for appropriate continuity of client care . There are important continuity of care considerations and related legal and ethical issues that may be involved with pregnancy and taking leave from professional practice .

This article describes key ratios and indicators to help you begin the process . <p> Some practitioners are more familiar with financial terminology than others . You may find it helpful to consult a glossary of relevant terms as you read this article . And though the subject of finances is tedious for many health professionals , it 's crucial be informed and to monitor the financial pulse of your practice . <p> Begin by gathering your financial statements including balance sheets and income statements for the past three years . Once you have compiled this information : <p> Calculate the financial ratios listed below for each year .

There are many different ratios you can calculate , depending upon your need and the nature of your practice . The main categories and a few examples of each are listed below . <p> You may generate the following ratios on your own , or ask your accountant to calculate them for you . For those who use financial software such as Quicken or Microsoft Money to help manage their bookkeeping , such software can easily calculate some or all of the following indicators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as profit margin ) : Measures your ability to control expenses and tells you how much money you actually keep for each dollar that comes in . For example , a Total Margin of 0.17 indicates that for every dollar of revenue earned , you kept 17 cents . You can improve your Total Margin by increasing rates , reducing costs , or increasing your non-operating revenue . The higher your Total Margin , the better . <p> Total Margin = Net Income / Total Revenue <p> Return on total assets ( ROA ; also known as return on assets ) : Measures how productively you are using your assets to generate revenue by telling you how many cents of profit you generate with each dollar of your assets . A higher ROA means your practice is more productive . <p> ROA = Net Income / Total Assets <h> Liquidity Ratios <p> Current ratio . Measures your ability to pay back your short-term debts by telling you how many dollars you have in current assets for each dollar of current liabilities . A higher current ratio is better ( i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Current Assets / Current Liabilities <p> Days cash on hand .

For example , your may want to invest extra cash in a vehicle that will generate additional income rather than just sitting in your checking account . <h> Debt Management Ratios <p> Debt ratio . Measures the percentage of your practice 's total financing that comes from debt . Creditors prefer a lower debt ratio and will be more likely to give you a loan or a better rate , since it means less risk for them . <p> Debt Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets <p> Debt to equity ratio .

A higher total asset turnover ratio is generally better , although it is important to strike a balance . Having too many assets reduces your profits , but too few may result in not having enough resources to offer needed services or pursue new sources of revenue . <p> Total Asset Turnover = Operating Revenue / Total Assets <p> Days in accounts receivable ( also known as average collection period ) : Measures how effective you are in managing your receivables by telling you the average number of days it takes you to collect a payment .

Practitioners emphasize that it is important for those who are launching an independent practice to become familiar with the business aspects of running a practice . Consult APApractice.org 's Managing a practice section for information on the business issues related to providing psychological services , and the Marketing and building a practice section to learn effective strategies for reaching potential clients and referral sources and developing a practice . <p> Stay connected .

" When you 're part-time and not seeing a lot of professional people , you have to look for opportunities to network , " says Burgess . <p> Control your schedule . Practitioners say time management skills can be critically important for handling part-time employment . <p> Bober , who has two young children , cautions that managing two part-time positions is n't for everyone . " Juggling part-time positions probably works better for certain people 's personalities , " she says . " It helps to know yourself and your strengths and weaknesses . If you 're someone who does n't want to do one thing all the time , it could be really great . But if you 're not that organized and you need big chunks of time to get things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a set up for disaster . " <p> Puri agrees that it is important to maintain control of one 's schedule .

@@101644009 @5844009/ <h> Research Roundup : Transitioning to parenthood <p> This issue focuses on recent research related to romantic relationship satisfaction for couples transitioning to parenthood . <p> By Practice Research &amp; Policy staff <p> Parenthood can be an exciting yet challenging transition for couples . First-time parents must learn how to meet their infant 's needs without ignoring their own , both individually and as a couple . Research shows that during the first years of parenthood , the quality of a couple 's relationship tends to plummet . Marital stress and conflict can affect each partner 's wellbeing and negatively impact the child 's development . <p> The subsequent research summaries attempt to understand this decline in romantic relationships following parenthood by examining previously unexplored moderators and mediators . Specifically , romantic attachment orientation , relationship adjustment following a child 's birth , and the impact of work and household labor hours on the couples ' relationship were analyzed . <p> In addition to reviewing the following research summaries , psychologists are encouraged to explore the literature more completely to determine what may be useful to them in practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of romantic attachment anxiety and avoidance on marital satisfaction in a sample of 192 partners expecting a child for the first time . The study utilized a longitudinal design with five assessment waves that initiated six weeks prior to birth and every six months postpartum .

Results revealed that both anxiously and avoidantly attached individuals had lower marital satisfaction than securely-attached participants . Perceived social support from and negative exchanges with an individual 's partner moderated attachment anxiety and marital satisfaction , particularly for women . A sharper decrease in marital satisfaction was observed in men compared to women if the men reported high levels of attachment anxiety as well as work-family conflict . <p> Decrease in marital satisfaction was also evident in highly avoidant individuals , especially as their perceptions of family demands and work-family conflicts increased . Importantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiously or avoidantly attached also reported less marital satisfaction regardless of their own attachment orientation . 60005 @qwx920005 <p> While romantic attachment and marital satisfaction are related through the duration of a marriage , the findings from this study suggest that for first-time parents , romantic attachment predicts marital satisfaction during the first two years of parenting . Since new parents who are either anxiously or avoidantly attached may be particularly vulnerable to problems in their marital relationship , psychologists may want to focus on individuals in these types of relationships and provide added support ( for example , anticipating change , improving communication and reducing perceived negative interactions ) . <p> First-time mothers who are prone to anxiety seem to be particularly vulnerable to perceived partner 's behavior . It is important to identify these women and address anxiety as well as increase positive experiences with their partner . <p> It is also important to identify and target anxious first-time fathers , particularly if they perceive that work interferes with their family life , as this could hinder marital satisfaction .

Journal of Behavioral Science , 46(1) , 20-28. doi : 10.1037/a0031259 . <h> Summary <p> Bouchard tested whether relationship adjustment and changes in this adjustment following a child 's birth , mediated prebirth insecure romantic attachment and postbirth parenting alliance . The study employed a longitudinal design with 151 partners transitioning into parenthood for the first time . During the third trimester of pregnancy and six months postpartum , participants completed self-report measures on romantic attachment , relationship adjustment and postnatal parenting alliance ( the degree to which individuals believe he/she has a good working relationship with the other parent ) . <p> Paired-sample t tests revealed a significant decline for women but not men in postbirth marital adjustment . However , the level of insecure attachment for men was related to a steeper decline in quality of romantic relationship after a first child 's birth . <p> Regression analyses suggested that insecure romantic attachment prebirth for both males and females was associated with a negative postnatal parenting alliance , partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's birth . Relationship adjustment postbirth was a mediator between prebirth insecure romantic attachment and postbirth parenting alliance " in both males and females . <p> Changes in relationship adjustment did not significantly affect this association in males , although insecurely attached men experienced difficulties in their marital relationship and adjustment to parenthood as well . 60005 @qwx920005 <p> The findings from this study , consistent with previous findings , suggest that the quality of a romantic relationship predicts parenting alliance , thus indicating parenting is not independent of the quality of marital relationship . <p> Couples experiencing poor quality in their romantic relationship may benefit from intervention prior to their child 's birth . Improving the romantic relationship may also improve parenting alliance , which could positively impact the child 's development . The author suggests that a psycho-educational component on changes in marital relationships and adjustments into parenthood could be introduced to existing programs delivered to expecting parents . <p> While pregnant women are often the focus of interventions , fathers-to-be could similarly benefit from targeted programming since they also experience adjustment difficulties . Psychologists may wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provide prebirth support and education in an effort to strengthen existing relationships and prevent future difficulties . <h> Summary <p> Through a British national household survey , Keizer and Schenk selected 689 couples to examine relationship satisfaction during transition to parenthood and the impact of work and household labor hours on the relationship . The study , which collected data from 1996 to 2009 in 12 waves , employed a longitudinal design examining hours spent at work , household labor and relationship satisfaction . A two-level model multivariate analysis revealed that both mothers and fathers reported a decrease in relationship satisfaction after a child 's birth . <p> However , this trend in relationship satisfaction was quadratic . Relationship satisfaction started to increase approximately seven years after the child 's birth . Researchers hypothesized this increase was due to children needing less assistance and mothers being able to spend less time engaging in household labor . <p> For both fathers and mothers , relationship satisfaction was not affected by changes in work hours . However , when men increased their time in household labor , women reported greater relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household labor , men again experienced decreased relationship satisfaction . Overall , these findings were more common in parents than in childless couples , indicating that the effect of a child 's birth on relationship satisfaction extends beyond changes in work hours and household labor . 60005 @qwx920005 <p> Psychologists working with couples transitioning to parenthood should be aware of possible changes in relationship satisfaction . Potential decreases in relationship satisfaction could be normalized for couples in order to identify possible strategies to strengthen the relationship . It is important to identify risk and protective factors , and to implement specific strategies that can prevent a steep decline in relationship satisfaction during the first years of a child 's life . <p> Relationship dissatisfaction in fathers associated with spouses ' household labor needs to be targeted , as men seem more vulnerable in comparison to women . For example , explicitly negotiating household labor so that both partners feel the expectations and divisions are reasonable may be necessary . <p> According to the researchers , it could be possible that when a female increases time spent on household labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend with her partner . This perception of less quality time with their partner could explain why fathers report a decrease in marital satisfaction . If couples can re-negotiate roles and responsibilities , opportunities to increase shared quality time could become more available .

Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state or jurisdiction where the patient will be ? <p> The psychologist 's license to practice does not grant the authority to provide services to patients wherever the patient may be . A psychology license is not like a driver 's license , where an eligible driver obtains a license in his or her state of residence and is permitted to drive anywhere throughout the U.S. using that license . To the contrary , the psychology license only permits the psychologist to practice in the state or jurisdiction that issued the license . <h> Rules vary from state to state <p> Licensing boards , charged with the mission of protecting the public health and safety , take the position that the delivery of health services occurs where the patient is , rather than where the provider is .

In order for the PSYPACT to take effect , legislatures in at least seven states must approve the model language ( PDF , 138KB ) without modification . Arizona was the first state to enact PSYPACT in May 2016 . The Practice Organization anticipates that once PSYPACT is enacted in at least seven states , licensed psychologists in good standing from a state participating in PSYPACT would be able to practice in-person temporarily , or virtually , in all other states that are parties to the compact . <p> In the meantime , psychologists must carefully consider all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdiction . <p> Practice Organization members who have questions about telehealth practices can contact the Office of Legal and Regulatory Affairs by email or by phone at ( 202 ) 336-5886 . <p> Note : The Practice Organization can not give members legal opinions or legal advice .

@@101644011 @5844011/ <p> In several key respects , the task force adopted suggestions or responded to concerns from the Practice Organization on how to advance enforcement of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act ( MHPAEA ) . The law requires insurance companies providing coverage for mental and behavioral health treatment to ensure that that coverage is comparable to coverage for physical health treatment . <p> However , with the election of Donald Trump to the presidency , it is difficult to say whether recommendations from the task force , which was established by President Barack Obama in March , will be implemented . In fact , if Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , one of Trump 's priorities during his first 100 days in office , parity protections extended by the ACA may be eliminated immediately or over time . <p> The ACA expanded the reach of MHPAEA primarily by creating health insurance exchanges ( HIXs ) . Plans sold through the exchanges were required to comply with the MHPAEA and provide mental health and substance abuse disorder services . The creation of the exchanges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were under plans without mental health coverage , or were covered by small employer or individual insurance plans that were exempt from MHPAEA . <p> The Practice Organization 's government relations staff have received indications that Congress will vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act before Trump 's first State of the Union Address takes place . The health care exchanges would remain in place for a few years while Congress and the Trump administration develop whatever would replace the ACA . <p> If the ACA is repealed , the Practice Organization will urge Congress to include mental health parity provisions that cover all health insurance plans in any legislation proposed to replace the ACA , and to maintain parity in the exchange plans during the transition period . The Practice Organization will also push for implementation of the task force 's recommendations in the new administration . <h> Task force seeks to increase plan disclosures and audits <p> One of the task force 's recommendations addresses health care providers ' access to information on an insurance plan 's limits on medical and surgical benefits . Having that information available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan is applying comparable constraints to medical care . As the Practice Organization pointed out in its Aug. 31 , 2016 , comment letter ( PDF , 433KB ) to the task force , that information has been difficult to access , but is essential to determining whether there is a parity violation . <p> The task force has recommended that Congress clarify requirements regarding benefits disclosure for all health plans . The task force also called for the development of simpler and more standardized disclosure tools . <p> Responding to the Practice Organization 's longstanding concerns about enforcement and transparency of enforcement , the task force announced in the report that the Department of Labor ( DOL ) will release annual data on closed federal parity investigations , and recommends that DOL have the power to levy civil monetary penalties . <p> To bolster state enforcement , the task force announced that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) will award $9.3 million to state agencies to help insurance regulators enforce the parity law . Federal agencies should also have additional funding added to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and increase the number of health plan audits that agencies can perform . <p> The task force 's report includes many other recommendations that expand the parity law and its principles to TRICARE , Medicare and Medicaid plans . <p> Additional information on the MHPAEA is available on the Practice Central webpage .

@@101644024 @5844024/ <h> How to deal with a subpoena <p> Answers to common questions about subpoenas that psychologists raise with the APA Practice Organization <p> by Legal and Regulatory Affairs Staff <p> December 17 , 2008 " Receiving a subpoena , a legal command to testify ( referred to as a subpoena or subpoena ad testificandum ) or to turn over records ( referred to as a subpoena duces tecum ) , is often a perplexing and anxiety-provoking experience for psychologists . <p> This article addresses many common questions about subpoenas that psychologists raise with the APA Practice Organization . The content pertains to subpoenas involving psychotherapy notes , process notes , client information forms , billing records and other such information . This article does not address psychological test material , which may be subject to additional ethical considerations . <p> The information here is not intended to provide legal advice or to substitute for the advice of an attorney , but rather to offer information about possibilities for dealing with a subpoena . Where further guidance is needed , psychologists may find it useful to consult with their malpractice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs department or a state psychological association representative . <p> 1 . I just received a subpoena . What do I do ? <p> You must first understand what the document is requesting of you . Subpoenas often seem to be asking you to testify in person , when they in fact are just seeking documents . Know who you are supposed to deliver documents to , or where and when are you supposed to appear to testify . Also be sure you 're clear about the applicable due date . <p> 2 . I intend to comply with the subpoena . Should I just turn over the documents or show up to testify , or do I first need my client 's written consent ? <p> Turn over the information only if your subpoena qualifies as a court order . In most states , you can turn over the documents or show up to testify without obtaining your client 's consent only if the subpoena you received qualifies as a court order from a judge , which is rare . Typically a court order will be identified as such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be signed by a judge , not a judge 's clerk or an attorney . If you are not sure whether the document is a court order , you may contact the court that issued the document and ask to speak to the judge 's clerk . <p> If you do n't have a court order , obtain your client 's written consent or authorization . If the document is not a court order ( the first subpoena you receive in a matter rarely is a court order ) , you will need to obtain your client 's consent or authorization before turning over confidential information . This step is required because most state and federal jurisdictions recognize a psychotherapist-patient privilege that allows the client to prevent confidential material from being disclosed to others . ( Some state laws provide exceptions to this rule that allow you to turn over confidential information without the client 's consent or authorization in certain situations . ) When obtaining this consent , you should tell your client exactly what you have been asked to turn over and that there is no guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are not covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) Privacy Rule , your state may require client consent to be in writing . Staff attorneys for the APA Practice Organization suggest that everyone obtain a client 's consent in writing , even if it is not required in your state . This will help ensure that your client is making an informed consent and will provide you with documentation in case you need it in the future . <p> The written consent that you obtain from your client should contain , at a minimum : <p> Exactly what information will be disclosed <p> To whom the information will be disclosed ( for example , to the requesting attorney ) <p> The purpose of the disclosure ( to respond to a subpoena ) <p> The client 's signature and date <p> If you are covered by the HIPAA Privacy Rule , you must have a " written authorization " that includes several specific items . The APA Practice Organization suggests that you obtain legal guidance in this area . A model form tailored to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the HIPAA Privacy Rule compliance product prepared by the APA Practice Organization and the APA Insurance Trust . ( Visit APApractice.org for additional information about this product . ) <p> Talk to your client 's attorney . It is also important that you discuss the subpoena with the client 's attorney ( if he or she has one ) after you have received appropriate consent from the client to do so . You should find out whether the attorney intends to oppose or seek to limit the scope of the subpoena , as discussed in the answers to Questions 4 and 5 . <p> 3 . Who gives the written consent if the client is a child ? <p> In situations where the client is a child or is otherwise legally incapable of consenting , you will have to obtain the consent or authorization from the client 's parents or legal guardian , although some state laws provide independent privilege rights for minors . Sometimes it is complicated to determine who has authority to consent , especially in child custody cases . If it is unclear who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain additional guidance , such as from your malpractice insurer or an attorney in your state . <p> 4 . What if I do n't have a court order and the client refuses to give me the consent or authorization or I ca n't reach the client ? <p> As discussed below , when you can not get the client 's consent or authorization , it usually makes sense to contact the party requesting the information to try to resolve the issue . If that does not work , then you could seek guidance from the judge who has jurisdiction over the subpoena . Each state has its own rules , however , and the APA Practice Organization is unable to provide guidance that works for every state and every situation . If the options below do not fit your circumstances , you should seek additional guidance from your own attorney or other appropriate source . <p> Option 1 . Tell the requesting attorney that you can not release confidential information without consent or authorization . <p> In most situations , an appropriate first step is to contact the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidential information without the client 's consent or authorization . It is important that , when making this contact , you do not reveal that you have ever treated the client , as many states take the position that the fact of treating a client is protected information . In your letter or e-mail to the attorney , you might indicate that you can not say whether you have provided treatment to the person named in the subpoena , but if you had , then you could not ethically release such information without an order from a judge or an authorization from the client , neither of which you have . In many cases , the attorney will try to address the problem by seeking a court order or trying to obtain the client 's authorization . In some situations , the attorney may decide not to pursue the request for confidential information . <p> Option 2 . Seek guidance from the judge with jurisdiction over the subpoena . <p> The attorney may disagree with your assertion that you can not disclose the information , or otherwise insist that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek guidance from the court . You or your attorney could call the court , stating that you wish to comply with the law but that you are ethically obligated not to produce confidential records or to testify about them , including whether someone is a client of yours , unless compelled to do so by the court or with the consent of the client . You could then ask the court for guidance . Be sure to confirm any guidance received in writing , with copies to attorneys for both sides . If you can not reach the court by phone , you can contact the court in writing . <p> Option 3 . File a motion to quash the subpoena . <p> If you seek guidance from the court and get no response , you may need to work with an attorney to file a motion to quash the subpoena . A motion to quash is a formal request to the court that the subpoena be declared invalid or otherwise without legal force . <p> If the client has refused to authorize you to disclose the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would relieve you of paying the costs related to such a filing . While working with the client 's attorney ( after receiving the necessary authorizations from your client ) is usually advisable , keep in mind that your client 's attorney does not represent you and that your interest and the client 's interests may not be the same , especially as the proceedings evolve . Moreover , if you have an obligation to the court , and the client 's attorney fails to contact the court or file a motion to quash in a timely manner , you may be subject to the consequences of failing to respond . Thus , while working with the client 's attorney , it is important that you stay apprised of your own legal obligations and deadlines . <p> 5 . What if I think disclosure will harm my client or a third party ? <p> There are several options to limit disclosure in such cases . In most cases , these options will be pursued by the client 's attorney . APA staff attorneys suggest that you discuss these options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . Be sure to confirm any agreement with the requestor in writing , with copies to all parties . If the requestor refuses to agree to any of these options , you may need to seek a ruling from the court . <p> See if the requestor will accept limited information . The requestor may agree that information about third parties ( such as spouses ) does not need to be disclosed . Requestors may also decide that they only need information to confirm that sessions took place , and not information that would disclose the purpose of the sessions or their content . The type of information that could fall into this category may include dates of sessions , amount of payment , the fact of payment or insurance company billed . <p> See if the requestor will agree to restrict who sees the information or how it is used . The person requesting the information may agree not to release the information to the public and/or to use the information only for purposes of the litigation and return it after the litigation is over . <p> Ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclosed . You could also ask the court through in camera inspection - a review by the judge in chambers - to determine whether the client records are really relevant to the issues before the court and need to be disclosed at all . <p> 6 . What if I do n't want to comply with the request because I think it is too burdensome ? <p> Sometimes psychologists may not want to comply with a subpoena because doing so will take an inordinate amount of time away from their practice . In such cases , you may consider filing a motion with the court to deny or limit the demand because it is unduly burdensome . ( Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45c1-3 requires that the party responsible for issuing the subpoena take reasonable steps to avoid imposing an undue burden or expense on the person subject to the subpoena . ) <p> You may also want to check whether the subpoena you received is invalid , which would allow you not to comply . There are several technical reasons why a subpoena may be invalid . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subpoena was not furnished to you in a manner that complies with the court 's rules , or the subpoena does not give you enough time to file a motion to oppose it . You will likely need to seek legal guidance to determine whether any of these situations applies . <p> 7 . I am unwilling to comply with the subpoena in the timeframe requested . What can I do ? <p> Assuming you have your client 's authorization to release the information requested , you can discuss the timeframe with the person requesting the information and see if the date may be changed . If the person will not negotiate on that point , you should determine whether the timeframe given in the subpoena complies with the requirements for your area . Jurisdictions vary in terms of the time that a person must be given to reply to a subpoena for testimony or documents . Some permit only five days , while others may provide 30 days . In making this determination , consider checking the Web site of the court listed in the subpoena , contacting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 . Can I just ignore a subpoena , especially if it 's not signed by a judge ? <p> No . You can not ignore a subpoena , even if it has not been signed by a judge . Most subpoenas are not signed by judges , but rather by the attorney who is seeking the documents or testimony . Nevertheless , you must respond in writing , as discussed above . Failure to do so could result in your being held in contempt of court and having to pay significant fines . <p> Further guidance on this topic can be found in " Strategies for Private Practitioners Coping with Subpoenas or Compelled Testimony for Client Records or Test Data , " prepared by the APA 's Committee on Legal Issues ( COLI ) .

In most cases , a health care provider would have 60 days from discovery to notify patients about the breach . <p> An unusual aspect of this " interim final " rule is reflected in its name : Although the Rule goes into effect on September 23 , HHS is seeking comments on it until October 23 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HHS was required to issue the interim final as a result of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health ( HITECH ) Act signed into law in February 2009 . <p> The American Psychological Association ( APA ) Practice Directorate plans to submit comments to HHS regarding unique concerns of psychologists and their patients related to this Rule . <p> We are aware of only isolated instances of breaches of PHI affecting practicing psychologists . However , the Rule will provide helpful guidance if your practice experiences this misfortune . The primary thrust of the Rule is consistent with how most psychologists respond to a breach " by notifying affected patients . <p> This article answers basic questions about when a breach occurs and how you as a psychologist should give notice of a breach . In the latter portion , we include answers to more specific questions that may arise , such as what to do if a breach affects the records of a minor patient . While the Rule also applies to business associates under HIPAA , for example , a billing service or accountant who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a psychologist covered by HIPAA . <p> It is important to remember that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure : The most important thing to do in your practice is to follow good security and privacy practices , for example , by complying with the HIPAA Privacy Security Rules and by considering recommendations in the 2007 Record Keeping Guidelines adopted by APA . Taking these steps will minimize your risk of suffering a breach that must be reported . <h> What is a breach ? <p> The new Rule defines a breach as : <p> The acquisition , access , use or disclosure of PHI <p> That violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule <p> Involving PHI that has not been " secured " ( by HHS-approved encryption or other technologies that make the PHI unusable to unauthorized users ) <p> That compromises the security or privacy of PHI by posing a significant risk of financial , reputational , or other harm to the patient . <p> Because the last prong " significant risk of harm to the patient " is a critical part of the breach definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breach should be to assess that risk . <p> For example , if you are consulting with another psychologist and or your assistant accidentally sends information on the wrong patient , the chance of significant harm is reduced by the fact that the other psychologist has legal and ethical obligations to protect the privacy of the information sent accidentally . The risk is further reduced if you promptly alert your fellow psychologist to the mistake and she/he assures you that the information has been properly destroyed or deleted . Because there is no significant risk of harm in this scenario , this would not qualify as a " breach " for which you must give notice . Conversely , if you learn that someone has hacked into your practice 's electronic records or broken into your paper files , that could pose a significant risk to the privacy of your patients . <h> What Is Protected Health Information , or PHI ? <p> The HIPAA Privacy Rule defines PHI as : <p> Information that relates to : the past , present or future physical or mental health condition of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past , present , or future payment for the patient 's health care ; <p> That identifies the patient or could reasonably be used to identify the patient ; and <p> That is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium . <p> Health information is not considered PHI if it does not identify a patient and provides no reasonable basis for identifying a patient . <h> What Is Secured PHI ? <p> The Rule defines secured PHI as PHI that is rendered unusable , unreadable or indecipherable to unauthorized users . To make PHI secure , you must use a technology or methodology specified by HHS on its Web site : www.hhs.gov . <p> The most common means for psychologists to secure PHI will be by HHS-approved methods of encrypting electronic records and methods of destroying paper and electronic PHI . Once PHI has been secured by an approved method , no breach notice is required if the information is improperly accessed or disclosed because the assumption is that the PHI will be unreadable . <h> What Must You Do If You Determine There Has Been a Breach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient affected of a breach without unreasonable delay and within 60 days after " discovery . " A breach is " discovered " on the first day that you know ( or reasonably should have been known ) of the breach . You are also deemed to discover a breach on the first day that any employee , officer or other agent of your practice ( other than the person who committed the breach ) knows about the breach . <p> The notice must be in plain language that a patient can understand . It should provide the following information : <p> a brief description of the breach , including dates <p> a description of types of unsecured PHI involved <p> the steps the individual should take to protect against potential harm a brief description of steps you have taken to investigate the incident , mitigate harm and protect against further breaches ; and <p> your contact information . <p> If you do not have all of the above information when you first need to send notice , you can provide a series of notices that fill in the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must provide written notice to the patient at the last known address of the patient by first-class mail . Alternatively , you can contact your patients by e-mail if they have indicated that this is the preferred manner of contact . <p> A breach notice could alert a patient 's spouse or other family members to the fact that the patient is receiving mental health treatment even though the patient did not want this fact disclosed to family members . To help minimize this possibility , it is advisable to discuss with patients the mail or e-mail address where they would prefer to be contacted in the unlikely event that you have to send a breach notice . We plan to raise such privacy issues related to breach notices in our comments to HHS regarding this Rule . <p> Notice to HHS For breaches affecting fewer than 500 patients , you must keep a log of those breaches during the year and then provide notice to HHS of all breaches during the calendar year , within 60 days after that year ends . HHS will specify how to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Questions That May Arise <p> What If the Breach Involves the PHI of Minors , Incapacitated Patients and Deceased Patients ? Where the breach involves the PHI of minors , incapacitated patients and deceased persons , you may send the notice to their personal representatives , for example , the parent or guardian of a minor or the executor of deceased patient 's estate . If the patient is deceased and you have the address of his/her next of kin or personal representative , you must send notice by first-class mail to either the next of kin or the personal representative . <p> What If You Have Inadequate Contact Information to Send Notice to Some Patients ? If you have insufficient or out-of-date contact information that prevents you from providing mail or e-mail notice , and you have fewer than 10 affected patients with this issue , you can provide substitute notice by telephone or other means reasonably likely to reach the patient . <p> If there are more than 10 affected patients for whom you have insufficient or out-of-date contact information , you must give substitute notice by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website or by a conspicuous notice in a major print or broadcast media in the area where your patients reside . You must also list a toll-free phone number that will remain active for 90 days so patients can call to see if the breach affected their PHI . <p> Should I Contact My Professional Liability Carrier ? While not required by the Rule , it may be advisable to contact your professional liability insurer for risk management advice about a breach , especially if the breach involves many patients or was arguably the result of failing to follow good privacy and security practices . <p> What Notice Must I Give for Breaches Affecting More Than 500 Patients ? For such large breaches , there are more complicated notice requirements , including immediate notice to HHS and notices to major media outlets in the area . Contact our office ( see information at the end of this article ) for further details . <p> Can You Also Contact Patients by Phone If There Is an Imminent Risk That Their PHI Will Be Misused ?

According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , E/M services are medical in nature and therefore may not be furnished by psychologists or social workers . CMS 's view , however , is outdated and does not reflect how widely psychology is now integrated with total patient health care . More and more of the work done by psychologists includes E/M services , especially in rural areas where patients being treated with psychotherapy may also be taking psychotropic medications prescribed by their primary care physicians . <p> CMS tracks services furnished by all health care professionals through the use of the Current Procedural Terminology ( CPT ) coding system .

CMS imposed this reduction in order to offset the increase in payment for E/M services . Psychologists suffered more than most other health care professionals because their services are work-intensive and they can not recoup any of these losses through the increase for E/M . It is inequitable to require psychologists to fund higher payments for E/M codes that they can not use .

Access to the E/M codes allows them to more accurately capture the work that they provide and the complexity of the patients that they see . <h> Medicare will have more accurate information about services <p> Psychotherapy , psychological testing , and health and behavior services now account for the majority of Medicare billing by psychologists . Nonetheless , in circumstances when a psychologist 's work is more appropriately defined as E/M , the psychologist should be permitted to bill for the service that he has provided to a Medicare beneficiary .

The psychologist conducts a psychiatric diagnostic interview ( CPT 90801 ) . This code can typically be used just once in a specified time period , usually six months to one year . Although the psychologist will spend considerable time reassessing the patient and generating reports for each of the physicians , the only service he can bill for is that initial interview . If , however , a psychiatrist is asked by another physician for a consultation , an inpatient E/M consultation code could be reported for the consultation services provided subsequent to the initial psychiatric diagnostic interview . A key requirement for using an E/M consultation code is that one health care professional , typically a physician , must first submit a documented request for a consultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide the requesting professional with a written report . <p> Example #2 " Psychotherapy with evaluation and management <p> A psychologist treats a patient for depression . The patient is taking psychotropic medication prescribed by his primary care physician . That physician asks the psychologist to monitor the patient 's progress and alert the physician to any side effects of the medication . It is not unusual , especially outside of major metropolitan areas , for this type of professional interaction to occur . This visit should be billed using a CPT code for psychotherapy with E/M , but Medicare limits the psychologist to billing only for the time spent on psychotherapy . The time spent by the psychologist monitoring the patient 's progress on medication , a critical element of psychotherapy with E/M , is not accounted for . <p> Example #3 " Nursing care services <p> A psychologist provides ongoing services to a nursing home resident suffering from Alzheimer 's disease .

Because the patient is abusive toward other residents and the nursing facility staff he is placed on psychotropic medication . The psychologist , as allowed under his state license , monitors the patient 's reaction to the medication and works with the staff to develop behavioral interventions that they can use when the patient acts out . Because Medicare prevents the psychologist from using the E/M codes , he does not have a way to report the time he spends with the patient and working with the nursing facility staff . A physician providing the same services could bill an E/M code for nursing facility services that include reviewing the patient 's status as well as counseling and coordination of care . The code used would reflect the complexity of the case , taking into account factors such as the status of the patient ( e.g. , stable , not responding to treatment , or experiencing a new complication ) .

@@101644101 @5844101/ <h> Intervening With an Impaired Colleague <p> By Michael F. O'Connor , Ph.D. , with the assistance of the members of the APA Board of Professional Affairs Advisory Committee on Colleague Assistance . <p> One of the most difficult challenges a psychologist can face is how to proceed when a colleague appears to be impaired and/or is acting in an unethical manner . Pope ( 1994 ) reported that receiving evidence of a colleague 's sexual involvement with a client , for example , was one of the most stressful professional events for psychologists . <h> Why So Stressful ? <p> Concern about harm to clients or students , for whom and about whom psychologists often care deeply , can be very disturbing . <p> Personal failings are not often discussed in professional forums , fostering the myth that people who are impaired are a different breed of psychologist , and fostering denial about the real risks and occupational hazards , for the professional , even the colleague we had lunch with last week . <p> In the therapy room , a psychologist 's personal concerns or problems are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the client . This ethic of " other 's welfare first " is fundamental to the passionate drive of many psychologists to do good in the world " in part by being personally above reproach . Impairment in a colleague is therefore threatening at a personal level , and may cast the concerned psychologist into an uncomfortable and unfamiliar role . <p> Professional activities often entail playing the role of social observer and commentator , whether as an academic or practitioner " someone outside the fray and therefore capable of assistance " intellectual or emotional " to others . Evidence that psychologists are all too human can feel personally threatening . <p> Psychologists tend to value independence of thought and action , making atypical versus inappropriate behavior more difficult to discern in many cases . A desire to see the best in people , and to give others the benefit of the doubt , can also be problematic . <p> Excellence is a prominent goal in all aspects of a psychologist 's work , and it is the expectation of the consumer , as well . Consequently , impairment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleague . <p> In many instances , psychologists are constrained from acting as a result of regulations protecting the confidentiality of those who use their services . <p> Psychologists may be concerned about how impairment reflects on the profession to which they belong . <p> Psychologists often work in isolation , or without direct supervision , making determination of ethical violations difficult . <p> The concerned psychologist colleague also may fear being misunderstood , maligned or retaliated against in some way . There are potential professional and legal risks , and the risk that the impaired colleague may act irrationally or attempt to disrupt the psychologist 's practice , for example . <p> There may be concern about the most effective way to approach the colleague . <p> These and other factors may result in an avoidance of action , whether intentional or by default . Professionally , this lack of action is not acceptable . Pragmatically , it is not smart . Psychologists can and do harm those they serve at times , and preventing or halting such behavior quickly can be extremely important . <h> Ethical Responsibilities <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychologist is thought to be impaired . Impairment , in this context , refers to " impairment of ability to practice according to acceptable and prevailing standards of care " ( Ohio Administrative Code . ) Impairment therefore refers to circumstances where professional ability is compromised , and may negatively impact the delivery of professional services by the psychologist . <p> Impairment , while heightening the risk for ethical violations , does not infer such violations . Nonetheless , psychologists are also responsible to ensure that they are competent to provide the services they offer . Impairment , as defined here , compromises the functioning of the psychologist , and should therefore imply a need for close scrutiny of job-related performance in order to preempt ethical violations . The following sections of the American Psychological Association Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct ( APA ethics code draft , October 21 , 2001 ) pertain to this circumstance : <h> Regarding Responsibilities of the Distressed or Impaired Psychologist : <p> Section 2.01 of the code , " Boundaries of Competence " requires psychologists to practice within the limits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Personal Problems and Conflicts " states : <p> a ) " Psychologists refrain from undertaking an activity when they know or should know that there is a substantial likelihood that their personal problems will prevent them from performing their work-related activities in a competent manner . " <p> b ) " When psychologists become aware of personal problems that may interfere with their performing work-related activities adequately , they take appropriate measures , such as obtaining professional consultation or assistance , and determine whether they should limit , suspend or terminate their work-related duties . " <h> Regarding Responsibilities of the Concerned Colleague : <p> " When psychologists believe that there may have been an ethical violation by another psychologist , they attempt to resolve the issue by bringing it to the attention of that individual , if an informal resolution appears appropriate and the intervention does not violate any confidentiality rights that may be involved . <p> Section 1.05 of the code , " Reporting Ethical Violations , " states : <p> " If the apparent ethical violation has substantially harmed or is likely to harm a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standard 1.04 or is not resolved properly in that fashion , psychologists take further action appropriate to the situation . Such action might include referral to state or national committees on professional ethics , to state licensing boards , or to the appropriate institutional authorities . This standard does not apply when an intervention would violate confidentiality rights or when psychologists have been retained to review the work of another psychologist whose professional conduct is in question . " <p> These ethical guidelines are clear in requiring that action be taken by the impaired psychologist and/or by their colleagues in a situation where ethical violations are thought to have occurred . Decisions about the manner of action are largely left to the psychologist to determine . Determination of whether or not an ethical violation is " appropriate " for " informal resolution " , for example , is the psychologist 's responsibility . Likewise , whether or not an ethical violation is " resolved properly " is also to be determined by the psychologist colleague . These circumstances will require a judgment call . A focus on the suspected professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , will therefore be more useful . Because such decisions may have serious consequences , consultation with peers or experts in practice , ethics or the law will often be wise . These options are further discussed below . <h> A Model for Intervention <p> VandenBos and Duthie ( 1986 ) have outlined a six-step process for confronting and supporting distressed colleagues . Their work is reviewed and augmented below . <p> 1 ) Evaluate the information <p> This step involves collecting and evaluating information related to the colleague 's behaviors of concern . The authors suggest making a list of " behaviors and events " that are of concern , as well as the meaning of these occurrences to you . They also suggest that observed occurrences are more persuasive in discussion , than are reports by third parties . Further , you may desire or need more information , which could entail conversations with other colleagues , or consultation with " experts " in the profession to determine the seriousness and correct course of action in the circumstances . <p> 2 ) Decide who should confront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate level of intervention with the impaired colleague . The authors note that those closest to the individual may be the most effective , but there are situations " where there is already conflict , for example " that would make a third party more likely to succeed . The option of a group intervention is offered , perhaps more useful in cases where the individual in question is highly resistant or in denial . In circumstances where professional services to the public are seriously impacted , a supervisor may be the most appropriate to intervene . <p> The authors also note that in situations where there is an imbalance of power , particularly where the impaired colleague is a supervisor or boss , precautions should be taken . They argue that in this case , the concerned psychologist should approach an individual who is equal in power to the colleague . Because a supervisee is inherently vulnerable to a negative reaction from their supervisor , this kind of intervention should be avoided . A supervisor , on the other hand , may engender more defensiveness on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be less threatening , in some cases . Nonetheless , supervisors do have ethical and in some cases legal responsibilities in these situations , that should not be ignored . <p> 3 ) Prepare before the meeting <p> Here , the authors advise concerned colleagues to organize themselves before approaching an impaired colleague . Making a list of the two to three issues of greatest concern , looking for patterns in behavior that can be identified , and dealing ahead of time with one 's own emotions towards the colleague and the task , will be helpful . Again , consultation with peers or experts may be a good idea . It is important to be prepared to acknowledge any biases one might have , as otherwise they may be used by the colleague to deny the validity of your claims . <p> The authors further advise that the inherent " dual role " in the situation " being both a colleague and an interventionist ( authority ) " be anticipated and acknowledged , in that one will need to pursue other alternatives if an informal resolution to this problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also underlines the seriousness of the circumstances . <p> One should attempt to evaluate the social aspects of the circumstances as well . If a man is approaching a woman , or a minority group member is approaching a supervisor , negative biases or motivations may be suspected by either party , whether or not they occur . The psychologist who will intervene would do well to anticipate these kinds of problems so that they can be addressed openly , and will not distract from the matter at hand . <p> 4 ) Consider how you will approach your colleague <p> The authors advise that one use simple sentences and " stick to specifics " when first broaching the topic with an impaired colleague . Describe the evidence and why it is important . Empathy and compassion is essential but must be balanced with clarity and facts . Acknowledging the difficulty of the conversation and the likely feelings of the colleague will be useful , as will an expressed expectation that the colleague will surely want to correct these problems . Naturally , a judgmental or patronizing attitude will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once the case is made , the psychologist should be prepared to listen compassionately and to consider any additional evidence the colleague may present . <p> The authors advise that one should be prepared to admit that you may be in error , but you should also ask for explanations of discrepancies or evasions . Acknowledging the likely discomfort of the colleague will be helpful , as will reminding him or her that you wish to help . <p> Many of the skills of a good therapist will be useful in this phase , but it is important to remember that you are not acting in the role of a therapist . One must attempt to maintain a focus on the concerns presented , and to lead the discussion to a course of ameliorative action . In this way , the intervention may feel and proceed more like a crisis intervention , with abbreviated goals and objectives , identification of resources , and a resulting plan . The authors suggest that one summarize the options and action plan , and make a date for follow-up . Again , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take further action , if an informal resolution plan is not enacted . <p> 6 ) Follow-up <p> Here , the authors suggest that one document the meeting and any agreement reached with the impaired colleague , at least briefly . These notes will provide future reference for contact with the colleague , and in the event that the colleague 's behavior deteriorates further , will provide documentation for contact with an ethics board or other authority . One should also be clear about the timing of a scheduled follow-up meeting . That meeting , like the initial intervention , should focus on specifics . It is important that goals and objectives in the plan be discussed directly , and that while remaining empathically flexible , one does not avoid setting limits , if errant behaviors have not been corrected . <h> Additional Considerations <p> Confidentiality <p> The APA Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct requires that confidentiality rights be observed in proceeding with a complaint with or against a psychologist . Confidentiality rights prevent a psychologist from sharing information , gained in a confidential setting , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even the police in many circumstances . So information received in a client psychotherapy session , or in a confidential session with a supervisee , for example , may not be shared without the source 's expressed consent . Informed consent rules in this case are also likely to apply , meaning that the source must be apprised of risks associated with disclosure of this information to a third party . A client , for example , should be notified of the likely consequences of proceeding with a complaint against a psychologist . In many instances , the client will be the only one allowed to file such a complaint , if it pertains to actions that they have witnessed or experienced , as complaints from third parties will often not be accepted by governing boards . It should be noted that states vary in their reporting requirements , and that other regulations may supercede the rule of confidentiality , such as child and elder abuse reporting , or Tarasoff requirements , for example . It is important for the psychologist to become familiar with the applicable regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is obvious that certain circumstances may be too risky to allow . Such conditions as abuse of clients , criminal behavior or suicidality may preclude a stepwise progression of intervention , as outlined above . These circumstances constitute an inappropriate context for informal resolution , and more direct and immediate action should be taken , in some cases by the authorities . As with psychotherapy clients , it may be important in some instances to act to protect safety first , and ask questions later . Individuals who are impaired , in particular by substances or mental illness , are at heightened risk for suicide . It should be also be noted that male psychologists were reported by OSHA to have the highest rate of suicide for any profession ( Ukens , 1995 ) . The moment of intervention may be one of the most painful for a professional who is in trouble . It is important to be aware that this individual may therefore be at significant risk for harm to self or others . <p> The psychologist colleague is at potential risk for intervening , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present risk of violence , retaliation or other threat . They may act to negatively impact one 's reputation or practice . They may also choose to sue . These risks should not be ignored , but they do not preclude a psychologist 's ethical responsibilities . Such circumstances should be carefully evaluated . It may be more appropriate to advocate a family intervention , to hold a group intervention or to call for intervention by the authorities , in some cases . Again , consultation may be helpful in determining the best course of action . <p> Consultation <p> It should be clear by now that consultation " with peers , supervisors and/or experts " is invaluable in the process of intervening with an impaired colleague . Consultation refers both to trusted colleagues , and to local or national experts in the circumstances of concern . Ethics consultation can occur at the local level through the local county psychological association , or at the state level through one 's state psychological association . Ethics committees and psychology boards will often provide anonymous consultation , meaning that the impaired individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information on ethical and legal questions , and in some cases a perspective on the likely trend in a particular situation . <p> Consultation can provide a sounding board for one 's concerns , can offer help with the interpretation of behaviors , and can provide support for strategizing and for the task of intervention . Rehashing an intervention with appropriate others can help discharge any residual tension and reassure that one has acted reasonably . It can also point out mistakes and provide corrective direction . Psychologists may tend toward the independent , but collegial support is good for everyone , not just the impaired . Those who intervene should be careful to manage the information they gather judiciously however , so that the colleague does not become the object of gossip in the professional community . <p> Power and Politics <p> As VandenBos and Duthie have noted , power differentials can impact both the likely success and ramifications of an intervention . In highly power-discrepant or complicated situations , these considerations may be very important . It is not reasonable to expect a student to confront a dissertation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a confused client to confront a venerable therapist . The least powerful in these " onedown " relationships are unlikely to be successful in an intervention , and run significant risk of political , professional or personal harm ( VandenBos and Duthie , 1986 ) . Likewise , being in a position of power may engender suspicion and defensiveness on the part of the impaired psychologist . In some cases , it may be preferable to initiate discussion of concerns with an impaired psychologist through a peer-level colleague , or a nonsupervising staff member . The political climate and interpersonal relations among these individuals should be carefully assessed , to the extent possible . Peers who have a history of competitiveness with each other , or those with a simmering conflict , are obviously not good candidates to direct a successful intervention . When Intervention Succeeds If the colleague in question accepts the proposal that they are not functioning adequately , it is important that they be supported in the process of correcting the problem . This may or may not fall to the psychologist who has brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , this individual will likely need or benefit from additional interventions via supervision , psychotherapy , group work , education and so on . It may be appropriate for the individual to cut back or take a break from work for a time . It makes sense for this plan to be established conjointly with a colleague , supervisor , therapist or other who can help the individual to cover all necessary bases . Isolation and denial can continue to be a problem otherwise . A focus on maintaining or establishing regular , supportive contact with others , a balanced life and a plan for specific problems should be enacted . Established self-care strategies can be very helpful ( see below ) . <p> Psychotherapy <p> The need for psychotherapy is indicated when an individual is unable to evaluate or correct their functioning through self-care . The benefit of support during such efforts is crucial , and a characteristic of most therapies . Evidence suggests that psychologists prefer psychodynamic therapy for personal work , perhaps because techniques are not as valuable personally as is a strong and supportive alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impaired psychologist is not moved to appropriate action following an intervention , there is the option to try again with a different strategy . One can also move up the chain of command for advisement or control as necessary . It is important that the issue not be dropped , however . The best time to intervene with the impaired psychologist is before harm is done . As noted previously , if efforts to encourage change in the impaired professional fail , it may be time to move to more formal means , such as contacting the local ethics committee or state board of psychology . One should be aware that ethics committees may be more supportive of the impaired psychologist than a psychology board . The psychology boards ' primary role is to protect the public , and they may be less concerned with the welfare of the impaired psychologist . Nonetheless , egregious ethical failures and potentially dangerous conditions should be addressed to the appropriate authorities quickly in such cases , before more harm occurs . <p> Prevention <p> Strategies that prevent the onset of impairment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact . Self-care strategies have been proposed that seek to ensure resilience in the face of the occupational and personal life hazards all psychologists face to a greater or lesser degree . Psychologists should understand that all psychologists may be vulnerable to impairment in the right circumstance . This is not a problem that affects only a limited group of sub-par professionals . There is also evidence that the profession of psychology may inadvertently select for people who are prone to certain kinds of risk ( O'Connor , 2001 ) . <p> Self-care <p> The APA Board of Professional Affairs Advisory Committee on Colleague Assistance ( ACCA ) has established the following recommendations for appropriate self-care : <p> Make and maintain professional connections that include the opportunity to discuss the specific nature and stressors of your work . <p> Seek consultation when professionally or personally challenged , as necessary . <p> Understand the risks of vicarious traumatization and how to counter them <p> Pay attention to the need for balance in work , rest and play . Make self-care a priority . <p> Pursue opportunities for intellectual stimulation in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations about work-load and your capabilities at any given time . <p> Identify sources of support and use them . <p> Take regular vacations . <p> Avoid isolation . <p> Monitor your use of substances or processes used to relax or for entertainment carefully . <p> The profession of psychology can be an immensely satisfying one , but it is not without it 's hazards . Psychologists in many settings become role-models , and in practice utilize themselves as therapeutic instruments . This very personal role is unlike that of any other profession , in that a person 's " self " is so intimately involved in the work . This instrument must be well-tuned and maintained to ensure the best possible services to the public , and a long and prosperous career for the professional . <h> References <p> American Psychological Association ( 1992 ) .

@@101644103 @5844103/ <h> Research roundup : Life after a disaster <p> Psychologists study disaster survivors and how they responded to different types of treatment interventions . <p> Disasters , ranging from destructive storms to terrorist attacks , can take an initial toll on people 's psychological well-being . Overtime , many are able to recover and go on with their lives . A smaller percentage , particularly those who are highly exposed to the disaster , can develop longer term psychological problems . Earlier disaster research on how people respond to disasters showed that taking proactive steps to cope in the aftermath of disaster can facilitate recovery . This premise leads psychologists , many active in APA 's Disaster Resource Network and Red Cross , to help communities prepare for , respond to and recover from disaster . <p> The following research studies examine how people fared in the aftermath of disaster and describe two promising psychological interventions . Psychologists are encouraged to explore the literature more completely to determine what may be useful to them in practice . <p> Three recent studies looked at disasters ' psychological impact . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveyed Oklahoma City Bombing survivors 18 1/2 years later . The survivors ' had both specific stress reactions to the bombing and more generalized depression and anxiety over time . Depression and anxiety were significantly higher for the disaster survivors ( whether they stayed in Oklahoma City or moved away ) than a community control group . Some post-traumatic growth ( positive change in important personal ways ) was seen among survivors who were female college graduates . Morris and Deterding ( 2016 ) studied parents ( predominantly women ) five years after Hurricane Katrina forced them to evacuate and relocate from New Orleans . These parents experienced emotional distress from the disruption of their social networks with close family and friends . While they adapted and made new friends , these relationships did not replace the significance of those left behind . The authors identified two variables : belonging ( comfort and longtime connectedness ) and mattering ( meeting own and others ' expectations to fulfill essential roles ) that were missing in these parents ' lives and causing them distress . Hashoul-Andary et al . ( 2016 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exposure , and at three and six months . Individuals with anxiety sensitivity ( fear of the sensations of being anxious ) and distress intolerance ( inability to endure exposure to aversive stimuli ) tended to avoid reminders of the fire . Avoiding reminders , such as sensations associated with anxiety and emotions connected to the fire , perpetuated distress and disrupted the possibility for recovery . <p> This study sought to extend and replicate the findings of two previous studies on the use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Post-Disaster Distress ( CBT- PD ) in treating disaster survivors . The authors recruited adult survivors of Hurricane Sandy to enroll in an eight- to 12-session intervention of CBT-PD . In addition to measuring distress , the researchers examined whether the post-disaster timing of treatment delivery or participants ' reported intensity of distress ( moderate or severe ) affected outcomes . Two hundred and two adults in the New York City metropolitan area enrolled in the treatment and completed a 12-item self-report measure , Short Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Rating Interview " Expanded ( Sprint-E ) at four separate time periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also completed the measure at a five-month follow up . The majority of participants were female ( M age &gt;40 ) . The intervention was administered by therapists ( eight licensed ; one nonlicensed supervised ) from the Visiting Nurse Service at individual participants ' homes . The therapeutic components included psychoeducation , breathing exercises , identifying and engaging in positive activities , and teaching and applying cognitive restructuring of maladaptive thoughts . Participants showed significant improvement in their level of distress after treatment and at follow-up . Also , for participants who began the intervention with higher levels of distress , they began to show significant improvement midway through the intervention , earlier than those who began the intervention with moderate distress . Timing of the intervention ( nine to 14 months , 15-19 month or 20-26 months post-disaster ) did not impact outcomes . Similarly , participants with moderate or severe symptoms prior to treatment both showed significant improvement . <p> The authors ' recruited 110 middle schoolers from Moore , Oklahoma , who had been severely affected by a tornado , to participate in an eight-session Journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolers were divided into a treatment and a waitlist control group . JoH addressed common post-disaster emotions by teaching skills in : creating personal safety ; understanding and coping with fear , anxiety , sadness and bullying ; and promoting self-esteem . Participants completed self-report measures at pre- and post-intervention on general self-efficacy , communication management , problem-solving , personal development and prosocial behaviors . Significant increases were found for the treatment group on communication management and prosocial behaviors . There were no differences in these measures for the control group . No significant results were found for general self-efficacy , problem-solving or personal development . A small subset of participants ( n=16 ) also took part in semi-structured interviews . The resulting qualitative data indicated that intervention participants gained coping skills that helped them deal with anger , grief and stress . Participants also experienced increased peer support in developing new friendships , learning from each other and supporting each other . <h> Clinical implications <p> Clinicians understand that people who have been exposed to trauma are at risk for development of PTSD , as well as other anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult emotional and behavioral responses post trauma . The study by Tucker , et al . ( 2016 ) , underscores how long-lasting the impact can actually be . Clinicians necessarily should be alert to such connections to past events and consider gently assessing for emotional and psychological responses to disaster and trauma , no matter the length of time since the experience . Additionally , the studies by Tucker , Morris and Hashoul-Andary all highlighted elements that are important for continued well-being . For instance , some individuals do experience post-traumatic growth following a horrific disaster and clinicians may be able to support and expand on that . Sensitivity to disruptions in social networks and efforts to help patients rebuild their networks , particularly by increasing the experience of belonging and mattering to others , may be quite important in developing overall psychological well-being . While clinicians may be quite familiar with the role of anxiety sensitivity and distress intolerance in maintaining anxiety disorders , these individual traits may need to be addressed to reduce distress and promote recovery after a disaster as well . <p> Both intervention studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distressed disaster survivors and successfully delivered in real-world post-disaster settings by community health personnel and school professionals . The Hamblen et al. , study suggests intervening , even a few years after the disaster , still provides important benefits for individuals . Both studies underscored that individuals with mild or nonclinical levels of distress and symptoms still can demonstrate improvements in functioning and reductions in distress . Being alert to individuals ' experience of disaster and other trauma and providing interventions that build coping skills and self-management appear beneficial for a range of age groups and trauma survivors and might be readily incorporated into clinical practice and community interventions .

" Peer consultation groups keep you from isolation , and help you to stay present with colleagues . " <p> Participation in peer consultation groups can also help practitioners relieve stress and ward off burnout , says Grossman , professor emeritus in the Boston University Department of Psychology and a senior supervisor of the Trauma Center in Brookline , MA . <p> " Our work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peer consultation is important for our own mental health , especially for practitioners who are in full-time practice . " <p> Information exchange is another major benefit of peer consultation , say practitioners .

" It is very helpful to get someone else 's perspective . " <p> Sharing information and experiences can also facilitate professional growth , allowing members of a peer consultation group to develop their clinical skills and improve their decision-making abilities . It can also facilitate professional growth by offering mentoring and networking opportunities . <p> " Peer consultation is psychoeducational , " says Oraker . " It 's a part of lifelong learning . " <h> A Variety of Forms <p> Peer consultation groups can take a number of forms .

Other groups are more informal , allowing group members to share information and anecdotes spontaneously . In addition , some groups have a recognized group leader , while others do not . <p> Content . Some groups invite members to discuss a range of issues , including personal issues or practice management issues , while others restrict discussions to clinical matters . " In some groups , members feel free to talk about themselves-their own stresses , temptations , impairments , " says Oraker , who notes that some practitioners appreciate this extra level of support . <p> Size .

Some groups meet for an hour , and others " especially those that meet less frequently " meet for longer periods of time . <h> Additional Considerations <p> Whatever form a peer consultation group takes , a common consideration among all the groups is confidentiality .

In fact , payments to clinical psychologists under Medicare have declined nearly 22 percent just since 2007 . Meanwhile , Medicare is falling far behind psychologists ' reimbursement by private insurers ; Medicare reimbursement rates are estimated to be 17 percent below private market indemnity insurance rates . <p> The steady decline in Medicare payment rates is leading psychologists to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking new patients . A 2013 APAPO member survey revealed that 26 percent of responding psychologists were previously Medicare providers but left the program , primarily due to low reimbursement rates . Half of those psychologists have left since 2008 . This means that nearly 5,200 psychologists across the country are no longer providing the mental , behavioral and substance use disorder services that Medicare beneficiaries need . <h> Congress should adjust the Medicare payment formula , which simply is not working to provide for fair and appropriate payment for psychologists in the program . <p> Under the payment formula , Medicare increasingly pays more for higher-cost , technology-driven services with high overhead " and therefore higher " Practice Expense " relative value unit ( RVU ) scores . Psychologists ' services , which involve almost no technology use and are provided with low overhead and cost , are consistently devalued in comparison . Also unlike other providers , psychologists use only a handful of reimbursement codes , predominantly for services which are explicitly time-based . Consequently psychologists are less able to balance reimbursement rate increases in some services against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of services they provide in response to declining payments . <p> In recent years , several Medicare Practice Expense adjustments in the payment formula have ratcheted down psychologist Medicare payment rates : <p> In 2006 , CMS announced changes in the Practice Expense methodology for all providers . As a result , average psychologist Practice Expense payments dropped by 2 percent each year through 2010 . <p> In 2009 , CMS announced a new series of Practice Expense adjustments , causing an additional 2 percent annual decrease for psychologists for 2010 through 2013 . <p> In 2011 , psychologists suffered a 4 percent loss in overall reimbursement when CMS rebased and revalued the Medicare Economic Index , more heavily weighting the practice expense component of the formula as compared to the work component . This benefited high technology cost providers to the detriment of low-cost providers like psychologists . <p> Although the payment schedule for 2014 adopted by CMS provided a small increase in most reimbursement rates for psychologists , the increases do not address the steady erosion in reimbursements that has occurred over more than a decade . Medicare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermined if psychologists are no longer able to provide the services they need . Congress should adjust the formula to ensure that psychologists remain in the program . <p> Congress enacted the SGR as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to limit growth in Medicare provider payments and contain program costs . However , as the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission recently testified , the SGR formula is not working , and Congress should act urgently to repeal it . Indeed , Congress has had to intervene on at least 16 occasions to avert staggering SGR cuts . If Congress does not act by March 31 , Medicare providers face another payment rate reduction of roughly 24 percent . <p> Psychology supports the " SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 " ( H.R. 4015 / S. 2000 ) . Psychology looks forward to working with Congress to replace the SGR with payment reforms , and proposals which enhance quality , care coordination , and efficiency should be encouraged . However , it is vitally important that new payment models treat all Medicare providers " both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reimbursement into the future .

The bill , whose passage came down to the wire , was negotiated by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev. , and Speaker of the House John Boehner , R-Ohio . <p> The new law postpones the SGR cut until March 31 , 2015 , and extends a 0.5 percent Medicare reimbursement rate increase through Dec. 31 , 2014 . A December 2013 law known as Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013 postponed the SGR cut for the first three months of 2014 and increased Medicare reimbursement by 0.5 percent through March 31 of this year . <p> When passage of the Protecting Access to Medicare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Medicaid Services instructed Medicare Administrative Contractors ( MACs ) to hold through April 14 all claims for Medicare services delivered between April 1 and April 14 . For services delivered on or before March 31 , as well as those delivered April 15 or later , the MACs are expected to process and pay related claims under normal procedures . <p> Among its additional provisions , the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 creates a Medicaid demonstration program based on the Excellence in Mental Health Act ( S. 164 , H.R. 1263 ) supported by the APA Practice Organization ( APAPO ) . The provision seeks to improve access to comprehensive mental health and substance use treatment services for individuals , particularly those with a serious mental illness . <p> The provision creates a two-year , eight-state demonstration program to stimulate the development of entities that meet newly established federal criteria for Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics ( CBHCs ) . Certification as a CBHC requires delivery of a broad range of services , including outpatient mental health services , crisis mental health services and psychiatric rehabilitation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Psychology Still Seeks SGR Repeal <p> While the one-year delay in the SGR cut is a victory , Congress still needs to repeal this flawed Medicare cost containment mechanism . Lobbyists for APAPO have been working diligently with legislators to gain permanent repeal of the SGR , and we 're seeing signs of progress . <p> But since leaders have not yet agreed on how to pay for the permanent SGR repeal bill ( SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 , H.R. 4015/S.2000 ) , a one-year delay provides lawmakers additional time to work toward enacting a lasting solution . APAPO will continue to work toward repeal of the SGR formula and its replacement with a reasonable cost containment mechanism . <p> From January 2013 until now , psychologists have sent nearly 16,000 messages to congressional offices calling for postponement of scheduled SGR cuts and repeal of the SGR system . Thanks to our grassroots members for this crucial support . We look forward to your continued success in having psychology 's voice heard on Capitol Hill .

@@101644145 @5844145/ <h> APA to establish treatment guideline panels for obesity and PTSD <p> Nominations invited for two new guideline groups <p> By Howard Kurtzman , PhD , and Lynn Bufka , PhD <p> April 12 , 2012 " The American Psychological Association ( APA ) has issued calls for nominations for scientists and clinicians to serve on two new panels for developing clinical treatment guidelines . One panel will draft a guideline for the treatment of obesity , and the other will draft a guideline for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . <p> These will be the second and third guideline development panels established within APA 's treatment guideline development initiative , following establishment of a panel for depressive disorders . <p> The formation of the panel on obesity follows from a recommendation made in August 2011 by the steering committee for APA 's initiative . The steering committee had identified PTSD as another possible topic for guideline development but , until now , had not made a final recommendation about whether or when APA should pursue it . <p> It has recently been learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults will be released in 2012 or 2013 by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ ) , a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services . AHRQ supports the conduct and dissemination of systematic reviews for a wide range of physical and mental health conditions . <p> After evaluating the scope and methods of the AHRQ review , the steering committee decided that it could be used as the basis for an APA guideline . In order to take advantage of the review while it was still current , the steering committee recommended that a guideline development panel for PTSD be formed in 2012 . Because it is a federal government product , the AHRQ systematic review will be in the public domain and available to APA at no cost . <p> Further , AHRQ is currently supporting systematic reviews on prevention of PTSD in adults and on treatment of children exposed to trauma that are also anticipated for release in 2012 or 2013 . These reviews , along with any other recent reviews that are identified , may also be referred to in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope of the guideline and selecting which systematic reviews will underpin it will fall to the PTSD guideline development panel working in cooperation with the steering committee . <p> For the new obesity panel as well , it is possible that the development of a guideline can draw upon systematic reviews that have been recently published or are currently in development . The new obesity guideline development panel will work with the steering committee to make decisions about such resources and whether APA will need to commission any new systematic reviews to address particular questions . <p> For the panel examining depressive disorders , the steering committee has already recommended that APA commission an outside organization to conduct a systematic review of the relevant literature , due to the lack of up-to-date , comprehensive reviews in that area . The committee has also begun to examine the range of organizations that could carry out this work , including the evidence-based practice centers with which AHRQ works . <p> For all three guideline development panels , it is expected that review of the evidence and drafting of a guideline will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed surprise or concern that APA is pursuing a guideline in the area of obesity . In fact , APA has adopted advancement of both mental and physical health within its strategic plan .

It can be effectively treated through behavior change , which falls within the domain of psychologists . As collaborations between psychologists and other health care professionals increase , psychologists are expected to be called upon more frequently to address obesity and other physical conditions . <p> Additional information about APA 's treatment guideline development initiative can be found on the clinical treatment guidelines website .

@@101644155 @5844155/ <h> Clinical Conversation on PTSD Related to Military Combat <p> by APA Practice Organization <p> February 14 , 2008 " This " Clinical Conversation " was stimulated by the documented mental health needs of active duty military , National Guard , Reservists and veterans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan . <p> Terence M. Keane , PhD , is Director of the Behavioral Science Division of the National Center for PTSD at VA Boston Healthcare System . He is also Professor and Vice Chairman of the Division of Psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine and Professor of Psychology . <p> The author of more than 200 publications , Dr. Keane has also edited nine volumes on post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , while developing many of the most widely used measures of psychological trauma and PTSD . He is recognized internationally as one of the leading authorities on trauma and PTSD . <p> Randy Phelps , PhD , is Deputy Director of the American Psychological Association ( APA ) Practice Directorate and has worked for many years on veterans issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving as the Practice Directorate interim executive director until April 2008 . <p> The online " Clinical Conversations " in this PracticeUpdate e-newsletter generally focus on clinical information and developments of interest to practicing psychologists . The psychologists featured in these conversations offer their own professional perspective on a particular topic . <p> This conversation is intended to stimulate feedback from APA members . <p> Dr. Phelps : Where do individuals who have returned from combat get treated for their mental health needs ? <p> Typically , VA provides health care to those who were injured during their military service or who developed a disease/disorder during the time of their service . Additional eligibility is conferred on those whose annual income is below a certain level and who do not have alternative sources of health care available to them . Elderly veterans over the age of 65 can also receive care at VA . <p> Historically , VA provided care to approximately 20 percent of all veterans . Eighty percent of veterans received their health care elsewhere . Veterans from the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are accessing VA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eligible veterans have been to a VA setting for some type of care . Generally , the problems driving this care are musculoskeletal complaints , dental needs and , naturally , mental health problems . Of course , combat-related PTSD is the most common psychological problem , but veterans also present with depression , substance abuse , chronic pain , traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) and other anxiety disorders . <p> The vast majority of veterans and their family members receive their mental health care from the private sector . For this reason , it 's important for mental health practitioners of all types to assess for veteran status . Making this determination may provide important information for case formulation and treatment planning . Practitioners who feel the need for additional training in the assessment and treatment of military veterans ( male and female ) may find helpful information through APA and state , provincial and territorial psychological associations and through a wide range of Web training initiatives . <p> Dr. Phelps : How do various subgroups such as active duty military and National Guard/Reserve members access treatment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care system provided by the Department of Defense ( DoD ) . For active duty military , mental health services can be provided by the DoD directly or through a mechanism known as One Source . Providers affiliated with One Source consist of psychologists and other mental health professionals who contract with the DoD to provide a limited number of assessment/therapy sessions to individuals and their families . <p> National Guard and Reservists are not ordinarily eligible for VA health care , nor are they typically eligible for DoD health care when they are inactive . However , an act of Congress created time-limited eligibility for these military members to utilize VA services . This legislative action has been a great source of mental health care for the returning Reservists and National Guard personnel . <p> The VA provides care largely to individual veterans themselves . Family members , and especially family members of those activated and serving in the war zones , are not deemed eligible for VA services . With a wide range of psychiatric and psychological services available in diverse settings , VA is a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission on Mental Health . It may well be the model system that the rest of the country could emulate . <p> Dr. Phelps : What is important for psychologists to know about the demographics of returning service members ? <p> Dr. Keane : Several key demographic features of the current military force are important to appreciate . First , it is a decidedly diverse , multicultural military . More than 40 percent of active duty military personnel is a racial or ethnic minority . This figure represents greater diversity than in the U.S. population at large . <p> Second , women constitute more than 10 percent of the military serving in Afghanistan and Iraq , and they perform a wide range of professional roles and combat roles . This situation is different than Vietnam , for example , when women were disproportionately represented in nursing and administrative positions and served in the war zone in far lower percentages of the total military force . <p> Third , there is a bifurcated distribution of age among service members . Some members serving in their first enlistment might be in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Guard members who might be in their later thirties or forties . Accordingly , their backgrounds and issues are very different and reflect their age , vocational and family structures . <p> Dr. Phelps : How do family members " spouses , children , parents and other family members " factor into treatment for returning service members ? <p> Dr. Keane : Veterans themselves are the ones deemed eligible for VA care . The VA 's statutory authority to treat family members is limited . <p> Family members are treated to the extent to which they are directly involved in the veteran 's care . For example , if a veteran develops depression or PTSD as a consequence of his or her service , the veteran 's spouse could be actively involved in a marital treatment program for these conditions . If a veteran is injured by an improvised explosive device ( IED ) and his/her cognitive processes are compromised , the parents could be involved in a psycho-educational rehabilitative program in conjunction with the veteran . This treatment would be fully provided by VA to the veteran and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are skills in treating trauma to treating people exposed to combat ? How likely is someone with a practice focused generally on trauma , such as helping victims of abuse , to be well skilled in meeting the needs of returning service personnel ? <p> Dr. Keane : I 'd like to think that the specific skills and conceptual models for understanding and treating one type of trauma are directly generalizable to another form of trauma exposure . This notion is fundamental to much of the work accomplished by our group at the National Center for PTSD over the past 30 years . <p> Yet , specific contextual factors are important to consider if one is to succeed in navigating the transition from working with one group of trauma-exposed people to another group . In the instance of combat trauma , it is critical to understand general military contextual variables and the specific details associated with the war itself , and to have an appreciation of the stressors and pressures under which the individual served . Even understanding the political climate in Afghanistan or Iraq during the time of service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Learning about the contextual factors associated with a particular type of trauma exposure would , in my view , be far easier and quicker to master than the acquisition of new therapy skills . <p> The principles for treating trauma survivors are far better understood today than 30 years ago when we first started to treat combatants . Importantly , the models and techniques that guide psychological assessment and psychological treatment of PTSD now possess reliability and validity data that transcend the various types of trauma to which people are exposed . These same principles appear to be effective across racial , ethnic and cultural boundaries . These facts are enormously encouraging to me . <p> Dr. Phelps : What is important for practitioners to know about the combat-related experience that today 's returning soldiers may bring to treatment that 's different from other trauma-related life experiences ? <p> Dr. Keane : Fundamentally , trauma is about exposure to life-and-death situations . Trauma may also be secondary to exposure to events that challenge one 's personal integrity or may inculcate shame or humiliation . For combatants , their experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exposure to these experiences often happens multiple times over the period of service . <p> Combat is not exposure to a uniform , single traumatic event . Rather , it often involves multiple types of life-and-death experiences associated with strong and wide-ranging emotional reactions in the context of a malevolent living environment that is estranged from the usual forms of family and social support . As a result , it 's vital to conduct a comprehensive assessment of exposures both in the war zone and prior to service in the war zone . <p> My experience is that veterans can be extraordinarily open in describing the devastation of war but may be reluctant to express details of events in which they might have had an active role . Patience is needed to understand the precise role of the individual in certain war events , their immediate reactions to those events and the long-term impact of this participation . Combatants are often actively and passively involved in acts of violence ; understanding the boundary conditions of war is pivotal in making progress in the psychological treatment of war veterans regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Keane : The general principles that guide treatment of PTSD are derived from several different models of care . First , the development of a strong therapeutic alliance is pivotal for all future work . It may determine the extent to which particular patients might even share with you the details of their military experiences . Conflict about one 's participation in combat is a function of what one does in the war zone and what happens to that person in the war zone . The complex emotions that emerge can be fear , anxiety , dread , horror , shame , guilt and disgust " the strongest and most aversive of human emotions . <p> Treatment of these emotional responses initially involves a quieting of the strong emotions often employing relaxation or meditational strategies , accompanied by psycho-educational efforts to inform the patient of the psychological , physiological and interpersonal consequences of trauma exposure . Reframing the experiences using cognitive restructuring models that focus upon realistic appraisals of the situation and the circumstances found in a war zone by combatants also is an important component of psychological care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult combat events is also demonstrably effective in helping patients to overcome their reactions . Emotional processing can take many forms , including prolonged exposure therapy , systematic desensitization , eye movement desensitization and reprocessing ( EMDR ) and other approaches that focus directly upon the emotional reactions precipitated by the traumatic events per se . <p> Dr. Phelps : Of course psychologists are trained to pay attention to countertransference . But are there potential blind spots for certain practitioners , such as those unfamiliar with military service or opposed to war , that they should be mindful of in working with returning service members ? <p> Dr. Keane : Yes , I think so . The therapeutic alliance can be a challenge in any setting and with any type of patient , but there are some key features that will determine whether veteran patients will return for continuing care . Listening attentively to the description of service , while asking informed questions about location , duties and training , can communicate to the veteran an understanding of their experience in important ways . <p> Most people who join the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Their belief system is such that they respect those who join the military and they consider the work of the military among the most worthwhile things possible . Challenging this belief or even demonstrating a political position on the value and merits of a particular war may inadvertently damage the therapeutic alliance in ways that are n't remediable . <p> For many war veterans , even those in their eighties today , the work they did for their country in the military was among the most rewarding life experiences they 've had . Supporting this belief is important to moving to the next stage of treatment . <p> Dr. Phelps : What is the Department of Veterans Affairs doing to help psychologists " both VA psychologists and non-VA psychologists " become better informed ? What 's the role for non-DoD and non-VA psychologists in helping with PTSD treatment ? <p> Dr. Keane:The National Center for PTSD has an award-winning website that is a national resource on the topic of PTSD broadly , but with a special emphasis on combat-related PTSD . The PILOTS ( Published International Literature on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most widely used facets of our website , contains both published and unpublished works on the topic of trauma " including chapters in books from across the world . PILOTS can be accessed directly from our website . <p> At the moment there are two fantastic initiatives within VA to bring effective treatments to all corners of the VA mental health system . Several treatments appear to help veterans and others to overcome symptoms of PTSD : Exposure Therapy , Cognitive Therapy , Anxiety Management ( for example , Stress Inoculation , Stress Management ) Treatments , EMDR , combinations of the above treatments and psychopharmacological treatment using serotonin-acting medications . These treatments are identified and described in the most recent edition ( in press ; Guilford Press ) of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies ( ISTSS ) Best Practice Guidelines for PTSD . My colleagues in Boston , Patricia Resick , PhD , and Candice Monson , PhD , are involved in a national VA-based dissemination of Cognitive Processing Therapy , a treatment developed by Patti some 20 years ago .

@@101644160 @5844160/ <h> Alcohol and Problem Drinking <p> By Carlo C. DiClemente , PhD , and the Advisory Committee on Colleague Assistance <p> September 28 , 2005 " Many very successful and competent individuals have found themselves in trouble with alcohol and have had to free themselves from problem drinking . Psychologists are not immune from the problem . Some may be vulnerable to the lure of alcohol to relieve stress in order to deal with the daily exposure to the toxic emotions and problems of patients . Having a drink can be a socially acceptable way to escape from the stress of patient care , the loneliness and burden of confidentiality , and the tension of an overextended work schedule . <p> As long as alcohol remains a beverage and does not become a drug , it does not pose a problem . However , if use of alcohol has transitioned from beverage to drug , from use to abuse , from drinking in moderation to drinking too much , the individual will likely have problems . <p> Alcohol is a drug with specific mechanisms of action in the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part of the problem lies in shared ambivalence and attitudes about alcohol and what we expect from it . Alcohol is viewed as a most effective social lubricant , a tension reducer , an inhibition releaser , a sexual enhancer , a courage builder , and a communication facilitator . At the same time , it is a restricted and regulated substance that one should learn to use responsibly only after reaching the age of 21 . <p> Most problematic expectancies related to alcohol are connected with drug effects , not beverage characteristics . So a key to assessing when you are drinking too much has as much to do with why and how you are drinking as it has to do with how much you are drinking . <h> Making a Self-assessment <p> How will you know if you are drinking too much ? Here are some key questions to ask to help you in your self-assessment : <p> Am I drinking alcohol as a beverage or using it as a drug ? <p> Do I need alcohol to relax or relieve the stress of working with clients ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emotions ? <p> Do I use alcohol to manage social functions or relationships ? <p> How does alcohol fit into my life ? <p> Do I make sure that there is always time for alcohol in my schedule ? <p> Has drinking become an important priority ? <p> What do I expect from my alcohol consumption ? An attitude adjustment ? Solace and release from tension ? <p> Can I honestly say that there are no negative consequences of my drinking ? <p> Are there any occasions or circumstances when I feel I have to have a drink ? <p> Do I have a spouse , friends , or family members who have a drinking problem ? <p> If your answers to one or more of these statements or questions are positive for problematic expectancies , patterns or consequences , then you may be engaging either in risky drinking that puts you at risk for alcohol problems or in hazardous drinking that is already producing some negative consequences in your life . The next step would be a more thorough evaluation of your drinking . <h> Options for Assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all psychologists are well aware , self-assessment is not like looking into a mirror where we get a complete ( even if slightly distorted ) view of ourselves . It is often difficult to be objective about ourselves . Seeking feedback from someone who can be objective would be the best route to take . Paying attention and being open to the information you receive is essential . Simply because we are psychologists trained to detect problems does not mean that we can see or diagnose our own , especially when there are potent psychological and physiological reinforcers for the status quo . We need to imitate our best clients and be open to considering feedback . <h> Making a Plan to Change Problem Drinking <p> If you are drinking too much and willing to admit it , there are many options available for doing something about your problem drinking . Many of these will be familiar strategies from our theories of behavior change . Creating a viable plan and making this change a priority is the next step . Every plan has to include the following : <p> Set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking , or quitting drinking altogether . Although there are differing schools of thought , moderating alcohol consumption or abstaining entirely may both be viable options . <p> Make sure you are convinced and committed . <p> Tell someone ( a spouse , colleague , or friend ) about it <p> Build in rewards and reinforcers for you goals <p> Use behavioral strategies to accomplish these goals . <p> Removing alcohol from your home . <p> Alternating alcoholic with non-alcoholic beverages , and pacing consumption of alcohol . <p> Substituting other behaviors to manage the situations , emotions , and behaviors that you have been medicating with alcohol . <p> Avoiding people and places where it is difficult to manage drinking , at least at the beginning . <p> Challenge your problematic expectancies about alcohol . <p> Alcohol does not make you a better conversationalist <p> Alcohol interferes with sexual enjoyment and performance <p> You can get as much relaxation from a long walk as you can from overdrinking . <p> Excessive drinking causes more stressors and consequences and does not make your life easier . <p> Make a commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get support from friends or mutual help groups . <p> Do n't give up . Successful behavior change takes time and may require continued attempts through the stages of change in order to get it right . <p> Problem drinking often is accompanied by other problems in a person 's life that are precipitants or consequences of the drinking . These problems also need to be addressed once the brain and body are clear enough to deal with them . <p> Recognition and realization of the drinking problem and taking effective action can help anyone who drinks too much to either abstain entirely or to return alcohol to the status of a beverage that can be consumed rather than a drug to be used . For professionals ( and in particular for psychologists ) it can be humbling to realize that we have fallen victim to the lure of alcohol . However , we are in good company with the many medical , business , sport , and entertainment professionals whose own struggles with alcohol problems offer object lessons about the dangers and models of the courage and hope needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fletcher , 2001 ) .

The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 ( MHPAEA ) , enacted into law on Oct. 3 , 2008 , represented a big step toward ending health insurance benefits inequity between mental health/substance use disorders and medical/surgical benefits coverage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comply with the law . <p> The first step towards parity in Medicare coverage came in July 2008 when Congress enacted the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act ( MIPPA ) . Under MIPPA , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) implemented a phase-out of the mental health treatment limitation over a five-year period from 2010 to 2014 . <p> Prior to 2010 , Medicare 's payment liability for outpatient mental health services was limited to 62.5 percent of covered expenses incurred in any calendar year for an individual who was not an inpatient of a hospital at the time the expenses were incurred . Following the enactment of MIPPA , that limitation was gradually reduced over several years : <p> Beginning Jan. 1 , 2014 , the limitation will be 100 percent ; Medicare will pay 80 percent and the beneficiary will pay 20 percent . <p> With the end of the five-year phaseout of the mental health treatment limitation , Medicare will no longer lag behind private insurers in providing nondiscriminatory outpatient mental health coverage to millions of people across the country . 
@@101644180 @5844180/ <p> A look ahead to what the Practice Organization is doing on behalf of practicing psychologists in 2016. 60006 @qwx920006 <p> Despite the gridlock that has characterized the current session of Congress , 2015 saw some legislative successes for practicing psychologists . In April , Congress overwhelmingly passed the Medicare Access and Children 's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act ( MACRA ) to repeal the flawed-Medicare sustainable growth rate and replaced it with a Medicare payment system based on rewarding quality and value . This averted a 21 percent cut in Medicare payment . <p> Even with a shortened legislative calendar due to the presidential election year , 2016 is shaping up to be a busy year . The following is a brief summary of what your Practice Organization is doing on behalf of practicing psychologists in 2016 . <h> Adding Psychologists to the Medicare Physician Definition <p> Treating Medicare patients without the oversight of physicians continues to be a top advocacy effort on behalf of psychologists who are Medicare providers . In December , Rep. Kristi Noem , R-S.D. , and Rep. Jan Schakowsky , D-Ill. , introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. House of Representatives . This bipartisan legislation would allow psychologists to provide Medicare services to their patients without unnecessary physician supervision in all treatment centers by amending the Medicare definition of physician to include psychologists . <p> Reps . Noem and Schakowsky are members of the influential House Ways &amp; Means Committee and House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee , respectively . These committees have jurisdiction over health care legislation . APAPO is solidifying sponsors to introduce a companion bill in the U.S. Senate and more information will be forthcoming soon . <p> The Medicare Mental Health Access Act is professional psychology 's priority legislation , and we need your help contacting Congress . Visit the Practice Organization 's Legislative Action Center on the APA Practice Organization 's Practice Central website to write to your members of Congress and urge them to co-sponsor the Medicare Mental Health Access Act . <p> If you have a personal story of how physician certification requirements are causing treatment delays or other disruptions in your work with Medicare beneficiaries , please share it with APAPO staff by completing a short survey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because under the current formula , Medicare pays more for higher-cost , technology-driven services with high overhead . The Practice Organization continues to advocate for a change in the Medicare payment formula so that psychologists are appropriately and fairly compensated for treating Medicare beneficiaries . This work will continue this year . <h> Working to Enact Comprehensive Mental Health Reform Legislation <p> In June 2015 , Tim Murphy , R-Pa. , a psychologist , and Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson , D-Texas , a psychiatric nurse , introduced H.R. 2646 , the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act of 2015 . This legislation focuses on reforming programs and providing needed resources for individuals with serious mental illness and their families . <p> The Practice Organization has worked closely with the bill sponsors and members of the House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee to pass this vital legislation . With the help of psychologists who sent letters to their members of Congress , this legislation passed out of the Energy &amp; Commerce 's Health Subcommittee . <p> In August , Sen. Bill Cassidy , R-La. , a physician , and Sen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mental Health Reform Act of 2015 , which is similar to H.R. 2646 , and focuses on creating a mental health system which efficiently and effectively offers patients , providers , families and caregivers access to timely and quality care . The Practice Organization has worked closely with the legislative sponsors to provide input and feedback on the legislative language . <p> The Practice Organization also supports the Mental Health Awareness and Improvement Act , passed in the U.S. Senate in December . This bill , introduced by Sen. Lamar Alexander , R-Tenn. , chairman of the Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , and Sen. Patty Murray , D-Wash. , ranking member of the committee , reauthorizes and improves current programs that focus on suicide prevention , mental health care for children and older adults , mental health awareness training and the integration of mental and physical health care .

The first eight chapters present the knowledge base for understanding the principles and practice of patient-oriented , hypothesis-testing neuropsychological assessment . The last 12 chapters review nearly all tests and assessment techniques discussed in previous editions , plus many new ones and recent revisions of older tests . The extent of the updating is apparent from the fact that approximately half of the more than 7,000 references cited appeared since the last edition was published .

Under this arrangement , income earned by the group 's health-care professionals is divvied up according to a percentage agreed upon in each partner 's contract . <p> The danger , says Stout , is entering into an inequitable contract . <p> " You would need to weigh what you bring to the practice , " he says , " and what the practice brings to you .

A clause might specify , for example , that when the psychologist leaves the group , he or she ca n't work within a 50-mile radius of the medical group 's office . <p> Psychologists faced with noncompete clauses might consider negotiating an exemption or turning down the offer , says Stout .

Here are two examples : <p> Renting office space from a physician could be seen as a potential conflict of interest , says Stout . A patient , for example , may misconstrue that the physician is making referrals to the psychologist to ensure the rent is paid . The simplest way to avoid this scenario is to make it clear that you evaluate all patients before treating them , says Stout . Delineate for the physician the types of patients you 're qualified to treat , he says , and explain that if you are n't qualified , you will refer the patient to a qualified psychologist . <p> Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Stout . If the physician gives you free office space or only charges a nominal fee , you ca n't treat Medicare patients . Generally speaking , it 's a conflict of interest to refer a Medicare patient to a laboratory or health-care professional that a physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship with because , says Stout , the Health Care Financing Administration considers that a self-referral . <h> Before you sign <p> Psychologists also need to be aware of potential legal consequences when signing a contract to be a network provider with a managed-care company . <p> A common misunderstanding among psychologists is that they must accept the contract as it 's written , says Stout . But , he says , that is n't true . <p> " Do n't be afraid to send the contract back with changes , " he says . <p> Stout estimates that he 's altered 80 percent of the contracts he 's signed with managed-care companies . <p> Red flags to look out for include : <p> Care standards . Providers should n't sign contracts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because one could argue that such a standard would require a complete psychological evaluation , social history , blood work-ups and psychiatric consultation--all for the cost of what may have been calculated by the provider as psychotherapy alone . <p> One-sided indemnification . By signing a contract with this clause , you agree to be responsible for everything that happens to the patient , including problems that might occur in billing or with another provider . " You are signing a contract that indemnifies the company , " says Stout . He suggests asking an attorney how to alter the contract so you 're responsible only for actions you have control over within the scope of your practice as a licensed psychologist . The contract should also stipulate that the managed-care company is responsible for all the activities involving the business aspects of care . <p> Confidentiality . Managed-care contracts often are n't in line with state confidentiality laws , yet state law always takes precedence . So , ask a lawyer to draft language that says patient medical records will be provided in accordance with the state 's confidentiality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clauses . According to these clauses , which many states prohibit , if you say something considered to be negative about the managed-care company , your contract could be terminated . Renegotiate or do n't sign a contract that includes this clause . <p> Restrictive covenants . Providers should be wary of any contract that limits them to a geographic area or type of service , since it might preclude them from contracting with other companies . Negotiate an exemption or do n't sign the contract , he says . <p> Stout advises that your contract include : <p> Term-of-contract considerations . Many contracts are for only one year , but it 's typically better to negotiate a longer contract so the terms do n't change annually . Providers also need to stay on top of renewal dates for their contracts so they can be ready to renegotiate terms . Some contracts have automatic rollovers known as " evergreen " clauses . <p> " With cause " and " without cause " clauses . Most contracts include both . " With cause " allows the company to terminate providers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as inadvertently billing a patient incorrectly or failing to send the managed-care company an updated copy of their license . In such instances , the contract allows for appeal and due process to determine whether the cause was indeed actionable . " Without cause " allows either the provider or the company to terminate the contract at any time for no reason as long as notice is given , typically 60 or 90 days , says Stout . <p> Contract termination . Providers should be aware of circumstances that would provide cause for their contract to be terminated . For example , a managed-care company might seek termination if the provider fails to send the company an updated copy of the provider 's malpractice insurance . Or a provider could seek termination because the managed-care company is n't paying him or her within 45 days , as stipulated in the contract . " It 's always good to know where trap doors are as well as emergencies exits , " says Stout . <p> Liability for patient care . The contract should outline how cases are handled if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the contract should state that the insurer will pay for a set number of sessions while the patient makes the transition to another provider .

An increase in the prevalence of obesity and mental health concerns among U.S. adolescent girls has prompted a rise in targeted prevention and intervention programs . It is important to consider the factors that contribute to positive beliefs about self and the development of health behaviors , as well as the relationship between body image and disordered eating or being overweight . <p> In addition to the information provided in the following research summaries , psychologists are encouraged to explore the literature more completely to determine what may be useful to them in practice . <h> Summary <p> This study focused on adolescent girls 12 to 16 years of age who were recruited from five different schools in South Australia . A sample of 298 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential predictors such as activities , and possible health outcomes at two time points , about one year apart . <p> Concepts assessed in the questionnaire included perceived body acceptance by others , body appreciation , self-objectification and social comparison , followed by health behaviors including intuitive eating . Positive body appreciation is when one accepts one 's body , flaws and all . Self-objectification is when one 's view of one 's own body is based on beliefs regarding others ' judgments . Relatedly , social comparison is the act of evaluating one 's own body in comparison to others . Intuitive eating is eating in response to body cues and needs , rather than emotional or external reasons . <p> Positive body acceptance by others , negative self-objectification , negative social comparison and positive body appreciation were related to an increase in intuitive eating over one year in young girls . Intuitive eating demonstrates a healthier relationship with food and responsiveness to the body 's natural hunger signs . Also in this study , there were significant relationships between body appreciation , alcohol and cigarette consumption . Girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use alcohol than girls with lower body appreciation .

This , in turn , may be linked to mental health . Two hundred and four adolescent girls between the ages of 11 and 13 were given a questionnaire that measured various daily lifestyle activities , ideas about their bodies and symptoms related to mental health . <p> Using structural equation modeling , the authors found that exposure to images in the media and on the internet as well as conversations with peers about appearance predicted self " objectification . Self-objectification was significantly correlated with body shame , dieting and depressive symptoms .

The data was collected as part of a larger study ( Growing Up Today Study ) with over 9,000 female participants completing annual or biennial surveys . Generalized estimating equations were used to measure the association between high concern of weight and the onset of weekly binge eating two years later , and any associated depressive symptoms and social functioning concerns . <p> Girls who had high concern ( overvaluated ) their weight were three times more likely to develop weekly binge eating two years later and , among those who did binge eat , those who overvalued their weight had more severe depressive symptoms .

Popular thinking suggests that girls are bombarded with images and ideas that promote unrealistic body ideals yet little is known about the development of healthy body image or how these unrealistic ideals might translate into more problematic thinking . These studies suggest fostering positive body appreciation and minimizing the importance of shape and weight have benefits for girls . Not only do girls who accept and appreciate their bodies seem to have less maladaptive dieting , they also seem to be less likely to consume alcohol and cigarettes . Supporting balanced and nonrestrictive approaches to eating , encouraging physical activities such as sports or dance and minimizing exposure to ( or discussing the pros and cons of ) media images may all serve to enhance positive body image .

Psychologists , in many cases . <p> Meet three psychologists using their behavioral expertise to assess and improve the functioning of public agencies in innovative ways . <h> Determining fitness to bear arms <p> In 1999 , the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) decided to arm its medical center police force . One snag : It did n't have a policy to psychologically evaluate potential hires . That 's when the VA turned to psychologist Robert C. Gresen , PhD . <p> Then the acting deputy chief consultant for the VA 's Mental Health Strategic Health Care Group , Gresen helped create a formal procedure complete with structured interviews and psychological testing for VA psychologists to conduct psychological evaluations of police officer applicants . Previously , VA psychologists met with a police officer only during an annual interview after the officer was hired , he says . <p> In creating the policy , Gresen talked to psychologists who conduct evaluations full time and consulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Div. 18 ( Public Service ) . <p> As the representative for VA psychologists in a four-person work group charged with formulating the final policy , Gresen shared his findings with the other representatives from the VA police , human resources and employee health departments . The group is pleased with the policy results thus far , he says . <p> " We went from an unarmed force to an armed force using a policy to evaluate new applicants that is consistent with professional practice , " Gresen says . " To date , the very few situations where VA police have discharged a firearm have been found to be fully warranted and justified an excellent record given that VA has some 160 medical centers with more than 2,000 armed officers . " <h> In pursuit of better cops <p> Michael Cuttler , PhD , always fancied himself as a bit of an entrepreneur : He liked the competitiveness of business and the chance to " keep score " of his success . That drive led the North Carolina-based psychologist to leave private practice and found his own company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LESI consults with law-enforcement agencies , such as municipal police departments and state highway troopers , by leveraging technology to conduct " pre-employment suitability screening evaluations " of potential employees . Cuttler has seen his 16-year-old company grow to serve more than 800 law-enforcement agencies in 14 states . <p> When he began the company , Cuttler provided about 200 local North Carolina law-enforcement agencies with psychological services such as employee counseling and critical response training . <p> But LESI decided to concentrate exclusively on pre-employment services . Thanks to the Internet , LESI narrowed its practice but broadened its reach . <p> " Instead of doing everything for agency A , we do one psychological service for agencies A through Z , " Cuttler says . <p> Cuttler screens potential officers using two patent-pending instruments . These instruments ask applicants about their employment and criminal history , among other factors . <p> His method screens large groups of potential law enforcement applicants and leaves a pool of strong applicants for example , reducing 200 applicants to 30 but still allows local psychologists to complete one-on-one evaluations with the agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests are cost-effective and based in psychological science , which saves clients money yet yields qualified applicants , " he says . <p> LESI also has compiled a database of more than 60,000 test results from applicants over the years . Cuttler meets with clients to learn which applicants were n't hired , which were and who later experienced on-the-job problems , such as disciplinary action for use of force . Then , like an insurance company might do , LESI sorts the applicants based on their outcomes into casualty groups to discover what characteristics make people likely to get rejected , hired or become top cops . <h> Strong science at the FBI <p> When the FBI needed psychological data on criminal behavior , clinical psychologist Kristen Beyer , PhD , was up to the task .

This issue of research roundup explores sleep disturbance and disorders in active duty and redeployed military personnel and veterans . <h> Summary <p> Seven hundred twenty five active duty military personnel ( 93.2 percent male and 85.2 percent combat veterans ) underwent diagnostic polysomnography sleep studies following referral from their primary care or behavioral health provider for sleep complaints . Over half of the individuals were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea , which is also common among civilians with sleep difficulties . <p> Military personnel were found to be more likely to suffer from insomnia or behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome ( BIISS ) than civilians . Military members reported averaging 5.74 hours of sleep at home with more than 40 percent reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short sleep duration ( SSD ) . In fact , military members reported far less sleep than civilians , which is not necessarily surprising given their work demands and military culture . <p> An unusually high number of individuals ( 17 percent ) had paradoxical insomnia ( the subjective perception of little or no sleep , despite a normal sleep duration ) as compared to the civilian population . Additionally , individuals with sleep disorders were more likely to be diagnosed with depression and anxiety than their non-sleep disordered counterparts . Lastly , those individuals with pain syndromes were more likely to have insomnia. 60005 @qwx920005 <p> While this study did not report on the general incidence of sleep disorders in the military population , it did indicate the kinds of sleep problems typically endured by members of the military . Of particular concern is the reported low numbers of hours of sleep as well as the relatively high incidence of paradoxical insomnia . <p> Both problems seem to be consistent with military culture and functioning . Military personnel frequently have high-stress jobs requiring vigilance , especially when deployed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to educate military members and veterans regarding the benefits of adequate sleep , typical amounts of sleep needed and strategies to promote good sleep hygiene . <h> Summary <p> This study assessed 3,152 U.S. Army soldiers 90-180 days after completion of redeployment in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) that ranged from six to 15 months to determine the prevalence of Short Sleep Duration ( SSD ) . Most soldiers ( 72 percent ) reported SSD , defined as reliably getting less than seven hours of sleep per night . The majority ( 93 percent ) were enlisted soldiers and the remaining 7 percent were officers . Participant age ranged from 18-54 , though males in their 20s comprised the largest group ( 72 percent ) . <p> The analyses found that SSD was more common for soldiers who had combat exposure . SSD was also associated with symptoms of depression , Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) , panic disorder and high-risk behaviors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse , as well as suicide attempts . Seventy five percent of soldiers diagnosed with PTSD reported sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers , and those who experienced combat are at increased risk for persistent SSD along with comorbidities associated with SSD. 60005 @qwx920005 <p> While there are many problems associated with short sleep duration and other sleep disorders , the relationship with PTSD is quite strong . Psychologists are encouraged to assess for sleep problems with military personnel with PTSD and develop a comprehensive plan to address both problems when present . Additionally , those who have one problem but not the other might benefit from psychoeducation or some prophylactic intervention in order to reduce the likelihood of developing the associated problem . <h> Summary <p> In this study , 29,640 male active duty members of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps who had a blast-related traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) and sleep problems were tested to find out whether their sleep problems were related to a subsequent diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) or depression . There is correlation between TBI and later development of mental health problems , but less is known about the mediating variables . <p> The prospective study evaluated symptoms at two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months post-deployment . The results found that if sleep problems are controlled adequately , the odds of receiving a positive PTSD screening during a follow-up significantly decreased for a person already screened positive for TBI . Additionally , controlling sleep problems decreased the chances of military personnel with a positive TBI screening result later developing depression . Controlling sleep problems mediated 26 percent of a TBI 's effect on development of PTSD , and 41 percent of a TBI 's effect on development of depression . 60005 @qwx920005 <p> Psychologists treating active duty military and veterans may want to screen for sleep difficulties in addition to mental health symptoms and history of traumatic brain injury . This data suggests that those individuals who are able to control their sleep problems are less likely to develop other problems . Psychologists have a variety of strategies to help individuals with sleep and may therefore be able to ameliorate some of the challenges faced by this population . <h> Summary <p> Data was analyzed on 423 veterans who received care at the Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) between 2000 and 2006 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45.4 percent of those who had committed suicide had clinician documented sleep disturbance , whereas 54.6 percent had no recorded sleep problems . Sleep disturbance included a variety of problems , including insomnia and nightmares . <p> The presence of psychiatric or substance use symptoms was significantly associated with sleep disturbance . Even after controlling for age and psychiatric and substance use problems , clinician documented sleep disturbance predicted a shorter time to suicide following patients ' last VHA visit . 60005 @qwx920005 <p> Sleep disturbance encompasses a range of problems from actual disorders to poor sleep and nightmares . Sleep problems also are connected to a variety of mental health concerns such as anxiety and depression .

@@101644279 @5844279/ <h> 2010 Medicare payment changes : Questions and answers <p> Learn how the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid final fee schedule rule affects you 60006 @qwx920006 <p> November 23 , 2009 " The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) recently released its final rule on the 2010 fee schedule . The rule includes changes to Medicare payments for the practice expense portion of all covered services , including those commonly billed by psychologists . <p> Based on the final rule , Medicare payments for psychological services are scheduled to be reduced an average of 2 percent per year for the four-year period beginning January 1 , 2010 and lasting through 2013 . <p> This article contains answers to questions from psychologists about this adverse provision of the rule . <p> Why are practice expense values changing ? Practice expense relative values are the portion of the Medicare fee schedule that recognizes the direct and indirect costs of providing services " including rent , utilities , supplies , equipment and staff . <p> CMS began utilizing resource-based practice expense relative value units in the Medicare fee schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methodology for calculating practice expense values , an action that stemmed in part from requirements under the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 and was designed to make practice expense values more specific to the service provided . The effects of that change have been phased in over the past three years with the transition scheduled to conclude with the 2010 fee schedule . Under the 2005 methodology , practice expense values were reduced by approximately 2 percent each year from 2006 to 2009 . <p> Amid concerns that CMS was using outdated information , a multispecialty survey was launched in 2007-2008 to obtain current data about the indirect costs of providing services . Prior to this survey , there was no baseline indirect practice expense data for a number of specialties , including psychology . Since 1998 , psychologists ' overhead expenses per hour had been linked to those reported by psychiatrists . The recent survey provides more specific indirect cost data for psychology and the other specialties . <p> CMS will now make payment determinations based on survey data that more accurately reflect the indirect costs associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that indirect practice expenses are lower . See the Q and A below about the involvement of the American Psychological Association ( APA ) in this process for further information . <p> Who is affected by the changes ? All providers of Medicare services will be affected by the changes . Beyond psychology , other specialties also will experience significant reductions in practice expense - and , therefore , in their Medicare payments . For example , practice expense values for cardiologists are cut by 10 percent , while radiologists will lose 14 percent and nuclear medicine will drop 15 percent . <p> What does the new rule mean for me and what can I expect in 2010 ? CMS will begin to implement the changes to practice expense values for services provided on or after January 1 , 2010 . While the rule proposed by CMS last summer planned to reduce Medicare payments for psychological services by an average of 7 percent , the final rule will phase in reductions over four years " resulting in a lesser immediate impact of an average of 2 percent for services in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 percent on average in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 as well " resulting in a total reduction of 8 percent when fully phased in . The average impact on psychological services increased from 7 to 8 percent because CMS adjusted its formula so that indirect costs represent a higher proportion of the final payment . Further , to maintain budget neutrality as required for Medicare , the higher reduction in payment for psychological services resulted from other services having increases in practice expenses . <p> Importantly , the changes will not equally affect all services . The chart below projects payment changes for the most commonly billed psychological services . <p> *2010 fees are based on the 2009 conversion factor and do not reflect the projected SGR cut . **The 5 percent restoration for psychotherapy services is not included in these calculations . <p> How are the changes calculated ? Practice expense values are expected to change for all services provided by psychologists . Not all psychological services will see the same rate of change in their practice expense values because of the way the values are calculated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple factors used to calculate both the direct and indirect costs of the service . Factors included in the formula used by CMS are : <p> Direct Costs <p> Supplies , equipment , clinical staff time/cost ; <p> Utilization rate for each service plus the sites-of-service ( in-office or in a facility ) ; <p> Current pool of practice expense values allocated to direct costs for all services in the fee schedule ; <p> Conversion factor ; and <p> Budget neutrality factor . <p> Indirect Costs <p> Survey data of rent , utilities , administrative staff and numbers of hours per year that the practice is open ; <p> Current pool of practice expense values allocated to indirect costs for all services in the fee schedule ; <p> Conversion factor ; and <p> Budget neutrality adjustment . <p> The direct and indirect costs are calculated separately and then blended into the final practice expense value . In most cases , the practice expense values account for approximately 30 percent of the total payment for psychological services . <p> The Medicare payment formula consists of three types of relative value units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units into a dollar amount . The average Medicare fee is derived by adding together each of the relative values - work , practice expense , and malpractice expense - and then multiplying that sum by the conversion factor . A geographic price adjustment may also be made to reflect the added costs of providing services in some areas . <p> How was the APA involved in the survey process ? Following the implementation of the 2005 revised methodology that resulted in annual reductions in practice expense values from 2006 to 2009 , the American Medical Association , the APA and fifty other physician and non-physician organizations were concerned that CMS was using outdated information that was resulting in lower practice expense values . Together the organizations sought an independent , multi-specialty survey to obtain current data about the indirect costs of providing services , and the APA arranged for psychologists to participate in the survey . <p> Independent research firm DMR Kynetec administered the surveys and The Lewin Group analyzed the non-physician survey data , which was then sent to CMS for use in the calculation of practice expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the survey data when it issued the proposed rule on the 2010 fee schedule on July 13 . <p> The APA was greatly concerned that the proposed rule from CMS projected a 7 percent cut on average for services provided by psychologists and immediately sought the survey data to examine for flaws in its administration , approach and findings . Because the APA and other specialty societies kept pressing for the data , AMA finally released important details about the survey on September 8 , followed by additional information including the data specific to psychology on September 29 . <p> The APA utilized the services of its actuary to review the practice expense data obtained in the survey . After confirming the validity of the data , our actuary noted some possible explanations for why the results indicated that psychologists had lower indirect practice expenses . Psychologists tend to have small practices with few administrative and clinical staff . Also , in response to the economic downturn over the past few years , psychologists likely have improved their productivity and/or reduced spending for items such as technology and office supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the survey was flawed , we would have exhausted every option to persuade and/or force CMS to revisit the changes . <p> Based on the this survey data , CMS promulgated the final rule on October 30 , projecting a phased-in 8 percent cut through 2013 ( 2 percent per year beginning in 2010 ) on average for services provided by psychologists . <p> Why are certain services , such as neuropsychological testing , hit harder than others ? Neuropsychological testing is unique because of the supplies and equipment that are used to provide these assessments . Due to the costs for supplies and equipment , the practice expense values for neuropsychological testing services account for a larger percentage of the total fee than they do for psychotherapy or psychological testing . As a result , reductions in the practice expense values for neuropsychological testing " including changes in indirect costs such as rent , utilities and administrative staff " have a greater impact on the final payment than do practice expense reductions for other psychological services . <p> One additional factor reflected in these reductions is that the percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing . Currently , direct costs represent 63 percent of the total practice expense relative value , while indirect costs represent 37 percent . Effective January 1 , 2010 , the direct costs will represent just 51 percent of the total value , while the indirect costs will rise to 49 percent . CMS is making this change having concluded that the data from the multi-specialty survey indicate that direct costs make up a smaller percentage of the total practice expense costs for almost every single specialty surveyed . <p> In summary , neuropsychological testing is harder hit because : ( 1 ) The indirect practice expense costs applied to all of psychology will be lower for 2010 ; ( 2 ) The lower indirect costs will make up a larger percentage of the total payment ; and ( 3 ) Direct costs , which are higher for neuropsychological testing than other psychological services , now represent a smaller portion of the total payment . <p> Services for psychological and neuropsychological testing by a computer will have their practice expense values raised .

While the APA 's options are limited in response to the new rule on practice expense values , we continue to do all we can to influence those aspects of the reimbursement formula upon which we can have the maximum impact . <p> The APAPO is actively lobbying Congress to extend the restoration we won in 2008 providing an extra 5 percent for psychotherapy services for an additional two years to 2012 . The restoration extender was included in the recently House-passed Affordable Health Care for America Act ( H.R. 3962 ) , as well as the Senate Finance Committee 's America 's Healthy Future Act . The APAPO continues to work to ensure the provision is included in the Senate 's health care reform bill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Final payment amounts for 2010 will not be known until Congress decides if and how to address the Sustainable Growth Rate ( SGR ) cut currently projected by CMS to reduce all payments by 21.2 percent . Congress is expected to prevent the SGR cuts through legislation later this fall , and the APAPO is working with other providers to ensure passage of this critical measure . <p> In addition , coinsurance parity in Medicare will be phased in starting in 2010 when Medicare 's payment rises to 55 percent and the beneficiary 's portion drops to 45 percent . Full parity " with 80 percent paid directly by Medicare , just as for physical health services " will take effect in 2014.

The ONC also was tasked to support the work of a federally recognized standards-setting body ( the National eHealth Collaborative ) to provide interoperability , privacy and security , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and local governments , as well as various health care systems , insurers , hospitals and communities across the country also have been working toward electronic patient records for some time . Certain distinct and insular health systems , such as the Veterans Administration health care system , already have electronic records in place . <p> It is believed that the use of HIT in the creation of electronic health patient records will : <p> Allow for comprehensive management of health information and help patients maintain and share their records securely with their health providers ; <p> Give health providers ready access to complete patient information in a standard , electronic form for medical decisions and for payment purposes ; and <p> Improve early detection of disease outbreaks and chronic disease management . <p> While there is a widespread belief that the administrative , quality-of-care and other efficiencies associated with HIT will mean that electronic records will substantially lower health care costs across the system , HIT implementation may be expensive , particularly for larger entities , such as hospitals and insurers . These and other health care entities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help address these costs . <p> In addition , the APAPO and other organizations have insisted that privacy and security standards must be a core component of HIT and electronic records ' development to address particular concerns with movement of records from a paper-based to an electronic-based system . <p> The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) Privacy , Security and related Rules ( which took effect beginning in 2003 ) were the federal government 's first major effort to encourage a national electronic records system . While significant , these voluntary standards apply only to " covered entities , " meaning health providers , health plans , and health care clearinghouses ( usually those entities that assist providers or health plans with records processing ) . <h> The HITECH Act Seeks to Accomplish a National Electronic Patient Records System in Three Ways . The New Law " <p> Funds the ONC and places it under U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) oversight . To this end , the HIT standards-setting process is also funded and placed under HHS . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ONC will then present any recommendation that it endorses to the HHS Secretary , who then may adopt the standards through regulation to apply to the health system . <p> In addition to endorsing standards for HHS consideration , the ONC will coordinate HIT efforts among federal agencies , shepherd the overall federal strategic plan for adoption , and certify HIT technology for use in the system . <p> Provides grants and loans to health care providers " including psychologists " hospitals , nursing facilities , federally qualified health centers , community mental health centers and other entities in the health care system for implementation of HIT into their practices and facilities . <p> Primarily , HHS will provide grants to states to assist their efforts in promoting HIT technology and adoption of electronic patient records by providers . HHS will also establish through the states and Indian tribes a loan program to assist with adoption . <p> The ONC also may offer HIT technology to health providers for a " nominal " fee , unless the HHS Secretary determines that their needs are already being met through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smaller , low income or rural providers . <p> HHS will provide an extension program " including through regional centers " to assist providers as they adopt certified technology into their practices and facilities . Regional centers will focus assistance on rural and individual and small group practices , among other providers . <p> HHS will provide grants for demonstration programs for the development of academic curricula that integrates HIT technology into the clinical education of health professionals , including for graduate programs in behavioral or mental health . <p> In another part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , Congress provides for Medicare incentive payments to physicians for the adoption of certified HIT technology into their ( non-hospital-based ) practices . These payments are significant in the first year and are phased out over a five year period . The stimulus package also provides for hospital incentive payments and modest Medicaid payments for a limited pool of providers ( psychologists are not eligible ) . HHS may provide funding to support the development and adoption of electronic records for providers not eligible for these incentive payments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be applied to other providers . <p> In general . ONC must ensure that patient 's records are " secure and protected " and that the standards setting committees provide for such standards . <p> Privacy officer . A new HHS Chief Privacy Officer will advise the ONC on privacy and security issues and coordinate HHS work with other federal agency and state and regional efforts . <p> Applies HIPAA to electronic records networks . The HITECH Act expands the HIPAA Privacy , Security , and other requirements to apply to other entities beyond HIPAA covered entities , by deeming them as " business associates " of covered entities . Through this provision , Health Information Exchanges , Regional Health Information Organizations , and E-prescribing Gateways , for example , are now covered by HIPAA , when they act on behalf of providers , insurers or other covered entities . <p> Study on records ' vendors . HHS will conduct a study and report to Congress on the privacy and security standards that should be applied to vendors of patient records . A vendor is an entity which maintains patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business associate of a covered entity under the law . <p> Stronger state laws preserved . The new law preserves stronger state privacy and related laws through application of the HIPAA preemption standard . <p> Sensitive records segmentation . The standards committees must specifically make recommendations regarding technologies that provide for segmentation of particularly sensitive health information ( mental health and substance use information would fall into this category ) . " Segmentation " is a concept that would provide additional protections for these records from inappropriate disclosure beyond treating providers . <p> Mental health testing records . Requires that HHS shall conduct a study on inclusion of mental health testing records in the current HIPAA Privacy Rule psychotherapy notes authorization requirement , which requires specific patient authorization of release of psychotherapy notes to entities beyond his or her treating provider . <p> Minimum necessary . Reaffirms the HIPAA Privacy Rule protection that disclosure of information must be confined to a limited data set of information on the patient or to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the disclosure . The HHS Secretary will issue further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Private pay opt-out .

An affiliate of APA , the APAPO 's mission to advance , protect and defend the professional practice of psychology is supported by Practice Assessment payments . <p> This article provides answers to common questions from APA members about the Practice Assessment . <p> Why is the Practice Assessment needed ? <p> The Practice Assessment provides vital resources to the APA Practice Organization , which assertively promotes the professional interests of practicing psychologists in all settings . The APA is limited in doing this activity because of its tax status . <p> APA 's practitioner members established the Practice Assessment more than 20 years ago to provide extra resources needed beyond APA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests . <p> As APA is a 501(c) ( 3 ) tax-exempt organization under IRS rules , it is legally limited in the amounts and types of advocacy efforts it can pursue . Providing for additional resources in order to confront persistent challenges and cultivate opportunities for practicing psychologists took a major step forward in 2001 with the advent of the APA Practice Organization . Created as a 501(c) ( 6 ) tax-exempt organization , the APAPO is able to engage in unrestricted advocacy in support of practicing psychologists , limited only by available resources . <p> How does the Practice Assessment benefit me ? <p> The APAPO works on many fronts to remove barriers to psychological services and position professional psychology for the future . The following examples represent just a few of the successes from 2008 achieved with Practice Assessment monies : <p> The APA Practice Organization played a key role in achieving the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 by negotiating with traditional opponents of mental health parity , crafting legislative language and leading a coalition that supported the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. took a great step forward in the long fight to end insurance discrimination against those seeking treatment for mental health and substance use disorders . This success will be key in keeping mental health parity at the forefront of the upcoming national health care reform debate . <p> The APAPO advocated for the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 ( H.R. 6331 ) that restored $45 million for psychotherapy and related services , halted the 10.6 percent Sustainable Growth Rate ( SGR ) cut and provided a Medicare payment update for 2009 . The APAPO also gained a provision that will phase in Medicare coinsurance parity . <p> An October 2008 law " the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act ( MIOTCRA ) " reauthorizes for five years beginning in 2009 a grant program designed to improve mental health services delivery to non-violent offenders . The APAPO and grassroots psychologists advocated strongly for passage and funding of this legislation . <p> In 2008 alone , the APAPO provided more than $600,000 to state , provincial and territorial psychological associations to support initiatives that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend and advance psychology 's scope of practice , seek prescriptive authority laws and other advocacy efforts . <p> In addition to helping state associations advocate for better managed care reimbursement within the bounds of antitrust law , the APAPO is conducting a pilot survey in selected states to gauge member satisfaction with managed care and insurance companies . This survey is designed to demonstrate to employers , consumers , state regulators and the companies themselves which ones do better or worse in providing access to psychologists , authorizing necessary care and respecting patient privacy . <p> Licensed APA members who provide health or mental health services or supervise those who do pay the Practice Assessment , which supports the work of APA Practice Organization on behalf of professional psychology . The Practice Assessment is included in a separate section in the APA member dues statements The base Practice Assessment amount of $140 for 2011 is noted on the APA dues statements sent in September 2010 . ( Certain limited adjustments described below may apply . ) <p> Why does the Practice Assessment increase each year ? <p> As APA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Practice Assessment annually by a cost-of-living increase based on the consumer price index . This adjustment enables the assessment to keep pace with inflation . For example , the base Practice Assessment increased four dollars from $133 for the 2008 dues year to $137 for 2009 . <p> Can I pay a reduced fee ? <p> Several categories of members are able to claim an " adjustment " that results in a reduced Practice Assessment or no payment due . <p> For example , early career psychologists licensed for 12 months or less pay $25 , while those licensed for 13 to 24 months pay $75 . <p> Members engaged in the provision of health or mental health services or clinical supervision thereof for less than five hours per week pay a Practice Assessment of $85 . This adjustment may apply , for example , to an early career psychologist raising a family or to a late-career psychologist winding down his or her practice . <p> Licensed psychologists who are not engaged in providing any health or mental health services ( including supervising those who do provide those services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychologists claim an adjustment on their dues statement reflecting their non-practitioner work settings . These adjustments include : employed solely as an academic administrator or faculty member ( e.g. , dean , professor ) ; employed solely in a non-health-related capacity by public or private organizations ( e.g. , research consultant , I/O consultant ) ; employed solely in providing education-related services in an institutional setting . Finally , APA members who qualify for Full Life Status or reduced dues as a result of hardship pay no Practice Assessment . <p> The list of " Practice Assessment Adjustments " and corresponding payment due for each is included annually in the APA Dues Statement Instructions . <p> Why is n't the Practice Assessment part of my APA dues ? <p> As noted earlier , Practice Assessment monies support the work of the APA Practice Organization , a legally separate entity with a different IRS status than APA .

APA members who pay the annual Practice Assessment to APAPO are constituents of the APA Practice Organization . We are dedicated to serving the professional interests and needs of members in varied practice settings and at all stages of their career . <h> Slide 8 <p> I 'd like to highlight the advocacy work in support of professional psychology that we do through the APA Practice Organization , beginning with legislative advocacy . All of the legislative advocacy on behalf of practice is done through the APA Practice Organization . This is one of APAPO 's major functions . <p> This year 's top legislative priorities will be reflected in the messages that our State Leadership Conference participants take to hundreds of meetings next month with their members of Congress and staff on Capitol Hill : <p> First , Medicare payment . Because private reimbursement rates follow Medicare 's lead , Medicare payment is crucial for safeguarding reimbursement for psychological services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of Medicare payment : the Medicare payment formula , which penalizes providers like psychologists , the Sustainable Growth Rate formula , or SGR , and sequestration , which involves annual across-the-board Medicare payment cuts through 2026 . On Feb. 6 , three congressional committees with Medicare oversight passed legislation to repeal SGR . Our Government Relations staff is working with Congress to ensure that psychologists are included on even footing with other providers regarding payment structures and incentives as SGR and Medicare payment reform move forward . <p> Our second priority is inclusion of psychologists in the " physician " definition under Medicare . Unnecessary physician supervision requirements in Medicare hamper psychologists from providing to Medicare patients their full range of services within state licensure . So , we continue urging Congress in 2014 to pass bills that include psychologists in the Medicare " physician " definition . Gaining this victory would end inappropriate physician supervision without increasing Medicare costs . <p> And our third legislative priority is psychologists ' eligibility for federal incentive payments to adopt electronic health record keeping . We are continuing to call on Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal incentive payments already available to certain providers who integrate electronic health records into their practice . Psychology has now gained three bills , two in the Senate and one in the House of Representatives , to accomplish this goal . <h> Slide 9 <p> Working in a partisan Congress has certainly been a challenge . In a climate of near-constant gridlock and ongoing pressure to slash federal spending , coupled with lost psychology champions like Rep. Henry Waxman , D-CA and Rep. George Miller , D-CA , and Senators Max Baucus , D-MT , and Jay Rockefeller , D-WV , we 've had our work cut out for us . <p> But despite the challenging environment on Capitol Hill , we have achieved some recent gains in the legislative and regulatory arenas . The release of the Medicare final fee schedule for 2014 by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services marked the first time since 2007 that the payment pool allocated for Medicare psychological services was increased . <p> We support the recent congressional legislation to repeal the SGR and have provided comments about ways the legislation could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule . <p> APAPO has successfully advocated 16 times to help prevent the SGR cut from going into effect , and we are pleased that Congress is moving forward on this issue . The process still has a long way to go , however , since there is not yet any agreement on how to pay for the more than $100 billion the legislation is projected to cost . <h> Slide 10 <p> In addition to our legislative advocacy , APAPO 's work on behalf of the practice community involves the legal system and regulatory processes affecting practice . <p> The APA Practice Organization remains actively involved in monitoring implementation of the 2008 federal mental health parity law and intervening as appropriate . Since 2011 , APAPO has been collaborating with 11 state psychological associations to challenge unprecedented rate cuts by Humana as a violation of the Interim Final Rule related to the parity law . The Final Parity Rule released in Nov. 2013 affirms the importance of the provider reimbursement requirement under the parity law . <p> In January 2014 , at the request of the Department of Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and five areas of importance for psychologists and access to psychological services " including the need for enforcement , the problem with reimbursement disparities , transparency of medical necessity criteria and other issues . <h> Slide 11 <p> Last year we began our advocacy work to ensure that state health insurance exchanges provide proper access to psychological services . In September 2013 APAPO sent a joint letter to Connecticut 's Lieutenant Governor expressing concern with the behavioral health fee schedules published by HealthyCT , one of the plans in the state exchange . The plan 's reimbursement schedule omitted neuropsychologists from the providers listed for neuropsychological services and gave psychologists the same payment rate as masters-level mental health providers . <p> APAPO and the Connecticut Psychological Association argued in their letter that these problems could create network adequacy issues and limit access to neuropsychological services in CT . The HealthyCT plan has indicated that they intend to address our concerns . <p> Also in 2013 , APAPO worked with at least 10 SPTAs on legislative activity related to applied behavior analysis ( ABA ) . At least 34 states already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states are currently pursuing autism legislation . Of particular concern , several state laws passed a few years ago restrict psychologists ' practice in this area . Since we became actively involved and the APAPO Board adopted its 2012 policy " Statement on Behavior Analysis and Behavior Analysts , " no new laws restricting psychologists ' practice related to applied behavior analysis have been passed . <h> Slide 12 <p> In August 2013 , the US District Court in New Jersey gave preliminary approval to a $120 million settlement of a class action lawsuit filed by psychologists , other health care professionals and patients against Aetna . The lawsuit alleges that Aetna used a faulty database from Ingenix and underpaid claims for services delivered by out-of-network providers . The APA Practice Organization has collaborated on the lawsuit with the New Jersey Psychological Association , a named plaintiff , since 2009 . As we have done with three prior class action settlements , APAPO is providing detailed guidance for members on how to submit settlement claims before the March 28 filing deadline . <p> Meanwhile , APAPO has been providing guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative practice models designed to effectively deliver psychological services in a changing health care world . We are exploring ways to further support alternative practice initiatives by state associations and individual practices . <p> Another of our marketplace initiatives is providing support to states such as New York and New Jersey that are pursuing or considering pursuing legislation to remove antiquated state laws that prohibit psychologists from forming multi-disciplinary corporations and limited liability companies . Eliminating these barriers will foster practice models that help enable integrated health care service delivery . <p> APAPO also supports Medicaid advocacy efforts taking place at the state level . Grants from our Committee for the Advancement of Professional Practice are available to states looking to modify legislation and regulations to improve Medicaid participation by psychologists and reimbursement for psychological services . In 2013 , Minnesota successfully used CAPP grant funds to gain psychologists ' reimbursement by the state Medicaid program for providing consultation services to primary care providers . <p> APAPO continues to promote psychologists ' roles in hospitals and health systems " including medical staff membership and practicing to the full scope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health reform will likely result in new opportunities for practitioners . Our Legal &amp; Regulatory Affairs staff recently completed a 50-state review of hospital medical staff membership laws in order to facilitate SPTA advocacy in this area . <h> Slide 13 <p> Now I want to shift the focus to how we help individual members with their professional needs and interests . Year after year , we assist more than one thousand practitioners with a wide range of legal and regulatory questions and concerns . Here 's just a brief sample of topics and issues where we frequently have inquiries from members : <p> HIPAA . APAPO has developed and updated several resources to aid members with HIPAA compliance . The resources are found in the HIPAA Compliance section of APAPO 's Practice Central website . <p> Record keeping . Increasingly , we assist members with questions about electronic health recordkeeping , ranging from very basic information to far more technical inquiries .

We 've had an increased volume of these calls in the wake of the Newtown and other shootings . Psychologists typically want to know if duty to warn applies to particular practice situations and what professional responsibilities they may face . <h> Slide 14 <p> The HIPAA Final Rule went into effect in September 2013 , and as I just mentioned , APAPO has worked diligently to aid members with compliance . <p> Available HIPAA compliance materials on our website include : <p> The HIPAA Final Rule : What you need to do now , a free resource for APA Practice Organization members , with inserts to update existing HIPAA forms used by practitioners . It also provides a detailed explanation of key changes for psychologists in the Final Rule . <p> In response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about HIPAA compliance , we published related articles and videos regularly in our member communications . <h> Slide 15 <p> I 'd like to focus a bit more on our marketplace advocacy for practicing psychologists and psychological services . <p> Health care reform is one of our primary APAPO marketplace advocacy initiatives . In 2014 , for the second year in a row , health care reform implementation is reflected in the theme of our annual State Leadership Conference . This year , the focus for SLC is on Creating Roadmaps for Practice . <p> Also related to health care reform , the health insurance exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act create a marketplace for millions of individuals to purchase private health care coverage . In anticipation of their rollout in January 2014 , we mounted an educational campaign through our regular member communications channels to educate our practitioners about the exchanges and potential issues related to psychologists ' involvement . <h> Slide 16 <p> Among their efforts to engage psychologists in state-based implementation of health care reform , numerous SPTAs have convened health care reform summits . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forums for positioning psychologists to play a role in health care reform as it evolves at the state level . I 've had the pleasure of participating in 19 of these summits since 2011 . <h> Slide 17 <p> Keeping a pulse on member needs and interests helps inform our advocacy work and member communications . In November 2013 , we conducted a survey of APAPO members that builds off two previous member surveys from 2008 and 2011 . The surveys provide valuable insights into the professional interests and concerns of our members . <p> I want to share just a couple highlights from our 2013 member survey results . Between 80 and 90 percent of respondents indicate that they are " extremely interested " or " interested " in having information from us about the following topics : legal updates , regulatory compliance such as HIPAA , psychology-related news , legislative updates , ICD code usage and information on the latest treatment procedures and models . <p> A majority of respondents also indicated that they are interested in having information about working with Medicare and Medicaid as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Slide 18 <p> Protecting reimbursement for psychological services continues to be a top priority for members , with 98 percent indicating that it is " extremely important " or " important " for APA Practice to pursue .

These results suggest that our major activities through both the APA Practice Organization and APA Practice Directorate match closely with members ' perception of importance . <p> Stay tuned for more member survey results through our regular member communication channels . <h> Slide 19 <p> We use a variety of mechanisms to inform members about what APAPO is doing to advocate on their behalf and to provide information and resources that psychologists need to practice in today 's evolving health care marketplace . <p> Our award-winning Good Practice print magazine , which helps members keep apprised of important developments and offers practical guidance , continues to be a highly-valued resource for members . <p> Our online home for APAPO members is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited the Practice Central website in 2013 , up from just over 250,000 the year before . Reimbursement for new psychotherapy billing codes , HIPAA compliance and information about ICD-10-CM were the most popular topics in 2013 . We 're continuing to expand the wide range of information and resources available at Practice Central for practitioners at various stages of their career and in diverse practice settings . <h> Slide 20 <p> The laws and regulations that fundamentally affect the day-to-day practice of psychology are enacted and implemented at the state level . So many of our advocacy activities involve partnering with state , provincial and territorial psychological associations , or SPTAs . <p> The APA Practice Organization Committee for the Advancement of Professional Practice , or CAPP , provides hundreds of thousands of grant dollars annually to SPTAs for organizational infrastructure support and legislative advocacy initiatives . CAPP grants also are awarded for emergency requests as well as to the Council of Professional Associations of Psychologists in Canada . <p> I 'm happy to report that , although we 've had to trim APAPO expenses in other areas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same level as in 2012 . Each year , many SPTAs benefit from the funds provided by CAPP grants . For example , 26 states and DC received organizational development grants last year , while 13 states were provided with legislative grants . <h> Slide 21 <p> This slide shows just a few examples of how CAPP legislative grants for 2013 supported a variety of professional initiatives , such as : <p> And supporting the inclusion of psychologists in the legislative process as Vermont considers a single payer plan . <h> Slide 22 <p> APAPO is fighting for practitioners on Capitol Hill , in the courts and the marketplace . We 're the only national organization with such a broad advocacy agenda working exclusively on behalf of the professional practice community . If we were n't here for psychology practice , who else would be ? <p> Here 's some of what the profession would sacrifice if not for APAPO : <p> Challenging Medicare and private sector payment cuts <p> Supporting litigation and regulatory action against managed care/insurance company abuses <p> Advocating for practitioners ' interests in health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state licensing laws <p> Confronting assaults on psychologists ' scope of practice <p> Our APAPO budget relies heavily on Practice Assessment revenues .

The greater our numbers , the more we can do on behalf of professional psychology . As we repeatedly tell our members : You help others . APAPO is here to help you . <h> Slide 23 <p> As you can see , we have a very ambitious agenda . Unlike APA , however , APAPO has a limited governance structure to support our c(6) work " just the Committee for the Advancement of Professional Practice . We need a governance group that can devote all of its time to moving our c(6) activities forward . <p> Shortly after this annual report , you will be asked to vote on a proposed motion from the Board to approve in principle sunsetting the c(3) responsibilities of CAPP so it can focus entirely on its c(6) responsibilities .

Building on past research indicating that stress is a top health concern for U.S. high school students , psychologists say that if teens do n't learn healthy ways to manage that stress now , it could have serious long-term health implications . <p> The third annual Stress in America survey polled 1,568 adults from around the nation on the stress in their lives and its effects . This year , for the first time , the report also included the results of a YouthQuery survey among 1,206 young people aged 8-17 years old on what causes their stress and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveys , conducted online by Harris Interactive on behalf of APA between July and August 2009 , are a key component of APA 's Mind/Body Health public education campaign .

More than 20 prominent outlets-most of which share the campaign 's target audience of women and families-attended the event , including the Wall Street Journal , Prevention , Self , Ladies Home Journal , Family Circle , Women 's Day and Redbook . ( See related story on media coverage of the 2009 Stress Survey . ) <p> APA Executive Director for Professional Practice Katherine C.

Roth spoke about the importance of family-strengthening activities , such as eating meals together or taking walks , to enhance communications in a family , ultimately helping to increase parental awareness of kids ' stress and worries . <p> According to the survey , many parents do n't realize how stressed their children are . Nearly half ( 45 percent ) of teens ages 13-17 said that they worried more this year , but only 28 percent of parents think their teen 's stress increased . <p> And while a quarter ( 26 percent ) of tweens ages 8-12 said they worried more this year , only 17 percent of parents believed their tween 's stress had increased . Similarly , only 2-5 percent of parents rated their child 's stress as extreme ( an 8 , 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale ) when 14 percent of tweens and 28 percent of teens said they worry " a lot " or " a great deal .

The survey showed that two-thirds ( 66 percent ) of adults living in the United States have been told by a health care provider that they have one or more chronic conditions , most commonly high blood pressure or high cholesterol . The vast majority of adults indicated that their health care provider has recommended lifestyle and behavior changes ( 70 percent ) . <p> But few adults reported that their health care provider offered support to help them make lasting changes : only 46 percent were given an explanation for the recommendation ; only 35 percent were offered advice or shown techniques to help make changes ; and only 5-10 percent were referred to another health care provider to support the adoption of lifestyle changes . <p> Further , only 48 percent of adults reported that their health care providers followed up with them to check on their progress in making lifestyle and behavior changes - such as quitting smoking , getting more sleep , reducing stress , exercising , losing weight and choosing healthier foods . <p> Those polled cited a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior changes - including lack of willpower ( 33 percent ) ; not enough time ( 20 percent ) ; and lack of confidence ( 14 percent ) .

The law becomes effective on January 1st , 2010 . Under this new law , 113 million people across the country will have the right to non-discriminatory mental health coverage , including 82 million individuals enrolled in self-funded plans ( regulated under ERISA ) , who can not be assisted by State parity laws . <h> The parity requirement <p> The new law amends the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 to require that a group health plan of 50 or more employees ( or coverage offered in connection with such a plan ) " that provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance use benefits " to ensure that financial requirements and treatment limitations applicable to mental health/substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and limitations placed on medical/surgical benefits . <p> Equity coverage will apply to all financial requirements , including deductibles , copayments , coinsurance , and out-of-pocket expenses , and to all treatment limitations , including frequency of treatment , number of visits , days of coverage or other similar limits . <p> This new law builds on the current 1996 parity law , which already requires parity coverage for annual and lifetime dollar limits . <p> Mental health and substance use disorder benefits are defined broadly to mean benefits with respect to services for mental health conditions and substance use disorders , as defined under the terms of the plan and in accordance with applicable Federal and State law . <p> A plan may not apply separate cost sharing requirements or treatment limitations to mental health and substance use disorder benefits . <p> If a plan offers two or more benefit packages , the requirements of this Act will be applied separately to each package . <p> As under the current federal parity law , mental health or substance use benefit coverage is not mandated .

A plan will make mental health/substance use disorder medical necessity criteria available to current or potential participants , beneficiaries or providers upon request . A plan must also make reasons for payment denials available to participants or beneficiaries on request or as otherwise required . <h> Preservation of state law <p> The current Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) preemption standard applies .

Private contracting is also an option for psychologists who become Medicare providers but later wish to leave the program . Psychologists who opt out and privately contract must do so for all services provided to all Medicare beneficiaries ; they can not chose to opt out of Medicare for some beneficiaries but not others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicare provider is not a prerequisite for an eligible health care professional who wishes to privately contract with a beneficiary . Yet when contacted by APA staff for information on how psychologists could privately contract , some Medicare Administrative Contractors ( MACs ) indicated that a psychologist who was not a Medicare provider must first enroll in Medicare in order to then opt out and contract privately with beneficiaries . APA advised CMS of the apparent misinformation and asked the agency to communicate its policy on private contracting to all MACs to help ensure that psychologists seeking to initiate the process receive accurate information . <p> A psychologist may not receive any Medicare payments for services furnished to a Medicare beneficiary with whom the psychologist has privately contracted . In turn , the beneficiary agrees to give up Medicare payment for services furnished by the psychologist and to pay the psychologist without regard to any limits that Medicare would otherwise apply to the charges . <p> The January 7 , 2010 CMS memorandum reminds the MACs that eligible health care professionals do not have to enroll in Medicare before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter into private contracts with Medicare beneficiaries the health care professional must file an affidavit with the MAC for their state in which they agree to not to file any Medicare claims for a period of two years and to meet certain other criteria . Psychologists interested in privately contracting with Medicare beneficiaries should contact their MAC for information about the opting out process and the requirements involved in private contracting . <p> Questions about Medicare may be directed to the Government Relations Office for APA via e-mail or 202-336-5889.

Review all information carefully , as PLC attendees are required to adhere to specific deadlines and reimbursement requirements . If you have any difficulties or questions please contact the State Advocacy Office at ( 202 ) 336-5864 . Thank you and we look forward to seeing you in March . <p> All PLC attendees are expected to participate in the Hill visits unless otherwise excused . Hill visits will take place Tuesday , March 7 , from 9:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m . <p> January always marks a fresh start . But this year , as we usher in a new presidential administration , our sense of transition and renewal is particularly strong . It gives us a chance to reflect on how our profession is also undergoing changes . Among other shifts , 2017 will likely see continued trends toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing role for technology in our practices . Some of these changes are welcome , while others will require ongoing advocacy for our interests at local , state and federal levels . <p> Perhaps it 's fitting , then , that this year we 've made some changes to our leadership conference , too . <p> At this moment of transition , we 're pleased to announce that what you know as the State Leadership Conference is now the Practice Leadership Conference ( PLC ) . This name better reflects the diversity of our attendees , as well as our programmatic focus . We think that this unique intersection of professional and political change is captured by this year 's conference theme : " Practice , Politics and Policy . " <p> The practice of psychology is dependent on our ability to function in political systems . Our success in legislative spheres influences policy outcomes that have a direct impact on our practice and our patients . As a profession , we must be vigilant , organized and proactive so that lawmakers at the state and federal level understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . In 2017 , the Practice Organization will continue to support state and federal advocacy efforts regarding coding and reimbursement ; health care reform and mental health parity ; health information technology and telepsychology ; and an array of other issues that affect your ability to practice and the scope of your practice . At PLC , you will learn how to contribute to those efforts . <p> But the legislative system is n't the only political system we need to navigate . As practitioners , we also must be skilled and savvy about navigating the politics of practice , whether we 're in private practice or we 're working for universities , hospitals , clinics , corporations , non-profits , or in any other practice setting . Some of you may also want to get involved in your state associations or other professional governance committees , which require certain sets of skills in order to be effective . We will equip you with these skills at PLC , as well as give you ample opportunities to connect with one another and strengthen your networks . <p> Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acronym . Many of you are aware that APA and the Practice Organization are facing significant financial challenges . To address those challenges , we have reduced the overall length of the program by starting with an opening reception at 5 p.m. on Saturday ( rather than with our traditional event at 1 p.m. ) , and we have reformulated our funding for some attendees . Be sure to carefully review all of the registration and reimbursement information on the web-based invitation . <p> These decisions were n't easy , but we welcomed this moment as an opportunity to think creatively and strategically about the future of PLC " and about how together we can shape the future of the profession .

The letter expressed concern with the behavioral health fee schedules published by HealthyCT , one of the QHPs participating in Connecticut 's HIE . <p> Under that plan 's reimbursement system , only medical doctors and advanced practice registered nurses ( APRNs ) are reimbursed for neuropsychological assessment . The fee schedule that includes neuropsychologists " the predominant providers of neuropsychological services " disallows reimbursement for neuropsychological assessment .

Blogging has emerged as an innovative marketing tool for psychologists , but it remains a resource untapped by most practitioners . <p> What 's a blog ? A blog is an online journal . Bloggers use their blogs to state opinions , post information or commentary , articulate ideas and share links to other resources . Viewable to others , blogs are typically set up in an interactive format that encourages readers to post their comments below each entry . As you blog , your most recent entries are displayed at the top of the Web page . To keep the information organized , older entries are archived by date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may feature photographs , videos and audio clips . You can set up a blog in minutes and , if used correctly , it can be a powerful , low-cost ( or even free ) marketing tool . <p> Why blog ? In addition to functioning as a mechanism for providing public education and sharing a psychologist 's expertise with the community , blogs can help shape your professional image , increase your online presence , establish your status as an expert and offer potential clients and referral sources a glimpse of who you are and the value your services can provide . Blogging is an easy-to-use , flexible way to supplement your broader marketing strategy . Used in conjunction with a Web site , a frequently updated blog can boost your Web traffic and provide the personal touch you might not relay through your Web site alone . <p> The frequent posts and common linking associated with blogs make it more likely that your information will come up on search engines and be seen not only by avid bloggers but also by the casual Web surfer . Although delving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blogs offer a simple and cost-effective way to reach a new generation of clients for whom blogs and podcasts are second-nature . <p> Getting started Before starting your own blog , get your feet wet by using Google Blog Search , Technorati or another blog search engine to find existing blogs that interest you and learn from them . Blogs come in all shapes and sizes , so get a sense of which ones pique your interest and why . What writing style do you find most engaging ? What length and format are easiest to read ? What topics seem to generate the most comments from readers ? Keeping up with all of the blogs you 're interested in can be very time consuming , as they are often updated frequently . Rather than visiting the Web page for each blog every time you want to check for new postings , consider the time-saving approach of subscribing to the blogs you want to follow . <p> Blogs typically contain " feeds , " which may be listed as RSS , XML , Atom or web feeds ( look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscribe on the page ) . Regardless of which format is used , a feed provides a way for the blog to push updated content to you , rather than your searching for it . You can use a feed reader or aggregator , such as Google Reader , Bloglines or NewsGator to subscribe to blogs , or add them to the Feeds section of Internet Explorer 's Favorites Center . If you have an iGoogle homepage , you can even have Google Reader appear on the page as a gadget , so any new blog posts are right at your fingertips . <p> Once you 've identified blogs that capture your interest and gotten the feel of the format , start posting comments to blog entries and sharing your expertise . When you leave comments , be sure to include a signature line with your name and the URL of your Web site .

A number of Web sites offer free blogging services , which allow you to quickly set up a blog . Examples include Blogger , WordPress and LiveJournal . Although these free services are typically robust and flexible enough for most bloggers , those who need more advanced features and are willing to spend some money can explore paid blogging providers such as TypePad and Moveable Type . <p> Blogging in practice Once you have set up your blog , it 's important to update it with short , informal entries at least several times a month , if not weekly . The more timely and relevant your blog entries , the more interest and traffic you will receive . A variety of formats lend themselves to blog posts , including topical summaries , quick tips , short anecdotes , commentary on current issues and descriptions of and links to additional sources for information . The idea is to keep the material fresh to keep readers coming back . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about those topics . You can begin by creating entries that you think would be of interest to your existing and potential clients . For example , if you provide couple 's therapy , the morning a new research study is released on the benefits of marital therapy you might familiarize yourself with the study and post a review of the article in your blog , including links to the study and other relevant resources . By blogging , you can help people find information they can use to make well-informed decisions about how and when they might benefit from seeking psychological services . You also establish yourself as an expert and demonstrate that you stay up to date on the latest research in your area of practice . <p> Notably though , there is no roadmap or guide on how one should blog .

@@101644382 @5844382/ <h> Research roundup : PTSD beyond the DSM-IV criteria <p> Emotions not addressed in the diagnostic manual that can help inform PTSD treatment are explored in this issue <p> By Practice Research and Policy staff <p> Sept. 13 , 2012 " Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) as defined by the DSM-IV is an anxiety disorder that can occur when an individual has witnessed or experienced a traumatic event . In order to meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD , one must experience a traumatic stressor , accompanied by re-experiencing , numbing/avoidance and hyper-arousal symptoms . <p> Factors including anger , aggression and a desire for revenge are not captured in current diagnostic criteria for PTSD , yet researchers and clinicians alike have noted their prevalence . The research covered in this article addresses these emotions and may help inform treatment beyond use of the DSM-IV . <p> Summary The authors conducted a meta-analysis of the current literature on anger , PTSD , and anxiety disorders to examine the degree to which anger is more likely to be specifically associated with PTSD than with other anxiety disorders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly higher levels of anger than controls , with the exception of individuals with social and specific phobia . <p> Since contemporary models often view anger as a multidimensional construct , the analysis also compared patients with anxiety disorders to control samples for differences in specific anger domains such as the tendency to suppress feelings of anger ( anger in ) , the tendency to outwardly express anger toward individuals or objects with verbal or physical aggression ( anger out ) , or the inability to overcome angry feelings ( anger control ) . Also considered were the differences between experiencing present angry feelings linked to a specific situation ( state anger ) and angry feelings that last over time and are linked to various situations ( trait anger ) . PTSD and non-PTSD anxiety disorder patients had more difficulties with anger control , anger in , and anger out than controls , but did not significantly differ on state and trait anger . <p> Practical Implications Certain anger domains appear to be uniquely associated with PTSD . Anger in PTSD may contribute to greater interpersonal difficulties , greater risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may require specific intervention in order to enhance treatment outcome . Better clinical understanding of the patient 's unique anger pattern may facilitate more targeted interventions . <p> Summary One of four criteria required by the DSM-IV for a diagnosis of PTSD is the experience of a traumatic stressor that is accompanied at the time of the event by the emotions of fear , helplessness , or horror . The workgroup report that led to the current DSM-IV PTSD diagnostic criteria noted that other emotional reactions such as guilt , dysphoria and sadness were also more commonly present in those developing PTSD after a traumatic stressor than in those who did not develop PTSD . However , the DSM-IV included only fear , helplessness and horror in the stressor criteria . Subsequent research has examined whether these three emotions are uniquely predictive of PTSD development . The goal of this study was to examine a broader range of emotional predictors of PTSD . <p> An initial pool of 771 undergraduate students in an introduction to psychology course completed a demographics form and the Brief Trauma Questionnaire ( BTQ ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure yielded a final sample of 341 participants who had experienced a potentially traumatic event . These participants then completed the PTSD Checklist-Specific ( PCL-S ) , a Likert-style scale of 17 questions designed to measure symptoms of PTSD . <p> The authors found that only anger , guilt , sadness , and disgust were predictive of PTSD . Across all groups who participated in the study , there was a significant relationship between the level of anger experienced and the severity of PTSD symptoms . <p> In both men and women , anger was a strong predictor of PTSD . Experience of other emotions varied by gender ; men demonstrated guilt as a unique predictor and women expressed emotions of disgust and sadness at the time of trauma . <p> European-American and African-American participant 's emotions varied somewhat from European-American students ' emotions of guilt , helplessness , and disgust , in addition to anger , predicting PTSD , while African-American students ' level of PTSD was predicted only by anger . <p> Practical Implications Both the DSM and the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD ) are currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revised criteria . Additional research is likely needed but , in the meantime , clinicians will want to explore a wide range of emotions beyond fear , helplessness and horror in order to understand clients ' response to the trauma they have experienced . <p> Summary Two decades of research consistently demonstrated that anger is a critical predictor of PTSD severity and treatment efficacy . In addition , the co-occurrence of anger with PTSD is present across a wide range of populations , including the military , emergency and disaster relief workers , crime victims , and accident survivors . PTSD , particularly when chronic , can be difficult to treat and anger has been shown to reduce the effectiveness of treatment . In this analysis , the authors reviewed studies on visual imagery in the areas of neuropsychology , psychopathology , anger and PTSD and propose that visual imagery is a significant factor in causing and sustaining anger in PTSD . <p> One aim of this review was to investigate whether visual imagery may be the distinct aspect that sets anger in PTSD apart from other types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high level of overlap in areas of the brain that are stimulated during the experience and production of both visual imagery and the emotion of anger . Evidence from research in psychopathology demonstrates that repetitive intrusive visual imagery produces negative emotions in various psychological disorders . The inability to manage negative visual imagery leads to greater mental distress . Studies on anger and PTSD evidence the strength of the relationship to visual imagery , with visual intrusions being described as a core symptom and risk factor of the disorder . The symptoms of physiological arousal that accompany anger cause intrusions and the intrusions yield a higher level of physiological arousal . Visual imagery and anger are intimately and complexly connected . <p> Practical Implications The authors suggest numerous directions for future research about the role visual imagery plays in anger in PTSD . For one , they suggest conducting studies into visual imagery capacity , which may be influenced by factors such as age , gender , culture , and developmental experiences . Another potential avenue for research would be to identify trauma-related factors that may moderate the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , non-trauma related moderators such as the individual 's personality or temperament might affect the role visual imagery plays in their PTSD . <p> Currently , there is no satisfactory model that can define the complex relationship between anger and PTSD . The authors believe inquiry into the role of visual imagery in anger in PTSD could significantly improve our understanding of this anxiety disorder and contribute to more effective treatments that focus on the role visual imagery plays in responses to trauma and assist patients with learning new ways to manage intrusive thoughts . <p> Summary While consistent evidence from numerous studies links posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) symptoms with aggression , little information exists regarding the relationship between PTSD severity and aggression after the completion of PTSD treatment . This study examined the association between PTSD and aggression by using a longitudinal data set derived from patients whose PTSD severity and aggression were reported before , immediately after and four months after intensive PTSD treatment . <p> A sample of 175 male patients admitted between 2000 and 2007 to a Veterans Affairs ( VA ) residential PTSD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-report measure using the 17 PTSD symptoms included in the DSM-IV was administered to the veterans . The questions represented three subscales that corresponded to symptom clusters of re-experiencing , avoidance/numbing and hyperarousal . <p> The patients also completed an assessment to measure aggression pre-treatment , post-treatment and at a four-month follow-up . There was a significant correlation between aggression and PTSD severity both pre-treatment and post-treatment . Of particular interest was the strong correlation between the hyperarousal symptom cluster and aggression before and after treatment . <p> Practical Implications Monitoring the symptoms of PTSD and aggression during the course of treatment is crucial . Furthermore , aggression may need to be a focus during PTSD treatment . While more evidence with larger , younger patient samples and different traumas is necessary , this study suggests that assessing aggression in the context of PTSD may lead to important information regarding post-treatment functioning . Additional studies to examine the impact of treating aggression on outcome of PTSD care will be important to better understand effective treatment and longer term patient functioning . <p> Summary Many studies have focused on PTSD among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are associated with symptoms of PTSD . These include self-oriented emotions such as shame , guilt , self-blame and other-oriented emotions such as the desire for revenge . Feelings of revenge often follow trauma that involves intentional and personal infliction of harm to an individual . <p> Two hundred and thirty-five victims of violent crime were given a three-item revenge scale to measure their feelings of revenge over the previous four weeks . Using the PTSD Symptom Scale , Self-Report ( PSS-SR ) , PTSD symptoms resulting from violent acts were assessed . An additional scale was employed to evaluate the victims ' views on perpetrator punishment severity . Finally , regression analysis was used to determine if the three PTSD symptom clusters " **25;140;TOOLONG , avoidance and/or hyperarousal " might predict feelings of revenge . <p> Of the 235 participants who took the PSS-SR , 139 experienced **25;167;TOOLONG , 107 experienced feelings of avoidance , and 160 experienced feelings of hyperarousal . The **25;194;TOOLONG symptom cluster was the only predictor of a desire for revenge . A possible explanation for the correlation between symptoms of **25;221;TOOLONG and revenge is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictive of both PTSD and revenge . The study failed to find a significant correlation between perceived punishment of the perpetrator and the victim 's feelings of revenge . <p> Practical Implications Given the finding of this study that the **25;248;TOOLONG symptom cluster positively correlates with feelings of revenge , when treating patients with a strong desire for revenge , it may be important to focus on strategies that minimize or control intrusive thoughts or assist the patient in managing re-experiencing symptoms . The authors also suggest investigating whether sensory stimuli that remind patients of their emotional and behavioral responses during the traumatic event may trigger or contribute to the intrusions . <h> Ending Notes <p> Posttraumatic stress disorder is a prevalent and debilitating disorder . Further research into the relationship between PTSD and emotions such as anger , aggression and an inclination for revenge is needed to better understand patients ' reactions to the trauma they have experienced and enhance treatment .

Medicare has taken an important step towards reversing the trajectory of downward payments for psychological services by raising the work values " reflecting cognitive effort and complexity in providing a service " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billed so frequently by mental health providers , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) decision will mean millions of dollars in additional costs to Medicare . As a result , after almost a decade of incurring some of the biggest losses among Medicare providers , the payment pool allocated to psychology will have the second highest increase in total payments allocated for 2014 . <p> Unfortunately , other adjustments to Medicare payments will chip away at these increases and at the fees for other psychological services besides psychotherapy . As disappointing as any payment losses are for psychologists , without the new higher work values for psychotherapy , the most commonly provided service by psychologists , Medicare payments for 2014 would be much lower . Through their work with the coding and reimbursement process and their advocacy to Congress and CMS , APAPO and APA have bent the payment curve in psychology 's favor . At a time when federal dollars are shrinking , APAPO positively impacted the areas over which the organization has some control . <p> Q.Why are new services like crisis psychotherapy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluation is being significantly reduced ? <p> A. The higher work values for the psychotherapy codes are a result of the critically important survey data collected by APAPO in 2012 and 2013 . Psychologists , psychiatrists and clinical social workers participating in the Relative Value Scale Update Committee ( RUC ) survey process furnished valuable information about the level of intensity and skill involved in furnishing the different psychotherapy services . They also indicated how the psychotherapy codes should be valued relative to other health care services . While some of the psychotherapy services received higher increases in their work values than others , CMS accepted all the higher work values for psychotherapy codes as recommended by the RUC . <p> As important as the work values are , the Medicare payment formula also takes overhead costs known as practice expense ( PE ) and malpractice expense into consideration . PE , which is typically low for mental health providers whose services do not involve expensive equipment , fell further when the psychotherapy codes were reviewed and inpatient overhead costs such as for nursing services that had allocated for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the diagnostic evaluation and 30-minute psychotherapy codes suffered significant losses in practice expense that offset the gains from their higher work values . <p> Q.Why are the payments for testing services being slashed ? A. The three codes for psychological testing , along with the neuropsychological testing by computer code , will suffer substantial cutbacks in 2014 . The losses for these codes are all due to a reduction in PE . According to CMS , after reviewing PE values for consistency and relativity the agency determined that certain items such as the fee and licensing costs for these codes should be categorized as indirect PE costs rather than disposable supplies . Changing how these items were classified resulted in a significantly lower PE value for each of the codes . This was an internal CMS decision based on the categorization of the factors involved in a variety of different services , not just the testing codes used by psychologists . APAPO is evaluating the rationale behind this decision to determine its advocacy options with CMS . <p> Not all of the testing codes will be reduced in 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing by a psychologist , and neuropsychological testing by a technician will see increases of 1.1 percent , 2.6 percent , and 4.1 percent , respectively . <p> Q. What exactly will my Medicare payments be in 2014 ? A. Payment schedules for each locality will be released soon by the various Medicare Administrative Contractors ( MACs ) . Psychologists should monitor the website of their regional MAC since all MACs are required to post payment schedules online . <p> Q.When will we learn if there are any changes for 2014 in Medicare 's reporting system known as PQRS ? A. APAPO is reviewing the discussion in the final rule on PQRS and will provide members with detailed information thorough the PracticeUpdate e-newsletter in January .

@@101644401 @5844401/ <h> Research roundup : The impact of Facebook on psychosocial health <p> This issue highlights research into the positive and negative impacts of social media use on psychosocial health and well-being . <p> By Practice Research and Policy staff <p> Created in 2004 , Facebook is the social media phenomenon that allows its users to create a profile , share photos , and keep in touch with friends , family and colleagues . As of December 2014 , more than 1.39 billion individuals used Facebook at least once every 30 days ( Facebook , 2014 ) . With frequent reports in the news regarding both the positive and negative impacts of social media use on psychosocial health and well-being , it is important that psychologists acquire a comprehensive picture of the existing research on Facebook . <p> The first group of studies highlighted in this research roundup examined the impact of Facebook exposure on a variety of psychological outcomes including body image , depressive symptoms and self-esteem in young adults , and investigated whether degree and direction of social comparison could explain these relations . The last study explored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socially anxious individuals . <p> In addition to reviewing the following research summaries , psychologists are encouraged to explore the literature more completely to determine what may be useful to them in practice . <h> Summaries <p> Fardouly et al ( 2015 ) conducted a cross-sectional study of 112 young adult females from the United Kingdom . Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups " browsing either through Facebook , a fashion magazine website or an appearance-neutral control website for 10 minutes and they could view any content they wished on the assigned website . <p> Participants completed measures of state negative mood and body dissatisfaction , social comparison tendencies and the Self-Discrepancy Index ( SDI ; Dittmar et al , 1996 ) . The SDI asked participants to describe three aspects of themselves that they would ideally like to change and rated how different they wished to be , as well as the importance of this change to them . Responses on the SDI were coded by the authors as pertaining to either 1 ) weight and shape , or 2 ) face , hair and skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being in a more negative mood relative to the control condition . Although there was no difference between groups in body dissatisfaction ratings or weight- and shape-related discrepancies , women in the Facebook group who reported often comparing themselves to others were more likely to wish to change the appearance of their face , hair or skin . <p> Steers et al ( 2014 ) conducted two studies to examine whether an individual 's tendency to make social comparisons underlies the relationship between Facebook use and depressive symptoms . In the first study , 180 ethnically diverse undergraduate students ( 141 females ) completed an online measure of general social comparison tendencies on Facebook and a measure of depressive symptoms , and they reported their average daily Facebook usage . <p> Analyses revealed that the more time that males and females spent on Facebook , the more depressive symptoms they reported and the more they tended to compare themselves to others . The more that males , but not females , compared themselves to others , the more depressive symptoms they reported . <p> In the second study , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks recording the frequency and length of their Facebook usage , and completed measures assessing depressive symptoms and three types of social comparison tendencies : general , upward and downward . Upward and downward social comparison refer to a tendency to compare oneself to others who appear to be doing better and worse off than themselves , respectively , for purposes of self-evaluation . <p> The authors found that the more time that individuals spent on Facebook , the more likely they were to make general or upward comparisons and the less likely they were to make downward comparisons . Greater engagement in any type of social comparison was associated with more depressive symptoms . <p> Vogel et al ( 2014 ) conducted two studies exploring the associations between exposure to Facebook , types of social comparison and changes in self-evaluation . In the first study , 145 ethnically diverse undergraduate students ( 106 female ) completed computerized questionnaires assessing frequency of Facebook use , social comparison ( upward or downward ) processes used while on Facebook , and self-esteem . Results illustrated that those who used Facebook more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report making upward and downward social comparisons . Further analyses demonstrated that upward , but not downward , social comparison explained the association between Facebook use and trait self-esteem . <p> In the second study , 128 undergraduates ( 94 female ) were randomly assigned to view one of four target Facebook profiles for three minutes and were instructed to evaluate themselves and the target individual immediately afterward . The authors manipulated the personal content ( for example , photos and statuses posted by the target ) and the social content ( such as comments and " likes " provided by the target 's social network ) of the target 's profile to be of either upward or downward comparative nature . Findings showed that people who viewed a target profile with upward social ( such as a high activity social network ) or upward personal ( such as positive photos and statuses ) content had lower reported self-esteem and more negative self-evaluations. 60005 @qwx920005 <p> These three articles demonstrate that comparing oneself to others on Facebook can be associated with multiple negative outcomes , including low self-esteem , depressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al ( 2014 ) found a negative relationship between Facebook use and downward social comparisons and Vogel et al ( 2014 ) found a positive relationship , the research illustrates that engagement in social comparison of any kind while on Facebook may be harmful to one 's psychosocial health . This could be explained in part by the fact that individuals can carefully select the photos and information they choose to display on Facebook , and so people end up comparing their own lives to inaccurate representations of others ' lives . <p> Clinicians may wish to pay close attention to the Facebook use habits of clients who struggle with their body image , particularly women with such problems as eating disorders or body dysmorphic disorder . Clinicians may also want to provide therapeutic tools that help combat feelings of self-dissatisfaction when using Facebook or other social networks , especially for clients who often compare themselves to others . While social connection is beneficial for all , exploring opportunities to connect outside of social media for those who are depressed may be especially important . <p> Determining whether Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmful for an individual may be an important discussion topic in therapy . Although Facebook is often perceived by individuals with low self-esteem as a safe environment for self-expression , clinicians may wish to consider the possibility that Facebook use perpetuates a vicious cycle for these individuals ; clients with low self-esteem may use Facebook to receive social support but in doing so expose themselves to upward social comparisons , further damaging their self-esteem and increasing their need for support from others . <h> Summary <p> Indian &amp; Grieve ( 2014 ) examined 299 young adult Facebook users ( 257 female ) to see whether perceptions of social support on Facebook were related to subjective well-being in those who have varying levels of social anxiety . Participants were split into low- and high-social anxiety groups based on their score on a measure of social fears , and everyone completed questionnaires assessing perceived social support offline and on Facebook , and well-being . Analyses revealed that , together , offline and Facebook social support predicted well-being for both social anxiety groups . Social support through Facebook was a relatively better predictor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60005 @qwx920005 <p> This article suggests that individuals use both offline and online social support to enhance personal well-being , but that for those who experience high levels of social anxiety , social support on Facebook is a more important predictor of well-being than is offline social support . <p> Clinicians may wish to encourage socially anxious clients to consider Facebook as a less overwhelming way to connect with others and potentially even as a strategy to confront social anxiety , but should be cautious not to promote long-term avoidance of face-to-face interactions in lieu of online ones . Clinicians may also want to consider Facebook as a social support tool for those who are unable to engage socially with others in person for reasons other than social anxiety ( such as distance or physical limitations ) . 
@@101644402 @5844402/ <p> This issue reviews a sampling of research related to bright light therapy and possible implications for conditions other than seasonal affective disorder . <p> By Practice Research and Policy staff <p> Bright light therapy ( BLT ) has been demonstrated to be helpful to individuals with seasonal affective disorder . More recent research is investigating whether and how it is helpful for other problems . After reading these summaries , those interested in using BLT may want to delve into the research more completely in order to make a determination of what may be useful in their practices . <h> Summary <p> Using a multilevel , mixed model design , this pilot study aimed to determine whether the therapeutic benefits of bright light therapy ( BLT ) that have been observed in treating seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) could be generalized to other mood disorders , either as an alternative or complementary to other existing treatments . Forty eight individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder were recruited from The Department of Mood Disorders , PsyQ , The Hague , Netherlands .

BLT was administered during 30-minute sessions on weekdays for up to three consecutive weeks . Participants completed the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms " Self Report ( WJDS " SR16 ) to assess the severity of their depression , and also completed the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire ( SPAQ ) to assess their mood and behavior changes . Participants completed these prior to beginning their BLT sessions , after completing their BLT sessions , and then 4 weeks after their final session . <p> Results indicated that BLT resulted in less severe depressive symptoms , regardless of type ( melancholic or atypical ) . Additionally , seasonality of depressive symptoms did not predict response to treatment . 60005 @qwx920005 <p> While BLT is often recommended for individuals with noted seasonal variations in mood difficulties , this study suggests it could possibly be an effective alternative or add-on treatment for depression regardless of its seasonal component . It also appears to benefit individuals with a variety of different symptom presentations . Psychologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to ongoing treatment with individuals who are depressed . As with any new treatment component or modality , psychologists and their patients would be encouraged to systematically track whether the addition of BLT appeared to result in changes in symptom presentation or important outcomes . <h> Summary <p> Using a single-blind study design , the authors compared the effects of blue-enriched light therapy with standard light therapy for patients diagnosed with seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) . A sample of 52 patients were selected from an initial pool of 200 for treatment at the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands . Participants were current outpatients who were screened for autumn and winter depression using the Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI-II , Dutch version ) . The 52 individuals selected for the treatment paradigm were those who scored a 15 or higher on the BDI-II-NI ( 40 females , 12 males , mean age of 38.8 years ) . Twenty eight patients had received light therapy prior to the current study , and 24 patients had not . <p> Participants either received two weeks of 20-minutes of blue-enriched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes of standard light therapy . Results indicated no significant differences between the treatment paradigms , with all three groups demonstrating similarly high treatment effects . 60005 @qwx920005 <p> Psychologists who recommend BLT to patients may want to explain the pros and cons of different types of light therapy in order to help their patients make decisions regarding which device to use . Given that participants in this study with blue-enriched light achieved similar results in 20-minute sessions to those who had 30-minute standard sessions , some individuals might prefer the blue-enriched light for efficiency reasons .

Eligibility was determined through a multi-step screening process : First , the researchers assessed applicants using the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire ( SPAQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affective disorder presentation was conducted ; third , a repeat telephone screening utilizing the SPAQ 24 hours prior to the first dose of light therapy was administered ; and finally , another SPAQ measurement was completed the morning before the first dose of light therapy to rule-out brief mood fluctuation in participants . <p> All 79 participants were exposed to two hours of light " one hour of bright light therapy and one hour of placebo , dim red light therapy . The type of light to which participants were exposed first and second was determined through a randomized process , resulting in 41 participants receiving bright light therapy during the first hour , and the remaining 38 receiving it the second hour . Results showed that exposure to bright light therapy resulted in a modest decrease of depressive symptoms associated with SAD , as measured by the Profile of Mood States Depression-Rejection ( POMS-D ) and the Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) . 60005 @qwx920005 <p> Participants experienced a modest decrease in depressive symptoms after only one hour of exposure to standard light therapy .

Psychologists may wish to have a BLT device available for patients to try so that patients can determine whether BLT might have a positive effect on their depressive symptoms . <h> Summary <p> This study was conducted to see if participants treated with cognitive behavioral therapy , light therapy , or a combination of both experienced a change in their cognition , and if this change was related to mood outcomes the following winter . Sixty nine participants received six weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy , light therapy or combination treatment . Participants were assessed for cognitive symptoms typically associated with depression/SAD , such as dysfunctional attitudes , negative automatic thoughts and rumination . <p> Several trends were observed : First , regardless of treatment modality , acute treatment was associated with reduced symptoms of dysfunctional attitude , negative automatic thoughts and rumination . Second , all three groups showed improvement the following winter although the effect appeared strongest for those in the CBT only condition . Acute treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts and rumination regardless of the treatment method being used . Additional analyses demonstrated that cognitive-behavioral therapy alone revealed a relationship between fewer dysfunctional attitudes and negative , automatic thoughts , and fewer depressive symptoms the following winter . <p> Practical Implications : While light therapy had a positive impact on participants ' symptoms of depression , cognitive-behavioral therapy appeared to have a more lasting impact the following winter on the cognitive features that contribute to depression . While light therapy is often the first choice for SAD , actively addressing underlying cognitions and challenging thoughts may lead to sustained improvements in depressed mood . Psychologists will want to evaluate the best options and combinations of treatments in order to meet the individual needs of their patients .

Anxiety can be a normal part of childhood , but children whose anxiety disorders are untreated face higher risks of performing poorly in school or turning to substance abuse . This issue of research roundup explores research areas such as treatment of child anxiety disorders with parental involvement , comorbidity with gastrointestinal issues and ADHD , and the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy . <h> Summary <p> Previous studies have demonstrated a link between anxiety disorders in youth and parental psychopathology . More specifically , studies have shown that parenting factors such as overcontrol , negativity and poor communication help maintain anxious symptomatology in children . Therefore , it has been proposed that parental involvement in the treatment of children with anxiety disorders is necessary ; however , research testing this hypothesis has yielded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted a literature review to investigate the role of parental involvement in the treatment of childhood anxiety disorders .

Across the studies reviewed , treatment outcomes differed ; some studies showed parental involvement was beneficial while others found no added benefit . This may be due to differences across studies , such as the amount and type of parent involvement . Further , parent involvement was shown to be beneficial for younger children but not older children . 60005 @qwx920005 <p> One important implication of this review is that CBT was effective without parental involvement , indicating that anxious youth can benefit from CBT treatment even if their parent is unable to participate . It may be that parental involvement could be beneficial in specific cases ( such as young girls whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be examined . The authors conclude that there is a need for large-scale methodologically-sound studies in order to address the variations in treatment outcome . Psychologists may find it advantageous to include parents when treating anxious youth , but do not need to require parental involvement as youth do seem to benefit from CBT with or without parental involvement . <h> Summary <p> While evidence from numerous studies identifies psychosocial factors that contribute to and maintain anxiety disorders in children , there is far less known about the frequency of various physical complaints that may contribute to anxiety in children . Some studies show children with anxiety experience more somatic symptoms compared to children without anxiety ; however the aim of the current study was to specifically examine the occurrence of functional gastrointestinal disorders ( FGID ) in children with clinical anxiety . <p> The sample included a total of 105 children between 6 and 13 years of age .

Additionally , children with FGID symptoms had higher levels of anxiety symptom severity . 60005 @qwx920005 <p> This study has important implications for treating children with anxiety disorders . The findings suggest that screening for FGID could help improve treatment outcomes by identifying gastrointestinal symptoms that might be interfering with treatment progress . Additionally , the findings suggest that it could be beneficial for primary care physicians and other providers to assess for anxiety if a child presents with gastrological symptoms .

Although research suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ASD , there has been limited research on the way anxiety manifests and is maintained in children with ASD .

Parents frequently stated that their child has difficulty sharing their thoughts , or that their child has cognitive distortions related to various situations . For example , one parent stated that their child thinks everyone is talking negatively about him in a social situation . The negative impact of anxiety was discussed frequently , with many parents indicating that their child 's high level of dependence on them was very challenging . 60005 @qwx920005 <p> The focus groups held with parents of children that have ASD and anxiety yielded clinically useful information related to the manifestation and maintenance of anxiety .

In the interim , clinicians may want to augment existing measures for use with their ASD clients . <h> Summary <p> Social anxiety is a common anxiety disorder affecting youth and causing significant distress and impairment . Children with social anxiety are more likely to have difficulty with friendships , family life and school . Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) is an effective treatment for youth with social anxiety .

@@101644420 @5844420/ <h> Research roundup : Hoarding <p> This roundup presents recent research and practical considerations related to hoarding , a subtype of obsessive compulsive disorder <p> By Practice Research and Policy staff <p> May 10 , 2012 " Currently considered a subtype of obsessive compulsive disorder , hoarding is characterized by three core features : the acquisition of a large number of possessions ; the failure to discard a large number of possessions ; and living in spaces that are sufficiently cluttered as to preclude their intended use . Many researchers have begun to explore behaviors and features that correlate with hoarding to better understand the condition , as well as make the case for classifying hoarding as a distinct disorder ( i.e. hoarding disorder or compulsive hoarding ) . <p> The weighted prevalence of hoarding is approximately 5.3 percent ; hoarding is twice as common in men and almost three times as common in people over the age of 55 . Moreover , hoarding is disproportionately seen among low-income populations and frequently leads to hazardous conditions , impaired functioning and increased health risks . As such , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this potentially devastating condition . <p> Due to varying definitions and measurement of hoarding/proposed Hoarding Disorder ( HD ) , comorbidity rates among this population are not consistent across studies . Using well-validated measures of hoarding and the proposed diagnostic criteria for HD in DSM-5 , comorbidity was compared across 217 participants with HD and 96 participants with obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) without hoarding . Only 18.0 percent of the HD participants met the criteria for OCD and significantly more HD participants ( 50.7 percent ) than OCD participants ( 33.3 percent ) had a comorbid condition of major depressive disorder . Social phobia ( 23.5 percent ) and generalized anxiety disorder ( 24.4 percent ) were the most frequently diagnosed anxiety disorders among HD participants but these rates were not significantly different from the rates among the OCD group . HD participants were more likely than the OCD participants to have experienced a traumatic event in adult or childhood but were not more likely to be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Over one-quarter of the HD participants met the criteria for the inattentive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the HD participants had acquisition-related impulse control problems such as compulsive buying , acquiring free things or kleptomania , both significantly higher rates than the OCD participants . <p> Practical Implications <p> Findings in this study support the notion that HD is not simply a subtype of OCD but a distinct condition related to a variety of disorders . With nearly 75 percent of the HD participants meeting the criteria for a mood or anxiety disorder , clinicians may want to investigate the onset of these disorders in order to determine whether they resulted from the significant burden and impairment of HD , or if they play a role in the development of HD . Similarly , acquisition-related impulse control problems were seen among a substantial majority of the HD participants , suggesting that they may not be comorbidities but rather part of the hoarding phenotype itself . While close to 50 percent of the HD participants reported experiencing a traumatic event , only 23 percent developed PTSD . Thus , clinicians may want to examine whether hoarding served some function ( for example , possessions are a source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which then buffered the experience of the traumatic event and prevented the development of PTSD . Future diagnostic assessments should utilize updated classification models and take into account these associations in order to inform treatment planning . <p> An increasing amount of research suggests the three core features of hoarding ( excessive acquisition , difficulty discarding and clutter ) are largely derived from impaired decision-making . Broadly defined as indecisiveness , this underlying characteristic of hoarding , as well as hoarding severity and onset , were assessed in a sample of 887 self-identified hoarders through a web-based survey . In order to examine potential biological and non-biological relative interactions , these constructs were also evaluated among 120 spouses and 295 adult children of the self-identified hoarders . Within the sample of self-identified hoarding participants , 75 percent met the proposed criteria for hoarding disorder and all indecisiveness measures were correlated with hoarding severity . Moreover , indecisiveness predicted each of the core features of hoarding above and beyond depression , anxiety and OCD symptoms , and indecisiveness was uniquely associated with age of onset of hoarding symptoms , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounted for unique variance in clutter , distress and interference , but not for two core features of hoarding ( excessive acquisition and difficulty discarding ) , suggesting that depression may relate to the consequences of hoarding behavior but not its core features . As predicted , participants with hoarding were more indecisive than their adult children and spouses and the adult children reported more indecisiveness than the spouses . Unexpectedly , spouses scored significantly higher on the clutter feature of hoarding when compared to the adult children . <p> Practical Implications <p> By demonstrating that indecisiveness is uniquely associated with the onset of hoarding as well as hoarding severity this study reinforces that decision-making problems play a major role in hoarding . Incorporating decision-making skill building into hoarding treatment may prove to be an important step to increasing treatment effectiveness . Clinicians may want to consider specialized treatments that utilize motivational interviewing and cognitive restructuring techniques to directly address behavioral avoidance and decision-making . Implementing family interventions that attend to indecisiveness and hoarding tendencies among family members may also be a beneficial approach to treatment , especially since spouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the person with HD . <p> The classification of Hoarding Disorder ( HD ) has been a topic of much debate in recent years . Although currently characterized as a type or symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , increasing evidence suggests HD may warrant a separate diagnostic classification . Moreover , neurocognitive ADHD symptoms , such as inattentiveness and impulsivity , has been shown to contribute to core features of HD over and above the contribution of OCD and other comorbid disorders . In hopes of clarifying the relationships between HD , OCD and ADHD symptoms , participants meeting the criteria for HD ( N = 39 ) , non-hoarding OCD ( N = 26 ) , and healthy control ( N = 36 ) were evaluated based on standardized measures of each disorder , as well as demographic and general distress ( depression , anxiety , stress ) variables . Predictive models revealed that indicators of inattention , but not OCD symptoms or **25;308;TOOLONG , were significant independent predictors of all three of the core features of hoarding . <p> Practical Implications <p> As the symptomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to carefully assess for the aforementioned neurocognitive deficits when planning treatment . In fact , the study authors recommended that these neurocognitive functions be considered in the proposed DSM-5 diagnostic criteria so clinicians will want to be familiar with these functions and any other changes to the criteria that are adopted . Problems with attention can become a major barrier to evidence-based psychosocial treatments for HD , for example the adherence to homework aspects of cognitive-behavioral therapy , and it may be necessary to improve these cognitive functions to enhance the effectiveness of treatment . Interventions typically utilized for ADHD , such as cognitive remediation , could prove to be an effective addition to treatment . <p> Despite promising results , individual cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) is an intensive and costly treatment for those suffering from hoarding disorder ( HD ) . Group CBT for HD has been found to have somewhat inferior results to individual CBT , perhaps due to the less structured interventions studied thus far . This study of 35 individuals with HD sought to gauge the effectiveness of group CBT that attempted to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Participants were enrolled in 16 or 20 sessions of group CBT and completed various assessment measures of hoarding , anxiety , depression and psychosocial functioning at pre- and post-treatment . Because home visits are challenging in real-life treatment settings , treatment in this study did not include clinician home visits , as did previous studies assessing group CBT for HD . Significant improvements in hoarding symptoms , as well as depression , anxiety and quality of life indicators , were found among participants pre- to post-treatment . These results were comparable to studies of individual CBT and superior to previous group CBT studies . <p> Practical Implications <p> Some elements of traditional treatment for HD , such as monthly home visits and non-acquiring shopping sessions , are less feasible for clinicians to undertake in real-life community settings , yet the need for treatment for this population is essential . This study outlines an alternative to these treatment components by demonstrating the effectiveness of group CBT for hoarding that reflects a similar protocol to individual CBT , without clinician home visits . Clinicians may want to consider adopting a similar structured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and close monitoring of attendance , punctuality and homework compliance . <p> In addition to excessive emotional attachments to possessions and unsanitary living environments , compulsive hoarding has been linked to poor global functioning and considerable disability . Yet few studies have investigated subjective and objective quality of life ( QOL ) in samples of individuals with compulsive hoarding behavior . In order to she 'd light on this crucial aspect of treatment , 34 people who compulsively hoard were compared to 137 non-hoarding OCD patients in an intensive outpatient setting . Compulsive hoarders were significantly older and had lower pre-treatment Global Assessment of Functioning Scale ( GAF ) scores than non-hoarding patients . Anxiety and depression scores did not differ between groups and therefore did not account for the lower GAF scores in compulsive hoarders . Controlling for age , subjects with compulsive hoarding reported significantly lower satisfaction with safety and living arrangements and higher victimization rates than non-hoarding OCD subjects . More specific item analyses revealed that those who hoard felt less safe in the streets of their neighborhood and less satisfied with the protection they had against being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who hoard had been the victims of violent crime and 23 percent had been victims of non-violent crime , compared to 4 percent and 15 percent in the non-hoarding group , respectively .

The phenomenon that individuals who compulsively hoard fear and experience crime more than others may be an important element for clinicians to address in treatment . Previous reports have found that some individuals reported that their hoarding initially developed as a result of a break-in and that a history of victimization may contribute to paranoid beliefs about possession security .

The intervention codes are for services with an individual , a group , a family including the patient , and a family without the patient present . <p> From the beginning , Medicare agreed to cover five of the six codes ( The exception is the family intervention without the patient , because Medicare covers only services provided to beneficiaries ) . Translating policy into practice , however , did not happen automatically . Some problems were simply technical ones as local Medicare carriers needed to update their computer software in order to recognize the new codes . In other situations , however , there was a lack of understanding about the codes that required coordinated advocacy to the carriers . <p> Throughout 2002 , representatives of the State Psychological Associations ( SPAs ) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) worked along with APAPO to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codes . CMS staff at both the national and regional levels interceded when one carrier mistakenly concluded that the codes represented preventive medicine services and therefore were not eligible for coverage . <p> APAPO reviewed a number of denied claims and found that some carriers did not realize a psychologist could treat patients who had been diagnosed with a physical , rather than a mental , health problem . To educate the carriers , representatives from the SPAs took part in telephone calls and face-to-face meetings with carrier medical directors and their staff . When necessary , outreach by the SPAs was followed by correspondence from APAPO , contesting the reasons why psychologists were being denied reimbursement . The problems were resolved and Medicare carriers across the country are now paying for services under the codes . Both inpatients and outpatients are eligible for health and behavior services as Medicare covers the codes in all settings . <h> Beginnings of Coverage under Medicaid <p> In the past year , Colorado and Vermont have begun reimbursing for health and behavior services through their State Medicaid plans . Because the initial spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often fluctuates with the economy . The past two years have been financially difficult for many States and as a result Medicaid has seen significant cuts . Nevertheless , we will continue to work with psychologists and the SPAs to advocate for inclusion of services under the codes . We are hopeful that as the economy improves the States will be more receptive to learning about the benefits , including the potential cost savings , of using health and behavior services to address patients ' physical health problems . <h> The Private Insurance Market <p> Over the past year APAPO has looked to increase coverage of the codes by private insurance . This task is more difficult for several reasons . Because the Federal government does not regulate private insurance , there is no central authority to mandate coverage nationwide . In addition , insurance policies are private contracts , usually between the carrier and an employer or an individual . Since APAPO is not a party to these contracts , the carriers are under no obligation to engage in a dialogue with us about their practices . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychologists and the SPAs to raise the coverage issue with carriers in their geographic areas . <p> Psychologists are well positioned to advocate to the carriers because they play an important role as providers of service under the carriers ' policies and can best articulate the needs of their patients . Over the past year we have teamed with psychologists across the country to educate private carriers about the codes . In the spring of 2003 , only one private carrier , Carefirst Blue Cross / Blue Shield in the Washington , DC area , was known to be paying for health and behavior services . Since then individual members have actively pursued coverage from private carriers , utilizing material provided by APAPO . When psychologists have been denied reimbursement after billing the codes , we have corresponded with the carriers on their behalf . Thanks to the efforts of individual psychologists , the following private carriers are now reimbursing claims in certain geographic areas : <h> The Next Steps in Expanding Coverage of the Codes <p> The ultimate goal is to have the health and behavior codes recognized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished over the past two years with Medicare , we realize that acceptance of the codes by private insurance is critical for both psychologists and their patients . Having psychologists submit claims for the codes and follow up with the carriers if denied reimbursement have been important first steps in a process that has resulted in slow but steady improvement in private insurance coverage . Patients with employment-based health care plans can also play an important role by asking their Human Resources office to pursue coverage under the codes . Because health and behavior services can help patients keep physical health problems from deteriorating , they may reduce the need for more drastic , invasive , and costly procedures . This is clearly advantageous to employers who are finding it increasingly difficult to meet spiraling health care costs . <p> APAPO is currently teaming with psychologists and SPAs who have expressed an interest in pursuing private insurance coverage in their geographic areas . This will be a laddered strategy of advocacy to the carriers with initial requests for coverage coming from the psychologists . Interested members and/or the SPAs will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carriers ' plans . APAPO will provide materials for educating the carriers and will become directly involved when appropriate . <p> We will provide new information on the status of this project as our work progresses . Meanwhile , anyone with questions about the codes may contact the Government Relations office at ( 202 ) 336-5889.

This volume grew from a belief that close examination of the psychological processes underlying judicial decision making can greatly enrich this understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and findings from psychology into the study of judging . The first section of the book takes as its starting point the fact that judges make many of the same judgments and decisions that ordinary people make and considers how our knowledge about judgment and decision-making in general applies to the case of legal judges . In the second section , chapters focus on the specific tasks that judges perform within a unique social setting and examine the expertise and particular modes of reasoning that judges develop to deal with their tasks in this unique setting . Finally , the third section raises questions about whether and how we can evaluate judicial performance , with implications for the possibility of improving judging through the selection and training of judges and structuring of judicial institutions . Together the essays will foster a better understand how judges make decisions , and open new avenues of inquiry into influences on judicial behavior . <p> The content provided above is for informational purposes only .

@@101644448 @5844448/ <h> The growing impact of clinical practice guidelines <p> When clinicians hear the word " guidelines , " what they often think they 're hearing is the word " cookbook , " says Andrew Bertagnolli , PhD , senior manager for the Integrated Behavioral Health Care Management Institute at Kaiser Permanente . " They think , ' You 're going to tell me to do this , do this , do this , ' " he says . <p> Psychologists and other behavioral health providers can find the prospect of clinical practice guidelines especially troubling , says Bertagnolli . When Kaiser Permanente 's leadership told Bertagnolli that behavioral health needed to start developing clinical practice guidelines , for instance , he was staunchly opposed . Behavioral health , he argued , was different from other clinical areas and could n't possibly impose guidelines on its practitioners . But that was the same story Kaiser 's leaders had heard from clinicians in primary care , oncology , emergency and every other department . <p> Now Bertagnolli has become a big supporter of clinical practice guidelines , even for behavioral health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal pressures , health plans , managed care organizations and even entire behavioral health systems have introduced guidelines for behavioral health providers . No matter where they 're implemented , however , guidelines share the same goal : reducing variations in care as a way of making the most of limited resources . <h> Managing health plan benefits <p> Take private payers , for example . " Health plans exist to manage benefits , " says Rhonda Robinson Beale , MD , former chief medical officer for external affairs at OptumHealth Behavioral Solutions . " We have unsustainable increasing costs in health care , " says Robinson Beale . " There is a great need to try to shape what is paid for by insurance . " <p> Originally meant to cover only catastrophic illness , insurance has broadened its mandate since the 1960s and 1970s to cover at the minimum anything deemed " medically necessary . " Noting that a controversial Kaiser Permanente settlement in 2004 brought health plans and payers to a common definition of " medically necessary , " Robinson Beale said that medically necessary services are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providers exercising " prudent clinical judgment . " <p> " Prudent clinical judgment is not just what you think , " Robinson Beale said , explaining that judgment must be based on diagnostic codes and evidence-based guidelines . In the absence of such guidelines , services must be in accordance with generally accepted standards of practice " standards outlined in peer-reviewed articles , consensus panels or specialty society recommendations , for example . Things get even stickier when you move beyond clinical appropriateness and try to determine medical necessity when it comes to such factors as frequency and duration of treatment , Robinson Beale added . <p> At Optum , a clinical technology assessment committee assesses the evidence behind any new technology " which includes new psychotherapies " the company is considering covering . Two reviewers use a scientific merit rating scale to independently examine research Optum has identified ; if their scores are in line with each other , the company does a more thorough review according to certain criteria , such as at least three high-quality studies . ( If there are fewer , the technology falls into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examines such factors as the technology 's safety , how easy it is to implement with fidelity and its comparative cost value . " It does n't help if a therapy is effective , but costs so much that it 's prohibitive in terms of being able to offer it generally , " says Robinson Beale . <p> The problem comes when there 's just not evidence to make a decision , says Robinson Beale . Some states have mandated coverage for autism , even though there are n't widely accepted practice guidelines showing what works for which patient population or information about how long treatment should take . " All of these things are a black hole , " says Robinson Beale . To come up with coverage determination guidelines , Optum brought together researchers and providers to assess which therapies have the most evidence . <h> Reducing variations in care <p> At Kaiser Permanente , clinical practice guidelines are helping behavioral health providers reduce unnecessary variations in the care they provide and thus meet the Institute for Healthcare Improvement 's triple aim of improving care , improving population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We feel that variations in practice are one of the things that lead to decreases in quality care and increases in cost , " says Bertagnolli . Other goals include preventing errors , increasing clinicians ' accountability and improving resource utilization . <p> The guidelines Kaiser Permanente is developing go beyond the guidelines most mental health practitioners are accustomed to , which focus on things like familiarizing yourself with the laws in your state or knowing what to write in charts . Instead , says Bertagnolli , the guidelines are systematically developed statements to help practitioners make appropriate decisions in a variety of circumstances . <p> Kaiser Permanente has n't produced guidelines for all 300 diagnoses in the DSM-5 . Instead , it has targeted four clinical areas " adult and teen depression , alcohol misuse and serious and persistent mental illness , especially suicide " that are both prevalent and costly . These areas also have multiple treatment options " with uncertainty about which one is most efficient " and significant variation in practice . <p> Kaiser Permanente either adopts guidelines from external organizations or creates its own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations meets a certain level of rigor and is free of bias , Kaiser Permanente looks for recommendations that are " actionable . " " A medication recommendation that says , ' All antidepressant medications are equal ; just pick one , ' is not a terribly actionable recommendation , " says Bertagnolli . " If they 're all equal , we often look at what medication is the least expensive , because we want to use our membership dollars in the most efficient way . " <p> Once a guideline is adopted , Kaiser Permanente looks for ways to support its use . The electronic health record system includes clinical " decision support " tools , for instance . " If a diagnosis comes up , it says , ' Consider x , y and z , ' " says Bertagnolli . The guidelines do n't tell clinicians what to do , however . Designed to allow flexibility , the guidelines simply tell clinicians what they need to know to make good decisions in partnership with their patients . Guidelines also inform patient education materials , both on Kaiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during visits . <p> Once Kaiser Permanente has a guideline , the process is n't finished . " There 's a huge maintenance component of guidelines , " says Bertagnolli . " They take a tremendous amount of effort and upkeep . " Accreditation by the National Committee for Quality Assurance requires a review of guidelines every two years , for example . <h> Transforming a system <p> The Philadelphia Department of Behavioral Health and Intellectual disAbility Services is using clinical practice guidelines for an even more ambitious purpose " supporting the effort to transform the entire system from one that focuses on managing patients ' symptoms to one that facilitates adults ' recovery and children 's resilience . <p> " Payers are under enormous fiscal pressures , " says psychologist Arthur C. Evans , PhD , the department 's commissioner . " Because of that , what we 're trying to do is reduce variability in practice so we 're more likely to get the outcomes we want as a payer . " Reducing variation and ensuring a commitment to the recovery framework are especially challenging given that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range from highly trained clinicians to those with just high school educations , says Evans . <p> To help ensure that shift , the department has developed guidelines based on scientific data in the form of randomized clinical trials , meta-analyses and even program evaluations ; professional consensus and the perspective of people with " lived experience " of behavioral health issues . The resulting guidelines lay out the system 's values and goals in several domains . The 10 values include hope , community inclusion , patient and family involvement , and cultural competence , for example . Goals include integrating services and creating an atmosphere of strength instead of just focusing on patients ' challenges . <p> The guidelines also outline various domains providers need to pay attention to , including finding ways to engage and retain people in treatment , using practices associated with improved outcomes making sure patients get connected to the next level of care after they 're discharged and having connections to and building the capacity of community resources like Alcoholics Anonymous meetings . <p> Like Kaiser Permanente 's guidelines , Philadelphia 's behavioral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' own judgment . The guidelines are n't intended to be an algorithm , explains Evans , but rather they draw on the literature , clinical consensus and input from behavioral health professionals to outline things that providers should pay attention to . <p> To be a provider in Philadelphia 's system , clinicians must show they know the guidelines . The guidelines also form the basis of Philadelphia 's pay-for-performance system . So far , says Evans , the guidelines are having an impact . " Our resources have remained flat for the last three or four years , " says Evans . " Yet we 've increased the number of people seen , and the per-person cost has gone down significantly . I am happy that this has been accomplished by improving clinical outcomes . "
