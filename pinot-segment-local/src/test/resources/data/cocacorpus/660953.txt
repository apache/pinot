While homes and businesses have been lit with incandescent light bulbs and fluorescent lights for several decades , LED lighting is quickly becoming the go-to solution for those looking to lower their energy costs and have less of a negative impact on the environment that surrounds them . LEDs are a more efficient and environmentally sound lighting solution for several key reasons : Lower Energy Use LED lighting is one of the most efficient lighting solutions available . LEDs have been recorded as using 75% less energy than their traditional counterparts . This translates into big savings when the energy bill comes , not to mention the positive environmental benefits that come with using less power . According to Energy.gov , widespread use of LED technology could result in saving energy equal to the output of 44 large electric power plants . At current energy prices , this represents about $30 billion in savings . Longer Lifespan There 's a second component to environmentally sound technologies : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifespan than incandescent bulbs , lasting up to 25 times longer in many cases . Bulbs with longer lifespans do not have to be replaced as frequently , which in turn results in a dramatic reduction in the amount of waste being created by each home and business . In short , LED lighting solutions allow you to limit the amount of energy you use when lighting your business or home and have a positive impact on the environment , all while lowering your maintenance costs and putting a big dent in your average energy bill .

@@109892771 @5292771/ <h> LED Tubes Are Not The Way To Go <h> LED Tubes Are Not The Way To Go <h> Written by Deco Lighting President Ben Pouladian . <p> After the recall of Cree Lightings LED retrofit T8 tubes back in June , I noted the importance of using superior hardwired retrofit solutions rather than tube retrofit options . Recently , Osram Sylvania recalled 55,000 T8 LED replacement tubes due to their potential to overheat and melt , posing a burn hazard for users . <p> This recall again highlights the superiority and increased safety of using hardwired LED boards as opposed to LED retrofit tubes . The Consumer Product Safety Commission strongly recommends that consumers stop using T8 LED tubes and replace them . Only a hardwired solution can safely retrofit a fluorescent fixture to LED . At Deco Lighting we focus on education and sourcing the best , verified components in our supply chain to eliminate this risk . <p> To aid customers interested in upgrading to the safer hardwired retrofit solution after these recalls , we are providing discounts on our Deco Linea retrofit kits to end-users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LED T8 tubes made to fit into existing fluorescent sockets . Using these LED tube retrofit kits presents a safety risk because most of the original fixtures used T12 lamps and magnetic ballasts ( an analog system ) , but were retrofitted to T8 using upgraded electronic ballasts . If the retrofitter did not upgrade or replace the existing T8 tombstones , then a small amount of leakage current is emitted . T8 lamps can tolerate this leakage . Yet , with solid-state LED lamps , this current affects the LEDs and the power supply , causing the sockets to overheat and melt . Deco Lighting does not use tube technology for this very reason . <p> These recent LED recalls also highlight the importance of utilizing US-made LED solutions . The Cree T8 LED tubes recalled on June 4th were manufactured in China , and the Osram Sylvania T8 LED tubes recalled on August 25th were manufactured in South Korea . Many of these non-U.S . made LED products posses manufacturing defects due to poor-quality components and lack of testing to ensure that end-products meet the proper safety standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story revealing that inferior LED luminaries were being labeled and sold as international brands in China . Unfortunately , many customers shop based solely on price and go to marketplaces like Alibaba.com to buy the cheapest DLC-listed LED T8 they can find ; and rarely are these products up to necessary LED standards . At Deco , we focus on educating the public about sub-standard versus quality LED solutions , and sourcing the best , verified components in the supply chain to eliminate consumer risk . We also make all of our LED boards at our manufacturing facility in Commerce , California , so you can be sure you are purchasing top-quality , American-made luminaires that will last a lifetime . <p> Google Trends depicts a growing interest among consumers in T8 LED tube retrofit solutions , and its important for end-users to be aware of the difference in quality and safety between a tube retrofit and a hardwired upgrade .

As the efficacy ( lumens/watt ) of LED increases and costs come down it makes more and more sense to make the switch .

@@109892790 @5292790/ <h> What You Need to Know About Commercial Lighting Efficiency <h> What You Need to Know About Commercial Lighting Efficiency <p> When considering the choices for lighting a commercial space , it is important for consumers to be able to determine which lighting solution best fits their space and application . Between initial costs , annual energy expenses , frequency of replacement , lumen output , and color rendering accuracy , choosing the ideal product can quickly become overwhelming for business owner and project managers . Luckily , Deco has devoted its resources to developing the best LED lighting engine on the market . Delivering superior performance and cost savings across all lighting applications , Deco 's LED solutions exceed the highest standards in lighting design and technology . <p> Whether you are looking to illuminate a parking structure , manufacturing warehouse , or outdoor space , some common lighting options include metal-halide , fluorescent , and LED . Some version of a 400 watt metal-halide high bay fixture is frequently used in many warehouses and outdoor parking areas . While this has been a traditional choice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption and quick decay of lumen output in metal-halides have motivated many consumers to begin using more durable and longer-lasting LED technology . For example , the lumen output for a metal-halide fixture can decrease by up 50% once 40% of its rated lifetime has passed , yet it will still continue to consume 100% of the energy . <p> Upgrading to LED lighting lessens the impact a business has on the environment and saves on annual energy expenses as well as maintenance costs , amounting to thousands of dollars when entire warehouses or offices are upgraded . With cost being a primary concern for most consumers , some are startled at the thought of replacing entire fixtures or lighting systems since the initial cost of upgrading to LED lighting is often slightly more expensive . However , retrofitting traditional lighting systems with energy-efficient LED lighting is an investment that will quickly pay for itself , especially as LED prices continue to decrease . <p> LEDs can be installed in a wide range of styles that enable you to customize the look of your space without having to renovate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replace any fixtures . Deco 's unique , patented LED board allows us to custom retrofit any existing lighting fixture to LED . For instance , Deco 's Linea family of retrofit kits is designed to easily upgrade any existing fixture to state-of-the-art LED technology . Because fluorescent and HID lamps are so rigid in the way they need to be installed , your options for moving or adjusting them are limited . Thus , an LED lighting solution can also save you money by giving you more flexibility in your lighting design . Deco also offers a convenient Payback Calculator , which allows business owners and project managers to calculate how much money they will save by switching from traditional lighting to energy-efficient LED technology . <p> For example , a company choosing to upgrade its warehouse fixtures from 400W metal-halide high bays to the equivalent 120W LED solution would experience roughly 75% in electricity savings . Additionally , LED fixtures emit far less heat than traditional metal-halide and fluorescent fixtures , subsequently lowering cooling costs . The driver components of Deco LED products are positioned on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat , removing the need for fan cooling . In fact , Lightsearch estimates that this reduction in cooling costs often equates to as much as 30% of the energy saved from upgrading to LED lighting alone . As the number of light fixtures being replaced in a building increases , so will the building ' total energy savings . The graphic above- compares the Deco Digital LED board to its equivalent traditional counterparts , a metal-halide lamp and T5 fluorescent tube , across several variables , highlighting the incredible benefits of upgrading to LED . <p> Safety is another major concern for consumers . Increasing lighting in dimly-lit industrial parking lots and commercial buildings helps employees and customers feel safer at night , and LED lighting provides higher levels of light output and visibility for employees without drastically increasing a business ' energy bill. - LED lighting is the most energy-efficient technology on the market and the optimal choice for any commercial lighting application . Environmentally-friendly and cost efficient , LED lighting removes the headache of constant maintenance associated with traditional lighting fixtures , and no other lighting product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides to consumers . <p> Consumers interested in making the switch and upgrading to energy-efficient LED lighting can turn to Deco Lighting .
