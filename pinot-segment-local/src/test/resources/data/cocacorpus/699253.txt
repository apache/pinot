@@10214031 @3414031/ <h> More Background on the Hybrids <p> Contributing to a thread talking about the new Hybrid line over on the TGR Boards , Stephan added the following regarding the thinking and a bit more facts on the new Hybrid Construction . <p> We designed the Hybrid line for 2 reasons : <p> 1 . because the Prepreg Carbon+Pure nano construction was getting apples to oranges comparisons with generic constructions . For example a Pontoon and a Lotus 138 in a Pure construction are physically very different animals . In terms of strength to weight ratio , torsional stiffness , power , precision of resin distribution , flex life , base material , price and complexity to build etc- it 's like a Taurus and a Porsche . So , the Hybrids are our " conventional " construction option- the more direct comparison to the Pontoon . Hybrids employ the same basic construction technologies used to make 99% of skis today as their foundation- wetlayup fiberglass . <p> 2 . We felt as though there were a lot of people who wanted to be riding DPS shapes , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enter the Hybrids- they are to be compared directly to fiberglass highend skis made by 99% of the ski makers in the world . The Pure construction is the only thing of its type made in the world , and has taken a bunch of years to perfect , is ridiculously expensive to build , and is the super exotic deal for the ultimate blend of light weight and superior physical properties . Again its very expensive to build and develop- so it 's relatively expensive , but still a great value for what you are getting in the ski- infinite flex life , the super power and reactivity and quickness in deep snow , etc . <p> + The Hybrid Line shares the basic construction attributes you see today by the best boutique and major manufactures , but with some nice bells and whistles . Just because it 's priced differently than the Pure does n't mean its low-end ski construction-wise- if fact , it 's premium . <p> + Hybrids , like the Pure line , have the fastest , hardest , highest graphite content World Cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our Pure Line . Ask your manufacturer what kind of bases they use and where it comes from- there is really shitty extruded stuff out there , some good sintered bases , and then trick Austrian race stuff . Hybrids use the later , alongside the best Polyamide Nylon ISO tops- no expense is spared on both the top and bottom side of the Hybrids . Again , ask your ski builder what they are putting into your skis . <p> +Hybrids have a bamboo core , not sidewalls . Sidewalls are tough , tried and tested UHMW . For a fiberglass ski , core material is very important to how the skis feels because the modulus of glass is so similar to most woods . Bamboo has superior physical properties , and supercharges your standard glass ski . With the Pure line , Prepreg carbon and Nano laminates are so physically dominant over the core material , that wood choice is not as critical , and we go for weight . <p> +Hybrids have solid , woven unidirectional 30mm carbon on both top and bottom laminates . Combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ski . <p> + Hybrid Longitudinal flex profiles are designed within 5-7% of Pure flex 2 values , but torsional stiffness is less for obvious reasons , and weight is typically about 20% more . A 190cm Lotus 120 in Pure : Carbon+ Nano construction weighs 1770g ( compare that to any other 120mm class ski ) . The same ski in a Hybrid construction ( again relative industry standards ) , is within 5.5% of longitudinal stiffness but weighs 2300g . <p> We are within about a day of soft launching the new site ... it will continue to evolve over the next couple of weeks .
