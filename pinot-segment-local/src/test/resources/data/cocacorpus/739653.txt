@@50393907 @3893907/ <p> Here in the USA , the AKC ( American Kennel Club ) Breed Standard characterizes the correct Rottweiler temperament in this way ..... <p> ' Calm , confident and courageous , with a self-assured aloofness ... an intelligent dog of extreme hardness and adaptability , with a strong willingness to work ... ' <p> These descriptions give you a good idea of what to expect from an adult Rottweiler who is well-bred and has been raised correctly . <p> It 's important to know that Rottweiler behavior should never include indiscriminate aggression , or appear vicious , ' sharp ' , fearful or nervous ( skittish ) . <p> Unfortunately poorly-bred , poorly-socialized and improperly raised Rottweilers ( and there are a LOT of them ) , may carry these personality traits . Be aware of this and choose your puppy or dog carefully . If you 're purchasing your Rottie , only buy from responsible and reputable breeders . <h> Rottweiler Behavior - What It Means For You <p> Rottweilers are very loving , affectionate dogs . They prefer to be ' where the action is ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family . <p> Your pup/dog will probably want to stay close to you whenever possible , and will bond closely with ' his/her ' humans . <p> One aspect of Rottweiler behavior that 's often misinterpreted as ' growling ' , is their habit of ' rumbling ' down deep in their throat . Although rumbling is the best way I know to describe the sound , it 's definitely not an expression of discontent - quite the opposite ! <p> Rotties make this noise sort of the way cats purr . They most often do it when they 're being petted , or they 're happy , or just as a way of communicating with their people . I love the sound , and it 's a rumbling , grunting sort of noise that is so endearing . <p> BUT people unfamiliar with the breed , and who may be nervous around them due to their ' reputation ' , often think the dog is growling at them or threatening them . If your new puppy makes this sort of noise do n't worry about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite different , and is usually accompanied by body language that shows fear or aggression such as lip curling , snarling , ears back , hackles raised and so on . You will probably recognize this quite easily ! <p> Of course , being natural guardians , Rottweilers are a protective and territorial breed . No matter how calm and gentle your dog is with the people she knows and trusts , she will undoubtedly use her considerable strength and abilities to protect ' her ' people if she feels that they are in danger or being threatened . <p> This is normal Rottie behavior , but it can translate into a dog who refuses to let anyone they do n't know set foot in ' their ' yard or home , or who tries to protect family members from threats that are n't really there . <p> For example , if your child is screaming and laughing because daddy is tickling her , your Rottie may think that she 's being hurt ... and take measures to protect her . You can see how this could end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ground rules ' are so important when raising a Rottweiler puppy . <p> Socialization and interaction with a wide variety of people , places and situations helps a Rottweiler to learn to distinguish between ' normal non-threatening ' people and behavior , and the kind that spell danger . <p> They 're a surprisingly sensitive breed , and although they can be inclined to be dominant , Rotties readily recognize and respect authority when it is presented in a confident , fair and calm way . <h> The Pro 's &amp; Con 's of Rottweiler Behavior <p> All dog breeds have their own special quirks and traits , it 's what makes them so special and individual . <p> It 's also what makes them suitable , or unsuitable , for certain people , environments or situations . <p> Rottweilers are big , strong , intelligent dogs and I would n't recommend them for first-time dog owners , small/frail people or those who are n't confident around dogs or have little canine experience or knowledge . <p> Although they 're usually wonderful with children , Rotties are powerful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reason I personally think that a family with children under 3 , or frail/elderly members , would be better choosing another breed ! <h> The Positives : <p> Intelligent , with a huge capability to learn <p> Confident , calm and self-assured <p> Loving , affectionate , devoted and loyal <p> Adaptable and versatile . A great ' all-rounder ' <p> Protective without being indiscriminately aggressive <p> Tolerant , loving and protective of children <h> The Negatives : <p> Needs lots of space to grow , develop and play <p> Can be clumsy , uncoordinated and rambunctious as a puppy <p> Strong willed , with a tendency to dominate and display stubbornness <p> Inclined to herd children or animals , and to ' bump ' or lean against people <p> Naturally wary of strangers , territorial and protective <p> This is a breed with it 's fair share of health issues and a relatively short life-span <p> They need the X-L size of everything .... and that can get expensive ! <p> You 'll notice that the negatives , or ' cons ' , of Rottweiler behavior are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you as owner and ' parent ' to shape these traits correctly . <p> For example .... Rottweilers are very intelligent , and this intelligence can be a ' double-edged sword ' . <p> If a pup is treated with love and patience , and is consistently shown the correct ways to behave . If she 's trained as she matures , with positive methods , and she gets the opportunity to use her intelligence in a sport or activity such as obedience training , tracking , agility and so on , she 'll be happy and well-adjusted . <p> BUT , if she 's ignored or ill-treated , not trained or given a chance to learn , she 'll quickly become bored . This can lead to destructive behavior , and she 'll turn that smart little brain of hers to ways of escaping , causing damage , or ' bucking the system ' . <p> She will be extremely creative , and not in a good way ! <p> If you 're considering a new dog , take all the time you need to research different breeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big commitment , and when that dog is a Rottweiler it 's even bigger ! <p> There are many great books that you can use to learn more about this amazing breed .

But in reality that is true of any breed of dog , and many other animals that we keep as domestic ' pets ' . <p> Choosing a Rottweiler that is the result of a sensible , well-thought out breeding program is the first step towards making sure that your Rottie is going to be a ' safe ' dog . <p> Training your Rottweiler puppy properly , giving him lots of positive socialization experiences , and of course lots of love , will all ensure that your little guy grows up to fit the true Rottweiler temperament outlined in the section above . <p> But is that enough to enable us to say that the question ' are Rottweilers dangerous ? ' has been completely taken care of ? No , not at all . <p> Although Rottweilers are n't inherently dangerous dogs in terms of their attitude , there is still the potential danger posed by any big , strong animal . <p> Given that a fully grown male Rottie may weigh 125lbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small child , elderly or frail adult , or small , fast-moving animal , the potential for DANGER comes over loud and clear . <p> Rottweilers are loving , goofy and playful .... and totally unaware of their size ! My dogs will happily sit ' in ' my lap ( they do n't fit ) , and if they 're focused on chasing their ball and something ( or someone ) small is in the way , they may run them right over , albeit unintentionally . <p> Rottweilers also have a tendency to ' lean ' against people ( a throw-back to their days as cattle drovers ) , and the weight of an adult dog ( or even an adolescent pup ) could quite easily knock over a child or light/frail adult . <p> When asking ' are Rottweilers dangerous ? ' , it 's also important to remember that these are working dogs and a guardian breed . They will instinctively protect their home and family if they feel they are threatened . They are also territorial and often do n't welcome strangers onto their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very discerning in their approach to guarding , and seem to be aware that their mere physical presence ( accompanied by a low growl if necessary ) , are enough to stop most folks in their tracks . True out-and-out aggression is extremely rare in well-bred and properly raised dogs . <p> For the above reasons , not every home is suited to ( or safe for ) a Rottweiler . Also , due to their strength and intelligence , they 're generally not recommended for first time dog owners . <p> Many times , Rotties raised from pups around small dogs , cats , chickens etc. do just fine , but introducing a full-grown Rottweiler into a home with a resident chihuahua ( for example ) should be approached with caution at first ! <p> So again , ' Are Rottweilers dangerous ? ' ..... not in the way many people imagine , or simply because they are of a specific breed . But in certain circumstances or situations there is the potential for danger . <h> The Truth About Rottweiler Temperament , Dog Bites &amp; Statistics <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite statistics , I 'd recommend these webpages .... <p> So there 's lots of information out there . The bad news is that much of it is way out of date , biased , inaccurate , misinterpreted , or based on politically weighted arguments/studies or media-type hysteria . <p> As I said earlier , I 'm not an expert here , but I did a lot of research on the question of ' are Rottweilers dangerous ? ' and here are just a few of the interesting things I found out .... <p> The most recent official survey on dog bite statistics was conducted more than a decade ago <p> Statistics on fatal attacks are more accurate/more current than those on dog bites in general <p> Dog Bite fatalities are extremely unusual . In the US there is only one fatal attack per 151,000 victims <p> Over 50% of bites occur on the dog owner 's property <p> Male dogs who have n't been neutered seem to be the most common ' biters ' <p> According to figures produced by the Insurance Information Institute , dog bites cost insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year old were the age-group with the highest number of fatalities <p> The second highest group were 2 year olds . In both instances between 87% and 95% of the time the children were left unattended with the dog who killed them <p> German Shepherds , Rottweilers , Presa Canarios , Pit Bulls , Chows , Huskys , Doberman Pinschers , Akitas and Alaskan Malamutes are among the breeds considered to be most likely to be involved in fatal attacks <p> Since 1975 over 30 different breeds have been involved in fatal attacks . These include Pomeranians , Dachshunds , Yorkshire Terriers and Labrador Retrievers . Mixed-breeds or dogs of indeterminate parentage are n't included ! <p> When looking at dog bites in general , mixed breed dogs are way ahead of Pit Bulls in the equation <p> So , where are we now ? Are Rottweilers dangerous dogs or not ? <p> Again there 's no ' clear cut ' answer , but there seems to be a lot of different ways to interpret the information available , and many studies contradict each other . <p> It 's important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics , from those relating to ' dog bites in general ' . These are two entirely different categories . <p> If you use some common sense , it 's fairly obvious that a bite from a Rottweiler is going to do a lot more damage than a bite from a Dachshund . If you make that several bites ( or more than one dog ) , the Rottweiler attack is clearly more likely to result in a fatality . <p> So , whether it 's a Rottweiler ( or a GSD , Pitbull , Chow ..... ) , being higher up the ' fatality statistics list ' does n't mean that they bite more often ( and in fact this does n't seem to be the case ) , but that they do more damage . <p> Obtaining information for statistics relies on the reporting of dog bites , or attendance of a victim at a hospital or medical facility for treatment , and I 'd guess that there 's a huge volume of un-reported bites , or those that do n't need urgent medical attention . <p> These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as they do less damage ) so perhaps there 's a whole ' hidden group ' , which would mean that the KNOWN statistics are n't a true representation of the situation . <h> The Bottom Line ..... <p> So , what can we take away from here ? <p> To me it has to be that ' Rottweilers have the potential to be dangerous in certain situations ' . Not a very snappy answer , but accurate . <p> Both genetic and environmental factors have to be taken into account , including the dogs ' parentage , care , training , socialization , home environment , supervision and a whole lot more .... so you ca n't judge the entire breed based on the actions of one ( or even several ) individual dogs . <p> This is true for ALL breeds , in every area of behavior . MY answer to the question ' Are Rottweilers Dangerous ' is this .... <p> ' In my opinion , and based on decades of personal experience , I firmly believe that Rottweilers are NOT inherently dangerous dogs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his/her own merits . <p> With the right breeding and upbringing Rottweilers make wonderful companions and pets , and are loving , loyal , intelligent , intuitive - and goofy dogs ! <p> I would trust my Rotties with my life , and the lives of the people closest to my heart - my children and grandchildren .

Carrying excess weight puts undue strain on the heart and other major organs as well as predisposing your Rottweiler to other health problems such as diabetes . <p> Rottweilers were not bred to be ' giant ' or ' XL ' dogs , and overfeeding your pup wo n't make him bigger and stronger . Instead it will simply make him fatter and weaker ! <p> In fact a 14-year study conducted by Nestle Purina PetCare Study ( although not specific to Rottweilers ) found that leaner dogs live on average 2 years longer than their overweight counterparts . <p> 5 ) Give him the right amount of exercise and rest <p> 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life expectancy by maintaining regular veterinary check ups , vaccinations and deworming .

It will save you a LOT of money should your Rottie develop a serious health condition or be involved in an accident . It also can quite easily save your pet 's life ! <p> 8 ) Neutering or spaying your pup can help reduce the incidence of reproductive order cancers and other problems , therefor increasing Rottweiler life span .

This rapid growth and development is what makes the puppy food she now eats so important . <p> Rottie pups ( and other large or giant breed puppies ) who do n't get the right balance of nutrients are at risk of developing serious bone/joint problems as they grow . <p> A diet that is lacking in quality nutrition or is too calorie-dense can cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding unnecessary supplements . <p> The best puppy food for your pup is a premium quality food , preferably one with **28;0;TOOLONG ingredients .

It should n't be a meat by-product , meat meal or grain . <p> Rottweilers are a breed that often seem to have problems with allergies , and so it 's important to avoid foods that contain chemicals , fillers , colorings and ' junk ' . As long as you stay away from generic or store-brand dog foods , and choose a premium puppy food with quality ingredients , you should be able to minimize any problems caused by dog food allergies . <p> Bear in mind too , that human food generally suitable for dogs ! If you want to feed your pup a raw or homemade diet , it 's important to follow the proper guidelines and recipes .

Most dogs ca n't digest it and it can cause diarrhea and tummy upset . For very young pups who are being weaned , or still need milk , the correct puppy milk formula is best . <p> When feeding puppies who are going to be large or giant-sized at maturity , you need to choose a food that is within the ' moderate ' range when it comes to calories , and has the correct ratio of protein , fat and calcium . <p> These are the sort of figures you should be looking for ..... <p> Protein - between 23 and 25% <p> Fat - between 12 and 15% <p> Calcium - between 1.2 and 1.5% <p> Large breed pups grow rapidly , but they take a long time to reach adulthood .

Others are picky eaters who nibble at their food and never seem satisfied with what you 're offering . I own both varieties and I 'm not sure which is more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding puppies according to the guidelines on the bag of food you have chosen to use . These generally are calculated according to the puppy 's weight/age and are a good starting point . <p> Do n't ' free-feed ' ( leave the food bowl down all day ) , but instead offer your pup the appropriate amount of food at mealtimes only . Leave the bowl down for around 10 - 15 minutes then pick it up - whether your pup has eaten all the food or not . <p> The aim is to offer enough food that your puppy walks away within 10 minutes or so , satisfied . If your puppy practically inhales the entire contents of his bowl inside 3 minutes , you need to give him more next time . If he walks away and leaves his bowl half full , and does n't return within 15 minutes , offer him less at his next meal . <p> One important point involving feeding puppies who tend to be picky , is to resist the urge to spoil them or pander to their whims ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on to their food bowls , they will soon get wise to this and refuse to eat anything that has n't been ' gussied up ' . Rottweilers are very smart dogs , and if you think that little puppy of yours is n't going to be able to manipulate you , think again . <p> Nature will not allow a healthy puppy to starve him/herself , and although a finicky eater may not be eating as much as you would like , she will eat enough to get by . <p> Just continue to offer a highly nutritious food at mealtimes and allow her to choose whether or not to eat . You 'll be surprised to see that she will soon be attacking her bowl with gusto . <p> I know that this can be worrying , because I have a huge male Rottie who was the pickiest eater in the world as a pup .

Be patient , and you 'll find that your baby Rottweiler will be all grown up soon enough . <p> Although feeding puppies involves a bit of trial and error to begin with , you will soon see a pattern emerging and will learn how much your individual puppy needs . <p> If you make sure to use only the best puppy food and follow the guidelines above , you 'll be taking a big step towards giving your Rottie pup the best chance of growing up healthy and strong . Good luck ! <h> The Best Food Dishes For Large &amp; Giant Breed Puppies <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best bowls to use when you 're feeding a Rottweiler . <p> Rottie puppies are notoriously clumsy , and they can eat/drink a lot . They 're also a breed that can be susceptible to Canine Bloat . <p> There are also some excellent , heavy-duty raised dog bowls that work well to keep food and water in the dishes and not on your kitchen floor . <p> Elevated dog bowls are not just convenient for you , they can also be much more comfortable and healthier for your Rottweiler . Rotties are big dogs , and like most large and giant breeds , they often have to bend uncomfortably or splay their legs to reach down to floor level . <p> This puts unnecessary strain on their bones , joints and ligaments and can cause problems for growing puppies and older dogs in particular . <p> Raised dog bowls may also help prevent another , very serious , condition - bloat . One of the contributing factors to a dog developing canine bloat ( or torsion ) is swallowing too much air , and elevated bowls can help minimize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making swallowing smoother and more comfortable . <p> But , it 's important to mention that there is a study which suggests that if a dog has a family history of bloat , or has suffered from it previously , then using elevated dog bowls may actually increase the risks . <p> Try to remember that your little Rottie pup is constantly growing and changing ... and so is his appetite ! <p> Puppies are like human kids , and they go through phases and stages . Some weeks they act as though you have n't fed them for days , other weeks they barely take a mouthful before running off to play . <p> This is a normal part of their development and nothing to worry about . <p> Just keep an eye on your pup 's week-to-week appetite and make sure you 're offering what he needs . <p> The ' jury is still out ' on this one , but it 's a good idea to take all factors into consideration . Rottweilers are a large breed ( size can be a risk factor ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only a 1.1% above-average risk . <p> However , they are prone to bone/joint/ligament issues , so when deciding what kind of bowl is best for your puppy or dog , do and weight the pros and cons and look at your Rottie as an individual when making a decision . <p> For greedy eaters , getting them to eat at a more acceptable pace is another important part of preventing bloat , and other digestive disorders . And in this instance the answer is pretty clear cut ...... slowing them down really can help ! <p> The easiest way to get a dog to eat more slowly is to use a ' go-slow ' or ' no-gulp ' bowl . There are a handful of different brands and styles , with the Brake-Fast Dog Food Bowl being one of the most popular . <p> Puppies are often not great at sharing and sometimes they 'll growl , or even snap , if someone tries to touch their food/bowl/treat/toy or whatever . <p> This is NOT okay and is a behavior that needs to be strongly discouraged early on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx562135 152136 @qwx562136 152137 @qwx562137

Intensive and immediate supportive care is the only way to give your puppy a chance at beating this disease ! <p> One of the biggest parts of this supportive care is giving the sick puppy IV fluids to replace those that have been and to restore the pupd electrolyte balance . <p> Secondary bacterial infections are very common with Parvo and antibiotics are usually given to help combat these .

Others are n't convinced , and argue that too little protein has even more of an adverse effect on a growing puppy . <p> In the past , adding Calcium supplements to a large-breed puppy 's diet was encouraged , but it has been fairly conclusively proven that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calcium can result in abnormal skeletal development . <p> Another point that seems to be universally agreed upon is that overfeeding puppies can cause many of the bone/joint and hip problems seen in adult dogs . <p> Perhaps more than an excess ( or lack of ) certain nutrients , the sheer stress of carrying too much weight due to overfeeding ( sometimes combined with too little exercise ) is what causes many growth-related problems in our big dogs . <p> These three simple steps will help you to make sure that your puppy gets what she needs to develop properly . <p> Choose a puppy food that is formulated from premium natural ingredients , in the correct ratio . <p> Feed the right amount of food <p> Make sure your pup has the right amount of daily exercise <p> Now you 've got a grip of the basics , let look in more detail at the first point on this list .... the importance of making sure you choose a food that has the right ingredients . <h> Best Puppy Food Ingredients - Large Breed Puppies <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of different dog and puppy food manufacturers , most of them with a huge range of different product lines . <p> The choice can be quite overwhelming , and if you 've spent hours wandering up and down the dog food aisle in your local petstore you 'll know what I mean . <p> Of course , just because a food is advertised on TV , or is on the shelf at the local pet superstore , it does n't mean that it 's the best puppy food for your little guy or gal . <p> In fact , most of the best puppy food and dog food choices , are n't found in regular petstores ( and definitely not at the supermarket or big-chain giant ) . <p> Feed stores , veterinary offices and online retailers are actually the best places to find the best rated puppy food .

Also avoid foods with artificial sweeteners such as corn syrup or sucrose . <p> No animal ' by-products ' - most of these have no nutritional value and many are indigestible . <p> When it comes to the ratio of ingredients in the best puppy food choices for a Rottweiler or other large breed pup , there is some disagreement between professionals .

This helps to prevent hypoglycemia . Even as adults , tiny and toy breeds should be fed twice a day to help regulate their blood sugar levels <p> Feed at least 4 times a day for the first 6 months , and then 3 times a day until your puppy reaches maturity ( usually at around a year old ) . <p> Medium breed pups ( such as Cocker Spaniels , many shepherd breeds , Bulldogs etc. ) do n't generally have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have less specific needs . <p> The best puppy food for these guys is an ' all life stages ' or ' all-breeds ' dry puppy food , fed three times a day until around 6 months old , and then twice a day until mature . 152135 @qwx562135 152136 @qwx562136 152137 @qwx562137

For example .... <p> Keep the volume down at home . High-pitched or loud voices , or a lot of noise , get a puppy excited and when he 's excited - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough-housing , wrestling and other rough-and-tumble games . Play of this sort in the canine world includes puppy biting , and your pup ca n't tell the difference between the dog world and the human world yet . <p> Puppies are attracted to fast moving objects , and a child running through the house or riding a bike around the yard , is likely to attract a chasing puppy who wants to nip at their heels . <p> Flapping , twitching hands or wiggly fingers and toes are a prime target for a mouthy pup . You can help stop puppy biting by teaching children ( and adults ) to use slow , deliberate hand movements and not to be ' jumpy ' around your pup . <p> Avoid playing certain games with your puppy . These include tug-of-war , chase , and wrestling type games which encourage a pup to use his mouth and to pit his strength against yours . <p> If your puppy is biting and growling in an attempt to protect his food bowl , toys or treats , check out my Dog Food Aggression page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <h> Puppy Biting Corrections That Work ! <p> Most of the time a biting puppy is simply trying to play with you , or get your attention . <p> So , the best way to stop this behavior is to make sure your pup does n't get the response he 's hoping for : o ) <p> When puppies play together and bite/nip at each other , they soon learn that it 's not well-tolerated by their siblings . <p> A pup that consistently bites hard and does n't learn to have a ' soft mouth ' ( gentle , play-biting ) soon finds that no-one wants to play with him ! This brings the lesson home and he learns to modulate his behavior in order to be accepted . <p> You can teach your pup in the same way ( a way that he will naturally understand ) , by making sure that he understands that it hurts when he bites you - and withdrawing your attention from him when he does so . <h> Method #1 - " Owee , I do n't want to play with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training a puppy not to bite .... <p> As soon as you feel those tiny puppy teeth on you , squeal or yelp and say " OUCH !

Do n't shout though as this will make your puppy more excitable and is likely to increase the biting behavior . <p> As soon as you 've let your little guy know that he 's hurting you , withdraw your attention from him right away . If you 've been playing with him , stop the game . If you were petting him , stop . Cross your arms in front of your body and do n't make eye contact with him , turn you back if necessary . <p> Do this for 30 seconds or a minute or so , or however long it takes for him to stop nipping and wonder what 's up . As soon as he stops his puppy biting , tell him " good , no bite " or something to that effect and go back to what you were doing . <p> If you were n't interacting with him at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the directions above , but rather than simply ingoring him , redirect his attention to one of his own chew toys first . <h> Method #2 - " Owee ... stop it , I 'm serious ! " <p> If you 've tried Method I consistently with no ( or limited ) success , you may have a more stubborn puppy biting machine on your hands ! <p> Some breeds are pre-disposed to biting/nipping due to their original job description - for example herding breeds who ' nip ' at the heels of livestock to keep them moving . <p> Other breeds that may be mouthy include Labrador Retrievers and other hunting breeds who use their mouths to carry game and so on , and German Shepherds and Bull and Terrier breeds are also often pretty prone to puppy biting . <p> If you own one of these breeds , or simply have a pup who is particularly stubborn or single-minded , this second ' stop puppy biting ' techinque should do the trick ! <p> Again , follow the first part of Method l correction ( the " Ouch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more tangible correction .

A few repetitions of this and they soon get the message . <p> Do n't worry , it does n't hurt them , and as long as it 's a small bottle and a gentle squirt it wo n't frighten them . Obviously you also want to avoid spraying their nose directly , or in their eyes , so as not to cause discomfort . <h> Method #3 - " Okay , I 'm bringing out the big guns !

If you get this spray in your pups eyes or on his nose it will be painful and can cause serious damage . Get it on his tongue ONLY . <p> However , the occasional pup will actually LIKE the breath mint taste ( I own one of them ! ) so in those cases , try one of the following ideas instead . <p> Shake CanMost puppies are startled by loud noises and do n't like them , so you can often stop puppy biting by getting your little guy to associate his biting behavior with a loud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an empty can of some sort with small rocks or coins .

A puppy recognizes this as being a behavioral correction , so you can use it for the same effect . <p> I do n't like using physical corrections like this , and with large breed pups you want to ' get physical ' as few times as possible . However , it 's here as a type of last-resort stop puppy biting method . <p> In this case you just follow the verbal correction by taking a firm ( but not aggressive ) hold of the loose skin on the back of your puppy 's neck and giving him a quick shake .

Hold his mouth closed for a few seconds while repeating the ' No bite ' command , then let go . <p> If he comes right back at you snapping , then repeat the process but hold on for a few seconds longer , many pups will whine and stop struggling at this point and you 've made your point . <p> NEVER hold your pups muzzle for more than about 10 seconds and do n't hurt him .

This should not be used lightly , and should also be done firmly but without anger . ) <p> Any of the tips/techniques above will only be effective if you 're consistent about using them ... and if everyone in your house does the same thing . <p> Inconsistent training will confuse your pup and make him anxious .

Africa . <p> The Rottweiler breed likely developed from the mixing of several different breeds including Mastiff-type ( or Molloser ) dogs who were used as guardians , and herding breeds . Research shows that early Rottweilers looked quite different from the dogs we recognize today . <p> During the very earliest days the ' look ' of the dogs took second place to their build and temperament . These were working dogs , and the priority was for them to fit the bill in terms of ability . <p> The characteristics that were needed in these early Rottweiler dogs were courage , intelligence , athleticism , strength and loyalty - and all of these are still clearly seen in the Rottweiler breed . <h> Rottweiler Breed Standards <p> The Allegmeiner Deutscher Rottweiler Klub ( or ADRK ) is the parent club of the breed and is located in Stuttgart , Germany . It was established in 1921 and promotes and protects the interests of the Rottweiler . <p> From what has been recorded over the years , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of looks over the last century . In the early 1800 's dogs were considerably lighter and a bit shorter than the dogs of today . <p> At that time , the ideal height for a Rottweiler was 23.5 " , and the preferred weight only 66lbs . Todays ' ADRK Breed Standard states the ideal height to be between 24 ' &amp; 26 " , with 25 " - 26 " being preferred . The weight should be around 110lbs . <p> The AKC standard calls for a height of 24 " - 27 " , but with no specific weight requirement . <p> The temperament of Rottweilers has varied little over the years . In 1883 characteristics such as ' courage , endurance and good nature ' were encouraged . <p> The biggest difference between the Rottweiler dogs of a century ago , and those in our homes today are their physical appearance , particulary their color/coat/size . <p> In the late 19th Century , a whole host of different colors were allowed including grey , brown , red , blue , and even ' tiger-stripes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were generally thicker and longer . <p> Even today you 'll still occasionally see ' rare ' rottweilers such as the ' Red Rottweiler ' because the genes for this color still exist in a very few dogs . Whether a purebred is black and tan or red , does n't matter in terms of temperament , ability , size etc. , it 's simply the outward appearance and a true purebred red Rottweiler is every bit as much of a Rottweiler as a dog with the accepted , and standard , coloring . <p> BUT there are unscrupulous breeders and dog owners who are n't afraid to try to pass of a mixed breed Rottie as a ' rare ' specimen , so if you see this type of dog for sale always do some thorough research to make sure that he/she is purebred . <h> Rottweiler Tails <p> An interesting little fact that you may not know , is that Rottweilers in the 19th century were often born with ' stumpy tails ' . <p> This is pretty much unheard of today , and I think that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dock all those tiny puppy tails just to meet the Breed Standard . <p> Also relating to tails , here 's is another interesting fact - todays ' ADRK Standard no longer calls for a docked tail , and Rottweilers are required to have a natural tail . In the US , a docked tail is still a part of the AKC breed standard . <p> In my opinion , Rottweilers are the perfect dog . They 're magnificent to look at , and their personalities are an ideal combination of strength , courage , affection and sweetness ... what more could I ask ? <p> Unfortunately the Rottweiler breed has been misunderstood and misrepresented over the years . In addition , a too-quick rise in the popularity stakes during the mid to late 90 's resulted in poor breeding practices and uneducated owners . <p> Many poor specimens of the breed , with incorrect physical and mental characteristics negatively affected the quality of the Rottweiler dog . <p> However , with their popularity declining over the last decade , the Rottie will hopefully have a chance to recover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you own a Rottweiler , you probably have no idea just how amazing and exceptional they really are . <h> Raising Rottweilers <p> Of course , much as I adore them , Rottweilers are n't for everyone . <p> They 're not Labradors or Golden Retrievers , and they do n't have that ' I never met a stranger ... ' attitude . Considering that they 're natural guardians , that 's really not so surprising ! <p> Rottweiler dogs are n't bullies , and they should n't show indiscriminate aggression . <p> Sometimes irresponsible breeding has produced dogs with just such characteristics , but poor breeding of any type of dog is likely to produce pups with poor physical and emotional health . <p> Rottweiler puppies should never growl or bite ( with the obvious exception of normal puppy mouthing/nipping and play-growling ) . You should never encourage your Rottie to guard anything or anyone . <p> Becoming guardians and developing protective and territorial behavior is something that will come naturally to them as they mature , however it should always be appropriate and not random . Luckily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bite when a bark or growl will do . <p> In spite of their huge physical presence and their courageous personalities , Rottweiler dogs are surprisingly sensitive . They need to be with ' their ' people , and thrive in a close relationship with humans . They often pick one person to bond very closely with . <p> Rotties are very smart dogs and are eager to please . There is no need to shout or use harsh voices or punishment when training your dog . Always use positive training techniques and lots of praise - tasty treats are always greeted enthusiastically too ! <p> The Rottweiler dog is included in the AKC and KC ' Working ' categories , and their skills in this area are clearly seen in their heritage . Many still retain the herding instict of the early drovers dogs , and Rotties generally have a strong ' prey drive ' . This often translates into a strong ' ball drive ' . <p> They excel at obedience and tracking and there are many activities that you can enjoy with your Rottie if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ( such as herding your cattle or guarding your jewels ! ) . <p> Rottweiler dogs can ' do it all ' , and I hope you have enjoyed learning a little about this amazing and wonderful breed.Enjoy your Rottie ! <p> If you 'd like to find out which questions are the ones most often asked by Rottweiler owners , check out my Rottweiler FAQ page right now : ) 152135 @qwx562135 152136 @qwx562136 152137 @qwx562137 
@@50393928 @3893928/ <p> Your puppy is the love of your life , and of course you want to protect her and keep her safe , so keep reading and you 'll find out everything you need to know about puppy vaccinations ...... <h> The Timing Of Puppy Vaccinations <p> I 'm going to start with the when of puppy shots , as it 's pretty important to get your timing right . <p> Puppies get a natural immunity to diseases that their momma has been vaccinated against , during their first few days of life . <p> This immunity is transmitted throught the colostrum ( sort of pre-milk ) their momma produces in the first 48 hours after giving birth . <p> It 's fairly short-lived protection , but researchers have n't been able to put an exact time-frame on it . <p> They do know that the antibodies that the pups receive stay in their bloodstream for several weeks , and that they gradually become weaker and less effective as time passes . <p> When these antibodies are above a certain level they prevent a vaccine from being effective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This seems pretty straightforward , but it gets more complicated at this point ! <p> As the antibody levels in the puppies blood start to fall , so does their level of protection against disease . <p> The problem is that there is a period of time where the antibody levels are too low to give the pup adequate protection against disease , but too high to allow canine vaccines to be effective . <p> This is the critical point when puppies are at high risk , but it 's impossible to tell exactly when it will happen . It can vary from breed to breed , from litter to litter , and even from puppy to puppy , and it could last a couple of days , or a couple of weeks . <p> This is the reason that puppy vaccinations are given several times , rather than just once . <p> A vaccine protocol like this is the best way to make sure that your puppy does n't spend any longer than absolutely necessary in that ' in-between ' stage when she 's not properly protected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her puppy shots up to date , you are giving her the very best chance of staying healthy . <p> To have the best possible chance of a vaccination ' taking ' and giving your pup the immunity he needs , it should be given three separate times ... at three week intervals . <h> Which Puppy Vaccinations Does She Need ? <p> There are certain canine vaccines that are considered ' core ' vaccines ( the necessities ) and others that are optional . <p> Whether or not your puppy needs any of the optional puppy vaccinations may depend on what part of the country you live in , whether or not she will be in contact with many dogs ( in a kennel or boarding facility for example ) and so on . <p> Generally the core vaccines will be given as a ' combination shot ' , so your puppy gets 4 , 5 or 6 different canine vaccines in one injection . <p> The actual vaccines included in a combination shot can vary from veterinarian to veterinarian and from location to location . I 'd recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what your pup will be getting . <p> The following puppy vaccines are often considered to be ' core vaccines ' and some , or all , of them may be given as a combination shot : <p> Leptospirosis is n't necessarily a ' core ' vaccine , but in the USA it 's usually recommended for the majority of pups/dogs . Veterinarians now recommend that it is n't given until after a puppy is 12 weeks old to prevent complications or severe allergic reactions . <p> Bordatella can be given as a shot , or as nasal drops . The drops become effective more quickly and one dose is enough . The shot needs to be given twice , at a 3 to 4 week interval , and takes a bit longer to become effective . <p> This vaccine is not thought to give full protection for more than about 6 months , so if your pup/dog is kenneled regularly , attends doggie-daycare or is around many other dogs on a regular basis you may want to have a booster dose given twice a year rather than annually . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually given somewhere when your puppy is between 12 and 16 weeks old . <p> You can learn more about the most common canine illnesses and their symptoms ( including all of those mentioned above ) , on my Dog Diseases And Symptoms page . <h> Example Of Puppy Vaccination Schedule <p> The exact puppy vaccinations schedule that your veterinarian will follow may well vary from this sample , because professionals and practices often have their own , preferred protocol . But it will give you a good general idea of when you need to get your puppy vaccinations set up . <p> Because your Rottweiler puppy is especially vulnerable to Canine Parvovirus , you need to give her a fourth Parvo shot when she 's around 16 weeks old . <p> As it 's best for a puppy to be at least 8 weeks old before she leaves her momma , your pup should have had her first set of shots ( at a minimum ) before coming into your home . <p> All responsible breeders make sure that the puppy vaccinations for their litters are done on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought your pup , it is your responsibility to make sure that the vaccination schedule recommended by your veterinarian is kept ' on track ' . <h> Possible Canine Vaccination Side Effects &amp; Reactions <p> Many puppies have no noticeable reaction at all to the vaccines , apart from maybe objecting to the actual needles .... and , interestingly , I often find that the biggest/strongest boys are the biggest cry-babies : ) <p> But , as there are a whole range of possible side effects or reactions that your puppy may experience , it 's a good idea to be aware of these and know when you need to consult your veterinarian . <p> The most common reactions are mild , and include : <p> Lethargy or depression . Your pup may sleep more than usual . <p> Vomiting . Should n't be severe , but may occur once or twice . <p> Diarrhea . As above . <p> Soreness , swelling or lump at injection site . May be noticeable for days or even weeks . <p> Loss of appetite . <p> If you notice any of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye on your pup . If any of them last more than 24 hours ( with the exception of a single swelling or lump at the site of the shot itself ) , call your veterinarian and ask his/her advice . <p> More serious reactions to puppy vaccinations are usually seen as allergic reactions . They most often occur within a few minutes to an hour of your puppy receiving the vaccine . They can include : <p> Generalized swelling of face , head , neck or body . <p> Hives , or large swellings anywhere on the body . <p> Difficulty breathing , poor co-ordination , disorientation <p> Seizures or loss of consciousness <p> These sorts of reactions are serious and you need to get veterinary help right away if your puppy develops them . They do n't usually happen after the first set of puppy shots , but may be seen after second or subsequent vaccinations . <p> If your pup does have this sort of reaction , she still needs to have the remaining sets of shots , but talk to your veterinarian about it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than the combination one . Or he may want to give her anti-histamines before she gets her puppy vaccinations , and monitor her closely for a while afterwards . <p> Although the potential for a reaction applies to all puppy vaccines , some of them seem to be more likely to trigger allergies . These include the Leptospirosis and Rabies vaccines . 152135 @qwx562135 152136 @qwx562136 152137 @qwx562137 
@@50393929 @3893929/ <h> About Dog Food Aggression <p> Dog food aggression and other types of resource guarding ( such as guarding toys , bones or treats ) is actually more common than many people think , and I regularly get questions from new owners asking how to handle this problem . <p> Food guarding in dogs is a normal canine behavior in response to a perceived threat to food ( and therefore his life ) , and it tends to be instinctive , a sort of survival instinct that is linked to the pack mentality . <p> It 's especially common in pups and dogs who have had to fight for their share of food , so it 's probably no surprise that it may be seen more in puppies from large litters . <p> Or in pups or dogs who have n't been well taken care of , or had enough to eat , in the past - such as rescued or abandonded dogs . <p> However , if you 're adopting from an animal rescue organization or shelter , chances are your pup/dog wo n't display this type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of it before you adopt him . <p> If a dog comes into a rescue with this issue , they generally work with him to eradicate this behavior before rehoming him . <p> Dog food aggression is not seen any more in Rottweilers than in any other breed , but when you 're raising a large breed puppy who is going to become a big , strong adult , you need to be especially careful to make sure this does n't become a problem . <h> Dealing With Dog Food Aggression <p> The older the dog and the dog food aggression has been going on , the longer it will take to correct it and the more slowly you will have to move . <p> However , given plenty of time , patience and practice most dogs can be cured of this habit . <p> The most ' alpha ' member of the household should start this training , and once it 's been established then all members of the family should take part at one time or another ( including children ) . <p> Bear in mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the space around it too . <p> If you have a pup or dog who growls or snaps when you approach his dish , when petted or touched during eating , or even one who 's body language indicates tension/fear/anxiety or aggression when someone gets close to his food bowl , then you need to take steps to correct that behavior right away . <p> Food guarding in dogs stems from the dog 's fear that he will lose his meal if you touch it . So , your aim here is to teach him that both you ( and any other family member or human ) and his food can be in the same place , at the same time , with positive results . <p> He needs to see you as the provider of his food , not as a rival for it ! <p> It 's not something he will not learn overnight , and depending on how old he is and how ingrained the guarding behavior . <p> It could take anywhere from a couple of weeks to several months to re-shape his behavior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take it slowly , but steadily , and make sure that he is comfortable with each step in the process before moving onto the next one . <p> Here are the steps I 've used with puppies or dogs who have a tendency towards dog food aggression ..... <p> 1 . Begin by hand-feeding your pup one meal per day . You can either feed him individual pieces of kibble from your fingers , or fill the palm of your hand and let him eat out of that . It 's a bit tedious , but is the first step in teaching your pup that your hands and his food CAN go together in a good way ! <p> Depending on the pup , you can do this for a week , or two , or even longer if you need to . You need to be certain that he is perfectly happy eating from your hand before moving on . <p> 2 . Let your pup see you putting food in his bowl with your hands , and then put the bowl down in front of him . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but many puppies get soooo excited at mealtimes that they simply ca n't stop wiggling and jumping . <p> In this situation , just ask him to ' sit ' right before you place his bowl on the floor . <p> Once he 's eating , walk past him and drop some REALLY TASTY treats into his bowl . You can do this from a height/distance to begin with so he does n't fee threatened , but you do n't want to be throwing them at him or he 'll get scared/excited . <p> Choose something he absolutely loves , like chicken or liver or hot dogs etc . The smellier and tastier the better : ) It may make it easier to introduce an elevated food bowl when you start this part of the training - it 's easier to drop treats into accurately . <p> Over the next couple of weeks , continue to drop treats into his bowl every mealtime , gradually getting closer to him and his bowl as you do so . <p> Once he realizes you are giving him food rather than taking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be able to place the treats in his bowl , right under his nose , before you move onto the next step . Take your time and do n't rush it . <p> 3 . Now , instead of dropping treats into his bowl , begin to pick it up and place the treats inside . You want him to SEE you do this , so at first you can just lift the bowl a few inches off the ground . <p> However , your aim is to eventually be able to pick up the bowl , stand up straight , drop the treats in and give it back to him without him getting upset . Again , take your time and move slowly so that he gradually gets more comfortable . <p> Do n't ever be tempted to be harsh with your pup/dog when you 're training him ( in any training situation ) , as it causes way more problems than it solves . Rotties are very intelligent and eager to please , but they can be stubborn if they feel they 're being threatened or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as that created by dog food aggression , you want to de-escalate and tone down the atmosphere , so always use a low , calm voice and be patient and consistent in your methods . <p> Once you 've reached this point you 'll have achieved a big victory , so give yourself ( and your dog ) a pat on the back . <p> Dogs are creatures of habit and although you will no longer need to put treats into his bowl at every mealtime , you will need to do it several times a week so that he does n't forget ! <h> How To Prevent Dog Food Aggression <p> There are a few general guidelines to follow when it comes to feeding your dog that can help prevent dog food aggression from getting started in the first place . <p> Feed your pup/dog in a quiet area , away from other dogs/pets . <p> Do n't ' free feed ' ( ie. leave the bowl down all day ) . Offer it at mealtimes only . <p> Let your dog ' earn ' his food by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bowl . <p> Do n't always feed in the same place/room to prevent territorial issues . <p> Do n't allow begging at the table/elsewhere . He eats his food , from his bowl only . <p> Also , although you want your pup to be able to eat in relative peace , without feeling stressed by other dogs/pets/people etc. , you do n't want him to only feel comfortable eating in a quiet , silent atmosphere . <p> Make sure that he eats within earshot of the general noises and activity a family makes . <p> Let him get used to people passing by him and so on , just do n't hassle him or get too close on purpose . You do n't want to create a problem ! <p> It 's always easier to prevent something , or to correct it early on , than it is to try to reshape behavior that is already entrenched . <p> Even if your pup has never shown any signs of dog food aggression it 's a good idea to follow these guidelines on a regular basis . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they can try to challenge the ' house rules ' , test limits and attempt to assert their authority as part of their normal development . <p> This can manifest itself in lots of ways , and dog food aggression or resource guarding are just a couple of them , so it 's good to be prepared . <h> Dog Food Aggression/Guarding &amp; Children <p> Puppies ( and sometimes even adolescent/adult dogs ) can see children as their siblings or equals . <p> This can mean they feel entitled to protect their food/bones/toys from them , just the way they would with other puppies . <p> That can lead to someone getting hurt , and especially with big , strong dogs such as Rottweilers it 's important to make sure that they understand their place in the family from day one . <p> If you have a new pup and he 's never shown any signs of dog food aggression then involve your kids in feeding him from the beginning . <p> Dogs respect those who control the resources of life - and in their eyes , food is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a puppy or dog who gets tense or anxious when someone gets too close to his dish , make sure the pack leader ( usually whoever the dog has bonded too most closely ) follows the steps outlined in the <h> Final Thoughts ..... <p> If you have a pup or dog who is extremely agitated or aggressive around his food bowl , and you are unable to improve his disposition with the techniques above , then you need to get some professional help to deal with it . <p> A qualified and experienced dog trainer , or a dog behavioral specialist will be able to help you , and your vet should be able to point you in the direction of these types of professionals . <p> Do n't ignore the problems of dog food aggression or resource guarding and hope they will go away , because it wo n't , they will only get worse . <p> Apart from the fact that someone is very likely to get bitten if this situation is left untreated , as your pup learns that he can control your behavior with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exert his influence in other areas too . <p> Before you know it you 'll have a dominant dog who feels comfortable using growling or snapping to get his way . That 's NOT what you want . <p> Dogs who are food-aggressive by nature , may also get very excited and ' bossy ' around treats , so be careful when training . Make sure they learn to ' take it nicely ' rather than snatching their reward from your hand . <p> ANY puppy , or older untrained dog , should attend at least a puppy or beginner obedience class where you 'll be able to learn to communicate better with each other , and get some hands-on help in problem areas . <p> If your pup or dog does n't show dog food aggression , but does like to protect or guard his toys/bones etc. , I 'd recommend checking out my Free Puppy Training Tips page - specifically the section on the ' Leave It ' command . <p> If you can teach him this , then you will be able to remove anything from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be patient and consistent as you work with him and do n't be tempted to move too quickly . <h> Related Pages : 152135 @qwx562135 152136 @qwx562136 152137 @qwx562137

We have very long , hot summers here and I 've never noticed it happen with my dogs .... although admittedly it 's too hot for them to be lying in the sun for long most days . I guess it 's possible as that happens with human hair , but I 'm not certain . <p> There are other possibilities for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be that she 's starting to get her undercoat in now in preparation for the changing seasons and colder weather . Although the color of a Rottweilers ' undercoat is generally gray , it can also be a tan/red color . Perhaps that 's showing through and that 's what you 're seeing ? <p> Or it could be that your dog carries a gene that produces red coats , or at least a red tint to the coat . In the late 1800 's Rottweilers came in a wider variety of colors , and red was an accepted coat color . Some of these genes occasionally produce ' red ' Rottweilers even today , but it 's rare when two purebred dogs are bred - although possible . You can read more about this on my ' Rare ' Rottweilers page . <p> Whatever the reason I would n't worry about it too much , as depending on what 's causing this color change it may just disappear .

@@50393931 @3893931/ <h> Puppy Crate Training <p> Puppy crate training is quite simply the quickest , easiest and most effective way to potty train a puppy , period ! <p> Crate training actually works incredibly well when you 're housebreaking an adolescent or adult dog too . <p> But it 's usually faster to crate train puppies as they have n't had a chance to really develop ' bad ' habits , and they pick it up so quickly and easily . <p> Contrary to what we humans sometimes believe , dogs actually like their crates and a crate becomes their ' safe ' place .... a quiet , comfy spot away from other pets , dinnertime craziness , noisy vistors and so on . <h> Why Should I Crate Train My Puppy ? <p> Introducing your puppy to a crate and helping him to accept being crated ( do n't leave him in his crate for long periods though ! ) , can also protect both your precious pooch and your home and furnishings . <p> Puppies do n't understand that chewing on your antique dining room table is somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Or that the carpet does n't make quite as an acceptable ' potty spot ' as the grass in the back yard . <p> Not to mention the fact that puppies have no concept of electrical current , the danger of **27;30;TOOLONG etc .... plus they tend to assume everything is being edible until proven otherwise . <p> Accidents can , and do happen , and as you ca n't watch your pup every second of the day , a crate can give everyone some peace of mind . <p> But , the number one benefit of crate training puppies is how quickly and efficiently it can reduce housebreaking ' accidents ' , and teach bladder/bowel control . <p> All canines are naturally ' den ' animals , and the main reason puppy crate training works so well is that it takes advantage of a dogs ' natural desire not to pee/poop where he/she sleeps . <p> Of course no housetraining method is foolproof ... BUT you can help ensure that your puppy crate training experience is a positive one following the few simple steps below .... <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is where a lot of new owners go wrong .... and it 's usually because they love their new puppy sooo much and want to give him the best of everything ! <p> Of course you SHOULD adore your new puppy , and spoiling him with new toys and possessions is part of the fun , but when it comes to crates bigger is NOT better at this stage . <p> As I explained earlier , puppy crate training works because it uses the natural canine desire to sleep in a clean ' bed ' . However , a puppy does n't need a lot of space to sleep - a king size mattress holds no real appeal ( unless you 're on it of course ! ) . <p> If you buy a crate that is too big , your little Rottweiler puppy will have no difficulty designating a small area for sleeping in and thinking of the rest of the space as his own personal en-suite bathroom . <p> The same principle applies when you have an older pup or adult and are dog crate training . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is big enough for your little guy to sleep in , but not big enough for him to feel that it 's okay to eliminate in . <p> QUESTION : How do you know when a crate is the right size ? <p> ANSWER : Choose a dog crate that is big enough for your puppy to stand up , sit down , lie down and turn around in - without touching the sides . That 's it . Any smaller and he 's going to be too cramped , any bigger and he 's going to think he has room for a toilet . <p> When you 're considering puppy crate training , do bear in mind though that your puppy is going to grow ! Rottweiler puppies grow quickly , and you will need to keep an eye on him to make sure that he does n't outgrow his crate without you noticing . <p> You may well need to buy 3 ( or possibly more ) crates before he 's mature , but successful housebreaking is a huge benefit and in my opinion outweighs the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next thing to consider is which type of crate to choose .... and today there are far more options to consider than there used to be . <p> QUESTION : Which type of crate is best ? <p> ANSWER : There 's not a one-size-fits-all answer to this as the different types of dog crates all have different ' pros &amp; cons ' , and your home , lifestyle , budget and personal taste all factor in . <p> A sturdy plastic crate is best if you 're planning on doing much car or air travel . Some dogs prefer the safe , enclosed feeling of this type of crate too . <p> There are a variety of sizes and levels of durability depending on the manufacturer , they 're generally easy to take apart for cleaning purposes , and come in a big range of colors and styles . <p> A wire crate is n't as safe in the car , and is n't suitable for air travel , but it allows your pup to see what 's going on around him and feel less ' shut out ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for him and he does better in a more enclosed area , you can always throw a blanket over the crate . <p> There are now different color options available in this type of crate , and some have ' divider ' panels to allow you to use the same crate as your pup grows and so on . <p> These are the two basic , and very popular , choices but are tons of other options too . There are soft-sided , portable crates , wicker crates , ' pop-up ' crates and beautiful dog crates that look like an item of living room furniture . <p> One thing I would suggest though is not buying a really expensive or ' fancy ' dog crate during the first few months of puppy crate training . Your puppy may have the occasional accident and is quite likely to practice cutting his teeth on it - not to mention outgrow it ! <p> I 'd recommend choosing a basic crate design to begin with and then indulge yourself ( and him ) by buying whatever you like once he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage . <h> Getting Started ....... , <p> Puppies are creatures of habit , and they learn through repetition , so it 's really important to start off the right way . <p> Have the crate of your choice ready before you bring him home and introduce him to it during his first ' recon ' of his new home . <p> Here are a few puppy crate training tips to get you off on the right foot ( or paw ! ) ..... <p> Do n't force your pup into his crate at first . Give him a chance to get used to it a little by throwing a few treats and a favorite chew toy in there and leaving the door open . <p> For the first day or two you can feed him inside his crate ( with the door open ) so that he associates something he loves ( food ! ! ) with his crate . <p> Give him one or two safe , sturdy chew toys to keep him occupied and relieve any pent-up anxiety . <p> Always make sure that your puppy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put him in his crate . Otherwise you 're setting him up to fail . <p> Crate him for short periods only . An 8 week old pup needs a potty break approx. every 30 mins to 1 hour <p> Give him plenty of ' crate-free ' time , but supervise VERY CLOSELY to prevent ' accidents ' <p> Ignore any initial complaints . Never take your puppy out of his crate because he 's fussing , wait for a break in the din before opening the door . <p> Young puppies need one , often two , potty breaks during the night too . <p> Do n't leave food/water in his crate when he 's small as that will just make him need to ' go ' . <p> Remove his collar before putting him in his crate to make sure he ca n't hurt himself . <p> Do n't leave his crate in the sun , or next to a source of heat . You do n't want him to over-heat . <p> Due to their limited bladder/bowel control , puppies ca n't ' hold it ' for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep your puppy in a crate for too long he will be forced to eliminate and this can undo all the good work you 've been doing . Remember , puppies learn through repetition and form habits very quickly ; if he only pees in there two or three times in a row it can become a habit much more quickly than you would like . <p> Here 's a guide to how long your pup can stay in his crate ..... <p> 9 - 10 weeks old - 30 mins <p> 11 - 14 weeks old - 1 - 3 hours <p> 15 - 18 weeks old - 3 - 4 hours <p> 18 weeks plus - 4 - 6 hours <h> Final Words ! <p> Puppy crate training is very effective , but it 's not a miracle , and most pups will have an ' accident ' or two during the early days . <p> If your pup does mess in his crate , chances are .... <p> You forgot to give him a potty break before you put him in his crate . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too young ( under 8 weeks ) or has immature bladder/bowel control . <p> He has parasites , is sick , or has an upset tummy or a urinary tract infection . <p> Is experiencing severe stress/anxiety ( such as is seen with dogs who suffer from separation anxiety ) . <p> When faced with a mess , remove your pup as quickly as possible and clean the entire crate thoroughly using an enzymatic cleaner or one designed specifically to remove pet odors . <p> Dogs have very sensitive noses and any lingering traces their own scent can trigger a recurring problem . <p> Housebreaking is one of the most biggest challenges you 'll face as a new puppy owner , but by following the guidelines above and crate training your Rottweiler puppy you can minimize the stress on everyone ! <p> However , you will need to be very patient , consistent and loving ..... and do n't expect your little guy to ' get it ' within a week , or even a month . <p> Some pups do of course , but in general when you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more of consistent , correct training , before a puppy is fairly reliable in his potty habits . 152135 @qwx562135 152136 @qwx562136 152137 @qwx562137

Or do they tend to have more complications than other breeds . <p> This is my/our first little with our Rottweiler and I am a bit nervous . My chihuahua has had one litter in the past but there is a big difference going from a 5 pound dog giving birth to a 90 pound dog giving birth . <p> Just wondering if there is anything that I need to especially keep my eye on ... Thanks ! <p> Hi NikkieSmall and tiny breeds are often more problematic in terms of whelping than the larger breeds , mainly due to their tiny frames and the delicacy of the pups . <p> Rottweilers are strong dogs and a healthy , well bred and fit Rottie will normally give birth without much trouble . However , there is always a risk involved with whelping and you need to have your vets ' phone number handy and someone to help you just in case you need to get your dog to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is bonded closely with you and loves and trusts you she should let you be right beside her and help if necessary . However , first time ' mommas ' can get nervous and scared and you will need to stay calm and try to keep her calm . You know your dog best , so follow your instincts there . <p> The biggest problem is when a puppy gets ' stuck ' in the birth canal and that requires veterinary help . Generally once the first pup is born , subsequent pups will appear anywhere between 10 mins and 2 hours apart ( usually it 's somewhere around 30 mins to an hour , but all dogs are different ) . If more than 2 hours pass and your dog is contracting and pushing but no pup is appearing , then you need to get your vets ' help . <p> As you 've been with your chihuahua when she gave birth , it will be basically the same thing , just bigger ... so you should be pretty familiar with it . The only other problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost unaware of their pups sometimes , leading to puppies being smothered or squashed by their mommas ' .

Ive been doing alot of reading online lately which says that neutering a rottie at 6 months is a MISTAKE because it stunts their muscular development ( i.e. you will end up with a tall , skinny , small-headed rottie if you neuter before 1 year old , or even later ) <p> I have 5 dogs , and always neutered around 6 months because I thought i was doing the right thing for their health and keeping down the unwanted " pup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stunted my guy 's development . He is about 25 inches right now in height which does n't  seem " unusual " but I wanted to get your thoughts on this ... at a little over 2 years old , will a NEUTERED rottie continue to " fill out " or is the growth and development stage over . Ive read different things all over the place ( i.e. no more growth , growth until 3-5 years , only in intact males , etc ) <p> Any help would be greatly appreciated--just want to know for my future rotties : ) <p> Hi BrianThis is a good question , and as you have found out there are a LOT of differing opinions on this , most of them expressed very strongly and usually conflicting each other totally . <p> I am not a veterinarian nor a professional when it comes to canine genetics , development and so on , just a Rottie owner and lover who has loved , raised and trained these dogs for decades . <p> I can only give you my personal take on this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to share them : ) <p> I have owned male Rottweilers who have been neutered prior to 6 months , and those who have remained intact throughout their journey to adulthood . In both instances my puppies grew up to be large , muscular adults . Of course they were different in lots of ways because they were from entirely different lines so their conformation , bone size , head shape , pace of development , personality etc. were not the same . However , I ca n't say that I noticed that a neutered pup was ' stunted ' in any way in terms of physical development . <p> In terms of how long it takes for a pup to reach adulthood , it 's very individual and tends to be genetic . One of my big males took a full 3 years + to grow into his head and legs , but he had not been neutered . <p> It would be helpful to see photos of your pup 's parents , and him as an 8 week old pup and again at 6 months , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . Of course , genetics is a very complicated process , and your pup does n't just inherit his looks and temperament from his parents . Grandparents and all the dogs in his lineage have an effect to some degree , so a pup who has two large , muscular parents would usually mature to be somewhat similar in type , but could also grow to resemble a grandparent , uncle , cousin etc . There are no guarantees . <p> From the photos above it does n't seem as though Atticus has a particularly large frame or bone size , but it 's very difficult to judge accurately from photos , especially small ones , so I could be wrong . His skeletal framework is probably fairly much complete in terms of growth by now , but he could quite easily continue to put on weight and muscle development over the next 6 - 9 months or so . <p> The best thing you can do is to make sure he 's eating a premium dog food and that he gets adequate exercise , after that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realize this is n't a definitive answer to your question , but I really do n't think that there is one at this point . There is no clear evidence either way that I am aware of , and my own experiences mirror that ! <p> Atticus looks like a nice Rottie and he has a sweet facial expression which gives the impression of a very calm and loving temperament . His size is really of less importance than his health and personality so I would n't worry too much about all of this , although I do understand your interest in this question . <p> Best of luck with your Rottie , enjoy him : ) <h> Comments for Was neutering my pup at 6 months a mistake ? ? ? <p> I had my male desexed at 5 months and he grew to 55kg and had a big head and was stocky.All the other Rottie owners we met loved his size and build.he was larger than most other male rotties we met .

An Owner 's Guide . <p> Dog diarrhea ( spelled in the UK as ' diarrhoea ' ) is going to happen , it 's just a fact of life when you 're a dog owner . <p> Loose stools in puppies and dogs are extremely common . <p> They can be caused by something simple such as a sudden change in diet or stress , or they can be a symptom of any number of dog diseases . <p> Diarrhea in dogs can be mild and short-lived , or it can start out severe - and rapidly get worse . <p> Loose bowels that last for longer than a day , especially if they 're accompanied by other signs of illness such as vomiting and/or lethargy , need to be evaluated by a veterinarian quickly . <p> Some very serious dog illnesses have diarrhea as a primary ( and often the first ) symptom . <p> But , even when the cause of the loose stools is simple ( you changed your dog 's food or he snacked from the cat litter box ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health concern in itself . <p> Knowing how to tell if you can afford to ' wait and see ' for a day , or whether you need to visit a vet immediatlely , can make all the difference to your dogs ' health . <p> On this page I 'll help you figure out what 's caused your dog to have ' the squirts ' , and decide what the best course of action is - whether that 's simple at-home treatment measures , or a trip to the veterinarian 's office . <h> Common Causes Of Dog Diarrhea <p> Diarrhea in puppies and dogs comes in a variety of types , none of them pleasant but some more worrisome than others . <p> Here 's a look at the most common ones ... <h> ' New Puppy Syndrome ' <p> Young puppies very often have an episode , or two , of diarrhea or loose stools , during their first week or two in a new home . <p> A sudden change in diet , coupled with the stress of leaving their ' doggie ' family and moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resulting loose bowels . <p> In this situation , the puppy diarrhea usually ranges from ' loosely-formed ' stools to a soft ' chocolate pudding ' type consistency . <p> If your pup is still eating and drinking normally , is n't vomiting or showing signs of exhaustion and plays happily , the chances are good that the problem will resolve itself within a day or two . <p> You can often prevent this from happening in the first place by making any dietary ' change-overs ' gradually - slowly replacing the old ' familiar ' food with the new one over a period of a week or so . <p> For this type of diarrhea all you really need to do is to make sure that your pup has access to plenty of fresh water , and gets plenty of rest . <p> BUT ... if the diarrhea does n't get better within 24 - 48 hours , or it gets worse , or if your pup shows any signs of not feeling well , you 'll need to get him examined by your vet right away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't changed your dogs ' food recently , he may have had the urge to eat something that is n't part of his normal diet - or even considered edible ! <p> A midnight ' snack ' from the kitchen trash can , or eating half of your new leather loafers are pretty much bound to end in an upset tummy for your dog - and if you 're a new dog owner you may well be surprised at how creative your pet can be when it comes to experimenting . <p> Depending on exactly what was eaten , the resulting dog diarrhea can be anywhere from one loose stool , to several very ' runny ' ones . Your dog may also vomit once or twice , and will probably look fairly sorry for himself . <p> It can be a bit tricky to figure out whether dog diarrhea like this is a minor or a major problem . <p> Unless you know for sure what your dog ate , and you know that it is n't toxic to dogs and is n't likely to cause an intestinal obstruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veterinarian . <p> A meal of left over burgers and fries is n't likely to be an issue , but things such as the stuffing from the sofa pillows/pieces of a toy/stones from the back yard or the TV remote control all have the potential to cause serious trouble ! <p> Some foodstuffs that are fine for humans can be dangerous for your dog . Chocolate is a big one ... it only takes a little bit of chocolate to poison a dog . Check out this page for info . on that - Help ! My Dog Ate Chocolate . <p> For a list of the most common foods that pose a danger to your dog , see this page ... Poisonous Foods . <p> If your dog has diarrhea that is recurring or getting worse , is vomiting ( or retching/trying to vomit ) , seems lethargic or is showing signs of stress such as excessive panting , drooling , whining , pacing and so on , then you need to have him seen by a veterinarian right away . <p> On the other hand , one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vomiting ) are n't necessarily cause for panic , and if your dog is behaving normally in all other respects then you can probably ' wait and see ' for 12 - 24 hours . <p> BUT ( and this is a big BUT ) , if your dog shows any other signs of illness or distress , or you are at all worried - talk to your vet . It 's always better to be safe than sorry . <h> Illness or Disease <p> There are a whole host of different dog illnesses and canine health conditions that can cause diarrhea in dogs . <p> Some of them may be fairly minor , others can be deadly in a very short space of time . <p> Many of them are very common in puppies but although they may be less common in adult , vaccinated dogs , there is still the potential for harm . <p> Some of the most common causes of dog diarrhea in terms of illness or disease include : <p> When disease is the root cause your dogs ' diarrhea , the diarrhea itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other signs of illness such as repeated vomiting , loss of appetite , lethargy , fever and so on . <p> Although he may start out with just ' loose ' stools , in this situation dog diarrhea will usually get progressively more severe ( sometimes very quickly ) . <p> It often turns watery and may even contain streaks of blood or mucus . If this happens to your dog , he 'll probably look ( and act ) as though he feels terrible , and you 'll suspect that something is very wrong . <p> Aside from the effects of the underlying illness , the dog diarrhea itself will cause your dog to get dehydrated very rapidly . <p> If left untreated , dehydration causes serious health complications , even eventual organ failure , so if your dog has repeated episodes of diarrhea , is n't drinking enough or won't/ca n't keep water down , he needs to be seen by a vet immediately . <p> Because dog diarrhea is a symptom seen in so many canine diseases , I 'd recommend always erring on the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' opinion if you 're at all concerned - it could make the difference between life and death . <h> Rottweilers &amp; Parvovirus <p> Rottweilers are one of the breeds that are especially susceptible to Parvo ( others include Doberman Pinschers , German Shepherds and Pitbull and bully breeds ) , so you should never take chances with a puppy who 's repeated episodes of diarrhea and showing signs of illness . <p> Canine Parvovirus can literally kill a young puppy , within 24 hours . I 'd strongly recommend checking out my Parvo Symptoms page so that you know what to look for and can keep your puppy safe . <p> Because of all of this , ANY time a Rottweiler shows signs of illness , which include diarrhea , vomiting and lethargy , he needs to be seen by a veterinarian IMMEDIATELY . <h> Treating Diarrhea In Dogs <p> If your puppy or dog has severe , watery diarrhea , is showing any signs of feeling unewll , or is diarrhea has lasted for longer than 48 hours , you need to have him examined by your vet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no two ways about it at that point . It 's always important to rule out something serious . <p> If your pooch has some **28;99;TOOLONG stools but otherwise is acting normally , is eating and drinking normally , and seems happy , you can usually wait for 24 to 48 to see if things improve . <p> It 's always important to make sure a pup with loose bowels or diarrhea has plenty of fresh water . <p> Dehydration can cause all sorts of trouble , all by itself . <p> Here are a few tips that can help speed up the healing process : <h> Fasting <p> To give your dog 's tummy a chance to settle down , you can withhold food for 12 - 24 hours . <p> Small breeds and young puppies are better being fasted for just 12 hours . Medium to large adult dogs can be fasted for 24 hours . <p> Do n't forget to make sure there 's plenty of water available at all times . <p> You can try to encourage additional fluid intake if by offering water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like K9 Quencher which is available in several tasty flavors . <p> If your pooch vomits up some foamy , yellow/green liquid it 's most likely going to be because his tummy is too empty . Giving him a couple of plain dog biscuits is okay to help with that . <p> After the fasting period is over , the first meal to feed your dog should be plain , white , boiled rice . With a tablespoon of canned pumpkin ( not the pie-filling variety ) added . <p> This is bland , easy to digest food , and will hopefully reset his digestive system . <p> After two meals of this , you can gradually return him to his normal dog/puppy food . <h> Dietary Changes <p> Adding a little canned pumpkin or pureed sweet potato to your pups food can help firm up stools ( oddly enough , it can also help a constipated puppy ! ) <p> To prevent loose stools as a result of a sudden change in diet , if you want to change puppy or dog foods , do it s-l-o-w-l-y . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new food to the current one , then gradually increase the amount of ' new ' and decrease the amount of ' old ' over a few days time , upset tummies are much less likely . <p> High protein dog foods are can cause loose stools in some dogs . As can generic or low quality foods which contain a lot of chemicals , poorly absorbed nutrients and ' fillers ' . <p> Large breed puppies should n't eat food with high levels of protein as it can cause problems with their growing bones joints ( see my Feeding Puppies page for more on this ) . <h> Supplements &amp; Products For Dog Diarrhea <p> There 's a whole range of different dietary supplements and products that have been especially designed to help dog diarrhea and digestive upsets . <h> Related Pages ... 152135 @qwx562135 152136 @qwx562136 152137 @qwx562137

@@50393944 @3893944/ <h> How Bad Is It For A Rottweiler Puppy To Have An Overbite ? <p> by Terry ( Hawaii ) <p> Our last dog we got was a rottweiler/dobie who we kinda saved but poor baby had some heath issues and only lived 2 years . My two rotties I owned prior both lived to 10-11 years no health issues . Very healthy happy girls . <p> We are getting a new puppy and I am a little skittsh with health issues . So I am asking for your advice . We have a breeder here who has produced outstanding puppies and though our puppy is just a part of the family and not a show animal I have this question . <p> I am number 4 pick for a female and the litter only had 4 . The puppies are 7 weeks and I will get to know which one I get in two weeks . The owner has kept us in the loop of progress from the day they were born and she just emailed to let us know that there are two female pups who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is and sent her an email as well . <p> Someone is taking one but I still have a chance that I will be left with a puppy that has this . In looking at all the photos of the pups and many at close facial range I honestly ca n't tell the difference the puppy is eating fine and is very good looking . Since we are not breeding or showing our dog is this ok or is this condition something that could cause the puppy problems/pain as she grows . <p> If she is left I have the option to opt out but we have been waiting awhile and if it will not pose a health issue I have no problems with it what so ever . <p> I appreciate any words of advice you may have . Thanks ! <p> Hi TerryThis is a good question , and as overbites are often an imperfection that separates show-quality puppies from pet-quality ones , it 's likely that many other people will be looking for similar answers . <p> A correct Rottweiler bite is the ' scissor bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top incisors overlap the bottom front teeth ( lower incisors ) very closely . A dog who has an overbite , underbite or ' wry mouth ' ( basically uneven or crooked teeth ) is n't show quality and these are disqualifying faults . <p> However , regardless of whether a pup is to be shown or kept as a pet , you 're absolutely right to be buying from a responsible , reputable breeder who produces excellent dogs . Rotties are prone to some health issues ( as are all other breeds ) and it only makes sense to be as proactive as possible in making sure you purchase a healthy pup - both mentally and physically . <p> In terms of the overbite affecting your pups health in any way , this is very ( very ) unlikely . Now I 'm not a vet and obviously every case is different so I ca n't say 100% for certain that there wo n't be a problem , but I 've never heard/seen that happen . Most overbites are minor and are a cosmetic issue really .... although as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor overbite unless you 're looking up really close . <p> Also , it 's good to bear in mind that your pups jaws will be growing and changing until she 's anywhere up to between 9 months and a year old , and that although she has an overbite right now - that could possibly become a scissor bite before she 's mature . <p> This should n't cause her any problems eating , or pain etc . Sometimes vets will recommend having the lower puppy ' fangs ' ( canines ) taken out surgically when a pup has an overbite .... to prevent discomfort of the lower canines putting pressure on the roof of the pups ' mouth . However , again I 've never know this to be necessary and if your pup does n't seem bothered by her teeth then I 'd leave well enough alone . <p> Obviously this is a very personal decision and you 've taken time to find an excellent breeder and to wait for a puppy , so only you can decide whether or not you want to purchase this pup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how difficult these types of decisions can be . <p> I ca n't give you ' professional ' advice I 'm afraid , but I can say that if I were in your shoes and a slight overbite was the only problem this pup had , then I would go ahead and take her , providing I did n't want to show her . I doubt this imperfection will have any real impact on her health or any other aspect of her overall wellbeing . <p> I hope this helps , and I wish you the very best of luck with whatever decision you make . 152137 @qwx562137 
@@50393945 @3893945/ <p> These will give you a more realistic idea of what to expect from your pup , and what her temperament SHOULD be - and it sounds as though she 's exactly where she should be right now . <p> As a guardian breed , your Rottie should have a strong desire to protect her home and family when she 's mature .. but that still does n't mean that she will bark/growl or want to bite anyone she does n't know !

This is how it should be . <p> Rotties are very discerning guard dogs and you must never encourage your pup to be aggressive , or even distrustful of strangers .

The specific gene involved can be ' carried ' by a dog without him/her showing any symptoms . <p> If this dog is then bred to another dog who does n't have the disease ( and is n't a ' carrier ' ) , the puppies are still at a greater risk of developing canine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this gene . <p> If two dysplastic dogs are bred to each other ( even if one is a ' carrier ' ) , the resulting puppies have a much greater risk of developing symptoms or being a-symptomatic ' carriers ' and will continue to pass this on to their offspring . <p> All of this makes it no easy job to eliminate the gene for hip dysplasia in dogs from any one breeding program , or even a particular bloodline . <p> Reputable and responsible breeders are making huge efforts to only breed dogs who do not have , or carry , the gene for this condition and it is helping ... but there 's still a long way to go . <h> How Diet Can Affect Hip Dysplasia In Dogs <p> Large breed puppies tend to grow very quickly , and sometimes erratically , and a diet that is n't designed to meet the very individual needs of these puppies can cause growth spurts that put excessive stress on their joint and ligaments . <p> In puppies who are predisposed to developing canine hip dysplasia ( perhaps due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the disease . <p> The main problem is usually either that the pup is being fed too much food , or one that does n't have the correct balance of nutrients . <p> Choose only a premium puppy food ( see my Best Puppy Food page for more info . and examples ) specifically formulated for large breed puppies , and one that falls within the preferred ratio of protein , fat and calcium . <p> Ideally look for ... <p> Protein : 23% - 25% <p> Fat : 12% - 15% <p> Calcium : 1.2% - 1.5% <p> Adding calcium or other minerals can do more harm than good and is n't recommended unless for some specific reason your pups ' diet is lacking in the proper nutrients . <p> It 's also very important not to overfeed your Rottweiler pup in an attempt to make him/her grow bigger , or faster . <p> The eventual height/weight of your pup is determined by bloodlines and genetics more than anything else . <p> Although an excellent diet , proper veterinary care and adequate exercise will maximize his potential , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain on his growing bones and ligaments . <p> It 's never a good idea to ' free-feed ' a puppy , that is in terms of leaving their food bowl down and letting them eat as much and as often as they want . <p> This can lead to eating problems such as all-day snacking , which can result in an overweight dog . <p> It 's best to offer your pup the amount of food that 's appropriate for his age/breed/weight ( guidelines are generally on the food bag as a starting point ) , twice a day . <p> No tidbits or inappropriate snacking between meals either - with the exception of small rewards during training sessions . <h> Exercise &amp; It 's Role In Canine Hip Dysplasia <p> All puppies need exercise , and large breed pups can need quite a bit of space to work off that boundless ' puppy energy ' . BUT , too much of a good thing is never good ! <p> Because they 're big and heavy , and often a bit clumsy or poorly co-ordinated due to erratic growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more easily than you may expect . <p> Excessive amounts of exercise can also put too much strain on those growing bones , joints and ligaments . This can cause damage and in pups who have the predisposition to canine hip dysplasia it can trigger symptoms of the disease . <p> Daily walks , a romp in the back-yard or play sessions with the kids or other dogs are fine as long as you supervise and do n't allow them to become excessive . <p> But do n't let your large breed puppy do anything that involves jumping such as in/out of a truck , off walls or several steps etc. as this is a common cause of injury . <p> Also avoid long hikes , or much running on hard surfaces such as cement or asphalt .

They all have white patches on their chest is that normal , will their colour change ( or what does this mean ) . <p> Also the vet advised we not bottle feed and to let nature take it 's course.Told me that bottle feeding was n't a good idea . I somehow feel they just wanted nature taking its course . What are the pros &amp; cons about bottle feeding . <p> Thanks <p> Cole <p> Hi ColeI 'm so sorry to hear about the loss of all these puppies , Rottweilers do tend to have big litters and 11 puppies is really too many for a female to deal with without help . <p> It 's difficult to advise on the bottle feeding situation as I 've no idea why these puppies have died and if there is some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to happen . If for example the pups were born too soon or have a genetic condition that 's incompatible with a normal life , then I can understand the philosophy of ' letting nature take it 's course ' . Although , I 'm not certain I would follow it unless there was no hope . <p> However , if these puppies were born full term , and seem normally developed , and they 're dying because the mom can't/wo n't feed them , or has n't got enough milk , etc. then I certainly would n't advise just letting them die ! Bottle feeding puppies can be tricky , especially if they 're weak already , but if you can do it successfully it can give them a chance of growing up . <p> Tube feeding is more effective in sickly or weak puppies , but does have risks involved and you 'd need your vet to show you how it 's done . Whether you tube feed or bottle feed , you need to use a milk formula suitable for puppies . You can buy these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores or can make your own at home . Here 's a link to what I think is the best information on the web about feeding newborn puppies ... Bottle Feeding Puppies . It literally tells you everything you need to know . <p> As for the white patches on the puppies coat , this is n't exactly ' normal ' but it does happen . Usually one , or both , of the parent dogs are carrying the genes for this coat variation , and it comes from some of the oldest Rottweiler bloodlines . There used to be more acceptable color variations in coat than there are today , and you can I mention it on my Rottweiler Dogs page and my Rare Rottweilers page . <p> A few white hairs is acceptable and often disappear as the pup grows , however white ' patches ' are a disqualifying fault in terms of show conformation . <p> I hope this info . helps and that these remaining puppies survive .

Rottweilers are a breed that are slow to mature and then are ' lanky teenagers ' for a long time ! The full height comes first , usually by around 17 - 18 months , and then they put on the rest of their weight , often not reaching their full adult size until they 're 2 years old ( in the case of the bigger males it can be closer to 3 ) . <p> As long as you are feeding her a premium puppy food specifically designed for large breed dogs then she is getting the nutrition she needs to grow up strong and healthy . Putting on too much weight too fast is unhealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd suggest that you take a look at both my Best Puppy Food page and my Rottweiler Puppy Growth Chart as they have lots of info . that I think you 'll find helpful . <p> When it comes to the white patches in her fur , this is something that is still sometimes seen in purebred Rottweilers , and goes back to the very early days of the breed . In the beginning this breed ( as with most others ) evolved from a blend of different breeds . There were herding dogs of different varieties in the first Rottweiler lines and a whole host of different colors were acceptable then . You can learn more about the history and origins of this breed on my Rottweiler Dogs and Rottweiler Facts pages . <p> Depending on the bloodlines of your pup , white may still show up randomly in some pups , generally it 's on the chest , but can appear elsewhere . A dog with white markings ( a few white hairs do n't constitute a ' marking ' though ) ca n't be shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pet dog it 's not a problem . <p> If your pups parents both had papers from a reputable registration body such as the AKC , then you can be fairly certain that she 's full blooded . If the parents did n't have papers then there are no guarantees , even dogs who LOOK like one breed but are a mix , can carry genes that will show up in their pups and indicate their mixed bloodlines . <p> As long as your pup is happy and healthy , I would n't worry about this too much . Chances are she 's exactly what you thought , and she 's your loyal and loving friend regardless . Hope this helps . Best of luck with your pup . <h> Markings of Rottweiler puppies <p> Our Rottweiler bitch has just had her first litter of puppies , and indeed it is ours too ! She was mated with a dog imported to Kenya from Germany . <p> Two of the puppies have white stars on their chests and one of these also has a white paw . The owner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puppy and they grew out . <p> Is this something that happens with Rottweilers or should we be concerned that perhaps another dog covered the bitch ? <p> Hi FionaWhite markings on the chest ( from a few white hairs to the sort of white patch you describe ) do occur in some bloodlines and go back to the very earliest days of the Rottweiler breed when other breeds were part of the genetic makeup . The white paw is less common , but can happen . <p> If the markings are very small it 's possible that they will disappear as the puppies grow up , but if they are patches as opposed to just a few hairs , they may actually get bigger . <p> Although it 's a conformation fault to have white patches , it does n't affect the dogs health or temperament and does n't mean that these pups are not purebred . I 'd recommend that you take a look at my Red Rottweilers and Rare Rottweilers page as it has more information on the original colors of the Rottweiler breed . <h> is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little gray or white <p> my rotties nose - the actual nose has slightly got a little white or gray on it she is akc registered . <p> Hi TerriA Rottweilers nose should be black , if your pup has some paler pigment on her nose then it would be a flaw in terms of being evaluated for show . <p> However , when you buy a show quality pup ( and have discussed this with the breeder ) it would need to fit the Rottweiler Breed Standard , although there is never a guarantee than any individual pup will mature to be show-worthy - it 's simply a ' best-guess ' by an educated and experienced breeder . <p> As your pup is most likely going to be a pet rather than a show dog , this should n't be a problem . It does n't mean that she 's not a purebred Rottweiler , just that she has a ' fault ' or ' flaw ' - as do most animals/people ; ) It does n't affect her beauty , temperament or worth to you . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check up just to be sure that it 's not due to over-dry skin , an infection or anything like that though . Unlikely , but never hurts to check . If she 's an older dog and this is a new condition , then definitely have your vet take a look . <h> White on chest of Rottweiler pup <p> by Mary ( Sibley , LA ) <p> We are thinking of getting another rottweiler , but he has white on his chest . <p> Could this mean that he is not a full blooded rottie ? <p> Hi MaryIf the pup you are looking at does n't have papers from a responsible organization such as the AKC , then it is possible that he/she is n't purebred . The only way to be fairly certain that any puppy is purebred , is if it has legitimate papers - but even then there 's no absolute guarantee . <p> However , a white spot on a Rottweiler puppy does n't necessarily mean that it 's not a purebred . White spots do show up on Rottweiler puppies from time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest , but occasionally on the feet . This is a genetic trait and goes back to the very early days of this breed , when other colors were acceptable and not just the black-and-mahogany that you see today . <p> If you are looking for a show quality pup , then you would not want to choose one with a white patch ( unless it was just a matter of a couple of white hairs ) as anything more than that is a fault . However , with a pet puppy it is n't anything to worry about . <h> Why do some Rottweilers have white spots and some do n't ? <p> I have two rotties and one has a white spot below his collarbone and the other one does n't ? They both came from the same breeds of german rottweiler , the mother or father do not have the white spot . S <p> hould I be worried , they are both 7 months old . I know they are not mixes because I met the parents . Why the white spot and what does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ' worried ' about this . If your pup with the white spot is a show-potential puppy ( and was sold with that type of stipulation ) then if it 's more than a a few white hairs it could be a fault in terms of conformation . <p> However , if your pups are pets and not destined for the show ring , a small white spot or mark is n't a problem - and does n't mean that a pup with this feature is n't a purebred Rottweiler . <p> I 'd recommend that you take a look at my ' Rare ' Rottweilers page where you 'll learn why some Rottweiler bloodlines do carry the gene for these white patches ( and just because a dog does n't show the patch , it does n't mean he/she is n't carrying the gene for it or is n't able to produce pups with that color variation ) . <h> genetics and white patch on Rotties chest <p> What does it mean when your rottie puppies are born with a white patch on their chest ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , on a Rottweiler 's chest is n't terribly unusual and can occur in full-bred Rottweilers . <p> It 's a genetic trait and is a ' hangover ' from the earliest days of the breed when other color variations were acceptable . It is a fault in terms of conformation , but in a pet it 's not a big deal as long as the puppy is otherwise healthy both physically and emotionally . <h> White symmetrical spots developing on my 2 yr old Rottweiler <p> We adopted a rottweiler from someone about 6 mos ago and in the past 2 mos we have noticed she is developing white spots that appear symmetrically on her . <p> Her nose has always been pink with some black spots and I am thinking she has some kind of skin pigmentation . <p> Have you heard of this before and is it something we should be worried about ? <p> HiI 'm not a veterinarian and I think this is a question for you to ask your vet as he/she will be able to give a hands-on exam which will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The only thing I can think of is that your pup is developing vitiligo , which is a skin condition that is related to immune system function . It does occur in Rotties , GSD 's , Dobermans and other breeds and is most common in male dogs of 2 years or older . I believe a veterinarian can diagnose this by taking a small skin biopsy . If this is the problem I 'm not sure there is an actual ' cure ' - although the dogs overall health is n't generally affected , just the skin/hair color . However , certain supplements etc. can help I think . Your vet would be the person to ask . <p> There are other possibilities for change in coat color , or bald patches of skin etc. such as allergies , or mites , but not for a pink nose as far as I know . <p> Sorry I ca n't help more , but I 'm sure your own vet will be able to find out what 's happening .

That 's a misconception about this breed and it actually sounds as though your girl has the correct temperament . <p> Rotties are extremely intelligent dogs and they are very intuitive in terms of ' reading ' people and situations . Your Rottweiler has obviously not felt that you or your family have been at risk or threatened , or in a situation that requires her to protect you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to ' run off ' strangers or visitors is n't a good guard dog , it 's a dangerous dog , and this is n't something you should ever encourage in any dog , least of all a Rottweiler . <p> Obviously all dogs are different and you may own one of the very rare dogs who wo n't protect their owner or family if faced with a real threat , but I very much doubt it . Your Rottweiler sounds calm and confident , willing to make friends and not fearful or snappy , that 's what you want to see . I believe that if you were to find yourself in a situation where you or one of your family were at risk , your Rottie would react entirely differently . <p> I once saw one of my dogs act very suspicious around someone , a stranger to me , ( and this was quite out of character for her ) , it was obvious that she did n't trust this person . I 've no idea whether she had good reason or not as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this person very carefully , ready to spring to my defense if needed . Normally she 's the friendliest dog you could hope to meet ! I think your dog will have the same ' sixth sense ' so I would n't be too concerned about this . <p> Do n't try to encourage her to act aggressively or defensively if she does n't feel the need , this can cause anxiety and result in fear-based actions or reactions which are out-of-context for a situation . Never a good situation . <p> You say she 's a good dog , and smart . So trust her judgment . Just love her and be grateful for her ' steady ' temperament , it really is a blessing . <p> I hope this helps some and I wish you the best of luck with your dog . <h> Comments for my rott is too friendly <p> hey i have the same problem with my 13 month old , she just wants to play with every dog we see , which is a bit of a problem because she just will not leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she wo n't come to us when we call . <p> Nov 01 , 2012Rating <p> I have the same problemNEWby : Steve <p> In the original response " Although Rottweilers are a guardian breed they should never be openly or indiscriminately aggressive .

Sometimes very hungry , other times not even interested , this is very normal and as long as she 's growing , is active and seems happy and healthy I 'm sure all is well . <p> Do n't try to force her to eat , just offer her a good quality puppy food ( what you are using is fine ) and give her 10 or 15 minutes to eat . Then remove whatever is left and do n't offer her ' snacks ' or anything other than tiny training treats before the next meal . Nature wo n't allow her to starve herself if she 's healthy , and it 's better to keep a Rottweiler puppy on the ' lean ' side when growing to protect developing bones/joints as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13lbs at 5 weeks she 's not underweight , but no two pups are the same and Rottweilers are slow to develop and mature . You really wo n't be able to tell how big she 's going to be for a long time ! Rotties were n't originally bred to be ' giant ' or ' extra-large ' dogs , and it 's much more important that a Rottweiler is well constructed in terms of conformation , healthy and active than that he or she is huge . <p> As for exercise , it sounds as though you 're doing just fine there too . The flights of stairs could be a potential problem , but as there 's really not too much option but for her to climb them , just take it slow and carefully . With any large breed such as a Rottweiler , the growing bones/ligaments etc. are at risk of damage from over-exercising or falling etc. , during the first 18 months or so , and stairs are a risk factor .

She is still playing and curious and beautiful , just wondered if her age is bringing on a different behavior pattern . <p> Thank you . <p> HiShe 's a gorgeous pup , great coloring too : o ) <p> When you 're raising a puppy it helps to remember that really it 's just like raising children - except that the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of years , rather than the 18 or so it takes for a human child to mature ! <p> At 15 weeks , your pup is entering the ' tween ' stage and is no longer a baby . She 'll become an adolescent/teenager and then young adult before becoming ' all grown up ' . <p> Each of these stages will have it 's own characteristics , some positive , others more challenging , but they 're all normal . <p> If you think how a child who is moving into adolescence starts to challenge their parents , push the boundaries , and try to exert their own authority/will as a way to see themselves as an individual , then you 'll recognize similar behavior in your pup . <p> The ' aggressive ' behavior and ' craziness ' you mention are probably partly fueled by these changes , but they could also indicate that she 's not getting enough exercise or stimulation ( physical and mental ) to use up enough energy . Many , many puppies go through the ' puppy crazies ' in the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe even barking or snapping at things as they fly past . This is a way for them to release any pent up energy , physical and emotional and is normal , if unnerving !

Like a human teen , she may ' push ' against them , but they 're necessary and she will learn to accept them as she grows . <p> At this age , enrolling her in a Basic Obedience class would be a very good idea as it will give her valuable socialization experience and help you both to bond and learn to work together . Even a few basic obedience sessions at home ( see my Free Puppy Training Tips page for lots of help/suggestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a puppy out ! <p> Biting and nipping is a very normal puppy behavior , but it needs to be firmly discouraged .

@@50393962 @3893962/ <h> socialization for my Rottweiler <p> by Jamie Ranft ( Seguin Tx ) <p> I have a 3yr old rottie Enzo . At this time he is the only dog we have . He is so very wonderful . He sleeps in the house but spends the day in the back yard . ( We let him in during the hot afternoon ) . We are a family with 2 boys 12 and 17 . <p> Of course true to his breed he is loving and wants to be in the middle of whatever is going on . We took him to the vet today for his yearly shots . He has always gone to this vet . The dr. said he was worried that Enzo was too afraid . That he was uneasy . That we should muzzle him and take him around people to let them touch him and around other dogs . I am wondering what your suggestion is . We live in a small town in Texas . There are no dog parks . I want you to know that we play with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been faulty of talking baby talk to him and probably have contributed to the high opinion he has of himself . <p> So I am puzzled that he is uneasy or not self-assured . I very much want a balanced dog . Also one final note . My husband is a strong figure and I can tell that Enzo sees him as the dominate one . However he probably does n't exactly feel that way about me. ( this has been my mistake ) . Any time you have would be very appreciated . This is our 3rd rottie , you can never get enough rottie love . <p> Hi JamieEnzo is a gorgeous boy , and it sounds as though he has a good , sound temperament and that you 've done a great job of raising him overall . <p> However , Rottweilers are a guardian breed and they 're naturally a little suspicious of strangers . If they 're not socialized properly this can translate into being fearful or aggressive when they encounter someone , or a situation , that they 're unfamiliar with . <p> Luckily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and personality is sound , they can learn to accept ( or at the very least to tolerate ) strange people , places and experiences calmly and without showing anxiety or aggression . <p> As your dog is now three years old it will take more effort , time and patience to socialize him than it would with a puppy - but it can most definitely be done ! If he 's never had any formal obedience training then I 'd suggest enrolling him in a beginners class as soon as you can . This would be a great way for him to get some socialization experience within a controlled setting and you will be able to get hands-on tips and advice from a professional dog trainer . <p> Also , check out this webpage which has tons of tips and advice ( and links to other related pages ) on socializing a puppy ... Socialize Your Puppy . Although it talks about puppy socialization you can apply it equally to socializing an older pup or dog . <p> Your vet recommending a muzzle suggests to me that he fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he feels threatened . You know your dog best , and if you feel that Enzo MAY react this way then a soft nylon muzzle may be a good idea , at least for the first few times you take him out in public . However , it can make the process a bit trickier as making socialization a pleasant experience for the pup/dog involves giving treats and praise , and it can be awkward treating a dog who is muzzled . Also , if he 's not familiar with the muzzle beforehand ( and comfortable with it ) , then wearing it can add to his fear which is counter-productive . <p> It 's something you 'll need to consider yourselves as you know your dog better than anyone else . Learning to obey commands and being rewarded for success will help to build up Enzos ' self-confidence . So will being out in public and being rewarded for letting someone give him a treat , or even for not shying away or retreating from someone or something that he 's a little nervous about . It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , positive and loving , the end result will be a happier , more confident dog . And that 's worth the effort . <p> I hope this helps some , best of luck with Enzo . <h> Comments for socialization for my Rottweiler <p> your dog is very handsome . I agree with the previous posting about enrolling him in beginner classes . It is also essential to introduce your rottie to all type of sounds and situations on a daily bases so that he will become familiar with them . If your dog did nothing to provoke your vets advice , I think your vet mighty be the fearful one . I do n't  know if this is the case , but as I am sure you know many people are extremely intimedated by rottweiler due to bad ownership and people training their dogs to be vicious and hollywood movies . I think you should let him spend more time in doors and make sure he is properly introduced to many people and objects Hope this helps good luck 152137 @qwx562137

But if it were n't for her momma 's quick thinking and responses this adorable little girl would probably have died . <p> Parvo is a no-holds-barred , take-no-prisoners type of virus , and Rottweilers are one of the breeds most at risk of catching it , and dying from it . <p> ALL Rottie owners need to learn all about Canine Parvovirus and make sure that they know how to recognize the symptoms and understand the importance of getting veterinary help immediately . <p> Angelika is a Rottweiler puppy who was unlucky enough to catch Canine Parvovirus from a puppy who visited her home just once . The photo at the top of this page is Angelika ' helping ' on Christmas morning , before she got sick . <p> However , she was one of the rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending ..... and that happy ending is due in huge part to her owner 's prompt action . <p> Angelika 's story was shared with me , and all the visitors to this website , by her owner Sherry . <p> We shared Sherry 's fears , prayed for them both , and then shared in the relief and joy as Angelika fought off the virus and was able to go home . <p> I have taken excerpts and photos from Sherry 's almost daily updates , and have focused on the most important and relevant parts . <h> Prayer Request For Angelika - January 12 , 2011 <p> My dear husband got me the puppy I so badly wanted after losing my Rott Roc this past summer , for Christmas . I was so happy when he walked in the door , I cried ... I am 48 and this is still hard for me to control when I am so happy . I really did n't think we could afford it , but he did find a way . <p> Well , the problem started when one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were caring for .... the next evening he called and told us about the puppy going down with Parvo . My heart sank . I had dealt with a very bad bout several years back that tore me apart ... out of 4 pups under age 2 , I was able to save 1 . <p> Those were some of the most horrible few weeks of my life and for those pups ! I refused to have a puppy near our home for almost 2 years to make sure . Again , we seemed safe and had no problems ... until this . Well , knowledge was my friend I hoped . <p> About 9 days later it started ... she started throwing up .. fear gripped my heart ... I watched carefully , she threw up again after only a little water ... it was happening . Really bad timing , we have all been sick and I have been very sick because of complicated respiratory problems anyway , but my pup was more important so in spite of fevers myself and needing to be in bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept her warm ( we had just been hit with an ice storm ... no going anywhere at that time ) , gave her a little kaopectate I had on hand when she threw up and water a little at a time about every 30 minutes till about 3 am . At this time , Angelika let me know she wanted to go to bed ... I picked her up gently and we went to bed to get a few hours of sleep . By 6 we were up and at it again . <p> By 8 my husband was on the phone with a vet friend of his ( wish that helped on the costs that are coming ) because I had done enough research online to find out that because of her breed , she was even more susceptible than the breeds I had dealt with before ... and I do n't do very well with losing . <p> Off to the vet by 9 and arrived by 10 ( we live in the country ) . Angelika was still very attentive and doing remarkably well and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did n't want to take any chances . <p> That was yesterday morning and we are far from out of the woods even though the vet is even more hopeful than when we got there simply telling us statistics and yes even suggesting euthanization ( hope that is spelled right ) . Again , I let them know I could not give up on her . <p> She has been on Antibiotics , IV and an anti-nausea med since about 12 hours after the first sign of onset that I could honestly tell ( and I am very overly protective of little things ... have raised many pups , cats , birds , raccoons , and even squirrels with much success among other things too . Even helped an owl get strong enough to go back to the wild once . Life is precious ... including God 's little creatures . <p> We really ca n't afford the vet bill , but I just do n't see where we ca n't afford not to incur it to give Angelika a fighting chance ! Fortunately , the vet is willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it stands , she is still doing very well ... still very responsive and alert and the signs are still mild according to the vet , compared to what I have seen . The vet says that the next couple of days will tell a lot and I know this all too well from experience . My only real question is ... Will you please pray for little Angelika ? <p> She is the most precious little girl with a great personality already showing . From the first night here she completely accepted our family and has never whined in loneliness . Overnight , she immediately decided this was home and has been our little princess . <p> I do n't care who thinks it is silly to pray over an animal ... honestly we are all God 's creatures and they deserve the prayers just as much , if not more at times , as people . I have been so careful for this not to happen again and now here I go again with such a precious part of our family and my dream dog . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she became part of the family in only about 36 hours and wanted to help my grand-daughter 's open their present Christmas morning . <p> We know she will love it here even more as she grows because we she will have access to 160 acres of land here to roam that our previous Rottweiler Roc loved so much too . And with the many other animals here , life will never be lonely ... someone ( mostly me ) is always home to be a companion and love her . <p> Please keep Angelika in your prayers ! ' <p> UPDATE Jan 12 : ' As of this morning , she is still alert and responsive , fevers are not bad and nor has anything changed from yesterday other than they told me that she is a little more depressed . ' <p> UPDATE Jan 13 : ' I got permission to come visit Angelika for a few minutes today . The moment she saw me , she lifted her head and tried to get up , which really surprised me , but made me feel so good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , but very tired looking . She is a bit skinnier , but not overly so really for what she has been through this week . She knows we have not abandoned her and I know she is definitely a fighter . There is a lot of good that came out of today , but please keep up the prayers as she is n't completely out of the woods yet ... ' <p> UPDATE Jan 16 : ' Well , my little girl is a fighter in spirit . She is still hanging on and starting to react more each day . Vet is starting to give her some high dose vitamins ( whatever she will hold on her stomach ) in hopes of helping with energy . She still has her IV in and getting the fluids , Antibiotics and a lighter anti-nausea med . I am trying to be realistic about this virus and understand that all could be for nothing except a heartache in the end .

We have been informed that she looks better today than she has and they will be force feeding her through today and tomorrow . As long as she holds the food down and continues with the improvements , she will be allowed to come home on Thursday ! At this point , my heart is ecstatic and extremely hopeful ! I want so much to believe that she is on the mend and has made it through , but I still know anything can happen . We have a long way to go before that little pup will be bouncing around again .

' <h> Prayer Thanks From Angelika - January 20 , 2011 <p> ' Angelika made it through the Parvo . I picked her up this morning at the vets ' . After 10 days in the hospital , she looks much better than I expected . <p> She is on bed rest and meds with a special diet ( a canned high protein and vitamin stuff from the vet ) including some yogurt with tummy bacteria . <p> She does not like the food they want her to eat but I found she will gladly eat plain cooked meat ... I am cheating on this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the yogurt and other food but have added a liquid vitamin just for dogs and puppies to make sure she is getting the nutrition she needs to recover . <p> I figure what energy she does have is better spent eating than fighting to eat . <p> We will return to the vet at the end of next week to follow up and give her next booster shot which will be right at her 12 weeks on that Saturday . Please , Please , I can not stress enough not to skip giving these puppies their shots regularly and not letting anyone bring any puppies around them until they have completed their first series of shots ... that means not until after they are 4 months old and had their 4th shot ! <p> Please , please take this very seriously as Parvo is a killer ! I have seen it 's ugliness first hand and that is why Angelika was rushed so quickly to the vet . <p> The vet says that the only reason my puppy lived is probably because we were aware that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to calm her stomach until we could get her into the vet within 12 hours of onset . <p> They really could not believe she made it through as sick as she was , but home she is now and the recovery is ahead of her . <p> Thank you so very much for all the prayers ... Prayer does work miracles ! Even for animals ! I am including a picture of Angelika this afternoon and will post another in about a week to show her progress . Keep those prayers coming . <p> Also , if there are any suggestions for helping her mend , please make them as I do so want to give her the best care I can possibly give her ... she has been through so very much these past 10 days . ' <h> Angelika On The Mend - January 25 , 2011 <p> ' Just an update and to show a few pictures . Angelika is doing much better after her bout with Parvo and 10 days in the hospital . <p> She is now eating and drinking very well on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of days left on meds . I will continue to give her the vitamins as I have really liked the way they have seemed to help her bounce back . <p> She is up more and a little playful at times now . <p> Still not the bouncing puppy we are looking for , but each day brings her back to us a little more . <p> I am afraid she has become quite spoiled through this and knows she has been queen for the past several days since coming home . She whines when she wants up on the couch or bed and not in her bed . Right now , I do n't mind to much as it is easier for her to whine than spend what energy she has trying to jump up . <p> Actually , because of how pulled down she is , I do n't really want her jumping much anyway so as not to cause any harm to her little growing body . I have been encouraging her to take it easy and stay fairly settled to give her little body time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in as it did when I picked her up , but it is just a little better than that now but at least it is showing signs of filling out again . <p> She is walking stronger each day and her legs do n't look as weak and skinny , but still have a long way to go as you can tell by the picture taken this morning of her sitting . <p> She has started eating a little of her regular puppy food softened with water but still mostly on her soft diet . <p> Her stools have finally started looking normal this morning without any diarrhea at all ... yippee ! <p> There were some points where I was concerned this weekend , but they did n't last long and quickly remedied themselves ... probably just me over worrying as I have a tendency to do this over the least little thing at times like this . <p> There is a picture of her snug as a bug in her little bed ... hope she does n't try to make us keep a box for her as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zone from the grandchildren , while still being able to watch everything going on ... we do have a busy household . She spends a lot of time awake now , but tucked away in her box , just watching the cats and little dog and grandchildren . <p> Today , she is not spending so much time there though and venturing out quite a bit more to be nosy and insist that everyone pet her . The sparkle is coming back a little more every day and today it is showing more than before ... <p> I am so thrilled to say ... Angelika is definitely out of the woods and going to have the chance to enjoy her home with all the other animals and 160 acres to roam thanks to all the prayers on her behalf ! <p> Sue thanks for such a great site !

All is well . <p> We waited until the second week after getting her home before taking her back into the vet for her next shot . She really did need that extra week in my book ... thanks for the tidbit of advice Sue . <p> At the vet , she was given a clean bill of health and started back on the normal routine of shots and care . The vet even said she was really surprised at how well she was doing . <p> Angelika is now in process of learning tricks and obedience with a vengeance . I say it like that , because this little pup is so smart ... we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she gets it . <p> At first I thought we would have to keep working at it through each session ... no , this pup learns them quickly ... the next session , she knows exactly what you want from the word and hand signals I give her . <p> She has already learned : sit , speak , shake and other paw . She understands and responds very well to her name , come , no bite and no and I am glad to say she is almost completely housebroken . <p> Still a little rowdy sometimes , so I have not started with stay too much yet ... though she does seem to understand when I go out the door and tell her to stay that she is not allowed to go with me . She is such a joy ! <p> Angelika 's bout with Parvo is definitely over !

I believe in prayers ! <p> Please be aware that even though Diarrhea is usually the first sign , in Angelika , throwing up was the first sign . She threw up ... I watched on guard ... she drank some water a few minutes later and then immediately threw up again ... that is when I knew it had started . <p> When this started , I started administering kaopectate ( about 1/4 teaspoon ) when she threw up and I used an injector syringe that comes with some of the turkey injector marinades and would give her about 1/2 a syringe ( about 1 ounce ) at a time ... little by little so as not to overdo it . <p> We spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving kaopectate when she threw up . <p> I would recommend to new puppy parents that you might consider purchasing some things like pedialyte and kaopectate or pepto bismol to keep on hand just in case . Then , off to the vet first thing the next morning ... we would have taken her that night except that we had an ice storm that night and could n't drive on our roads until later the next morning . <p> I am posting some new pictures so you can see that she is really on the mend . You can see that her weight is back ... we will find out at the first of the month whether she is back on track with her weight . <p> My opinion is that she is there from her looks . What do you guys think ? Also , you can see in the background of the pics that she has a very large backyard to play in ... and she loves it ! <p> Angelika is definitely a little Miracle Puppy !

Also a healthy puppy looks a little ' chubby ' - Rottie pups look quite ' square ' and like little bear cubs . <p> I 'd generally recommend picking a pup that is ' middle of the road ' in terms of temperament , not the shyest one and not the most outgoing or ' alpha ' . An outgoing and very ' forward ' pup may be too much for a first-time Rottweiler owner to handle when he/she grows into adolescence and beyond . A too-timid or shy pup may need extra attention and experience to prevent it becoming a fearful adult . A pup that is friendly , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-time owner . <p> Lastly , make sure the pup has been de-wormed and had at least one set of vaccinations before you bring him/her home . That gives at least a little protection against disease . Then have your pup examined by your own vet within 24 - 48 hours ( the sooner the better ) after picking him up . This will make sure he 's healthy , and rule out any underlying ( but invisible ) health problems . <p> You may also want to check out my Rottweiler Puppy page for more tips and advice on choosing and caring for your pup. 152137 @qwx562137 
@@50393967 @3893967/ <h> 1 year old Female Rottweiler - jumping and mouthing <p> I adopted Kaena from our local shelter.Remarkably she is AKC registered . Her background just states the previous owner could n't handle her need for exercise as they were not very active : <p> Anyways my question is about jumping and mouthing . I do n't think she was properly trained . She was at our shelter for 2 months though and had some behavioral classes and socialization from volunteers . Shes about 85 pounds right now so I want to figure how to get her to stop mouthing arms when she jumps at you . <p> I know she is playful and she 's not growling or aggressive in anyway when she does this . It is her way of greeting once let take her out of her kennel . She practcally knocks me over though ! I am petite myself and in a few years she 'll outweigh my 110 frame ! So I have a few bruises on my arms where she has jumped and put her paws around me and licked my face haha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog and all . I just want her to calm down a little , and break her of that puppy habit of mouthing . <p> She does respond to commands to sit and lay down ... when she feel like it . Overall she is a joy to have and I love her to death ! <p> Hi TaraOverall it sounds as though Kaena is doing very well considering the upheaval she 's been through , but you 're right to want to put a stop to this behavior . It 's irritating at best , and could be dangerous if she was to act this way with a child , or old/frail person who could get seriously hurt . <p> There may be an element of dominance in her behavior , as I 'm guessing she 's an adolescent or young adult , and although she 's being friendly and exuberant , she may also be expressing a ' show of strength ' ( not necessarily , but possibly ) . <p> I 'd recommend that you read my Stop Puppy Biting page and follow the tips and advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , she should understand the corrections you 're giving her . As she 's a bit older though and has been allowed to indulge in this behavior , it may take a bit longer than you expect to change it . Be very patient and consistent with your corrections . <p> If she knows the ' sit ' command , use it every time she jumps up and only pet her when she 's sitting nicely . Do n't greet or pet her while she 's jumping - ever . If after several weeks of consistent training she is still jumping and mouthing , then you could try a no-jump harness which physically stops a dog from jumping , but it can only be worn for short periods . <p> Enrolling her in another round of obedience classes would probably also help and strengthen the bond and communication between you . <p> I 'm so happy that Kaena has been lucky enough to find a good , loving home with someone who is willing to take the time , and put in the effort , that 's needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish you both the best of luck . <h> Comments for 1 year old Female Rottweiler - jumping and mouthing <p> yes seep the dogs back feet when she is up .. , the dog can fall and injure its head , etc ... u have seen too many bruce lee and chuck norris films <p> Mar 06 , 2012Rating <p> jumpingNEWby : Anonymous <p> One method that works is to take the dog off balance when they jump up . you can use your feet to sweep her back legs , not kick , sweep and make her unbalanced and she will have to bring her front paws down .

On balance though , given the information and experience available to me I still feel that doing the surgery between 6 and 8 months of age gives a pup the best protection against reproductive order diseases without causing other issues with growth/development . Neutering before 6 or 8 weeks is another issue , and may cause more problems . But again there 's no consensus on that from the professional world . <p> Hip and elbow dysplasia is mostly caused by hereditary components . A pup who has joint abnormalities due to his genetic makeup may develop the full-blown condition regardless of whether he 's neutered , or whether his diet is adequate , or his exercise level is appropriate . It 's often a combination of nature and nurture , but it 's different for every pup . Luck or fate also often plays a role and we have no control over that . <p> From my personal experience I would consider diet and exercise to be much more important in terms of minimizing the chances of dysplasia developing ( even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) than neutering or spaying . As a breed , Rottweilers are also very prone to developing cancers of all types , and ' altering ' a pup before full sexual maturity helps to significantly reduce the risks of reproductive organ cancers and malignancies . <p> I 'm so sorry to hear that your pup is suffering from elbow dysplasia , it 's a very painful and debilitating condition and I can only imagine how difficult it must be for you , and obviously for him . If his parents both had good OFA ( or equivalent ) hip/elbow ratings , he is very unlucky to have developed the condition , and it 's possible that an environmental factor was involved . But it could also be just ' one of those things ' that happen sometimes without adequate explanation . <p> I definitely would n't blame yourself or feel that you were responsible for this by neutering him , or by any other action you took ( or did n't take ) .

@@50393976 @3893976/ <h> biting Rottweiler puppy <p> by Aladdin ( Egypt ) <p> I got a rottie he 's now 47 days when I got him he was 41 days old ? ! ! he is my 1st puppy ever .. however i used to take care of my cousin 's adult german ! the 1st thing I did with my puppy when he came home that we played tug of war and wrestling games .... so he started to bite , later on by visiting this website I knew that was a mistake ? ! ! <p> sometimes his bites really hurts ? ! ! is there any way I can stop him from biting me ? ! ! BTW I stopped all these games right away ! ! now it 's like 2nd day ! ! ! ! <p> Hi AladdinA puppy should never leave his momma and littermates so early , 8 weeks is a minimum age for a pup to be going into a new home . One of the problems often seen in puppies who are removed from their canine family too early is excessive biting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhibition or other canine social skills . <p> By playing tug-of-war and wrestling , you then encouraged him to bite , so it 's not surprising he 's a little piranha fish right now ! However , at least you recognize that you made a mistake and are willing to change it , so that 's a big step . <p> You need to realize that this puppy is a very tiny baby and he 's basically acting on instinct alone right now . I strongly recommend that you read my Stop Puppy Biting page and follow the tips and advice there . Do n't expect an overnight success though , it ALWAYS takes days , usually weeks , to start to see improvement and in your situation it could take longer because your pup is so young and he 's already taken a cue from you to start biting . <p> You need to be very consistent with him , correct him firmly but lovingly every single time , and be patient . Training takes time . I think my Taking Care Of A Puppy page would be useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips and advice to help you understand puppy care better and give your little guy the best chance of growing up happy and healthy . <h> biting rottweiler <p> I have 1 problem with my dog that his biting how can I control him . He is 13 months old <p> Hi Nhorie.Your pup is an adolescent ( teenager ) right now , and it 's normally around this age and stage of development that pups begin to test their limits and may exhibit dominant or unwanted behavior . <p> Rottweilers are big and strong , and you need to make sure that you train them properly when smaller and younger so that they respect you and will listen and obey . By this age no Rottie should be biting or nipping at people in play/fun and definitely should n't be inclined to bite . <p> I 'm not sure if he 's biting you when playing or training , or if he 's acting in an aggressive way and biting others . However , either way , you need to correct him strongly and firmly ( but not with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm verbal correction and a leash correction should be enough , as long as it 's done at the right time and in the right way . <p> I 'd also recommend that you get him enrolled in a dog obedience class or find a professional dog trainer to help you work with your pup and get this problem resolved quickly . Until you can teach him not to bite , you may need to use a soft muzzle on him in public IF he 's acting in a threatening or aggressive way to strangers . This is n't a long-term solution though , training is needed . <p> I 'm afraid that I really ca n't help or advise more than this but please find a local dog trainer who can help you deal with this now . Best of luck with your pup . <h> Rottweiler puppy pulling on my sleeves or pant legs . <p> I have a 7 month old rottie male , who recently started pulling on my clothing . He has never done this behaviour before . <p> We go for walks 3-4 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his leash or the sleeve of my jacket , how do I get him to stop ? <p> I have tried saying no , and removing his mouth from my clothing but it only gets worse . <p> Hi JulieYour pup is a teenager , an adolescent , and he 's trying to exert his own opinion about things and this is just one way of expressing his excitement . It 's bordering on being dominant though as he 's pulling you , so it does need to be stopped . <p> Verbally correcting him is the first step , and I 'd also recommend using a training collar when you walk him now so that you can give him a quick ' pop ' on the collar as a correction - at the same time as the verbal correction . <p> You can find a selection of these on my and Big Dog Collars pages . Personally I prefer to use the ' prong collars ' rather than the simple chain-link ' choke ' collars . Many people think ( quite mistakenly ) that prong collars are cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounded and a firm but gentle ' pop ' on the collar will be noticeable to the dog , but not hurt him . <p> Rottweilers are very strong dogs and if your pup is excited he may barely be aware of a tug on his choke collar , if you need to use a lot of force or ' drag ' at his neck to get his attention you could hurt him , or even damage his throat . <p> You may also want to try the ' water spray bottle ' correction method . Just buy a small plastic spray bottle and fill it with water , then set it to ' jet ' or ' squirt ' rather than a spray or mist . When your pup pulls on his leash or your pants/sleeves etc. , use a verbal correction and then give him a quick ' shot ' of the water right on his nose . He wo n't like it and it 's a pretty good deterrent . <p> With any type of puppy behavior like this , you need to be very consistent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correction every time , in the same way , be calm and firm and never shout or get excited or angry - that will just escalate the situation . Your pup will learn what you expect if you 're consistent in showing him . <p> During this adolescent period many pups , especially males , will try to dominate you at times , sometimes subtly - others not so subtle . They 're basically testing their limits and whether or not you are strong enough to be their ' leader ' . Be firm , strong and loving and he will understand that everything is okay . <h> Rottweiler puppy that likes to bite ! <p> We got our Rottie at 6 weeks of age . She is now 8 , but has a real ' biting " issue . <p> Not just at EVERYthing in the house , but at us as well , how do we stop this ? <p> HiAll puppies have biting issues , it 's an absolutely normal part of puppy behavior ! Some breeds , and some individual puppies can be a bit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more intense in puppies taken from their momma before 8 weeks of age . <p> Up until at least the age of 8 weeks , pups need to be around their momma and siblings so that they can learn proper social behavior and interaction skills , and bite-inhibition ( how hard they can bite ) is one of them . <p> However , although this is normal , it 's important to discourage this early - while your pup is small and eager to learn . I 'd strongly recommend that you read my Stop Puppy Biting page as it has all the tips and advice you need to get this under control . <p> Consistent , firm and loving correction will eradicate this habit but you need to be patient and not over-react . The page mentioned above will tell you everything you need to know . Best of luck with your new pup. <h> over excited 5 months old female rottie jumping and nipping <p> by Jane ( New Brunswick , Canada ) <p> Sunshine , 5 months old , challenges me when overexcited , listens and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she also chews on leash and when corrected jumps and nips . Have tried just about everything , ignoring behaviour just makes her more assertive . <p> I understand she is still puppy but at 60 pounds she can cause problems , can not allow her to meet new people as she jumps and gets overexcited as she loves people . <p> We do not have any formal obedience classes in our town . <p> Also have 9 years old rottie who comes to us and stands in front of us when she gets too hyper . Is he trying to protect us or does he want to have us take over the correction phase of this hyper pup ? <p> Hi JaneTo deal with your older Rottweilers ' behavior first .... I would say that he 's actually doing both of the things you mention . He stands in front of you because he senses the pups ' over-excited and emotional state of mind and he want to make sure that she realizes that you are ' his ' to protect . <p> But he 's probably also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing what he thinks he needs to because you are not in control of the situation . This could lead to problems if he feels he needs to be more ' assertive ' in order to set things to rights . <p> Your pup IS still a pup , but she 's a big pup and ca n't be allowed to behave this way . There are some things you can do to help show her that this is n't acceptable , but I also strongly suggest that you find an obedience class for her , even if you have to travel a bit . She ( and you ) need the help and the socialization and hands-on approach will make this a lot easier . <p> For now I would suggest that you set up ' practice sessions ' where you can work on this jumping . You 'll need a long training leash ( see my Leash Training A Puppy page ) or a length of strong , but light , rope . <p> Practice appropriate behavior for greeting someone at the door ..... attach the leash/rope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your family ) should hold the other end of the leash lightly and loosely . Then have someone go knock on the front door or ring the bell and another family member should open the door and invite them in . Sunshine will likely leap on them and they should say ' no jump ' and hold their hand up palm forward , simultaneously the person holding the end of the leash needs to give a firm , but quick , jerk of the leash to put her off balance and return her feet to the floor . <p> Repeat if necessary if she tries to jump again , and she will soon stop for a moment to try to figure out what 's going on . When she 's not jumping , have one of the people at the door tell her to ' sit ' and then greet and pet and praise her . <p> The point is for the leash correction to be unexpected , and for Sunshine not to think of it coming from the person she 's greeting . Repeat this several times a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoors in other ' meet and greet ' sessions . Be patient and consistent and she will eventually begin to ' connect the dots ' . <h> My Rottweiler Pup Is Biting <p> I have a 9 week rottie X staffy and he seems to bite everything be it fingers , hands , blankets , clothes everything . <p> I was wondering if this behaviour is just part of being a puppy or does he need to be seriously disciplined ? <p> Hi MikeeI 'm not sure what you mean by seriously disciplined , but if you mean corrected in a firm , but loving way .... then yes he does , because this is something that he needs to learn is n't okay . <p> However , no puppy ( or dog for that matter ) needs harsh or physical punishment , or even shouting , it 's not necessary and is counter-productive ! <p> At 9 weeks old it 's important for you to realize that he is a tiny baby , and he 's just doing what comes naturally . Puppies play in this way , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bite nip people or chew on stuff that 's ' off limits ' . <p> I strongly suggest that you read my Stop Puppy Biting page as it has all the tips and advice you need to curb this very normal , but annoying , puppy habit . <h> Still Chewing and mouthing <p> by Audrey ( Cleveland , OH ) <p> Sweet but not innocent ! ! <p> My beautiful girl Bella is now 8 1/2 months old and is a wonderful loving puppy , however , she is still chewing pretty bad and recently has started to get into things she never bothered before . She is also still mouthing quite a bit when excited . <p> We have TONS of toys to keep her busy and spend a lot of time training her but we ca n't seem to break these two problems , any advice ? <p> Hi AudreyAlthough Bella is growing fast and now looks much more ' grown up ' than she did as a pup , it 's important to remember that Rotties are slow to mature and develop and right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tween and early-teen ' phase in humans . <p> During this time it 's very normal for a pup to ' up the ante ' in terms of challenging authority , testing limits and acting out . Absolutely normal . However , it can definitely be challenging and exhausting for owners : o ) <p> The only thing to do is to continue to correct her firmly but lovingly and to be absolutely consistent about rules and boundaries . She needs to feel secure in her environment and to know that ' her ' humans are in charge and the rules are not made ( or altered ) by her ! <p> There is also sometimes another ' fear period ' at this age which can make a pup suddenly act afraid or nervous around people or places that she was previously comfortable with . It passes given time , and all you need to do is continue to socialize her consistently and in a positive way . <p> Add to this the fact that she 's probably either just had , or will be having soon , her first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hormones are all ' out of whack ' and you can see why she is behaving in a very teenage-type way . <p> Bella is a beautiful girl and it sounds as though overall she 's doing just fine . If you 've raised kids through the teenage years you 'll already know how to handle this , if not just follow your instincts and be loving but firm with her and she 'll come out the other side a well-balanced and confident adult . <h> Rottweiler pup is nipping , growling and jumping <p> lucy at 4 months <p> My 7 month pup jumps up when i tell her no and growls and nips at me , she nips at me . <p> I know she just wants to play but she 's getting very strong . <p> HiRottweilers mature into big , strong dogs and it 's much easier to deal with behavioral issues like jumping and nipping when they are small . However , even a pup who has learned NOT to nip or jump , may ' regress ' during adolescence . <p> Adolescent pups ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are inclined to test the limits and their parents ' authority on a regular basis . It 's part of growing up and finding their place in the family , and the outside world . <p> It 's very important that you are consistent and firm in your corrections , but also that you are loving and non-combative . I 'd recommend that you read my Stop Puppy Biting page as it has all the tips and advice you should need to curb this annoying ( but very common ) habit . <p> I 'd also suggest that you check out my Free Puppy Training Tips page as making sure that Lucy is well-trained and respects and obeys you will help to tone down her behavior . <p> At this age pups are often trying to exert their authority over the people ( and sometimes other dogs ) in their lives . It 's important not to let Lucy think that she is ' in charge ' . Do n't allow her to sleep on sofas , chairs or beds ; block doorways by lying in them ; obstruct you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet ' ) ; prevent you from touching her food , or her , while she 's eating and so on . She needs to be totally clear about who 's ' boss ' . <p> If you follow these tips this stage will pass and Lucy will grow out of it , and into a well-behaved , confident and obedient adult . I wish you the very best of luck with her , she 's a pretty girl . <h> Rottweiler puppy biting problem <p> by Georgina <p> Hi , I 'm Georgina <p> My puppy was now 8 weeks old . She has been biting me harder on my hand and feet . And I tried to correct her by closing her mouth to say NO and push her away but when am trying to close her mouth , she bites me aggressively . <p> Plz correct me and do advise me . TQ <p> Hi GeorginaBiting and nipping is a very , very common puppy habit and it is annoying and can be painful too . However , you need to be very consistent and patient in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactive in your attitude will only make things worse . <p> I strongly advise that you read my Stop Puppy Biting page as it has lots of tips and advice to help you . If the verbal corrections and withdrawal of attention do n't help , try the water-spray bottle method , it 's usually the most effective in that situation . Do n't use the ' holding muzzle closed ' if it only escalates the situation , this does happen with some pups and it 's then counter-productive . <p> Do bear in mind that your pup is just a tiny baby and is doing what comes naturally to her . You need to be very patient and consistent ( and loving but firm ) with your corrections as she wo n't learn overnight - or even within a week or two , it takes lots of time and effort to train a puppy.Do n't resort to smacking or shouting as that will most definitely make things worse , cause her to lose faith and trust in you and get your relationship way off track . <h> Nine week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs and hands . <p> by Ryan ( Calgary ) <p> Hi there , I am trying to get my 9 wk old puppy to stop biting at mine and my seven year old son 's feet , legs , chin , ears , hands , nose ... you name it , and he 's nipping at it . <p> I ca n't seem to scold him enough , I 'm beginning to fear the word ' NO ! ! ' is really going to mean nothing to him very soon . I 've only had him for five days but there has been no improvement . Also , he seems to be fixated on only me , ignoring my son almost all together . <p> I know he see 's me as the big dog in our pack , but he wo n't respond to him at all if it means having to be more than two feet away from me . I would really appreciate some advice . Thanks . <p> Hi RyanWhat you 're describing is absolutely normal puppy behavior for a 9 week old in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his place in this new ' pack ' and so far he sees you as the ' alpha ' or pack leader ( which is the way it should be ) , and sees your son a sibling , basically another puppy ( which is something you will need to deal with , but take it slowly ) . <p> The first few weeks with a new pup are a time of adjustment for everyone , and it 's important to remember that your Rottie is just a tiny baby right now , so do n't expect too much from him too soon . <p> I 'd strongly recommend that you read my Stop Puppy Biting page as it has all the tips and advice you need to deal with this annoying , but totally normal , puppy behavior . You need to be very consistent in your corrections , firm but loving , and very patient , you wo n't see results overnight ! But with consistent training this nipping will diminish . <p> The reason he 's nipping at your son the most is because that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way . In order to help him learn that he 's the ONLY puppy in the house , you will need to involve your son in taking care of him on a daily basis . Have him fill his food bowl , brush him , play with him , help teach him basic obedience commands ( see my Free Puppy Training Tips page for all the help you need ) . Even if you have to stand 2 feet away at the time that 's not a problem , your pup will learn and understand , plus in a few weeks he 'll be a lot less ' tied to your apron strings ' because he 'll have increased in self-confidence . <p> Raising a puppy is a long-term project and patience and consistency are key . Just take it slowly and give him lots of love , attention and loving discipline . It 's really just like raising a child , just a shorter time-frame ! Hope this helps , best of luck with your puppy . <h> 4 month old Rott keeps biting us ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Rott can be so sweet one second and the next he is a wild man jumping and biting us and no it 's not teething like others have said to us . <p> We are stern with him telling him no but he does n't seem to care he just keeps doing it and more so to my 6 year old little girl . <p> We need to stop this before he gets to big and really hurt her . Any info/tips would help . <p> Thanks , Donna <p> HiHi Donna , Although your puppy is teething at this age , and although biting and nipping is a very normal part of puppy behavior - you 're right to realize that this is definitely something you need to stop as soon as possible . <p> Your pup is just coming out of the ' baby puppy ' stage , and is an adolescent , a ' tween ' really , and his behavior is an attempt at domination and part of his efforts to establish his ' place ' in his ' pack ' . <p> His pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack instinct , it 's something that is ' hard-wired ' into them and he 's purely going on instinct . From what you describe , he 's about willing to accept that you and your husband are above him in the ' pecking order ' , but he is trying to place himself above your daughter . This is normal . Puppies often see human kids as their siblings and the interaction between them is similar to what you would see in a litter of pups . <p> Of course , if you think of human tweens and teens , you will be able to see the correlation between your pups ' behavior and a human teenagers ' . There 's the constant challenging of rules , the ' miscommunication ' between kids ( the human and fur variety ) and parents , the acting out and flaring emotions ... it 's all there . Raising puppies is very much like raising children , just a much shorter time-scale <p> It 's very important during this stage that you are firm and consistent in your action and corrections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , do n't shout , and never use physical or harsh punishments , these cause much more harm than good . Firm , but loving , discipline is the key . <p> Rotties are big , strong dogs , and you 're again correct to be concerned that your daughter could get hurt - not due to aggressiveness , but simply due to your pups ' superior strength and dentition ! It 's important that you help your pup recognize your daughter as higher up in the ' pecking order ' than he is himself . <p> Dogs respect those who control the daily necessities of life , and tend to see them as ' alpha ' . This means first and foremost that you daughter needs to be involved in your pups ' daily care , particularly feeding and training him . As she is only 6 , she will need to be supervised , but try to let her do it by herself as much as possible so that the pup sees her as taking care of him . <p> Have her practice the ' sit ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit ' before she pours his food into his bowl and gives it to him . Let her practice other basic obedience with him , and give him the rewards or correction ( again with as little help from you as possible ) . <p> I 'd recommend that you read my Stop Puppy Biting page as it has tons of tips and advice on how to deal with a nippy pup . Then choose the way that you , as a family , are going to correct your pup and make sure that your daughter does the same thing as you do . Try to help her to keep her voice low and her actions slow , this will reduce your pups ' instinct to ' chase ' her or to ' worry ' her . High voices and quick movements tend to trigger the ' prey drive ' in dogs and that 's why kids are often chased or are the target for a dogs ' excited behavior . <p> Rottweilers are very loving , loyal and protective and make great family pets , but they are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fact that their ' pack ' can take care of them . Otherwise they will take it on themselves to be protector and provider etc. , which is n't what you want . Your pup needs to trust you to take care of him . <p> I 'd also recommend enrolling him in a puppy class at a dog obedience school . It will help you all to learn to communicate better with each other , plus you 'll be able to get some ' hands-on ' training from a professional which will help you overcome any issues such as jumping , inattention and so on . It really should be a priority to make sure all Rottweiler pups get at least the basic obedience training they need . Also , socialization is important as your pup needs to learn to feel comfortable around strange people and new places or environments . This builds self-confidence and helps to prevent their natural ' guarding ' instincts from getting too pronounced . <p> The adolescent stage can be a bit challenging in any breed , but with the right approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope this helps some , if you 're loving , but firm and consistent , with your training your pup will grow up to be a well-behaved dog . Best of luck with your pup . <h> My Rottweiler Biting <p> by Travis Howard ( Inman , SC , US ) <p> My Rottweiler he is 3 years old . He is a very lovable dog . He sleeps with me and my fiance , and he loves my mother . He acts as if he would n't hurt anyone . But when a car rides by he jumps at the window growling and jumping really bad . Also if we are outside in the fenced in back yard if someone comes up to the fence he growls and snarls really bad . <p> I 've done everything i can do to prevent him from being mean . I do nothing but baby him and i do not train him to protect . But today a guy came up to the fence and tyson(dog) was growling like usual but i walked down and started petting tyson and he calmed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach over and pet him and he bit into the guys arm . <p> I am scared to death that he will bite more often now . And i have a baby due in July and i just do n't want my dog being a risk . I love my dog and do not want to give him away . What do you suggest ? <p> Hi TravisYou 're right to be concerned about your dogs behavior , and although I can give you some suggestions and advice , I really recommend that you have your dog evaluated by a professional dog trainer or dog behavioral specialist and follow their advice and recommendations . Some one-on-one training with a professional trainer would probably be very valuable here . <p> Rottweilers are naturally protective and can be very territorial , although you 've never encouraged him to be aggressive I 'm inclined to think that he 's also not had enough socialization and interaction with other people and places . Many owners do n't realize that it 's VERY IMPORTANT to socialize a pup and continue to these experiences throughout his/her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that strangers are n't a threat , and to learn how to behave around other people , dogs and in new situations . It increases their self-confidence , and decreases any fear or anxiety ( which is often at the root of ' aggressive ' behavior ) . <p> I also wonder how Tyson reacts when you take him out , to the park for example , or to the vets ' office ? Many dogs are much more inclined to be friendly when they 're not on their ' home turf ' which they feel a desire to protect . If your dog is generally well-behaved and approachable when he 's out and about , then the situation is a bit less worrying ( although obviously still a concern which needs addressing quickly ) . <p> Also , although I know you 're doing it out of love for him , ' babying ' Tyson or petting him when he 's being protective , is n't actually helping him . He needs to be corrected firmly ( verbally ) if he barks or growls at someone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should most definitely back down and allow himself to be approached . Rottweilers are n't Golden Retrievers and they do n't love everyone on sight , but they should tolerate them without any sign of aggression . This does n't happen overnight , or without a lot of work , and I most definitely think that you need some professional hands-on help here so I 'd again recommend getting in touch with local dog obedience schools , trainers and even your vet as he may be able to recommend a behavioral specialist who could work with Tyson and you to overcome this behavior . <p> Rottweilers also need to know who 's in charge , and if you are not firm enough with him and instill in him the feeling that you can take care of every situation and will protect HIM , then he may take it on himself to become the ' alpha male ' and it sounds as though this may be what is happening . <p> Because he 's already bitten someone , and your family situation is about to change with a new baby being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will hurt the baby as it will be part of his ' pack ' - do n't every leave him alone with your baby/small child unsupervised .. EVER ) , you need more help and advice than I can give you here so please , get in touch with the professionals in your area and enlist their help . <p> This is n't Tysons ' fault ' and he 's not necessarily a mean or vicious dog , he 's simply trying to protect his family in the only way he knows how . You need to show , and teach , him that this is n't acceptable so that he learns the correct way to behave . For everyones 's sake please get him some professional help asap . I wish you all the very best of luck and hope that you can get this behavior under control soon . <h> tried to nip me <p> by Jane ( Scotland ) <p> My rottie 2 years and nine months . Generally well behaved and well socialised . Loves playing with other dogs . While massaging his head which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his sides and front legs and started to do the same and he turned round as if he was going to give me a nip . I stopped doing this immediately . <p> Is it he did not want me to stop doing this to his head , which he was clearly enjoying . He had snapped at me a while back but I put him back to nilif training and he has been great since then . <p> Am I needing to go back to this again ? <p> Hi JaneIt sounds as though your dog was trying to tell you something , but what it was I ca n't be sure . He may have wanted you to keep stroking his head , or did n't want his legs/body touched . Either way he was trying to control your behavior by his , and that 's not acceptable . The fact that you ' obeyed ' immediately will have reinforced this type of reaction in his head as it worked for him that time . <p> It 's important not to stop doing something if your dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for trying to stop you with a firm " No " , and continue - even if only for a few seconds . You obviously do n't want to get nipped , but you need to pretend that you 're stopping because YOU want to , not because he said so ! <p> I 'm not sure what nilif training is , but basically you need to become a stronger and more authoritative figure in your dogs eyes as he 's now an adult and is trying to figure out his place in the family . You do n't need to be harsh or punitive about this though , Rotties are actually very sensitive dogs . <p> Make sure that you always make him ' earn ' everything , from food to toys and treats by asking him to ' sit ' before he receives them . Also , keep him down off beds , sofas etc. and do n't let him block doorways , obstruct you when walking etc. etc . With a little extra time and work I 'm sure you can overcome his tendency to dominate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my puppy Indy since he was 2 weeks old and he has been hand reared as his mother rejected all 12 puppies and they were all subsequently fostered out or sadly passed away . <p> He has been growing perfectly to date , eating well , and knows a few simple commands like sit and down . At his age now though of 9 weeks unfortunately we can not seem to get him to stop biting/nipping . I have read your page on puppy biting and have followed the steps that you have suggested to no avail though . <p> He specifically nips at me and my youngest child who is 5 ( he particularly likes her clothing ) . I understand that he did not get a chance to develop his bit inhibition but we have to put a stop to this ASAP as his claws are getting sharper as are his teeth by the day . <p> Any help would be greatly appreciated , Natasha ! ! ! <p> Hi NatashaIndy is only 9 weeks old , so even with the best and most consistent of corrections it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior . <p> The tips and advice on my Stop Puppy Biting page will work , but you need to be patient and give it time . I know this is difficult when there 's a small child involved because they 're getting scared , but your puppy is just a baby and it takes time to learn things . <p> It 's also likely to be more of a resistant behavior because ( as you are obviously aware ) he has n't had siblings to play with and learn from . Really you just need to be patient and consistent with your corrections and give it time . Indy will learn as long as you correct him every single time . Remember that ' firm but loving ' are key , if you are too harsh , or raise your voice or emotional level it will only make the biting worse . <h> Biting behaviour in Rottweiler puppy <p> by Ahmet tok ( Turkey ) <p> Hello SBIer ! I realised that you have an sbi website like me it 's wonderful ! Firstly you have a great website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rotweiler for a week and it 's 7 weeks now . I am trying to teach to poop only on a newspaper in the apartment . My problem is , she lovesss to bite . I do n't let her to bite me but she is dying to bite with an incredible passion ! <p> I let her to bite an old pair of socks when we are playing but she is still craving to bite my hand , fingers . What should i do ? <p> It 's my first pet . Your advise is appreciated . <p> Hi AhmetThanks for the compliments on my website , I 'm glad you 're enjoying it and hope you find it helpful . SBI rocks ! ! <p> As for your question about puppy biting .... this is totally normal as ALL puppies do it , but some breeds ( and even individual dogs within a breed ) are more stubborn about it than others . <p> I 'd really recommend that you read my Stop Puppy Biting page as it has all the tips and advice you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though and you need to be very consistent and patient in your corrections . <p> Puppies are creatures of habit and they learn through association so it 's important that they always see the same ' cause-and-effect ' in action . They 're also tiny babies and do n't learn things overnight , it 's a gradual learning curve . <p> Sometimes people who are n't familiar with puppies do n't recognize it in the same way , and unfortunately there are also people who have certain preconceived ideas about a breed such as the Rottweiler , and they misinterpret many behaviors because of that . <p> However , just because it 's normal behavior , that does n't mean you need to accept it . Larson needs to understand that his teeth should n't come in contact with your skin ( or the skin of any other human ! ) and to do this you 'll need to correct him firmly , but gently . <p> I strongly recommend that you check out my Stop Puppy Biting page as it has all the tips and advice you need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent with your corrections , because puppies are creatures of habit and they learn through repetition . Never be overly ' authoritarian ' with Larson , you need to be firm , but loving . Use a low firm voice , no shouting , and if you need a muzzle correction ( see the page I linked to in paragraph above ) do it gently but firmly . <p> Also , make sure he has plenty of really strong , sturdy chew toys to play with . He 'll be teething until he 's about 6 months old , and Rottie jaws are very strong ! Take a look at my Tough Dog Toys page for some examples of suitable toys . <p> Rotties respond very well to positive , reward-based training , but they can get stubborn if you are too harsh or ' come on too strong ' . This is especially important when they reach adolescence , because at that point they will often resist training or corrections that are too heavy-handed and it makes the whole process a lot less fun for all involved . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you follow the tips I 've given you , Larson will grow out of this just fine . He 's a really good looking boy ( the bits of him I can see anyway ! ) , and I know he 's going to be a wonderful companion . Best of luck with him . 152137 @qwx562137 
@@50393977 @3893977/ <h> Buying A Rottweiler Puppy - Lessons learned from Cash ! <p> Before running out and buying the first Rottweiler you fall in love with , please consider the following : <p> * The MOST IMPORTANT thing you can do before buying that cute Rottie pup is to think about it and do your research . Once that 's done , here are some tips to buying a quality dog that will provide you and your family many years of love , companionship , and faithfulness . <p> * When visiting the breeder 's home or facility , ask to see the parents of the pups . Some breeders may not have the male available as they used a stud dog or artificial insemination . But they should have photos of the stud dog , and a copy of the pedigree and health certificates for both dogs . Also ask if they allow the dam to skip a heat cycle after each litter . Back-to-back breeding is unhealthy for the female and genetically bad for the offspring . Skipping to the 3rd heat cycle is best , but skipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the breeder is releasing pups earlier than 8 weeks RUN . It 's become common for puppies to be released as early 6 weeks , but between 6 and 8 weeks puppies undergo a tremendous amount of socialization . Expect to place a refundable deposit on the pup . If you have not taken delivery of the puppy at the end of 9 weeks expect to loose your deposit and expect the breeder to sell the pup to someone else unless other arrangements have been made . Breeders vary their refund policy . <p> * If the breeder has more than 6 females ( especially those with out health certifications ) and is producing more than 5 or 6 litter per year , it 's a good bet you are at a puppy mill . Rottweilers need interaction with their humans daily . Do you think it 's possible to have quality interaction with 6 dogs ( not counting the puppies ) in one day ? <p> * Ask the breeder questions about the pedigree of the pups and parents . Ask how the parents get along with strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ask the breeder if the sire and dam have been OFA Certified for hips and elbows , have a CERF certification for eyes ( Rotties are notorious for having eye problems ) , and have OFA heart clearances . In some cases an unplanned litter does happen before the dam or sire is 2 years old , so not all dogs will have all of these medical certifications . But if the sire and/or dam are over 2 years of age , they SHOULD have been tested . <p> * Also check out the breeder 's home and general condition of the yard , kids , etc . This goes for third party sellers as well . If the house is a mess , the yard is unkempt , and the kids look like they needed a bath three days ago , it 's a good bet the pups are living in squalor . If the house smells of waste , that 's generally a bad sign . <p> * Ask the breeder if they give any type of guarantees . A health guarantee allowing you to bring the puppy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of time ( 2 to 3 business days ) is sufficient . If your vet says something is wrong with the pup , the breeder should give you your money back or at minimum arrange to reimburse you for the cost of the puppy 's healthcare up to the purchase price of the pup . If a breeder states " NO REFUNDS-EXCHANGE ONLY " you need to RUN ! If something is wrong with your puppy , do n't you think chances are good something will be wrong with the replacement puppy from the same litter ? <p> * The breeder should also give a return guarantee , indicating that if you are unable to continue caring for the puppy properly , the breeder will take the puppy back . This is a COE breeder 's way of trying to avoid having their pups wind up in an overcrowded shelter . <p> * Other reputable breeders will give you a genetic or congenital defect guarantee . 1 year is common , 2 years is better , especially for large breed dogs such as Rottweilers . The guarantee should stipulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vet for verification of your vet 's diagnosis . If the diagnosis is verified , the breeder should either give you your money back , or allow you to keep the puppy and pay for medical expenses related to the defect up to the purchase price of the pup . Why 2 years ? Because most Rottweilers start showing signs of genetic faults by 12 to 18 months and you ca n't get an OFA certificate until they turn two . <p> * If you are not planning on showing or breeding your dog , then consider an AKC Limited Registration . COE breeders will usually do limited and give you a small discount . The same guarantees should extend to both Full and Limited Registration . Some Limited Registrations also come with a spay/neuter clause in the contract . Large breeds should not be spayed/neutered until 12-18 months . Some breeders will charge full price for the pup and once he/she has been fixed , give you a reimbursement . <p> * Beware of low ball prices on Craigslist and the internet . Some quality breeders may attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs out and there are no more littermates left . But when it comes to Rotties , you should beware of ads that mention " German " , " Championship Bloodlines " and other sales pitches . Ask for documentation ! <p> As an example , our male , Zuwachs , has an American Champion in the 4th generation , and multiple International Champions and SchH 3 titled dogs in the 5th generation and beyond . We can also provide verifiable evidence that traces his bloodline all the way back to multiple Original Foundation Dogs , including the very first Rottweiler registered in Germany . But this does NOT mean he has a " Championship Bloodline " . If either of his parents had a championship then he would come from " Championship Bloodlines . " Further , he is NOT German . He was born in the United States and is therefore an American Rottweiler with German bloodlines . <p> * If you 're looking to buy a Rottweiler , it may take you a while . Good , quality COE breeders usually have a waiting list and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be born . The breeder should choose the puppy that will fit your family best . After all , he/she has spent 8 weeks with the pups and should know that puppy #1 would do better in a calmer house , while Puppy #4 would be best for a active household . <p> * Do you have the time to train a puppy ? Training is important because that 16 pound puppy will grow into a 130 pound monster in about 2 to 3 years . Basic obedience is a MUST for a dog of this size and power ! And why are you buying a Rottie anyway ? Do you love the breed that much ? Or do you just want to tell your friends you own a Rottweiler ? <p> * Are you ready for the expense ? In the Texas area , a true German Rottie imported from Germany will cost between $7,000 and $20,000+ . An American Rottie with German import parents carrying titles/championships will cost $1,000 to $5,000+ . An American Rottie with German bloodlines ( like our Zuwachs ) will cost about $500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no papers or the owner wants to hold the papers ? They cost about $400 to $250 or less . You can bet that in most cases the dog you 're buying is n't a true Rottweiler . <p> * Other costs you need to consider include puppy shots ( $8 to $12 per puppy ) , puppy wellness vet check ( $100+ for 9 pups ) at least twice in 8 weeks , tail docking and dew claw removal by a vet at 3 days old ( $200 for 9 pups ) , annual rabies shots ( $25 per dog ) , County or Local registration in some municipalities , possible increase in homeowner 's insurance , micro-chipping &amp; annual membership fee ( $30 for the chip and $17 per month ) , GPS collar &amp; annual membership fee ( $200 per collar and $15 per month ) , AKC registration fees ( average $50 per dog ) , emergency vet visits at off hours , possible surgeries , pet insurance , spay/neutering at 12-18 months ( free to $150 depending on where you go ) , and FOOD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry food supplemented by 14 cans of wet food per WEEK ! That adds up to about $300 in feeding expenses a month . A litter of 9 puppies that have been weaned go though a 40 pound bag of quality Puppy Food every week . That adds up to $150 per month . These are real numbers from our last litter . <p> * Do you have an adequate area for exercise such as a kennel or run ? Or do you plan on chaining the dog to a tree ? A regular 4 ' or 6 ' chain link fence will not do . Rottweilers love to dig when they are bored and can jump over a 10 ' fence with ease . A quality kennel will run $500+ . <p> * If you 're not interested in a pure breed Rottie , consider checking with your local pound , rescue , or www.petfinder.com to locate your forever friend . Many people are surprised at the number of Rottweilers ( pups , teenagers and adults ) and Rottie mixes available . You 'll get the dog you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of all you 'll get to give your new best bud a second chance ! 152137 @qwx562137

I always discourage additional calcium injections etc as they can even have side effects . <p> I hope to get opinions from other owners who did successfully overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't your first question and you already know that I 'm not a veterinary professional I can just go ahead and give you my opinion : o ) <p> ( but of course I always have to make sure other visitors know this as it would be irresponsible of me to give out veterinary advice without clarifying that point ! ) <p> What you 're showing in the Rottweiler puppys ' photo above are weak pasterns - the pasterns are the ' ankle ' joints on the front legs . <p> This is like any musculo-skeletal condition in large breed dogs , and can be caused by a number of different things . The number one reason for this is genetics ... basically the pup inherited the gene for weak pasterns ( although this does n't mean his parents necessarily show the same trait , it can be a ' recessive ' gene ) . <p> Although weak pasterns are primarily a genetic problem , and you ca n't ' undo ' genes , there are other factors that can make this condition worse or better . The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food specifically designed for large breed pups is essential .

Avoid these . <p> The type of surfaces the pup walks on and how much exercise ( and of what type ) he gets also play their roles . It 's important to try to prevent a growing Rottweiler puppy from walking on slippery surfaces , as this puts too much strain on his growing joints and ligaments . Also excessive exercise , or jumping , running on hard surfaces etc , has the same effect . <p> So , although a pup showing weak pasterns such as in the photo is genetically inclined to have them , you can help minimize the problem by feeding a well-balanced diet with the correct ratio of protein:fat:calcium ( see my Feeding Puppies page for more on this ) , limiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traction ' . Also keeping the toe-nails cut short helps too . <p> This problem often seems to get worse in young/adolescent puppies ( before the age of 6 - 8 months or so ) , and improves as the pup grows .

@@50393981 @3893981/ <h> timid behaviour in Rottweiler pup <p> I have just purchased a 6 month old female who seems to be timid of everything . Especially stairs . But most things in general . <p> She was living outside at a farm and now will be inside my house . I bought her from a breeder who said he was going to keep her but his wife is i 'll . <p> Have I been taken ? <p> HiIt depends what you mean by ' taken ' ! If you think that you 've bought a pup who is genetically unsound in temperament - then I think that 's a huge jump and probably not accurate . <p> However , if you did n't research the breeder ; see their other dogs ; determine which health checks they do on their breeding dogs ; did n't buy a puppy who has a solid pedigree with both working and conformation titles and so on but were expecting a show quality dog who is well bred and well socialized - then that was also unrealistic I 'm afraid . <p> BUT - if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason to think that this puppy is n't going to be a great companion given time , effort and lots of love . <p> If she was kept outdoors and not socialized around other people , pets , situations and environments then obviously it 's not surprising that she will be timid and anxious at first ! She wo n't know much about anything that was n't within her own back yard and at 6 months old it will take her longer than an 8 week old puppy to adjust . That 's perfectly normal . <p> It 's very important that you realize this and take it slowly with her . You definitely need to introduce her to new people , animals and places - but take it one step at a time and do n't force her into confronting things head-on in too much of a hurry . That will simply scare her more and make the whole socialization process much harder . <p> Let her set the pace , and start off observing things from a distance while talking to her in a happy , up-beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help her to learn to associate good things with new experiences . <p> Also , if you 've only just brought her home then she 's also got to adjust to a new home environment , new family members , maybe new pets etc. etc . Just let her do this at her own pace too . Give her lots of love and attention but also space and time to explore on her own and in her own way . This is all scary for her and she 'll need support and love in order to feel at home . It could take several weeks , even a couple of months for her to fully adjust . <p> It 's difficult to tell from your question what exactly you were expecting from her or why you feel you 've been ' taken ' . If you bought a Rottweiler because you want a big , brave guard dog then that 's the wrong reason to own this breed ! Guarding comes naturally as the dog matures but should never be encouraged and aggressive or defensive behavior is n't desirable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , and providing your puppy is good tempered this will develop as she feels safe and secure in her new home and gradually learns to feel confident around new people and in new places .

@@50393982 @3893982/ <h> My 5 month old Rottie eats rocks . <p> by Jane ( Bozeman MT ) <p> Why does my five month old male rottie eat rocks ? He is very well behaved and listens to and follows commands but when he is off-leash in my yard and I am not working with or playing with him , he goes to the flower beds , picks up and eats rocks . <p> Most of the time I catch him and tell him to " drop " which he does and then I give him a treat . He vomited up three small rocks the other night . Obviously , I did not catch him and get him to drop them . This is worrisome as I know it can be fatal if he gets a rock lodged in his intestines . <p> I want him to have the run of my yard but I fear leaving him alone when he is older if I do n't nip this in the bud now . Advice ? ? ? ? <p> Hi JaneYou 're right to be concerned about this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would think . It 's definitely not only Rotties that do it either , many breeds do , and Labrador Retrievers are particularly prone to this . <p> However , it 's rarely a dietary deficiency or anything like that , it 's simply an inherent personality trait that appears in some dogs . You will need to be very vigilant while he 's a puppy , and hope that he ' outgrows it ' as he gets older . Some pups do , others continue doing it for life , but generally are less stubborn about it as they mature . <p> It 's really not safe to allow him free range in the yard if he does this , as he could indeed end up with an intestinal blockage . I 'd recommend fencing in a particular area of your yard specifically for him and making sure it 's as ' rock-free ' as possible . Also continue to correct him every time as this will eventually have an effect , and get him to exchange his rock for a treat whenever you can . Some dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat , but obviously this can get out of hand , so tread lightly ! <p> Sorry I ca n't help more , but it 's one of those puppy behaviors that you just have to work with and be patient .

So far we too have been lucky , as she seams to pass everything . I also have a 3yr old Aussie and we taught the drop command at a very early age with her and now the pup as well . Just by offering a really good treat when she takes a rock , she drops the rock for the treat . Eventually , as with my older dog , this becomes an awesome retrevel game . We always have treats and kibble on us , and when either of them bring us ANYTHING , we treat them , so they learn to bring you everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your lap while you watch tv or at your feet on a walk rewards them with something much better . It may or may not work for your guy , and usually they wo n't completely stop until after the teething phase ( up to 6 months ) but I find it helps to ensure that as maturity sets in they 'll get past it . I know my trainer 's collies bring him every crumb on the floor including the corner snips from the milk bag . If it becomes that they are getting good at this and getting too many treats , portion meals smaller and let them have that kibble as rewards .. or when they are past the oral phase , start using toys as rewards . <p> Oct 11 , 2010Rating <p> Rocksby : Anonymous <p> My female Rottweiler is 10 mo . and used to chew on stones .

Personally I do n't think you have anything to worry about . <p> Rottweilers are n't high-energy dogs as adults ( in general , there 's always the exception and ' working dog lines ' tend to be more active than some others ) , but as puppies they are like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a very laid-back kinda guy , or perhaps you 've just forgotten what he was like at such a young age ? <p> I 'd strongly recommend making sure that your pup is getting enough exercise on a daily basis , and has plenty of tough dog toys to use up his energy on . There 's a lot of truth to the saying ' a tired puppy is a good puppy ' ! <p> It 's great that she 's already enrolled in dog obedience classes , that will definitely help and will give you a chance to get some hands-on help with any puppy behavior issues you may have . Do work with her at home too on a daily basis and be consistent and loving in all interactions with her . You can see my Free Puppy Training Tips page for lots of advice on this . <p> As she gets older and more mature ( but remember Rottweilers are slow to mature in general and she wo n't be considered an adult until at least 18 months to 2 years of age ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For now just appreciate and enjoy the time she has as a puppy and be creative in finding ways for her to use up that energy . She is probably a very intelligent little girl and the more ways you can find for her to be active ( both mentally and physically ) the happier you 'll both be . <p> One point to bear in mind when exercising her is that you do n't want to put too much strain on those growing joints - so no jumping or pounding on hard surfaces such as concrete etc . <p> Best of luck with her . <h> Comments for my rottweiler puppy is too hyper and active <p> My young male Rottweiler is the most hyperactive one I 've had ( I 've had 7 of them over the years ) &amp; our Vet diagnosed him as very hyper .

@@50393988 @3893988/ <p> Hi NorbertFirst of all I 'd recommend that you visit my Rottweiler FAQs page as it has a section that talks about how difficult it is to determine whether or not a dog is purebred . It all really depends on whether or not you have the papers to prove that her parents/grandparents etc. are purebred . <p> However , I want to answer the last part of your question first as it really disturbs me . You say ' I REALLY NEED TO KNOW WHETHER TO DISPOSE OF HER AND GET A PURE BREED ' .... I 'm not sure what you mean by ' dispose of her ' and do n't understand why you would n't want to keep her even IF ( and it 's an IF ) she 's not purebred . Earlier in your question you say that you 've had her for several months and that she 's ' doing great ' . So why would it matter if her head is a little less ' boxy ' than it should be .... if you 're not 100% sure of her pedigree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' pup then breeding her should n't be an issue and therefore conformation is n't nearly as important as good health and an excellent temperament ! <p> I can say from looking at the photos that she appears to be a full-blood Rottweiler , her coat , bone structure , coloring etc. looks right . Her muzzle is a little long and her ears a little big right now , but she 's a puppy and wo n't be done growing and maturing for at least another 18 months or so and will change a lot during that time . She has a very sweet expression and looks adorable too . <p> If you do n't want her as a beloved pet and companion regardless of her bloodlines etc. , then I 'd advise finding her another really good , loving home where she 'll be valued for who she is . Rotties are amazing dogs - loyal , loving , intelligent and they bond closely with their owners , if you have any doubts about being able to give her what she needs then find someone who can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THIS A PURE BREED ROTWEILER ? <p> The day I picked up my baby girl rottweiler who was AKC registered she was nothing but problems . Just mean . Smart as hell , but mean . We kept working with her and she behaved alright , but we were happy she was good with our baby , and yes great guard dog . She knew when I had two herniated discs . She sensed it and totally played me as the Alpha . Tested me and stopped listening to my commands because she knew I could n't stop her . My back got tolerable again and I had to teach her again that I was in control . Her energy was intense , we took her for two half hour walks a day , and played fetch in the yard numerous times a day where she would jump up and down off the deck and run circles while doing so . Her strengh was amazing , but her temperament was just off . I never really was scared of any dogs , even strange ones but something about my Ronda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . She ended up biting me while I was trying to crate her because I was leaving the house . Even with a treat she would n't obey . She just stopped . Anyway I have a puppy that she was with for the first four months we had him . She was brutal to him . Normal puppy play at first but she would get him on the side of the house where I could n't see and one day I opened the side door and she was flinging him around by his neck . Anyway , he is not AKC registered , had a white spot on his neck that 's fading , but my God is he the most handsome dog I have ever seen , everyday he learns something new . The second day I had him he learned to wait till I tell him to eat in front of his bowls . It took me literally 3 minutes to teach him " paw " and " high 5 " . Down took about two sessions of ten minutes but when he gets down he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on your butt " and he rolls his hips to the side .

In this situation you 'll usually notice it mostly around the neck , behind the ears , around the tail and upper back legs . <p> Rottweilers have either a red/rust or grey undercoat and depending on bloodlines some have a thicker undercoat than others . The undercoat is softer than the top coat and in dogs who have a lot of it often have a top coat that is a bit coarser . It 's not a fault or something to be concerned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot weather when the top coat is thinner , the undercoat may show through more obviously , especially after a heavy molt such as the ones that take place during the Springtime or when a puppy sheds his ' baby coat ' and the more adult coat comes in . <p> In the winter time when it 's colder , the topcoat will be thicker and the undercoat should be less noticeable . Unless your pups topcoat is turning grey ( and this would usually be happening on the face/head first ) then I would n't be too concerned .

@@50393992 @3893992/ <h> 4 year old Male Rottweiler suddenly falling over <p> We just moved into a new house 2 weeks ago , and Torque ( our Rottie ) has been falling for no good reason . <p> He is n't in pain , he is n't hurting anywhere , we 've moved joints and felt him all over on his back end , he does appear to " drag " his back foot a little , but nothing too " concerning " . <p> This is not our first Rottweiler , for the last 13 years we 're rescued , and owned Rotties , so we do not normally get too concerned with health issues . <p> We have n't called the vet as of yet , because we first thought it was the " pitch in the backyard " , new surroundings , and such . However it seems to be getting a bit worse . <p> Like everyone else in American currently our financial situation is n't good , but we make do , and our animals are very special and important to us . I contacted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have taken him " yesterday " .

Now though he needs to be seen by a professional for sure . <p> It 's possible it could be a neurological problem , or one related to his spine , hips , back leg .... it 's impossible to tell without veterinary evaluation . <p> The fact that you recently moved could be just a coincidence , but it is strange that it happened now . It 's possible that he hurt himself somehow in the unfamiliar yard and that 's what is causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's a common injury for Rotties . They have a very high tolerance for pain and can be extremely ' stoic ' so he may be in pain from something like that but just not be showing it . <p> The only other possibility I can think of is that he 's been bitten by a tick ( especially if your new home is out in the countryside ) . Occasionally a tick can cause a temporary paralysis of the rear legs , usually it starts off with weakness in the rear legs and then progresses to paralysis of the legs . I 'd suggest examining Torque very , very carefully and looking for a tick attached to him . If this IS the problem , once you remove the tick he should get back to normal pretty quickly . A bit of a long-shot but a possibility . <p> This is all guesswork though and I 'd definitely recommend a visit to the vet right away . I wish you all the very best of luck and hope Torque makes a full and speedy recovery . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My Rottweiler Joe is 3yrs. old and he too suddenly started to fall over .

The others have a smooth coat and there heads seem smaller . <p> Please could you guide me as to how i can make my decision . Any guidelines please . <p> regards <p> Cole <p> Hi ColeYou 're right when you say that puppies are changing all the time , and that makes it tricky to gauge how a pup will look at maturity . <p> At 8 weeks old a pup is basically a miniature version of his/her adult self because the rapid and irregular growth spurts have n't started yet . Head size is particularly difficult to judge , but generally a Rottweiler pup who has a wide head ( ie with a good distance across the top of the head between his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped head ) is going to have a good headpiece . <p> In terms of judging body size in general , look at the size of the bones a pup has . Heavy bones , with big paws and large lower joints on the front legs is more likely to grow into a big , well-built dog than a pup with smaller , lighter/finer bone structure . Weight is n't necessarily the deciding factor as a fat or overweight puppy is n't big in the sense you mean , and in fact carrying too much weight can jeopardize health and development . <p> Do remember to also consider temperament in a puppy as , unless you 're looking specifically for a show-dog , it 's really the most important aspect of a prospective pet . Unless you 're very confident and familiar with raising these big dogs , do n't choose the bossiest ' alpha ' pup , also do n't pick one who is overly shy . Look for friendly and confident , but not pushy. 152137 @qwx562137

They need an owner who is confident , but loving , and who will treat them with respect and yet set firm , fair guidelines for behavior . <p> Inconsistent or ineffective training attempts , anger , shouting or punishment will make them stubborn and difficult .

We thank you in advance . <p> HiThere 's no ' one size fits all ' answer to this question as a lot will depend on the individual dogs temperaments , and how well trained and socialized they are as they grow . <p> However , if they are temperamentally sound and raised properly , they should be able to meet and get along without any major problems even after several months apart . <p> Bear in mind that dogs do n't know ' family ' and the fact that they 're siblings will mean nothing to them . Luckily they are of the opposite sex which will help as two dogs of the same sex are much more likely to have ' confrontational issues ' even if they live together year round . <p> There really are n't big differences between males and females in terms of behavior or how to raise them . The biggest differences are related to individual character and personality . You can have dominant males and submissive females , or dominant females and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out who is the bolder and ' bossiest ' of the two , and it wo n't necessarily be the male ! <p> Personally I think it would be a very good idea to keep something that carries the scent of the other dog , and the people who are raising him/her around each pup . That way they will feel familiar with the scent and hopefully find them to be less ' strangers ' when they meet . <p> Of course there will always be a few days or maybe a week or so when the dogs first meet and are wary of each other . That 's to be expected , just make sure you 're all patient and that you supervise both of them closely during these vacations . Only leave them together alone once you 're absolutely sure that they are ' friends ' . Generally dogs sort this situation out by themselves without too much trouble if they are allowed to do so ... and owners only need interfere if there is a chance of someone getting hurt . <p> The biggest thing will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Labs or Goldens and do n't love everyone in the world in an unquestioning way . However , they should be friendly and approachable and calm , not aggressive towards other dogs or people , or fearful . Early and ongoing socialization , lots of love and a good dose of loving discipline , and proper training are all important if you want to raise a well-rounded Rottie . <p> It sounds to me as though you have experience with the breed , and already know what you need to do to raise your pups well , so I would n't worry too much about future problems as I think it will all work out just fine . 152137 @qwx562137

Can anyone advise anything to help break this . <p> It is very annoying especially when company is over . He is 16 months old and very well behaved/trained otherwise . <p> HiSome dogs do love to lick , and yes it can be a bit tricky if he 's doing it excessively ... many visitors do n't appreciate that too much ! <p> It can become a bit of an obsessive type of behavior so I 'd definitely recommend that you discourage this as much as possible . As far as I know though there 's no magic tip that will stop him , it 's more a case of constant and consistent corrections . <p> Tell him ' no lick ' firmly ( but lovingly , he 's showing affection ! ) and gently push his muzzle away . If he keeps coming back , use the ' muzzle wrap ' that I recommend to stop puppy nipping . Basically you wrap your hand gently around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while repeating the verbal correction . As your pup is well behaved and trained , he will understand what you 're demonstrating and it should help . <p> If he loves to lick your hands/arms , you could try spraying yourself with the bitter apple spray used to deter puppy nipping . Then when he goes to lick he 'll get a mouthful of the bitter taste , it may deter him and give this habit a chance to die down . Of course your visitors probably wo n't want to be sprayed with it , so use the other technique with them : ) <p> When you do tell correct him , follow it up immediately by redirecting his attention to something he is allowed to do . A special , favorite or extra-tasty chew toy is a good choice and should help him to forget about the licking for a few minutes . <p> It will take time , patience and consistent effort because this has now become a habit , but he 's still plenty young enough to learn so with time you should be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , best of luck .

@@50394003 @3894003/ <h> Rottweiler Aggression Towards Children ? <p> Greetings , <p> My daughter purchased an 8 week old puppy Rottweiler from a professional breeder 2 &amp; 1/2 years ago . During that time , she has spent considerable time training him , and socializing him around other dogs . He has been described numerous times as the best behaved dog in the park . <p> Last month , my daughter had a job change and was forced to drop the dog off to live with me . At that time , my daughter advised me that the dog does not like squirrels or small children ( I really did n't know what this meant ) . After being with the dog for a month , I found that it has no food or toy aggression . I consistently go through doors first , never step over the dog , make it walk behind me on walks , take its food away during meals , require it to sit-stay for 15 minute periods , I make it sit before I pet it , never rough play , I roll it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding its arms to the ground .... it submits . <p> Now for the scary part . Yesterday I took the dog to the dog park . Inside the enclosed park there were six adults and two small children ( a boy and girl ) . The boy was about 8 years old . I unhooked my dog from his leash and he greeted a few of the dogs . Half way across the park ( 70 feet ) , the little boy made some type of jumping movement and my dog ran straight for him . This was not they type of run you would see chasing a tennis ball.it was the wolf going after the prey.the dog after the man in the bite suit . <p> I quickly gave him the OFF command , and he stopped . I then called him over to me , put the leash back on him , and sat down on the bench .. my heart was racing . After about 5 minutes , the family with the two children started to leave the park . The little boy came walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of felt bad that I shouted at my dog ) , when my dog went to the end of the leash , snarling and snapping , barking , etc . I instinctively yelled NO , jerked his pinch collar , and I am embarrassed to say , slapped him across the face as hard as I could . This stopped the growling and he dropped into a laying position as the little boy walked away . <p> My concern is obvious.I can not longer trust this dog . When I go to the beach , if there are any children there , I must keep him leashed , even it the off-leash section . More importantly , if he every gets away from me , children may be at risk . <p> How do I address this behavior ? <p> Thank you for your response . <p> HiThank you for a very detailed and concise explanation of the behavior that 's worrying you - it makes it easier for me to evaluate it and try to help . <p> What you describe is classic ' prey drive ' behavior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of how developed it is , there can be a big variation between certain breeds and between individual dogs within one breed . Rotties do tend to be one of the breeds who have a more highly-developed ' prey drive ' as do many other dogs bred to hunt or guard . <p> From what you say , this dog is extremely well behaved and that fact that he listened to your corrections ( the first one a verbal correction while he was off leash ) is commendable and shows that he 's been extremely well trained and respects your authority . The rest of his behavior also indicates that he has a very sound and stable temperament and no ' alpha ' issues . All excellent news . <p> The main problem here is that he 's not been socialized to accept small children as ' humans ' so he naturally sees them as prey . Young children move quickly and erratically , and they have high-pitched voices and tend to squeal and squawk . This triggers the prey drive deep in a dogs brain , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or premeditation - that 's why you recognized it instantly . It 's totally reflexive . <p> Once this behavior is triggered the dog is in such an emotional state that unless he 's very well trained will often ignore any verbal corrections - he will literally not hear or see anything other than the ' prey ' . This is why the fact that your dog immediately responded to your voice is so encouraging . <p> The barking and snarling at the child afterwards is n't the same thing , that 's why I believe he 's simply not accustomed to children being around him . That type of behavior could be fear-based as he 's not sure what the child is , or it could be defensive because he 's trying to protect you from an unknown ' danger ' , it 's not really aggressive behavior but obviously has very real dangers connected to it , of which you are well aware . <p> Given how well trained , temperamentally sound , and ' biddable ' this dog is , I honestly think your best course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with young children . I think it 's something that you will need some ' hands-on ' assistance with as although the verbal correction and collar-check were the correct way to handle it ( the slap was n't but I totally understand that you were startled and very concerned ) , if you are anxious about the whole thing your dog will pick up on that and it will make the situation worse . <p> A professional trainer or dog behavioral specialist will be able to evaluate and deal with his behavior in the most constructive way , and will show you what to do in that type of situation . <p> Until this is completed you need to be very careful about allowing him to be off leash , and be very vigilant when children are around even if he 's leashed . There are all sorts of ways to help him learn to associate children with something good and to realize that they are NOT prey , but it 's impossible for me to go into them as it would be very time consuming and it 's much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trainer is the next step . <p> I can appreciate how frightening and worrying this encounter was , but please do n't overreact and consider this dog to be dangerous or aggressive . That would be doing him a huge disservice . He 's still plenty young enough to be retrained and to learn new associations and , as intelligent and eager to please as he seems to be , it will simply take time and patience to overcome this stumbling block . <p> I wish you lots of luck and hope that you can get the help that he needs to make sure that this situation does n't happen again . <h> Comments for Rottweiler Aggression Towards Children ? <p> Ok so my rotty is just over a year old and is doing pretty well with her training .

@@50394005 @3894005/ <h> Rottweiler 5 months old : Healthy weight and height ? <p> I purchased Piolo from a friends friend . I was told that he is a purebred Rottie . I live in Indonesia and pedigree certifications can take months and so I do n't have papers for Piolo yet . <p> He is an adorable and amazing puppy . However , I have noticed that he seems underweight and short for his age . He is about 5 months old and is about 18 inches tall and weighs around 40 pounds . I have seen 2 different vets and they too have mentioned that he is small for his age . <p> I know that a number of factors determine a puppy 's growth such as bloodlines , health and diet . From what I 've read Rotties are also a slow growing breed but I 'm just concerned about his development . I 'm worried that it could be some health related issues that is making him grow slowly . <p> I do n't have any current photos of him at the moment but here are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I was told he was around 2 to 3 months old in those pics and even then he looked scrawny and tiny . I only realized this after looking at other Rottie puppy photos . <p> Is his current size still considered normal or should I be worried ? Any feedback or advice would be wonderful . <p> Thank you : ) <p> Hi Ray . I would definitely say that in these photos Piolo looks underweight , I 'm guessing he was maybe around 8 weeks in those photos and puppies of that age should be chubby and ' rounded ' , regardless of breed . <p> I 'm guessing he did n't get the nutrition he needed and that 's why he was so scrawny . It would be very helpful to see photos of him now in order to see if he looks at a healthy weight for his frame , even if he 's below-average compared to others of his breed . Each pup is different and health is much more important than size . <p> Only legitimate , truthful registration papers can prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be less than truthful and give ' purebred ' status to pups who have some mixed blood . It 's impossible to say if this is what 's happened with your puppy because he looks very thin and underweight and that can completely change how a puppy looks overall . <p> As long as you have him on a healthy , nutritious diet ( this page has lots of info . on feeding large breed pups in locations where quality commercial foods are hard to find , or when a home-made diet is preferred ... Feed Program For Overseas , and he has had all his necessary vaccinations , parasite control and regular health checks , then he should be healthy overall . <p> Adolescent pups are often a bit out of proportion and ' leggy ' , it 's natural at this age . Piolo is a bit below average in terms of weight for a 5 month old Rottweiler , shorter too , but as you do n't really have any genetic background on him , know what his parents look like , or even have proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say why that is . <p> If you 're worried about his health , I 'd definitely recommend having your vet give him a complete check up to make sure all is well . Parasites , infections or other underlying health problems can cause a pup to be underweight , but only your vet can tell you if there is a problem . <p> BUT , if Piolo is a happy , active puppy who seems to be healthy but simply a bit smaller than you would expect then I would n't worry too much . He may or may not be purebred , he may just be smaller-than-average due to his genes , or he may be a ' late bloomer ' . No one can really say . But as long as he 's healthy then just enjoy him for the special boy that he is and do n't be overly concerned about his size - Sue 152137 @qwx562137

The new puppy we have named Angel seemed to be doing really well until this evening wednesday 30th may . <p> I had fed her all her food for the day split into 3 meals and she had eaten it all , ( I am feeding burns for large breed puppies ) , I was sorting out my 5 year old daughter when my 13 year old daughter came to me crying saying Angel had snapped at her aggressively , my daughter had simply tried to move Angel away from our other dogs food bowl ( which is elevated ) and Angel snapped and broke the skin on my daughters hand , ( looks like a pin prick now the redness has gone down ) . <p> 30 minutes later my and my eldest daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clicker , my daughter asked her to sit , clicked , gave her the treat and then praised Angel by using a baby voice and stroking her , Angel snapped at my daughter again , this time just getting the sleeve of her top . <p> We then went into garden where puppies being puppies Angel was picking up anything she could find , she allowed my daughter to take them off her until she picked up what appeared to be a dried up caterpillar or slug , when i got it out of her mouth she snapped at me as i pulled it put . I tapped her nose and told her no in a firm voice . <p> Is this a sign of food aggression and what advice could you give me as i have to consider my youngest child also , thanks x <p> HiThis is what you call ' resource guarding ' and it 's pretty common in puppies and sometimes older dogs too if they 've not been corrected for this behavior early on ( it shows up in all breeds as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's more common in puppies from large litters ( where they had to fend off their siblings at mealtimes ) or in abandoned or neglected pups who have always had to fight for everything they got , or there was n't enough to go around . Also , more dominant puppies MAY exhibit this behavior more than submissive ones , but it 's usually the result of a combination of nature and nurture . <p> Your pup is still a tiny baby , and although her little teeth are sharp she wo n't do much damage if she snaps ... this is why it 's so much easier to handle now and much safer . An adolescent or adult Rottweiler with the same behavior is a whole different proposition ! <p> I 'd recommend that you read my page on Dog Food Aggression and start hand feeding Angel right away . If your daughters are old enough involve them in doing this too . It 's very important that Angel realizes that they are above her in terms of authority ( ie NOT her siblings or equals ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd also strongly suggest that you teach her the ' Leave It ' command , starting with things that she does n't value as highly as food ( ie a toy of some sort ) . Regular practice will help her learn to ' drop ' or ' leave ' anything you tell her to right away , and will allow you to work up to taking treats/bones/food from her without trouble . It 's a very important part of her training . This webpage has all the info . you need to teach this command ( and some other basic obedience lessons too ! ) ... Dog Commands . <p> Angel is just a baby and she 's simply reacting the way she 's learned to do in her previous environment . Rotties are VERY smart , and the most trainable breed I 've ever worked with , she will soon learn that this behavior is n't acceptable and what it is you want from her . Just be patient , consistent and firm-yet-loving , and do n't over-react . She will soon learn . <p> Best of luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old puppy with food aggression ? ? ? <p> Two years ago we bought a four month old female rottie with severe food aggression .

You absolutely have to feed her food to her by hand , let her know that you are the boss , it 's your food , not hers . I would feed mine with one hand and pet her head with the other ( I had to ease into that because she was much older than yours ) If she sits , have her sit and wait , starting with a few seconds and gradually extend the time , then feed her by hand . And definetly have the kids feed her by hand also . Rotties are stubborn and head strong so you will need to be firm and consistent with her and never let her get away with the bad behavior .

Sometimes it takes even longer especially for the big males . So , personally I would n't be getting her into agility until she 's around 18 months old . <p> She 'll need some basic obedience training before she starts agility .... know how to sit and stay , and to be focused on you at the minimum . You can start obedience training with her as soon as she 's had all her puppy vaccinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that Rottweilers are one of the easiest breeds to train .

@@50394009 @3894009/ <h> Toys for Rottweiler Puppies <p> We will be getting a 12 week old rottie puppy in the spring and I would like to know what are the best types of toys to buy for him . <p> Hi NancyRottweilers are big and strong even as puppies , so you definitely want sturdy toys that ca n't be ripped up easily . Avoid cheap , store brand toys . <p> All puppies like to chew , and Rotties are no exception . So toys that can stand up to their powerful jaws are vital . <p> Kong toys are high on my list and always popular in our house , also the chew toys made from Zogoflex , Nylabone ' Dura-chews ' , and natural bones are all excellent choices . Rope toys and ultra-sturdy stuffed toys can be okay for Rottie pups , but many adults will be able to destroy them given time . <p> I 'd strongly recommend that you check out my Tough Dog Toys page as it has lots of information on the very best toys for power chewers and a selection of the ones I personally recommend . 152137 @qwx562137

I would like the largest , but also want to make the right decision when it comes to temperament . I had a rottweiler for 11 years previously and it was the best dog I have ever owned . We live in the country with lots of space for our new addition to run . <p> But as much as we know our new family member will be a huge sucky baby ..... we want him to be big and intimidating looking because of the fact that sometimes I get nervous being alone at night for weeks at a time when my husband leaves . <p> Size is n't an absolute must for us but would be a huge bonus , so is there any way to tell as the pups mature which ones will be the largest ? <p> Pups are n't even here yet . Not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting to have my own child ! lol <p> Hi AmyThis is an interesting question , and although there 's no ' one-size-fits-all ' answer , there are some things to look for . <p> First of all though , I personally would n't put too much emphasis on size for several reasons , including ... <p> Males are usually bigger , but not necessarily better in terms of protective instincts . <p> When you choose a pup , the biggest pup at 8 weeks may well not grow up to be the biggest adult . <p> Bigger , heavier dogs tend to have more issues with bones/joints etc. and are n't always the healthiest . <p> Sometimes the biggest males are the biggest babies : o ) <p> First of all be sure the parents of this puppy are healthy , have OFA hip certifications , and have sound temperaments . Their puppies will inherit their genes and you want to be sure that he/she is sound both physically and mentally . <p> If this is all okay , then I would say personality/temperament is more important than looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be considered very important if you are going to show a puppy , and even then great looks with a poor temperament are n't worth much ! <p> Unless you are very comfortable and sure of yourself in terms of raising a possibly challenging and headstrong puppy , do n't choose the boldest , bravest or most ' argumentative ' puppy . You also do n't want a shy , scared , nervous or ' skittish ' puppy as he/she will require experienced handling and lots of extra time and effort to enhance self confidence . Look for the ' average ' pup .... active , happy and confident but not body tackling you or dominating every interaction ( or bullying every sibling in sight ) . <p> At 8 weeks old a Rottweiler puppy is a miniature of his/her adult form pretty much , should be cobby and sturdy in the body , strong bones , clean shiny fur , clean ears , no discharge from eyes or nose , no signs of diarrhea or of parasites such as fleas . The width of the head between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the wider it is the bigger the head is likely to be . Also the ' conehead ' look often develops into a strong headshape . Muzzle should n't be narrow or pointed , but a big square and quite short . <p> Basically , Rottie pups are like adorable little black bears ! ! <p> As you 've already raised a Rottweiler , you hopefully have all the experience you need under your belt . Just remember that even if your new pup is going to be your guardian , his/her protective instincts will develop slowly and should be allowed to do so naturally . <p> I hope this helps some and I wish you the best of luck with your new puppy .

Of course the puppy is very young , but as you 're experienced with dogs in general , I 'm sure you 've already got an idea as to what sort of personality she has . <p> If there is a choice , I 'd always recommend having two dogs of the opposite sex , as it 's just less likely to become difficult .

Two Rottweiler females fighting is a serious situation and generally results in someone ( either dog , or the human/s trying to mediate ) getting hurt ! <p> BUT , if both females are spayed , neither of them is dog-aggressive or very ' alpha ' in their attitude , and at least one of them has a chance to ' grow up ' around the other , then I would personally say your chances are good that they will be able to live peaceably , and probably be good friends .

A well-bred and properly raised Rottweiler is n't any more unpredictable than any other dog would be . <p> In fact , the natural inclination of a Rottie is to be calm and confident , to observe rather than ' jump in ' and because of this they make very discriminating guard dogs - knowing when , or by whom , they or their family are being threatened .

@@50394017 @3894017/ <h> Do Rottweilers change personalities as they age ? <p> by Ashley A ( Ohio ) <p> My rottweiler Rufus Von Dufus is three and a half years old , I 've raised him since he was seven weeks old and he a great dog except for recently . Rufus has always been very vocal but not in an agressive way , he would talk while being petted , playing and even in his sleep . It sounds more like grunts , sighs and soft growls ... everyone who knows Rufus knows he 's just an over grown lap dog . <p> Rufus is very smart , it took me no time at all to train him to do the basics along with roll over , jump through a hoop , fetch , heel and play dead . I pretty much kid proofed him from a young age , I can lay on him , completely squish him , pull on his ears , stick my hand in his mouth , even stick my face in his mouth . He 's such a pushover and pretty much let 's me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , push him around on the tile floor , vacuum him , brush his teeth and even paint his toe nails if I so choose . He 's never had a problem with obeying a command from me but for my boyfriend who has been around since day one , he simply ignores him which my boyfriend sees as a problem but I do n't . <p> My boyfriend and many of my guy friends rough house with Rufus and I think Rufus does n't see him as his master but more as a play mate . But That is where the problem stems I believe , Rufus growls ... it could be considered talking but recently it sounds worse and I 've seen his lip curl several times . He does this when eating and a cat or dog approach him , when my boyfriend tries to punish him , when sleeping and the cat or dog tries to lay with him and even started guarding his toys . <p> To correct the behavior I 've hand fed him but his problem is n't with me it 's with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a different room and wait till he 's done to retrieve the bowl because he 'll also guard his empty bowl . I 've also noticed he wants to guard his water bowl which i just down understand because he 's always shared his water bowl with at least three other animals . The sleeping thing is harder to understand and I 'm just at a loss of what to do with that one because it really could just be him talking . And the guarding I simply just take the toy away and set it aside . <p> I 'm worried that Rufus 's growling could turn to snapping and I 've always said that if he snaps at me or anyone that he will be put down and I 'd hate to have to do that to him . So I guess what I 'm asking is if Rottweilers behaviors change while they age and if the talking should or can be stopped . <p> Hi AshleyRufus is adorable , and from what you say it sounds as though he has an excellent temperament overall and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's now an adult and sometimes behavior can change subtly as a dog matures , but growling with a curled lip is a clear warning signal and you need to give Rufus credit for issuing that warning . He 's trying hard to show that he 's not comfortable with something but without resorting to snapping or biting . Although you may have ' always said that you 'll have him put to sleep if he snaps ' but that is totally unfair and realistic . From what I read in your submission you do n't have an aggressive or dangerous dog , but one who is having some ' issues ' which it is your responsibility to deal with and help him overcome , and the sooner the better . <p> Obviously Rufus regards you as the ' boss ' , and you may not see a problem with him not seeing your boyfriend the same way but there is one . Your dog needs to defer to all humans , not just you , and your boyfriend needs to become more proactive and involved in Rufus ' care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No more rough-housing or being a playmate , he needs to be an authority figure . But only ever in a positive , loving way - no harshness etc . <p> I 'd recommend starting to split the caregiving tasks such as feeding , grooming , walking , training etc . You may need to be with your boyfriend to help things along at first , but the aim is for him to be able to interact with Rufus in every way you do , without issue . <p> The resource guarding needs to be dealt with and I 'd also recommend that your boyfriend hand feed Rufus to make sure he does n't become a target . With the other dog and cats it 's more difficult and you may need to simply separate them for now when it 's feeding time until his behavior improves overall . <p> I 'd also recommend using some basic strategies to help Rufus realize that his position in the family is a lowly one ! It may be that he 's just giving himself a little too much authority here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . <p> The best way to do this is to start making him ' work ' for everything ... treats , walks , games , meals etc . Ask him to ' sit ' or make him do a ' down ' or ' sit-stay ' or ' down-stay ' and do n't reward him until he obeys . Be calm , but firm and start easy and slow - a 5 second ' sit ' for example and work up . Also , do n't allow him to sit or sleep on furniture , beds , top of the stairs , in doorways or block corridors etc . <p> Do n't allow Rufus to control your actions with his , ever . Dogs can be very clever about this . For example he comes up and nudges you for some attention and you turn around and start petting him ... who 's in charge here ? Rufus ! Do n't let him whine for his supper , push you around when playing etc. etc . All these things mean power in the dog world . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just one that 's testing the waters a bit and needs to be reassured where his place is and how he should behave . AND always correct him firmly with a verbal ' NO ' if he growls or acts as though he is objecting to something that you feel is necessary for him to accept - obviously within reason and fair though . <p> I 'd recommend also getting him enrolled in a basic obedience class so that you can get help from a professional dog trainer . Hands-on help is invaluable when problems like this arise . A dog behaviorist is also an option if you find that you ca n't reshape his behavior yourself . However it sounds as though the relationship between you and your Rottie is a good one , and strong , and with patience and understanding you should be able to get past this ' sticky ' phase . Rufus needs your understanding and help to feel secure and happy . <p> I hope this helps and wish you all the very best of luck . <h> Comments for Do Rottweilers change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments help I am pretty firm and so is my Husband with our Gunner , recently he has been very aggressive in lots of ways growling twice showing us teeth started when a family party someone rubbed his ears .

Females being closer to the dam 's size , males to the sire 's . However , as I said even within puppies with the same parents there can be considerable variations . <p> From the photos your female looks well proportioned with good bones , head etc . The photos are dark so it 's hard to see , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always even more difficult to judge from photos , but that is my impression . She looks like a very nice pup . <p> At 17 months she may be at her full height , or very close to it , but she probably has some more weight to gain . She 'll probably be full grown somewhere between 18 months and two years . <p> My Rottweiler Puppy Growth Chart page has more information on this subject , but do remember the chart is ' average weights ' , and as it 's non-specific in terms of sex , females will be expected to be on the lighter end of the scale and many , many pups will fall outside of this range , that 's okay . <p> Rotties were n't designed to be huge dogs , and it 's much better for their health for them to be a moderate size . You can learn more about the ideal size/weight according to both ADRK and AKC breed standards on my Rottweiler Breed Standard page . 152137 @qwx562137

Using an effective topical flea preventative is usually the most effective method . Frontline and Advantix are the most commonly used brands and both work well .

There are several different ones to choose from , and if the first one does n't help ( allow at least a week to 10 days trial first though ) , you can always try something else . <p> Do n't just run out and buy any antihistamine and start giving it to your dog though - it 's vital to discuss this with your vet first , and to make sure that you give your dog the correct dosage . <p> Your vet can prescribe whatever he feels would be the best medication , and tell you exactly how much and how often to give it . That is the best ( and safest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs immune system , and reducing the inflammatory response to ' allergy triggers ' can also help . <p> Certain natural dietary supplements can help with this , and many dog owners have found them to be very successful in reducing ( sometimes even eliminating ) canine allergy symptoms . <p> If your Rottie seems to suddenly develop allergies , think back over the last few weeks and see if you 've made any changes to his environment . <p> For example , have you washed his dog bed in a different detergent ? Had the carpets shampooed or used a new carpet deoderizer ? Used a different shampoo on him , or a nice smelling spray ? <p> You may get lucky and find the culprit right away . <h> Dog Food Allergies <p> If your dog does n't have fleas , his allergy symptoms do n't seem to be seasonal , and you ca n't think of anything environmental that could have triggered his problems , then he may be reacting to an ingredient ( or more ) in his food . <p> Canine allergies that result from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research has shown that some ingredients are more likely to create a problem than others , these include ( but are n't limited to ) , beef , pork , dairy products , whey , chicken , eggs , soy , wheat , and yeast . <p> Many dogs are also allergic , or sensitive to , chemicals , colorings and additives/preservatives . <p> Because the lower quality , more generic dog foods contain more of these type of ingredients , they are more likely to trigger canine allergies than the premium foods which are free of this sort of ' junk ' . <p> However , if your dog is allergic to pork for example , he will react to it whatever type of food it is in . <p> Rottweilers are big dogs who grow very rapidly , and they need a high quality dog food with the right balance of nutrients . Making sure you choose the best puppy food to start with will help minimize your growing dogs ' chances of developing canine allergies related to their diet . <p> If canine allergies do show up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame , switching to one of the quality foods that have been specially developed for dogs with sensitivities/allergies is a good move . <p> Many dogs who have shown an intolerance for certain dog foods do very well on one of these allergy free dog foods . Try to choose a food which contains ingredients that your dog has n't ever eaten before . <p> Many of these special foods contain more ' exotic ' ingredients such as duck , venison , fish , sweet potato and so on . <p> There are several dietary supplements that you can give to your dog to help his digestive system handle food sensitivities , digest his food better , and improve his overall GI function . <p> If you change your dogs diet , you will need to keep him on the new food for at least a month to determine whether or not it is helping . This is because it can take quite a while for the effects of the previous food to be completely eradicated . <p> If simply changing your dogs ' diet does n't eliminate his allergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet ' . Allergies related to food ingredients can be difficult to diagnose properly due to the number of different ingredients in most foods . <p> An elimination diet basically means choosing a food with the minimum number of ingredients , or even a home-made dog food diet that has only two components . One ingredient should be a meat that your dog has n't eaten before ( rabbit or venison for example . <p> Lamb used to be considered a good choice , but because of it 's inclusion in many foods today , you probably want to try something less commonplace ) . The second ingredient should be a starchy food such as potato or rice . <p> Feed your dog only this ( no treats , human-food tid-bits , dog biscuits , edible chew toys etc. ) for two to three weeks and see if his dog allergy symptoms decrease/disappear . <p> Then very slowly add one additional ingredient at a time to his diet , waiting a week in between additions to check for the reappearance of allergy symptoms . This way you can slowly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Because this sort of diet is n't nutritionally complete , you should n't keep your dog on it for more than 10 - 12 weeks maximum , and you should always consult with your veterinarian before AND during the elimination diet period . <p> You want to be sure that your dog is getting the nutrition that he needs and is n't having any difficulties due to the restricted diet . <h> Allergic Reactions to Canine Vaccinations <p> Although true allergic reactions to canine vaccines are fairly rare , many puppies and dogs have mild reactions . <p> These may include loss of appetite , low grade fever , pain or swelling at the site of the injection , and occasionally even diarrhea or vomiting . <p> Mild symptoms like this are generally nothing to worry about and do n't last for more than a day or two . <p> But .... a small percentage of puppies can suffer a severe allergic reaction to their puppy shots ( Rabies , Parvo and Leptospirosis vaccines are the most likely culprits , but any vaccination can trigger a response ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccination include swelling ( particularly of the head/face/neck ) , hives anywhere on ( or all over ) the body , vomiting and/or diarrhea , difficulty breathing , loss of balance or co-ordination , seizures and even death . <p> This type of reaction usually happens within minutes of the shots being given , and needs urgent veterinary treatment . <p> If your pup/dog has this sort of reaction , it 's important to make sure that your veterinarian is aware of , or remembers , that when giving the next set of shots as he will probably want to take additional precautions to avoid a repeat performance . <p> Some breeds of dog are particularly vulnerable to canine allergies in response to vaccination . <p> If you own one of these breeds , work closely with your veterinarian to work out a canine vaccination schedule that you 're happy with . <p> Ask Dog Veterinarians Now <p> letters left <h> When Itching Might NOT Be A Symptom Of Allergies <p> I think it 's also important that dog owners realize that intense itching or scratching and/or patchy hair loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There is a skin condition called Mange which can cause a lot of itching , sometimes a rash , and often hair loss . Mange is caused by tiny mites , and there are two different types , Demodectic Mange and Sarcoptic Mange . <p> These can be diagnosed by your veterinarian taking a skin scraping from your dog , and there are several different treatments available . Learn more about the symptoms and treatment of mange by visiting this webpage Mange In Dogs . <p> Sometimes what looks like an allergy can actually turn out to be a yeast infection , and systemic yeast infections usually have similar symptoms such as skin irritiation , itching and so on . <p> If your puppy or dog has had several courses of antibiotics , is eating a poor quality food or one that has a high percentage of grains , or has had a reaction to vaccinations , it 's possible that his symptoms are yeast-based , not allergies. 152135 @qwx562135 152136 @qwx562136 152137 @qwx562137

Growing pains do occur and when it 's more than a passing ' twinge ' it 's usually considered to be a condition known as Panosteitis or ' Pano ' . <p> This is a bone disease , believed to be inflammatory and perhaps with a genetic component , which causes lameness , pain , limited mobility and so on .

Mostly minor . <p> Rottweilers take a long time to develop and mature and are n't considered adult ( either physically or mentally ) until they 're at least 18 months of age . For the bigger males it can take up to 3 years . During the adolescent stage , which is what your pup is just entering , they will grow rapidly and often look ' scrawny ' or ' out of proportion ' .... think of a gangly teenage boy and you get the picture . They gain their full height before their full weight , and until fully mature you wo n't see what your pup is going to look like as an adult .

Otherwise , just enjoy your puppy and give him a chance to grow up happy and healthy . <p> Whether his legs end up being a bit on the long side , or he does n't weigh 120lbs as an adult should n't matter so much as long as he 's happy , loving , healthy and a great companion for you .

Last time I had him weighed he was 10 months ( 88lbs ) . <p> One of my obedience instructors had said to give him Vitamin C &amp; MSM to assist with bone strength . However , should I be concerned with the flat foot ? He seems to be handling everything fine ( runs , plays , does n't complain that he has to move , etc ) . <p> Please advise . <p> Neil DeshmukhCold Lake , ABCANADA <p> Hi NeilI think I know what you 're describing when you say ' flat foot ' and in my opinion it 's probably more genetic than anything else . <p> It 's difficult to see from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of him having weak pasterns ( front lower leg joint ) and feet that are ' splayed ' rather than ' tight ' . <p> This is what the AKC Rottweiler Breed Standard has to say about this part of the body - ' Pasterns : Slightly springy , strong , not steep . Front feet : Round , tight and well arched .. ' It seems as though Rileys ' pasterns are more angled than they could be , and his feet not as tight or arched as is preferred . BUT most likely this is a cosmetic , conformation problem rather than a big physical issue . <p> Conformation is mainly hereditary , but diet also plays a role in these big , fast growing dogs . Even though he is a year old , Riley still has a lot of growing to do and at his weight , he 's going to be a BIG boy . Make sure he 's eating a premium food so that he gets all the nutrition he needs . There are many different opinions about this , but I keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems to work very well . Whether you continue to feed puppy food , or change over to an adult formula , just make sure it 's good quality . You can also check out the handy canine calorie calculator on the puppy food page I 've linked to earlier in this paragraph . It will help you figure out exactly how much food Riley needs each day . <p> I doubt that this flat-footedness is going to cause Riley any real problems in everyday life . Depending on how angled or weak his pasterns are , he may have some discomfort if he walks too far or jumps too much , but it does n't seem as though it 's bothering him now so I would n't worry about it too much . <p> A premium food should provide all the nutrients he needs , but giving him an appropriate supplement should n't hurt and may help . Do n't be tempted to give him calcium as that will be counter productive . Vitamin C , Glucosamine and MSM are all good . I 'd recommend a product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Caine , it 's natural and well-balanced and will help improve your pups ' general health and immune function as well as support his bone/joint growth . <p> Hope this helps , Riley looks happy , healthy and handsome and I doubt this problem will cause him much trouble .

If you feel your dog has a chest that is narrow , or shallow , chances are it 's a trait he 's inherited from one , or both , or his parents . <p> I 'd recommend that first you take a close look at photos of your dogs ' parents , and study their conformation . You will likely see that this is the case . Even if both parents have chests that are deeper than his , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps from a grandparent . <p> Of course , exercise can help to build up the muscles and will eventually make some difference to the width/depth of a dogs chest , but not something extremely significant . With large breed dogs like Rottweilers , especially in hot climates , you need to be careful not to overexercise , or to cause strain on the joints/bones/ligaments or major organs such as the heart . <p> A good diet and regular exercise ( within normal limits ) is the best way to help your dog reach his maximum potential . At 2 years old he is likely almost finished growing in terms of height , but will probably continue to gain weight and muscle mass for at least another 6 months before he 's considered fully grown . 152137 @qwx562137

I was thinking about getting two Rottweiler 's . <p> Would having two females be a good idea or not ? <p> If so would it be wise to get them from the same bloodline ? <p> Thank You Christian <p> Hi ChristianThe first thing I suggest is that you do a LOT of research on this breed , as they are not really recommended for first-time dog owners due to their sheer size and strong-will . If you have owned big dogs before and are familiar with caring for and training them , but just have n't owned a Rottweiler that is different . <p> I do have several pages that go into a lot of detail about this breed , their traits , behavior etc . I 'd recommend that you read these pages to begin with .. <p> As for your specific questions ..... I personally would n't recommend getting two puppies at the same time - ever . It 's an amazing amount of work - many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time and effort it takes to care for ONE puppy , let alone two . It is also much better in terms of bonding and training to have just one pup to take care of . <p> Secondly , whenever you have two dogs of the same sex there is the potential for conflict , and in dogs the size of Rottweilers that may lead to serious trouble . It 's always better to have dogs of the opposite sex and have them spayed/neutered to prevent unwanted puppies and reproductive order diseases . <p> Two puppies of the same sex will get along to begin with , but as soon as they begin to mature the squabbling is likely to start . Two pups of the opposite sex will likely squabble too , but they wo n't be as aggressive about it and there will be less combative behavior . <p> Dogs do n't recognize family the way we humans do , and even two pups from the same litter wo n't have any special feelings for their siblings ... or even their parents . So whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't make any difference . <p> And finally , do take lots of time to research breeders and if you decide to buy a Rottie pup , choose carefully .

A firm " NO " ( not shouted and no smacking ) in a low voice , and a quick shake of the scruff of the neck should be enough .

I have never heard of this and wondered what your opinion is on this . Angel is 17 weeks old now and we know for sure we will not breed her . Also , at what age do they usually lose all their teeth . <p> Thanks in advance for your response .. Judy <p> Hi JudyTo be honest , this is n't something I 've ever come across either . I know that very occasionally a pup wo n't lose all their teeth and if that causes problems then they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never happened to any of my dogs or puppies so I have no personal experience with it . <p> It 's certainly not something that is ' run of the mill ' , or very common . <p> As for having Angel spayed , generally it 's recommended that you have a pup spayed or neutered before they 're 6 months old . This conveys the maximum health benefits . A female will usually come into her first season somewhere between 6 and 8 months of age , and if possible you should have her altered before then . <p> Generally a pup will lose their upper canines ( the ' fangs ' ) last of all , and that happens at around 6 months of age . So it 's pretty much on par with the time recommended for spaying . However , even if Angel has some baby teeth left at that point , unless they are causing pain or interfering with the growth of her adult teeth I would be tempted to wait a bit and see if nature takes it 's course . But that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a little while before you have to come to that decision so I 'd wait a little bit and then talk it over with your vet again .

They said something about teeth becoming impacted or causing permanent teeth to come in crooked , etc , and wanted to charge about $15.00 per tooth , stating they 'd only pull the baby teeth that were loose . I have had many dogs over the years , and none of them ever had a problem with puppy teeth not falling out . All of their adult teeth came in fine . I 'm not a vet , but this new practice sounds unnecessary to me , like they 're just trying to make some extra money .

You need to keep cool and calm and exude confidence and a happy , positive upbeat attitude . <p> This is where time for both of you spent with a good trainer will help so much because you 'll learn to be confident in your handling of your dog in any situation and that confidence will do wonders for his behavior . <p> Hope this helps , best of luck with your Rottweiler . <h> Comments for how can i help my rottie to adjust to visitors ? <p> Thank you all for the great advice .

I 'm waiting to hear back from the orthopedic vet at my dog 's office for a final diagnosis . I 'm heartbroken that this has happened , she 's so young ( she 'll be 2 in August ) . <p> The vet said she 'll probably need a " tibial plateau leveling osteotomy " ( TPLO ) , and is sounds like recovery from this is rough and lengthy . I went to another office for a second opinion ( I have an appointment to go with my dog to see their ortho vet , and it sounds like he has quite a bit of surgical experience ) ; from their website it sounds like this vet usually prefers doing a " tibial tuberosity advancement " ( TTA ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quicker recovery time . <p> My questions are , do any of you readers have experience with this ? How old was your dog when it happened , did you opt for surgery , and what was the recovery like ? Did your dog eventually tear the 2nd side ? <p> I have learned that it 's common for dogs with one torn ligament to tear the other eventually , so I looked into dog insurance and only found one company ( Pet 's Best ) that says they 'll consider paying for the 2nd side if it happens , but they also do n't pay for " hereditary and congenital " problems , and I 'd hate to pay them for a few years only to have them say she had " congenitally weak " knees or something like that .

One day she scooted out the front door with my daughter 's pit-mastiff mix . It was about 5 minutes before we got them back , but that 's the day she tore her 2nd knee , she would not touch her back foot to the floor , and I knew what had happened .

From what I 've seen across the country , this seems to be on the lower side . I may have her stay with the vet for the first 2 weeks ( we of course will visit ) , but he can perform range of motion PT exercises for her , and keep her subdued while healing begins . As much as I love her , it is a tough decision to spend that much on a dog , especially since it 's likely to happen on her other knee as well . I have learned that this injury is not uncommon in rotties - either young and active ( like Zoe ) or older and overweight ... so I 'm sort of planning on doing it twice . She is young and a good weight , so we 're hoping for the best . Prayers and good energy sent our way would be appreciated ! I 'll keep you posted on her progress . Again , thanks for the site , I 'm glad to speak with you and other rottie owners . 152137 @qwx562137

Then he runs through their legs . <p> How do I get him to stop ? He is about to turn 8 months . <p> Hi MelissaJumping up at visitors is a natural and instinctive canine behavior . Sometimes it 's their way of showing that they recognize authority ( wild dogs will lick the faces of the more dominant dogs ) , other times it can be a way of trying to exert dominance themselves . <p> Kane is still a puppy and I think he 's most likely doing this as a result of the first motivation ... but it is something you need to correct because Rotties are big heavy dogs and can easily knock someone down if they 're small , light or frail . <p> Obviously the first way to do this is with a firm , verbal correction such as ' no jump ' , make sure the people who are being jumped on give him this correction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not okay by anyone 's standards . Do n't shout or get angry etc. though as that will make him excited and he 'll jump even more . <p> In addition to the verbal correction I 'd recommend getting him a short training leash ( see my Leash Training A Puppy page for one of these , also known as a ' pull tab ' ) and when people are coming over have it attached to his collar . It 's basically a leather ' handle ' and you can use it to give Kane a short , sharp tug on his collar whenever he goes to jump on anyone . <p> To be most effective you may want to combine it with a ' choke chain ' or ' prong ' collar rather than his regular buckle collar .

We have a two year old son . If you have any tips on training the puppy with my toddler , it would be very much appreciated . <p> Hope to hear from you soon . <p> P.S. Love love love your website . <p> Hi LauraI 'm so happy that you are enjoying my site , hopefully it will help you in choosing and taking care of your new pup . <p> Rottweilers are generally excellent with children ( I have 6 kids and they 've been raised with Rotties underfoot ) , but there are a few tips ( mostly just common-sense stuff ) that may help you . <p> Firstly , Rottweilers are big , strong dogs and , even as puppies , they tend to be heavy , clumsy and have absolutely no idea of their own size/strength ! With toddlers and small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's important to supervise all interactions to make sure that the pup/dog does n't accidentally knock down or hurt the human . <p> As you are starting out with a puppy , the size differential should n't be a problem to begin with and you will be able to train him not to jump on your son etc . I 've personally found that female dogs seem to be a bit more aware of the fact that they need to be gentle with small children , but that does n't mean that a male is n't a good choice . Most of it is simply individual character and personality traits . <p> Although he 's only 2 years old , try to include your son ( obviously with serious ' mommy or daddy help ' ) in taking care of the new pup . Puppies have a tendency to see children as other puppy siblings , and this is n't what you want . Your pup needs to know that your son is an authority figure and above him in the family hierarchy , you can achieve this by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Remember to also teach your son that your puppy is n't a toy , and that he needs to be gentle and careful with him . Also , puppies tend to want to chase small , fast-moving creatures especially if they have high-pitched voices . This is triggered by the prey-drive , but in puppies it 's play-based behavior . Still , to prevent your son being knocked down by a happy little Rottie in hot-pursuit , try to encourage slower movements and an ' inside voice ' around the pup . <p> Raising puppies is very much like raising children so you will be able to follow your instincts most of the time . Do remember to do lots of research and make sure you 've chosen a reputable and responsible breeder ( see my Choosing A Rottweiler Breeder for advice on this ) , so that you get a healthy puppy both physically and emotionally . <p> Hope this helps , I wish you the very best of luck with your new pup . <h> Comments for Rottweilers and Babies <p> My family has a 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our daughter alot ..

@@50394071 @3894071/ <p> Hi SanjayAs you say , the only way to make a definitive diagnosis of either Panosteitis or HD/ED is by taking the appropriate X-rays - and in the case of canine hip dysplasia , 6 months is too early for an accurate evaluation . <p> There are a few things that can help you figure out whether it 's Pano or HD , but they 're only guidelines , they ca n't be considered totally accurate . Only X-rays and proper professional veterinary evaluation will do that . <p> Firstly , Panosteitis is usually seen in the front legs first and is often very intermittent in nature . Often there will be swelling of the leg joints visible to the naked eye , but the pain is felt more in the middle of the bone ( between joints ) rather than centered on the joint itself . <p> Symptoms of Hip Dysplasia are connected with the rear legs and often include weakness or stiffness on rising , a bunny-hopping ( or unusual ) gait , clicking sound when walking etc . If there is pain or discomfort it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dog may resist having hips or rear legs manipulated .

Sometimes a vet can tell if there is a hip problem by physically manipulating the joints , but at this age it 's a bit hit-and-miss. 152137 @qwx562137

@@50394073 @3894073/ <h> 9 month old puppy behavior <p> by stephanie ( arizona ) <p> Hello , i have a question that is really troubling me . I have 9 month old male rottie and a almost 2 year old female rottie . Just yesterday my 9 month old rottie injured my 12 year old female pug/chiuahua mix . <p> He has grown up with this dog since we bought him at 8 weeks old . I know that the 12 year old was not playing with him or provoking him in an anyway . I ran outside early yesterday morning because I heard what I thought was him playing too rough with her . But to my horror he had her in his mouth by her neck shaking her . I got him to let her go , as soon as he saw me yelling at him to stop . We had to ultimately put her to sleep because she was having trouble breathing because of the bite to her neck . She was not bleeding or mangled in anyway . So my question is why do you think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puppy not know his own strength and maybe was playing too rough and can hurt a small dog without bad intentions ? We socialize him and work with him almost daily . We have had him around our 4 children since the day we brought him home . He has never shown any aggression towards anyone , only a little with other dogs he does n't know . But as soon as he get close to the unknown dog his aggression subsides . <p> He is a wonderful loyal dog , and you can feel their love for you . I am really worried about this , and hope this incident does n't mean my dog is going to be dangerous .... : <p> Thank you , Stephanie Olvera <p> Hi StephanieThis is a very difficult question to answer because it 's not possible for me to know why your Rottie pup behaved this way as it certainly seems totally out of character for him . <p> Rottweilers can have a very strong prey-drive , and this instinct ( along with his guarding instincts ) are likely to be increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young puppy . Often pups ' do n't know what to do with ' these instincts at first and may over-react to situations . Generally , as they mature and their training and socialization continues , they learn the boundaries and how to control and understand their feelings . <p> Unless you were actually watching the dogs when the altercation began it 's impossible to know whether or not the smaller dog ' provoked ' this reaction , but I would definitely agree that if she did it was entirely unintentional . It 's possible that she got over-excited , or was running and barking/yipping and this triggered your male 's prey drive . It 's a very basic instinct and is n't something dogs think about , it 's literally an instinctive reaction and he may have grabbed and shaken her without any conscious thought being involved . <p> The fact that he dropped her when you told him too is good , and shows that he recognizes your authority even in a highly emotional state . Of course , that does n't make up for what he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain that must have caused to you all . That 's a horrible experience to have to go through . <p> Right now , my personal opinion would not be to over-react to this , or assume your pup is a ' dangerous dog ' , I think that would be wrong . It could well be that this was one of those isolated incidents that can happen with dogs ( or any animals for that matter ) and hopefully are never repeated . <p> BUT I definitely think it would be wise to monitor his interaction with other , smaller dogs and pets very carefully from now on and make it clear to him that ANY show of ' rough-housing ' or aggression is n't tolerated . The same goes for interaction with your children if they are very young or toddlers , although I seriously doubt there 's going to be any correlation between the two . This does n't mean he 's ' dangerous ' or ' aggressive ' , but you can never be too careful and it 's always best to be over-vigilant than under-vigilant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some pretty substantial developmental changes and it 's always a challenging time ( think of human teenage behavior and you 'll know what I mean ) , but with love , patience and discipline he will get through it and hopefully grow into a calm , stable and well-behaved adult . It 's important to continue his socialization and training though , as this is something Rotties need as ongoing activities . <p> IF by any chance , he shows any aggression or similar behavior in the future , then I would strongly recommend seeking some professional help from a dog trainer or canine behavioral specialist so that you can ' get to the bottom of it ' . Hopefully this will never happen , but it 's always better to be safe than sorry . <p> I hope this helps some and wish you all the very best of luck . <h> Comments for 9 month old puppy behavior <p> My rottie Jack , who is also 9 months old , just wants to play all the time .

Dogs who are chained are more likely to be defensive , or even act aggressively , when approached by other pets or people because they feel trapped and at a disadvantage and therefore decide their ' best means of defense is a good offense ' ... this can lead to all sorts of trouble . <p> There are also inherent dangers in chaining or tying-out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , as your Rottie has been tethered this way for years she has probably accepted this although it would be much better for her to be indoors with her family .

At 10 years old there should n't be any issues with house training as she will naturally want to eliminate outdoors and will have full bladder/bowel control . <p> If this is impossible , then using a pen outdoors for her ( with a nice warm bed and plenty of shade ) would be better - and safer - than tying her on a rope .

I did n't buy him from a registered breeder but i met his parents and they were so friendly and freely let me into their backyard with their pups around . <p> In the past month he has shown fear aggression towards my family members and i do n't know what to do . I tell him " no " every time he shows this behaviour and make him sit and when i tell him to stop , he does but it 's getting worse .

I 've also just started taking him to training lessons but i 'm unsure if i have found the right trainer as she said if it does n't stop i will have to re-house him because he will be unsafe to be around my children and i really do n't  want to do this as i love him dearly and do n't want to give him away . <p> Any help or advice you can give me will be greatly appreciated . Thank you , Talitha . <p> Hi TalithaI think what you 're seeing here is a result of several things . Firstly , your pup is an adolescent and his guarding instincts are starting to show up , but he 's not sure why he feels this way , or what to do with them ! It 's confusing and he over-reacts . This happens quite frequently . <p> Also , puppies go through two distinct ' fear periods ' in their development , one at around 8 weeks of age , and another at about 8 months . Your pup is likely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both of these things , you are about to have a new baby and there is probably an undercurrent of activity , anticipation and change going on in your home . Your pup will sense this , but have no idea what 's happening , and so will likely feel unsettled and insecure . <p> I doubt that he has a temperament problem as such , or that he 's an aggressive pup , it 's most likely a combination of the above factors leading to him feeling anxious and worried , and so he 's expressing that the only way he knows how . <p> I know it 's difficult to handle this sort of change at first , but he 's relying on you to help him regain his self-confidence and understand his place and role in your family . I definitely think a professional trainer will be hugely helpful with this , but you do need someone who is experienced with this breed ( or large guardian breeds in general ) and who wo n't over-react or read things into his behavior that are n't there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of dog obedience schools or trainers and find one that you are all comfortable with . <p> Try really hard not to over-react yourself and remain calm , loving and confident in all your dealings with your pup . Dogs are extremely intuitive and tend to absorb , and then reflect , their owners ' emotions . If you keep your calm , he will feel more in control too . <p> The fear period will pass as it 's just a ' stage ' , and if he gets proper training and corrections he will learn when he needs to ' protect ' you and when he does n't , and he 'll relax a bit overall . Do be sure that you continue to tell him ' no ' if he barks or growls when it 's not needed , and use a prong collar when you walk him ( see my Leash Training A Puppy page to see why I recommend these ) and give him a ' pop ' on the collar if he starts to overreact to strangers . <p> Do n't ' baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or truck , maintain a confident matter-of-fact attitude and just keep walking . Also be aware that if you are tense or worried , that will transmit down the leash to him ( sort of like a telephone wire ! ) , so keep your grip on the leash relaxed and do n't tense up yourself in anticipation of trouble . Be calm , and firm , and lead by example . <p> Of course , if your pup threatens you or your family , if you feel afraid of him , or if he threatens to bite without provocation , then you need urgent professional help with him and you would need to consider the safety of your children . But from what you have written I do n't think this is the case and it would be awful for your boy to lose the only home and loving family that he knows simply because he needs a bit more guidance and some confidence-building . <p> Anyway , I hope this helps and wish you lots of luck .

@@50394077 @3894077/ <h> Health Insurance For Your Dog <p> Illness , injury , surgery , accidents ..... all of these can , and do , happen to dogs every single day . <p> And , as we all know , owning a big dog means big bills in just about every area , including veterinary care . <p> Choosing a good health insurance plan for your dog means that you know you can afford to take care of him if he gets hurt , needs surgery , or develops a chronic illness . <p> It also protects your bank account and credit score if the cost of his veterinary care is more than you can comfortably afford . It 's a win-win ! <h> About Pet Health Insurance <p> Here in the US , having dog medical insurance is n't as common as it is in Europe , but we 're catching up fast ! <p> In fact the pet health insurance business is growing at a rate of around 15 - 20% each year . <p> On the other hand , over the last 20 years or so veterinary costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 the average cost of a routine vet bill doubled ... and overall spending on veterinary care tripled . <p> Since then , the cost of pet health care has continued to rise , and there 's no sign of it stopping any time soon . <p> According to the American Pet Products Association it 's estimated that pet owners spent over $15 BILLION on veterinary care in 2014 . That 's a lot of money . <p> When even straightforward veterinary procedures can cost hundreds of dollars , the monthly cost of taking care of dogs with common chronic health problems ( such as diabetes , arthritis , liver or kidney problems ) and surgeries ranging anywhere from $500 to $3000 or more , it 's easy to see why protecting your dog , and your wallet , is hugely important . <p> With the average cost of dog health insurance being somewhere between $260 and $420 per year , if you ' do the math ' you 'll soon see why more and more pet owners are taking advantage of the plans being offered . <h> Can You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Accidental injury or serious disease can come ' out of the blue ' . <p> And if you do n't have several thousand dollars in savings that you can afford to spend ( or an ' empty ' credit card ) it 's easy to find yourself unable to get your pet the help he/she needs . <p> Dog Health Insurance can prevent this sort of nightmare scenario because by paying a little every month , you do n't have to rob a bank ( or borrow from your friends/family ) if your dog gets injured or falls i 'll . <p> It 's important to know that with dog health insurance , although you generally have to pay your veterinary bills up front , you will be reimbursed quickly and easily ( usually within 15 - 30 days ) . <p> There are several different pet insurance companies , and each one may have several options when it comes to dog healthcare insurance plans . There 's literally one to suit every budget and situation . <p> There 's no one-size-fits-all policy , and premiums and deductibles vary quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you and you should also have a few questions to ask them so that you know exactly what you 're going to be getting for your money . <p> It 's easiest and least expensive to set up health insurance for your dog while he 's still a puppy . <p> As he grows he may develop health issues that will be considered as ' pre-existing conditions ' ( and therefore wo n't be covered by the plan ) if you start insurance later on . <p> Certain breeds may cost a bit more to insure , and the area that you live in can also affect premiums - sometimes because there 's a higher risk of certain health problems , accidents and so on in that area ) . <p> Generally a company will put together a policy for you that fits the level of care that you want as well as your budget . <p> Here are some of the different components of dog healthcare insurance policies .... <p> Cover for accidental injury or ' Major Medical ' coverage <p> Cover for Illness ( may be broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Cover for chronic conditions such as osteoarthritis , diabetes and more <p> Genetic condition coverage - varies depending on the breed involved <p> The last two items on this list are n't necessarily available with all dog health insurance companies , plus they can be complex and vary considerably from plan to plan . They also tend to make the overall coverage a bit more costly , but for Rottweilers they can be very vaulable indeed . <p> You should aim to get a plan that at least covers urgent veterinary visits , diagnostic tests , surgery and hospitalization as they 're the expensive procedures . <p> Additional coverage for routine vet visits , spay/neuter , vaccinations and dental care would be next in order of importance in my opinion and you may , or may not , have to pay extra for some or all of these depending on the provider and plans available . <p> Things like alternative treatments , behavioral problems , breeding issues , elective/cosmetic procedures ( yes dogs can have those too ! ) and preventable diseases are often not covered by most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major illness/accident or injury , you could find that the plan just paid for itself . <h> Rottweilers &amp; Dog Health Insurance <p> Rotties are BIG dogs , and they need the ' large ' or ' extra large ' size of just about everything ...... <p> ..... including vaccinations , routine treatments such as de-wormer and flea/tick preventative , right up to anesthesia , surgical care and medications for more serious problems . <p> They also have their own set of hereditary diseases and common health issues that the breed is particularly vulnerable to . <p> Of course , Rotties are n't alone in this , in fact all purebred dogs tend to have an higher-than-average risk of certain diseases or health issues which vary according to the breed in question . <p> Research done by the people at ConsumerReports.org indicates that Rottweilers take 6th Place on the Top 10 List of dog breeds particularly prone to certain conditions . <p> The most commonly seen hereditary problems in Rotties seem to be hip dysplasia and ruptured ACL 's . The most common degenerative disease appeared to be osteoarthritis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eye problems such as entropian and ectropian , and allergies . Also , Rottweilers are one of the breeds that are extremely vulnerable to Parvo . <p> In fact , as a whole Rottweilers are considered to be one of the most expensive breeds when it comes to the cost of veterinary care ... studies have shown them to cost up to 32% more than many other breeds . <p> So , if your dog develops any one ( or even more than one ) of the health problems above , your veterinary bills could end up being very , VERY high ! <h> Questions To Ask Before You ' Sign Up ' <p> Finding the right health insurance for your dog may take a little bit of time , effort and research , but it could save you a ton of money down the line . <p> And , it 's not just the insurance companies that should be asking the questions before you make a decision . <p> Here are a few of the things you need to find out before you commit .... <p> Check the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deductibles so that you know exactly what you 're going to need to pay . <p> Look at the age limits given - both minimum and maximum - to make sure it 's a good fit for your dog . <p> Find out what the ' caps ' are ( max. amount they will pay out ) , and whether it 's per incident or per year . <p> Check what percentage of the total bill is covered , it can vary quite a bit but it 's typically between 50% and 80% of the cost . <p> Know what the ' waiting period ' is going to be . This is how long you 'll need to wait for the coverage to kick-in . <p> Find out if you can use the **32;339;TOOLONG of your choice , or whether there 's a list of ' approved providers ' only <h> USEFUL TIP ! <p> Often a discount is available if you pay your premiums annually rather than monthly . <p> It 's another point to check with each company when doing your research . <p> Getting health insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the high cost of veterinary care it 's a necessity for most people . <p> So take your time and do the necessary research , and you 'll be able to feel confident that you 've made the right choice and found affordable pet insurance that works for you and your dog . <p> You can get FREE quotes online from many pet health insurance companies , and this is a good way of getting the information you need to compare dog insurance policies . <p> Getting quotes is quick , easy and does n't cost you anything . <p> Just fill in some basic information and you 'll get an instant quote showing the cost of the type of coverage you 're looking for . <p> I 'd recommend getting between 3 and 5 quotes before making a decision . <p> And remember , as with any policy ... make sure you always read all the fine-print before you accept it , and ask questions before - not after - you 've signed up . <p> It has a variety of very comprehensive and flexible plans which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'd strongly recommend checking out this page on their website - Rottweiler Pet Insurance - as it has detailed information on the veterinary charges that you could face if your Rottie falls victim to some of the most common conditions and surgeries that affect this breed . <p> Plus , it explains in detail the benefits and costs of insuring your Rottie and even has tips and advice to help you compare plans from other companies against their own , or get a free quote . <p> No obligation to buy , just information to help you make an informed decision ! <p> Of course , there 's more than one pet health insurance company out there , especially now as this sector is finally growing in popularity here in the US . <p> Another company that I researched recently in my efforts to track down affordable pet health insurance options is Trupanion Pet Insurance <p> They offer one affordable yet comprehensive plan with no payout limits ( at all ) - you can even choose your own deductible starting as low as $0 ( yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic or breed-specific conditions are covered , so are chronic or recurring ones . <p> There 's even an add-on that costs only $12.02 per month that gives your pup/dog full coverage for hip dysplasia and a number of alternative veterinary treatments . <p> Definitely worth considering in my opinion : ) <h> Related Pages .... 152135 @qwx562135 152136 @qwx562136 152137 @qwx562137

For first time owners it 's usually best to go for a ' middle of the road ' puppy - one who 's friendly and confident but not the bossy , ' alpha ' of the litter . Rottweilers should never be shy or fearful and if there is a seriously shy or nervous pup that would not be a good choice . <p> As you are buying from a reputable and experienced breeder , I 'd recommend letting him/her help you to choose .

@@50394080 @3894080/ <h> How to control bad behaviour in my 12month old rottweiler <p> Bow is very hyper and over playful , she bites , destroys , jumps on furniture and jumps up people . she is a lovely dog and has never showed any aggressiveness ! <p> what can i do to stop this bad behaviour ? <p> Hi RachaelI know that Bow is a big girl , but at 12 months old she 's still a teenager/adolescent and is likely to be considerably more active , energetic and ' hyper ' than she 'll be as an adult . <p> It sounds as though perhaps you have n't been clear enough in showing her what 's acceptable behavior and what is n't , and when a pup is younger ( and smaller ! ) , this sort of stuff does n't seem to be such a problem . However as the pup grows it becomes more difficult to tolerate , which is why it 's easiest to get it taken care of during those first few months rather than when it actually has grown to be a nuisance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly as long as you are consistent and loving in your corrections and show her clearly what you expect from her . I 'd recommend getting a crate and using it for short periods during the day so that she gets used to playing quietly by herself . A crate keeps her safe and protects your belongings , it will also be very helpful to have this habit already comfortably established by the time your baby comes as there will be times when you need to devote 100% of your attention to the baby , without making Bow feel upset or left-out . <p> Make sure she 's getting enough exercise too , there 's a lot of truth to the saying that ' a tired puppy is a good puppy ' ! ! At least 2 walks a day plus a play session , and at least one short training session are ideal . <p> I 'd recommend that you check out my Stop Puppy Biting page as it has lots of tips and advice to help you correct her nipping . The same sort of corrections work well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' naughty ' behavior has become a habit so you need to realize that it will take some time for Bow to break these old habits and adopt the new , correct , habits . You 'll need to be very consistent and very patient with her during this learning period . Rotties are very intelligent and very eager to please , so once she understands what you want she will try hard to obey , it just will take some time . <p> I 'd also recommend getting her enrolled in a basic obedience class at a local dog obedience school . It will help your relationship , be great socialization experience for her , and allow you to get some hands-on help with any issues/problems . If it 's difficult for you to handle her during your pregnancy , perhaps your husband or another family member could work with her for now . This sort of mental stimulation also helps to calm a pup and has a ripple effect on their behavior as a whole . For basic obedience commands that you can work on at home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It sounds as though Bow is a great girl overall , just has n't learned the rules properly yet . If you give her the time , patience and lessons that she needs I 'm sure she will grow into a great adult , she just needs your help to get there . <p> I hope this helps some , I wish you the best of luck . <h> Comments for How to control bad behaviour in my 12month old rottweiler <p> I have a boy rottweiler puppy and he does the same thing we decided to pay for home training classes AMD he doing better now ...

From personal experience I 'd say that two females are worse in this respect than two males , but it 's not always the case . <p> Of course , all dogs are different and just because it can often cause problems , does n't mean that it will ALWAYS be that way . It seems as though you were fortunate the first time around with your father/son Rotties , and you could also be lucky this time and they will continue to get along . However , it 's also perfectly possible ( even likely ) that they will become combative as they mature . <p> But , as you are familiar with raising this breed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that goes on and help them to overcome their differences so that they can live together long term . Again , a lot will depend on the individual dogs and their personalities . There are no guarantees one way or the other . <p> For first time owners , or those not familiar with the breed and perhaps not confident in their ability to deal with problems , I would definitely say do not try to raise two pups of the same sex together . However , for you the situation is a bit different and I think you 'll have to follow your gut on this . <p> Until they reach adolescence they should be fine , and you can always re-evaluate the situation should problems arise . Of course , you would have to be prepared for the worst outcome , which is the they can't/wo n't get along and you find you ca n't keep them both .

But , an older dog can learn too , it just takes a bit more time and patience . <p> Make sure you always correct her with a firm ' No jump ' but use a low , calm voice - if you shout , get angry or swat at her it will get her excited and she 'll jump more !

Do n't greet her right away , avoid eye-contact , and only interact to correct her jumping and ask her to ' sit ' . If you only reward the ' sit ' with attention sooner or later she 'll figure out that she should try that first ! <p> I 'd also recommend a formal obedience class as it helps to get ' hands-on ' help when you have any behavior difficulties .

Just do your own thing when you come home before going outside to your rotty . <p> A Jumping dog is a leadership thing and you do n't want that . <p> What i teach my clients is that when you do go outside is to walk with your posture straight and your arms folderd and no eye contact . She will try to get your attention by continuing jumping on you . You just keep turning your back towards her and walk away or walk around the yard like you really own the place . <p> But remeber to not to make any eye contact . Once she has calmed down call her tell he to sit , once she sits , SAY GOOD SIT &amp; reward with a praise or treat . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just a pat on the head and then go back inside . <p> Repeat this method twice a day . Your friends and family should follow these simple steps too . Usually it will take one week but more stubbon dogs may take 2-3 weeks to catch on . 152137 @qwx562137

I ice it for her when she yelps for comfort.I also read up about Pano and looked for pictures of " knuckling " .. Best I can suggest is to make sure your dog is not overweight.I cut back slightly on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to not yelp as much .. She would yelp and sit for 10 seconds and then run off like nothing was wrong.Dr felt she was a little overweight ( 70 lbs @ 6 months ) so I slightly cut back ..

Other than that I would say hang tight and give it time .. make sure to limit the amount of exercise that targets the front paws and of course smuther him with love ... 152137 @qwx562137

This stage has many challenges and it 's very important that you continue to make sure that he knows his place . Adolescent Rotties , especially males , usually want to challenge authority and test limits during these months . <p> He 's also probably at the peak of his teething stage ... the last adult teeth will come in somewhere around 6 months of age . <p> All of this will be causing an increase in his biting , and the tendency to ' throw his weight around ' . To make sure this biting does n't continue you will need to keep correcting him EVERY SINGLE TIME - that 's very important . A firm verbal correction and a withdrawal of attention is the first thing to try . If it 's not enough , then try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everything else you need to know about puppy biting and nipping on my Stop Puppy Biting page . <p> Being patient and consistent is the key . Correct him every time , and in the same way . If you show him clearly that this behavior wo n't be tolerated he will eventually begin to give it up . Good luck . 152137 @qwx562137

Give yourself a pat on the back for getting her to that point , because this is the correct Rottweiler behavior ! <p> Contrary to media representation and popular belief , Rottweilers are NOT a dangerous , mean or aggressive breed ( see my Are Rottweilers Dangerous ? page for more on this ) . They are very discriminating in their guardian abilities and generally wo n't act aggressively , or defensively , unless provoked or they feel that they ( or their families ) are under attack . Even if they do feel it necessary to be on guard , they are more likely to use their physical size and voice as intimidation tactics , and are not inclined to bite first and ask questions later . That is the way it should be . <p> If you are afraid that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you do n't need to worry . She obviously has n't felt any threat to you , or your home/family , if she does then she will act accordingly . Also do remember that at 18 months or so she 's still not fully mature , and her guardian instincts are still developing ( along with the rest of her body ) . <p> Do n't every try to encourage your dog to be more aggressive or to fear other humans or dogs , that will confuse and frighten her and interfere with the natural development of her guardian abilities . Rottweilers rarely get a second chance or the benefit of the doubt , and if you try to encourage aggressive behavior she could well become unstable and unpredictable in her behavior which could lead to tragedy . <p> Just allow her to develop naturally and trust that the generations of breeding that have produced today 's Rottweilers has given her the strength , intelligence and abilities that she needs to be your friend and protector . <p> Hope this puts your mind at rest , I wish you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comments for my rottweiler is not agressive ? <p> Mine is also very playful and 9 months old , and I live in South Africa I need to trade this dog for a Pitt bull.My wife though loves the dog to bits and am also fond of it but I hate that it plays with everyone . <p> Jul 29 , 2013Rating <p> Managed Aggressio in RottiesNEWby : RKR <p> I believe that the question of aggression is misunderstood .

We currently have a female bull terrier who is socialised and is still doing dog training . <p> Was just wondering what will be the best way to introduce the new edition to the existing pets , should it be done on our property ( will this make my bull terrier more territorially aggressive ? ) should we try walk the dogs first ? <p> Any tips would be appreciated . <p> Thanks Kelly <p> Hi KellyYou 're doing the right thing by thinking ahead and trying to make sure that the first introductions run smoothly . <p> Generally bringing a new pup into a home with existing pets is n't a huge deal as the older dogs are tolerant of puppies , and a pup raised around other dogs and cats learns to accept them without difficulty . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeds , can be a bit dominant and tend to ' play rough ' even in fun . However , a Rottie pup is pretty robust too and should be able to handle that . I 'd recommend reading this web article Introducing A New Puppy as it has lots of tips and advice to help you . <p> The fact that the new puppy is of the opposite sex to the bull terrier is good as there are less likely to be any major conflicts that way . Usually things run pretty smoothly at first , even when the dog and pup are of the same sex , but later on two females or two males can start to be combative as the puppy matures . <p> You could try introducing the pup to the older dog in another safe area where unvaccinated dogs have n't had access ( for health reasons ) and then take them home together . If the new dog was an adult I would recommend this , but with a puppy it should n't matter too much . Unless your Bull Terrier is generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if that 's the case then you may want to try this tactic . 152137 @qwx562137

Why would this be ? <p> Many Thanks Reba 's mum <p> Hi AnneIt 's hard to say what is causing this sudden change in behavior , but there are a couple of possibilities that come to mind . <p> Firstly , if she actually NEEDS to go pee when she 's waking up at 3am , and if she seems to be urinating more often in general , then it 's possible that she has a urinary tract infection . <p> This is fairly common in puppies , and seen more often in females than males . I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rule out an infection as if she does have one and it goes untreated it could cause more serious health problems . <p> Also , at four months old Reba is moving out of the ' baby ' stage and into adolescence . Many times you 'll see a regression , or ' acting up ' while a pup moves through this phase . Rottweilers are slow to mature and develop and can remain ' teenagers ' for a long time . You may see behavior and attitudes that are very similar to that seen in human teenagers .... defiance , efforts to assert individual authority , emotional ' outbursts ' , alternating over confidence and anxiety and so on . <p> It 's important to keep the ground rules fixed and to enforce them firmly but lovingly , and to be totally consistent about what you expect from her during this time . She needs to feel loved and secure in order to develop properly . <p> If I were you , I would take her out right away when she wakes at 3am and give her the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crate and ignore any more fussing . During these night-time potty breaks do n't reward her with any type of attention . Do n't talk ( apart from the basic potty commands and a quiet ' good girl ' if she goes ) , do n't make eye contact and do n't pet her . You do n't want her waking up just for attention . This way she will stop waking up when she no longer needs to ' go ' . <p> If after several nights she does n't seem to want to pee , then you can probably simply ignore the 3am wake up call and she will eventually stop doing it . <p> Hope this helps , best of luck with Reba . <h> Comments for CRATE TRAINING ISSUE - 4 MONTH OLD ROTTIE <p> I have a nearly 4 month old female Rottweiler .

Researchers and veterinarians believe that this allows for the maximum health benefits of the surgery - in terms of preventing reproductive-order diseases and conditions . <p> If a pup or dog is older than this , that does n't mean they should n't be ' altered ' , just that the benefits of the surgery in terms of disease prevention may be less .

If someone approaches , encourage them to give him one of the treats you 've brought along so that he begins to see strangers as a positive experience rather than a negative one . <p> If you have friends with friendly , vaccinated dogs , take him along for ' play dates ' and watch to make sure he does n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a happy , upbeat voice - if you 're confident and happy he will be more likely to feel the same way .

Like most of the day and through the night too . <p> Is this normal for Rotties or could he be sick ? Should we be worried ? <p> Hi DanRottweilers are definitely not high-energy dogs when mature , but Rottie puppies are usually fairly active and energetic - as are most breeds . <p> However , I think that your new Rottweilers ' behavior right now is more likely due to the stress of the recent changes in his life rather than his personality . Regardless of how old they are , pups tend to go through an adjustment period during the first week or so in a new home .

At 8 weeks old your Rottweiler is just a tiny baby , and this is the earliest age at which he should have left his momma and littermates . He was taken from them much too young . <p> Removing a pup from his canine family before 8 weeks of age can lead to excessive biting and nipping , and sometimes other behavioral problems because the pup has n't had a chance to learn proper canine social interactions or ' etiquette ' . However , it seems as though you have controlled the biting and nipping well , and in general I would say that your puppy is doing very , very well for such a little baby . <p> At 8 weeks his attention span is very short , and you should n't expect him to be able to focus for more than a couple of minutes at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 minutes , and always make them a happy , fun experience and use lots of treats and praise to keep your pup motivated and rewarded . <p> I 'd recommend that you keep feeding him one meal a day by hand as this will help to make sure he does n't develop any dog food aggression issues .

If you issue a stay command , and the dog gets up , you bring the dog back to the original area where you issued the command and jerk the collar ... you get the picture . <p> Is that conducive to the Rottweiler breed ? We used it on our unruly lab and it worked wonders , but I know that the Rottie is a totally different breed with a different temperament ! <p> Hi RonnieThis training system is n't one I 've ever used or am personally familiar with so I did some online research in order to answer this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any hands-on use of the system , so bear that in mind . <p> Personally I 'm not a fan of the approach that uses coercion to achieve results .... be that a prong collar , alpha roll , physical reprimand etc . Positive rewards-based training methods are much more effective in my experience , and from what I understand Don Sullivan system does n't use treats as rewards . This in itself is n't necessarily a deal-breaker , but I 've always found that puppies respond much more quickly and enjoy their training sessions much more when food is involved : o ) <p> Of course there are pros and cons to every system , and you need to use rewards wisely , gradually switching from a guaranteed reward , to an intermittent reward and eventually to an occasional reward , as the pup grows and matures . However overall I find this method much superior - some puppies or dogs are n't food motivated though , and in that case you can substitute an alternative such as a favorite toy or simply praise . <p> Rottweilers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're one of the easiest breeds to train , with even young puppies being focused and eager to please . Using force of any kind or being too heavy-handed in the corrections does n't work with Rotties . It tends to trigger their stubborn streak and training can become a battle instead of a co-operative effort . <p> The use of a prong collar is n't necessary in my opinion to teach commands such as sit , down , stay etc. and I think it 's like ' taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut ' with most dogs . There may well be the occasional dog ( particularly if it 's an untrained adolescent or adult ) who needs and responds well to this , but I would imagine that 's the exception . For your average pup it 's overkill . <p> Having said that , there is definitely a place for a prong collar when it comes to leash training adolescent or older dogs . Rottweilers are extremely strong and have a high pain threshold , a regular ' choke chain ' collar will have little effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trachea if not used properly , or used excessively . I 'd recommend taking a look at my Leash Training A Puppy and Big Dog Collars to learn more about prong collars , leash training a Rottie pup etc . <p> A prong collar only requires a little pressure to be felt by the dog and is therefore much more effective and a lot safer . The plastic prong collar used in this system may work with a Rottie , but knowing my adult dogs I 'm skeptical about it 's strength or effectiveness . <p> Now as I said , I 've not used this system , so this is just a few preliminary thoughts based on the reviews and info . I saw online . As you 've actually used the system effectively , you obviously have a better understanding of it 's potential . However , as you rightly assume , a Labrador and a Rottweiler are totally different breeds , and just because it works on one does n't necessarily mean it will work on the other . <p> I hope this helps in some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rottie 152137 @qwx562137

My problem is that she ca n't seem to get along well with our 6 year old Norwich Terrier , Victoria . <p> I try to let them play so that they can get to know each other but Antonia sometimes gets too rough during play . She tries to push our terrier around and gives her playful bites . Victoria does n't seem to be enjoying this and she keeps on snarling at Antonia . I 'm trying to teach Antonia a Stop command to keep her actions from getting out of hand but she just ignores me .

Even if you work long hours , she needs to be walked at least twice a day and you should add one play session and a minimum of one 10 minute training session to that daily schedule . If it 's impossible for you to walk her twice a day , perhaps you can find a relative , friend , neighbor or petsitter who will be willing to do it for you - perhaps even for a small fee . <p> Training is very important for Rottweiler puppies , so is socialization , and if possible I 'd suggest enrolling her in a dog obedience class where you can both learn to communicate with each other . This is also a good bonding activity and excellent socialization opportunity for Antonia . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tips page for help with basic obedience commands etc . <p> Raising pups takes patience , consistency , time and effort , and as your pup is only 4 months old she 's still very young .

@@50394164 @3894164/ <h> SUPER Hyper puppy <p> Our puppy is now almost 6 months old ( got him at 8 wks ) and BEYOND hyper at times . <p> He understands " come " , " sit " , " stay " , " down " and a few other tricks and will snap to them when a treat is seen . However , when he does not WANT to obey - he just wo n't . <p> He goes into rages out of the blue . He is still biting us when he does not get his way . He will eat out of our hands , let us put our hands in his bowl , but STILL growls when we try to pet or touch him when he eats ( final step in breaking his food aggression issues ) <p> We have had stubborn dogs in the past and successfully trained them , but at 6 months this one is beyond anything we have ever seen . And the bigger he gets - the worse it will get . <p> Please do n't give me the standard advise ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , play with him in the pool , he has balls and toys and we play with a laser beam in the house with him at night as well . <p> We get mixed reviews about having him fixed ( which we are doing next week ) to if that will help . <p> My questions are : <p> How do we get him to " obey " his commands on our terms ? The biggest issue right now is " NO " . For example , if HE wants to go in the pool he just goes in the pool . We see him go to the edge and we say firmly " NO " ... he will look straight at us and get in the pool ! We pull him out immediately and say " NO " , dry him off and put him in the house - he KNOWS what he did - but will then do it again the next day ! ! ! <p> How do we calm him down ? I have tried the sprays , room diffusers etc and they were a waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up , but he is just not even trying to learn how to behave or bond with us . <p> HiIt certainly sounds as though your pup is a handful and a half , and I can thoroughly appreciate how frustrating this can be , especially when you 're following all avenues possible to ' control him ' . <p> It may not be much consolation , but what you 're going through now is probably the most challenging stage in his development . It probably wo n't get worse as he gets bigger , because right now he 's a ' bratty adolescent ' who is challenging your authority and testing every limit ( on a daily basis ! ) . As long as you provide firm , CONSISTENT corrections and guidelines for behavior , he will more than likely grow into a much better-behaved and calmer adult than you are visualizing . <p> Raising puppies is like raising kids in so many ways , and sometimes you feel as though your banging your head against a brick wall and not getting through ... then lo and behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you and they actually display the behavior you were laying the groundwork for . It 's a miracle every time ... but it is an exhausting , frustrating and difficult task sometimes . <p> I 'd think your pup is very intelligent , but is also a strong-willed , stubborn ' alpha ' personality , and he 's going head-to-head with you . With this type of pup it 's even more important that you correct his behavior every single time in the same way ( just as you are doing with the pool ) , because it only takes one slip up on your part to give him the thought that maybe he IS in charge after all . Dogs are creatures of habit and if something happens enough times in the same way they eventually recognize it as a habit , and then it becomes almost inevitable in their mind . Cause and effect are very important and need to remain consistent . <p> It sounds as though overall you 're doing a great job with him and working through the food aggression issues etc. very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his bowl , pick up his food , hand feed him etc. and he was originally food aggressive , then you 've done an excellent job . Most dogs do n't want to be petted or interrupted when eating , and if that 's his only issue right now then I would n't worry about that too much . Just leave him alone to eat in peace , but periodically do a ' test run ' with the food bowl to keep him on track . <p> I would also recommend that you start making him earn everything from food , to walks , toys , treats etc. by having him ' sit ' and even ' sit/stay ' before he gets them . As he is only working for treats right now , this will help expand his repertoire ! It also reinforces in his mind that YOU are in charge . <p> If he 's getting enough general exercise already , then the next step would be to get him in a regular obedience class as it 's a form of both mental and physical exercise/stimulation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will also be able to get professional one-on-one help with any behavior or training issues that are problematic . <p> As you have a smart , energetic pup you may also want to get him involved in some other activity such as tracking , or later on when his bones/joints are fully developed , agility or something similar . Rottweilers are after all a working breed , and depending on their bloodlines some have a stronger desire to ' work ' or be active than others . Your pup may thrive in that sort of situation . <p> Neutering may or may not calm him down a little in the short term , but combined with maturity , it will most likely make some difference . Of course the biggest advantage of having him neutered is that you 'll be giving him maximum protection against reproductive order diseases/conditions including cancers . That 's very important . <p> Please do n't give up on this pup as you 're probably over half-way to the ' finish line ' by now . Rottweilers are very loyal and even though you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he most definitely will have and it would be very difficult for him to be uprooted from his home . They 're often one-person or one-family dogs and find it difficult to transfer that affection . <p> Just think of human teenagers and how they behave , and you 'll see the correlation in your pup . Just as the majority of teenagers outgrow their trying behavior , so do dogs . Be as patient as you can and give your boy a chance to grow into the dog he 's meant to be . I think he 's going to be an incredible dog when mature . I wish you the very best of luck and hope it all works out well . <h> Comments for SUPER Hyper puppy <p> My husband and I know how you feel .

Rottweilers are one of the breeds who are especially susceptible to these due to their size and color . <p> A dog 's normal temperature is anywhere between 100F and 102F . A temp . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely dangerous . There are a lot of things you can do to reduce the risks of over-heating or heat-stroke in dogs , including ... <p> a ) Making sure your dog has plenty of shade ALL day , it can be too hot even early in the morning , or late in the evening . <p> b ) Keep your dog in a grassy area rather than on concrete or asphalt which heats up quickly and also reflects and magnifies the sun/heat . <p> c ) Having access to cool , fresh water at all times <p> d ) No strenuous exercise when it 's really hot , walking or playing should be done really early , or really late in the day . Playtimes can be taken indoors where there is a fan or air-conditioning and even then go easy . <p> e ) Do n't use a muzzle <p> f ) If possible provide a source of water for your dog to actually GET into ... if you do n't have a swimming pool , a child 's wading/paddling pool works well . <p> The symptoms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all dogs will show all of the symptoms ( or the same ones ) . It can also develop and progress very quickly . Here are some of the most common signs of canine heat-stroke ... <p> a ) Excessive or rapid panting <p> b ) Lethargy , loss of balance or disorientation <p> c ) Excessive salivation - this may be thicker than normal <p> d ) Diarrhea or vomiting which may contain traces of blood . <p> e ) Seizures or collapse <p> Heat stroke is very serious , and a severe case can result in organ failure and death . As soon as you suspect your dog is over-heated it 's vital to get him out of the heat and start to cool and hydrate him . <p> However , trying to get him to drink icy water or reducing his temp too quickly can also cause problems . The best thing to do is to get your dog indoors where it 's air conditioned , or at the very least into the shade and provide a fan to circulate the air . Wetting him down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first step and you can use a garden hose , or simply pour water on him . Using rubbing alcohol ( aka isopropy alcohol ) on the paw pads and under the ' armpits ' and groin area also helps . If he will drink offer cool water or a electrolyte-solution such as Pedialyte and water . <p> Other than that there is n't much that an owner can do and it 's absolutely vital to get the dog to a veterinarian as soon as you 've taken the above steps . A very high internal temperature can cause multiple organ failure , seizures and death , and only a veterinarian can provide more sophisticated cooling options and try to prevent this from happening . <p> Take the initial steps to cool your dog , but do n't waste time after that , get straight to your own vet or an emergency animal clinic and call ahead to let them know the situation and that you 're bringing in a dog with heatstroke. 152137 @qwx562137

Have patience and use positive feedback for the pup . Go slow , baby steps , Rotties can be vocal as well . Give a warning that you are going to pick up the pup and do it gently , treating immediately so the dog learns to enjoy being handled . Give the pup a gentle massage and lots of treats to make it positive and repetition helps so it becomes part of his/her day . When a pup growls at you for picking him/her up it is usually because they have not been handled by humans much , they are in pain , they are unsure of what you are doing and feel fearful .

Done calmly with respect and patience ; consistancy and leadership . Yelling shouting demanding all those kind of communications excite your Rotti and she sees this is a threat ; not a dominant thing , but a fear thing . Their ears are extremely sensitive . They do best learning after strong physical exercise and play . Their are a few different growls ... one is the Rotti purr which is done when your girl is being petted and laying out with you ... it is a soft growl and not to be misunderstood as a threatening growl ; another is the " I 'm loyal to my handler growl " ; this one is a little more intimidating and usually comes from an unwanted petting or touching ; they are n't all that big on hugs and kisses except from the pack ; usally the leader only or their pups ... which is why when raised with pack leader children they love them and socia lize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be permitted unsupervised by adults ) . Now the worst is the eye stare fluid dropping growl snarl .. teeth are showing slightly ears are forward and head is in a herding positing or basically down slightly with the eyes up ... this kind of direct communitcation is to herd you back with the group ; the leader and also a challenge to dominate you . If you are the leader of the pack then I encourage you to treat her as your partner and let her know that you will take care of things that are threatening . A loud voice to your Rotti is like a puppy yelping ... she will want to put you in your place because you are not behaving correctly . Your dog is a regal beast of a girl . She wo n't take shame kindly . She is n't stupid and she actually needs to be living with you and your family for a time before she gets what it is you want .. and she will do it ... but pressure her and the deal is off . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she waits for her previous handler .. that is how loyal they are . Never dicipline your Rotti with choker chains ... electric collars ... sticks ... hits and of that sort of tough dog thinking . Your Rotti although very intimidating to look at is a big ball of mooshy emotions . She will feel hurt deeply and although try to please you she wo n't understand what you want ... regardless of Pavlov 's theory . Love her , listen to her and watch her behaviors .. crate her to feel safe ( her to feel safe ) and exercise her alot ... 3k min two times per day . Make sure you socialize her with dogs her size , small dogs , and find a walking partner dog that can teach her what the rules are in her new area .

Dogs who could retrieve and dogs who could herd sheep . All of these were good dogs , but not what the creator had in mind . <p> Finally there was one dog . He looked rather plain .

" <p> For three days and two nights the dog went with man while he hunted , and helped track down game , he protected their flocks , and chased away the wild animals who sought to harm them . He pulled their loads and supplies , and guarded their valuables . On the third night , a small girl came to him . She was frightened by dreams she had .

Giggling and playing with her new friend and protector she even patted his behind . The child and dog became inseparable , and the dog felt only undying love for the child . <p> The Geat Being whispered in the dogs ear , then . " You have passed your test , for many dogs can hunt and guard and herd , but you were not only willing to give your life , you went into the world of man and entered his darkest dreams and fears .

At 10 weeks I found she had a severe case of round worms and subsequently , she was put on special food by the vet for a month . She hated it and when she was able to eat kibble again , I mixed it with cooked chicken and carrots to entice her . So until recently her diet consisted of roughly 1-1 1/2 breasts daily with veggies and about 4 cups of kibble ( BW large breed pup ) . <p> Now i 'm concerned that this diet might have been too low in calcium . Compared to her brothers and sisters she is considerably shorter and her head is much smaller . And it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrawny stage , she is very muscular and much more " filled out " . Also , her parents , especially her mother , have very large skulls .

Most of what I 've read regarding calcium supplementation was negative and it 's actually possible to stunt growth . But she is a vet and I do n't know if the negatives resulted from a year of extra calcium or a few weeks . Her idea of " making up for lost time " seems logical I guess but I just want a second opinion .

However , she is past the stage where she 's growing rapidly , so to me it would seem that giving her extra calcium at this point would n't carry the risks that it does for a younger puppy .

This is n't unusual , and the biggest male pups often take much longer than the smaller females to reach maturity . <p> Her muscle development is probably more a genetic tendency than anything to do with her diet too . She will probably be a strong , sturdy adult and although her head may ( or may not ) grow to be similar in size to that of her parents , she will be exactly what her ' genetic blueprint ' set out to achieve . <p> As long as she 's happy and healthy , that 's what really counts and it sounds as though she is .

More calcium than this is too much for a large breed puppy and contributes to Developmental Orthopedic Disease ( DOD ) . Calcium supplements are unnecessary and will likely cause an increase in DOD unless the calcium is medically necessary to treat an ailment or medical condition . <p> Calcium levels in puppy foods are regulated by AAFCO , setting the maximum at 2.5% on a dry matter basis ( Source : AAFCO Pet Food &amp; Speciality Pet Food Labeling Guide ) . Since this level was established , the incidence of DOD related to excess calcium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Puppies eating a commercial product designed for their life-stage do not need supplements of any kind , unless it is medicaly mecessary . <p> Double check with your vet . Rotties take 2 to 3 years to mature . At 8.5 months she 's sill growing , just not as fast as when she was younger . If you want to supplement calcium and it 's ok with your vet , you can grind 2 egg shells in a cheap coffee grinder to where it 's almost a powder . Put it on her dry food and see if she 'll accept it . The calcium content in 2 egg shells every other day is safe and will not " overload " the calcium concentration in the dog 's system or contribute to DOD . Again , check with your vet first ! 152137 @qwx562137

@@50394197 @3894197/ <h> DESTRUCTIVE puppy behavior <p> by Jeanne ( Florence , MS USA ) <p> Wow ! Where do I start ? We have had our 7 month old male Rottweiler pup , Gus for about a month . We took him from a friend who had gotten him as a " gift " but due to their work schedule did not feel they could care for him properly . That being said , he spent a lot of his first 6 months in a kennel . <p> We have a huge backyard that we thought would be great for him . It was a beautiful backyard , but not anymore ! We have been leaving him outside while we are at work with plenty of toys and chews to keep his interest . My husband runs 3 miles every morning and Gus goes with him , so I think he is getting plenty of exercise . Also , either me , my son or husband play with him several times a day by throwing his toys or playing tug with his rope . <p> Everyday I come home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lattice out from under the stairs several times . Dug up under the lattice when we fixed it . Eaten A LOT of plants . Dug up an entire flower bed . Eaten my grandmother 's rocker that was on the back porch . Chewed the door facing and several stairs . I could go on but I am sure you get the point . <p> He does not do this when we are outside with him only when he is alone . He is pretty well behaved while inside . We bring him inside in the evenings and he sleeps inside in his kennel each night . He did chew up the corner of a table and started on a bench . But stopped when we corrected him and gave him something appropriate to chew instead . <p> What can we do to correct this behavior ? I feel it would be cruel to keep him in his crate all day while we are working , that is why we took him in the first place . I do n't mean to make him sound like a monster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very loving . I am a tad bit upset writing this because today was the day her ate my grandma 's rocker and that pretty much sent me over the edge . I guess removing everything not nailed down or rooted in the backyard is an option , but I think correcting his behavior would be more beneficial to us all . <p> Someone suggested a smaller pen within the fenced backyard because he is having too much freedom with the run of about a half acre yard . Another friend said maybe he is getting overly tired and acting out like a child who does n't have a nap . I have read lots of things on the web in search of an answer but nothing specific to this breed . <p> Should I just give up and let him wreak havoc until he grows up ? I hate dreading walking into my backyard everyday when it used to feel like a sanctuary to me . <p> Can you give me suggestions ? I am really at a loss and want to be able to both love my pup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very normal and expected part of puppy ownership and one of the reasons why it 's so important to puppy proof your home carefully and thoroughly ( and that includes your yard ) . <p> Large breed puppies like Rottweilers grow physically very quickly , but they mature slowly - much more slowly in fact than small or medium sized breeds . That means that the inevitable ' puppy behavior ' lasts for longer than you might expect . At 7 months of age your pup is still young , not a ' baby ' but more like a pre-teen or middle-school child . <p> Plus a large or giant breed puppy can do a LOT more damage than a small breed puppy , and within a much shorter time frame ! <p> From what you describe I would say he 's bored and lonely rather than lacking in daily exercise . A pup left alone , even with the best toys in the world , is naturally going to feel this way . Dogs are pack animals and they live to be with their ' pack ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , in most families where everyone is either working or at school , the dog has to be alone for hours at a time . This is n't ideal , but as long as he gets plenty of love , attention , exercise and training during the times when his people are home he can adjust and do just fine . <p> As you ca n't change the amount of time your pup is alone during the day , then in order to protect your yard ( and you do n't have to forfeit your right to a nice yard that you enjoy just because you own a dog ) , you need to contain him and prevent him having unsupervised access to your entire yard . <p> Personally I would do both of the following and use both options regularly - switching them around according to weather or just to keep the degree of ' sameness ' from becoming overwhelming : <p> 1 . Set up a smaller fenced area within your yard that is specifically for your Gus to play in when you 're not supervising him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this , I 'd recommend the 10 ' x 10 ' size if he 's going to be in there for 6 - 8 hours at a time . <p> You can buy shade covers to fit over the top and would need to also make sure he has an insulated dog house and plenty of water when he 's out there ... plus sturdy chew toys and even a paddling pool with 6 " or so of water for him to play in . If you can set it up under a tree/s even better . <p> If you do n't want to buy a kennel , you can fence in an area yourself , just make sure the fencing is sturdy and at least 5 ' tall . Rottweilers are n't usually ' jumpers ' but I have owned a male who could clear a 5 ft. fence with no problem , so 6ft. is optimum . <p> 2 . Set up a dog crate in a living area where you can leave the TV or radio on while you 're gone . <p> Make sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of his favorite ( I often buy a couple of new ' special ' toys for this crate ) toys in there for company . <p> You can use both of these options to confine Gus while you 're at work . It 's not cruel to crate him during the day as long as he gets lots of love and attention when you 're at home ! <p> Rottweilers are pretty low-energy dogs once they outgrow that little puppy stage and chances are he 'll simply sleep most of the day when he 's crated . Occasionally chewing on his toys when he 's not napping . By leaving the TV or radio on he 'll have something to listen to and it helps him to feel less alone . <p> Confining him to a smaller area outdoors is n't unkind either . Again , he does n't NEED a lot of space to run around in when he 's getting a long walk ( and actually personally I 'd say be careful with the 3 mile jog at this stage ... Rottie pups should n't run on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it can cause damage to developing joints/ligaments . A long walk is better ) , and play sessions plus training sessions daily . He 'll be just as happy in a smaller area with his toys and dog house . <p> This way you can keep your yard nice and your pup happy and healthy . It 's actually dangerous to leave him alone unsupervised if he 's prone to chewing on plants and other ' stuff ' ( and what puppy is n't ? ) . Some plants are toxic , and ingesting wood , rocks , dirt etc. can cause digestive issues , even poisoning and at the very least tummy upsets . <p> It sounds as though Gus is a lucky boy to have found a loving home and family , and you will be doing the best for him by keeping him safe this way . Once he 's fully mature ( anywhere between 2 and 3 years most likely ) , then he will be much less likely to destroy things and you should be able to give him free access to your home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there ! 152137 @qwx562137

Hopefully she is from a breeder who has dogs with OFA certified hips - that way you have less chance of her developing hip problems . <p> Rotties do tend to be susceptible to knee injuries , and it 's possible for puppies to damage themselves while playing , especially if they 're running and turning rapidly , or on uneven ground .

Just remember that Karma is like any other puppy and do n't be tempted to have your judgment of her behavior/stages or anything else colored by the fact that she 's a Rottweiler .

When my first Rottie got parvo ( after having all her innoculations ) I found that she was allergic to the anit vomit injection , so went to the health food shop and got Slippy elm powder and gave it to her and with hours she had stop vomiting and actually recovered from parvo . Now whenever any of my dogs get an upset stomach I use Slippy elm and it seems to work . 152137 @qwx562137

She lives with my dad I pick her up once/twice a week and take her out mainly to a family members let her run around the garden buy her loads of treat and toys ETC . <p> So my dads give me a few snippets of her behaviour , she 's ran out the house not reposed to calls , she 's scratched the door , she 's scratched the carpet . <p> Tonight its kind of come to a head were my dad has basically said he 's thinking of taking here back , I DON NOT wan this to happens . She has started to tear away at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffing and then even get to the foam/ She has also scratched a a certain part of the carpet right down to thread . <p> We had a rottie previous who was put to sleep a year earlier , she was 14 and as you know quite old for a rottie .

I have a 4 months female rottweiler I named Zuni , everybody in my family ( including my 18 months old little boy ) love Zuni . <p> The problem is everyone who knows we have a rottie as a pet complains and feeds us with all sorts that I have not been able to confirm ... they say they are not the best of dogs , they are wolfs , they eat their owners , they are threats to kids , they are not controllable etc . I am worried as well as scared now . <p> Second , Zuni will cry all day long if I chain her or lock her in her Kennel as I have been advised to . Ask Zuni to sit or lie she will not she will rather be jumping on you licking you and try to play with you . what do I do now ? How do I train her , should I keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am worried is Zuni really a threat to my kids ? <p> Hi GordonLet me say first of all - a well-bred and properly raised Rottweiler is no more ' dangerous ' than any other breed . This almost ' devil dog ' reputation is entirely undeserved , inaccurate and basically just ridiculous . It makes me very angry and sad . The people who are telling you this nonsense do not know what they are talking about , most likely have never met or owned a Rottweiler , and are simply ' parroting ' the ignorant gossip they hear . <p> First of all I 'd recommend you read the following pages on my website as they should answer just about every question you have ..... <p> Rottweilers are wonderful dogs , but of course they 're not perfect , neither are they ' saints ' . They 're a guardian breed ( as are German Shepherds/Alsations which is the other breed you mention ) , and are big , strong , intelligent , loyal and loving . <p> They 're often not recommended as a ' first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong willed , however they ARE NOT an indiscriminately vicious or dangerous dog at all . Because of their adult size ( and the fact that an adolescent Rottweiler can be clumsy and awkward ) , they can inadvertently hurt very young children or frail elderly people simply by knocking them down .... usually as the result of an over-excited and loving greeting ! So that is something to bear in mind . However , training your Rottweiler puppy properly will teach her not to jump , bite etc. and how to behave . <p> Start training Zuni now , and be loving and consistent with her . I 'd also advise getting her enrolled in a dog training class once she 's had all her vaccinations , but be sure that the trainer understands these dogs and uses only reward-based , positive training methods . Some ' old school ' type trainers still believe that big , strong dogs like Rottweilers need harsh , punitive training methods but nothing could be further from the truth . <p> Zuni complains when you chain her or lock her in her kennel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the family . This is natural . Rotties need to be involved in family life and bond very closely with their owners , she will be miserable if you keep her separated all the time and if anything could make her unpredictable and difficult this would be it . <p> She needs to be around you , to learn how to behave and to bond with you . Of course she does also need to learn to be kenneled or left alone for short periods of time , and in that situation you just need to ignore her fussing . You can make it up to her when she gets family time later on . <p> I really hope you take the time to read all the information and advice on the pages above as it will give you an accurate picture of this breed and has lots of tips to help you understand and train your puppy . I have 6 children myself and they have been raised with Rottweilers without incident . They love the dogs and the dogs love them . It is important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure that they do n't tease a puppy or adult dog . <p> I wish your family and Zuni the best of luck and hope that you take the time and effort to train her correctly and give her a good life , with lots of love , so that she can grow up to be a great representative of her breed ( a true Rottweiler ) and show other people just what an amazing dogs Rottweilers truly are : o ) <h> Comments for How do I handle my Rottweiler puppy ? <p> Gordon , you would be making the biggest mistake if you sell your rottie , I tell people they are the best breed ever.I live in Lagos , 9ja .. <p> Oct 04 , 2010Rating <p> pack of liesby : Gbolahan <p> I have two adult and three months old rottweilers , have had the two adult for five years and they have never bitten anybody including my children and I also live in nigeria , my email I can advice you . gbolexk@yahoo.com 152137 @qwx562137

They 're heads and paws are big , their joints are knobbly , they 're heavier and bigger than they think they are .... it all leads to tripping , falling , stumbling , running headlong into things . Pretty normal . <p> However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legs seem weak , if he seems disoriented or you are worried he may have trouble with his vision , balance or whatever , then I 'd go back to your vet and ask for a through check up to make sure all is well .

@@50394215 @3894215/ <h> Shy , Skittish , Fearful , 9 month old Rottie Bitch what 's going on ? <p> by K Majestic ( NY ) <p> Hello- We purchased our rottweiler Nora at 11 weeks old she was the last pup the breeder had and all her litter mates had been sold the week prior . She was kept in a kennel near her parents . She seemed timid at first but within a minute she was licking our hands and what i would consider a normal playful pup . I met both the bitch and the dog both eager and friendly.The bitch was imported from Germany with impeccable lines including Holzmicheal and Benno . She is extremely Well bred . <p> She was very skittish of loud noises and not warm with strangers as a pup. we enrolled in puppy classes which she did well in. she is crate training very smart and eager to work . <p> I own a business and i would bring her with me once a week . she was never comfortable around people and customers but she did start to come around as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paw and receiving a treat from strangers . but as soon as people went to pet she would slink or run away . Also if a stranger does a sudden movement she runs off . she growls if people continue to approach . or will growl if she feels cornered. i have since stopped bringing her in to the store . <p> Out in public she is happy and fine as long as she is ignored by everyone . same in the store . but as soon as a person goes oh look a puppy and approaches she gets on the defense . <p> She is an amazing family dog and an absolute mush who loves all children . she has a low prey drive and enjoys the company of cats . very bidding and obedient everything a rotti should be minus the stranger danger . <p> We had hopes of Breeding Nora but this has put a glitch in the plans . Any advise ? <p> She is now 9 months old . She is calm and playful with dogs and gentle with children . An amazing girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so wondering if the leary of strangers aspect of her personality is how she has been breed . unfortunately i did not see her brothers she was the only female in the liter so no point of reference . but it was her Bitches 5th Litter with the same Dog . <p> Any advise or training tips ? <p> Hi there . I 'm so sorry that somehow this submission slid in under my radar , so this is very late response on my part : ( <p> By now you have another couple of months under your belt with Nora , and as she 's an adolescent I wonder if this has been positive or negative in terms of her behavior . <p> It definitely sounds as though Nora has great temperament in general , just the fearful behavior as the kink in the works . She is a beautiful girl and it seems to be well bred , however I would guess that her fearfulness is a genetic trait as it does n't sound as though there have been situations in her short life which would produce this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed friendly and outgoing , it 's possible for them to pass on a tendency for anxiety which ' skipped ' them as individuals . Shutzhund requires strength of character , courage and the willingness to be very ' mouthy ' . Lines bred for these qualities are generally bold and often have a tendency to be nippy . However , there 's always a flip-side to emotions and fearful or anxious behavior can occur . <p> Ongoing positive socialization is vital for pups and dogs like Nora . If she does n't get this then she will become more scared and anxious , and eventually more defensive around unfamiliar people and situations . It 's obviously not as easy to socialize a fearful dog as it is to socialize an outgoing one , but it 's even more important . You have done a great job so far of giving her what she needs and continuing with the obedience training would be a positive move . With her intelligence and breeding she will likely excel , probably all the way up to competition level .. and this will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice on dealing with issues or behavior . <p> Have you talked to Nora 's breeder about this at all ? Good breeders ( and if her bloodlines are excellent and her parents were properly health-tested , then they should be ) know their dogs very well and are usually more than happy to give any amount of help , advice and suggestions to owners of their puppies . I would suggest that as a place to start . <p> Adolescence is a challenging time for pups , and Nora may show enhanced anxiety or defensiveness during this time . Especially as the guarding instinct starts to surface somewhere in this period . Most puppies are unsure what to do with those feelings at first . <p> You may also want to bring in the help of a dog trainer/behaviorist on a one-on-one basis to evaluate her and give suggestions or practical help that will boost her self-confidence . <p> She is overall a wonderful family member and her breeding , and your care and upbringing of her , are top notch .

Best of luck to you all .. and again , my apologies for being so late to reply . Sue <p> Hey Sue , Thanks ! Nora is now 11 months and is getting better .

I do n't know what to do . <p> He is healthy , fifty pounds , great coat and tons of energy . I have been feeding him ' Canadian Naturals ' I was told it 's a great food and aside from this one problem things are normal . I had him checked by a vet when I got him and he 's clean of any bugs .

Do you have a food that you would recommend ? <p> Thanks . <p> Take care . <p> HiIt 's not normal for a pup to have so many bowel movements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vet for a check up first of all . Although he did n't have worms/parasites when you first got him , he could have them now . Coccidiosis is fairly common in puppies after any sort of stressful event - such as coming into a new home - and it could be that your pup has these parasites . <p> However , it could also be that he is sensitive ( or even allergic ) to an ingredient/ingredients in the food you are using . Just because a food is a ' good ' one , that does n't mean that a pup ca n't have a sensitivity to a particular component , it just makes it less likely . <p> I 'd recommend trying one of the foods that you 'll see on my Hypoallergenic Dog Food page as these are less likely to cause problems . However , it will take about 6 weeks or more before you will be able to evaluate whether or not there is an improvement . <p> Hope this helps , best of luck . <h> Comments for My rottie is taking lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar issues , and I kept feeding her super premium dog foods .

Sudden behavioral changes like this can be caused by physical conditions which are causing pain or discomfort and the pup reacts by becoming snappy and irritable . <p> If he gets a 100% clean bill of health , then his behavior is probably due to the fact that he 's an adolescent male and is trying to exert his ' authority ' on those around him . It 's a natural behavior but needs to be controlled and corrected by you and your family . At this age he needs to know that you are in charge , and to have firm limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenager ! ) . <p> Rotties do n't respond well to harsh or punitive corrections or training and need reward-based methods and loving , but firm , discipline . If you do n't already have your pup in formal obedience classes the I strongly recommend that you get him enrolled as soon as you can . It sounds as though you need some ' hands on ' help to understand and control his behavior . <p> What you are seeing is n't necessarily ' aggressive or vicious ' behavior , it 's more an acting-out and attempts at dominance . Do n't allow him to control your actions or behavior with his , as that will only reinforce the problem - after all if it works , he 'll keep doing it ! <p> I 'd recommend checking out some of the books on Rottweiler Training that I have on my Rottweiler Books page as they will be able to point you in the right direction , but I believe you 'll do better with some ' hands-on ' help from an obedience instructor as well . <p> This type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog ' , it just shows that he has n't had enough training , or been socialized enough yet , plus he 's questioning who is the ' alpha ' in his pack . You need that alpha to be YOU , and you need to give him the opportunity to learn what is okay and what is n't . Be loving , consistent and patient in teaching him and he will outgrow this stage and develop into the dog he was meant to be . 152137 @qwx562137

It 's not that you ca n't play tug-of-war with ANY puppy or dog , just that with many of them it 's not advisable for the very reasons you 've discovered . <p> Any dog who is extremely self-confident or has any ' alpha ' tendencies should n't play this game ( even if they 're a tiny breed ! ) , and it 's not recommended for large breed dogs particularly those in the ' guardian ' category , or breeds that naturally tend to be very mouthy or nippy ( such as herding dogs ) . <p> There are two main reasons for this . One , because this type of play encourages a puppy to use his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human hand , it can make the normal puppy ' nippiness ' worse and let them think that trying to snatch ( or pull ) something from your hand is okay . But it 's not . <p> Two , because it encourages a puppy to work against his owner and to resist something he/she is trying to do ( ie pull the tug toy from his mouth , or ' win ' ) . The pup does n't distinguish between play and reality and when he ' wins ' then it gives him a false sense of his own strength and superiority , which can transfer over into other areas . <p> Any aggressive tendencies usually stem from one , or both , of these scenarios . You do n't want a pup ( or dog ) to think that they can beat you at anything , that they 're stronger than you , or that it 's okay for them to use their mouth near your hands , or on something you are holding . <p> If you absolutely want to play this type of game then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> make sure you win more than your pup does <p> YOU decide when the game ends , and when it does you let your pup ' win ' that round , then have him give you the toy in exchange for a treat , and you put the toy away out of sight . <p> teach your pup the ' leave it ' command so that you can get him to drop any toy ( or any other object ) at your command .

You can find out more about separation anxiety and how to handle it here .. Separation Anxiety In Your Dog . <p> If you do n't think this is the issue and your Rottie seems quite happy in her crate , but continues to urinate there it could simply be that it 's become a habit . If you 're not using an enzymatic type cleaner to remove all traces of the scent of her previous ' accidents ' that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crate that is too big ( see my Puppy Crate Training page for more on this ) can encourage a pup to eliminate in it .

We also spoke to many breeders , specifically ones that breed large , XL , and giants . After all our research and hearing what most breeders had to say , it all made sense . When you neuter a dog , you take away the necessary hormones they need to grow . And when you do so to a dog that grows from 12 lbs to 100 lbs in 12 months , it becomes even more dangerous . There is no doubt in my mind that getting Kuma neutered and especially so young , played a huge role , if not being the cause of his CCLD . AND , I would say that it actually stunted his growth . His mother was just over 120 and his dad was 155 ( a German ) . Kuma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wanted your dog to get another dog pregnant or become pregnant , there really is no good reason to neuter your dog .

He is not neutered , weighs 100 lb , is the sweetest dog you 'll ever meet , and is in excellent health . He 's never been aggressive to any other dogs , or people , not even kids . We give him chewable vitamin C and MSM every day to help his joint growth and make sure he gets plenty of exercise but no running .

We 've had nothing but joy from her and all who knew her loved her . <p> With her history it was always in the back of our minds that she could become i 'll at any time but her mannerisms were such that she seemed the picture of health and remained playful like a puppy . <p> Unfortunately I 'm writing this with a heavy heart because our beloved Katrina died suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2014 . <p> We 're so blessed to have had her in our lives these past years . Both Trinity and Katrina demonstrated the amazing characteristics ( smart , sweet , loving , loyal , and the list goes on ) of the Rottweiler breed . <p> I just wanted to write this as a tribute to both Katrina and Trinity . <p> We so miss them ! <p> What a beautiful tribute to pets who were so loved , so precious .... and so lucky to find a loving forever home with your family . <p> I 'm so very sorry for your losses . <p> I hope that the knowledge that Trinity , Katrina , Stud and Texas were able to know years of love and kindness because of you , helps to ease the pain a little . And that you can remember them with less pain as time passes . 152137 @qwx562137

@@50394244 @3894244/ <h> My rottie has behavior issues <p> by Carleen ( Los Angeles county ) <p> Hello my husband and I have a 1 1/2 year old Rottie . He 's never been trained . Just Sit , down and stay . He 's a good dog , but I think he has a dominance problem . <p> He is very submissive to my husband and my 17 year old son . He does have the tendency to push the envelope with me . I am firm , with him , but sometimes he just wants to play and his play is jumping on me . I feel that is very disrespectful . He wo n't do it with my husband around , but will do it when i 'm alone . <p> He also has a problem with any stranger . He does n't lunge or bite , but he has trust issues with strangers . When my husband walks him , he does n't have a problem with other dogs , he 's usually very curious , if someone gets close to him he is fine , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone comes close to him at home , or if someone tries to touch him , he immediately tries to jump on them , almost like hold on to them . <p> I understand that when a dog tries to hug your leg , or something to that effect , it reflects dominance or aggression . So as you can imagine I avoid him being alone around strangers . He also has a barking problem . My neighbor has 4 dogs . When they come out , he barks like crazy , he starts whimpering , and just barks . They have never met or been around each other , so I 'm wondering if they meet will his behavior change ? There are other dogs other neighbors have on the other side , but he does n't react to them the same way . <p> I 'm hesitant to take him to trainer , because I just do n't know if he 's too old to be trained . I did n't socialize him when he was pup because I was told that he needed to get all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a huge 6 month old rottie , and these behavior where already peaking . <p> Can you give me some advise on how to go about this ? Also can I crate him at this age also ? I never have . <p> Hi CarleenWow , lots of questions ... I will do my best to answer them all , but apologies if I miss anything ! <p> First of all , it sounds as though your Rottie has a basically sound temperament , but is going through the very challenging adolescent stage . His behavior is very normal for that period of development , but he also has some additional issues which are likely due to a lack of training and socialization . <p> The good news is that he is still a pup and plenty young enough to learn more appropriate behavior . I would strongly recommend that you get him enrolled in a basic obedience class with a professional dog obedience trainer . Do pick one who is familiar with large , guardian breeds and who only trains with positive reinforcement ( ie uses praise/treats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trainers still maintain an ' old school ' attitude to this type of breed and train too harshly , which is counter-productive . <p> You are right that his behavior towards you is a dominant one , he is the equivalent of a human teenager right now and he 's trying to find his place in your family . He is pushing the boundaries and testing the limits - normal behavior . However , you need to make sure he understands that YOU are superior to him in terms of authority . He already recognizes your husband and son as being higher up the pecking order than he is , so you 're the ' weakest link ' as it were . <p> In order to show him that you are in charge I 'd recommend making sure that you are responsible for feeding , walking , grooming and training him from now on ( and until he 's more mature and has accepted your authority completely ) . Dogs respect whoever controls the resources of life and the biggest one of these if food . <p> Make him ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playtimes . You can do this by asking him to ' sit ' and making sure he obeys before putting down his food bowl , giving him a toy , or taking him for a walk . I 'd also recommend hand-feeding him at least one meal a day for the next few weeks . It shows him very directly that you are his superior and also helps to build a bond between you . There is advice about doing this on my Dog Food Aggression page . It would be a good idea to follow ALL the tips on that page too and make sure that your pup is totally accepting of you around his foodbowl/toys etc . <p> His attitude around strangers and other dogs is also pretty normal for a pup who has n't been socialized much . He 's unsure of himself and what is expected of him , plus he 's got his natural guarding instincts that are immature and confusing to him . He needs guidance from you and your family as you are his pack leaders . The more calm and confident you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this point it 's important for you all to get some professional help to learn how to handle his insecurities and behavior , as he is relying on you to lead him . It 's much easier to do this with hands-on help and advice , than it is to just read about it . A professional trainer will give you all the input you need and help with specific issues that exist , or may arise later on . <p> At 1 1/2 years old your Rottie is just a pup and he will be a much happier and better behaved adult if he gets the proper guidance and training now . THAT will make you all happier and less stressed so it 's a win-win situation . <p> Hope this has helped , I wish you all lots of luck . <h> Comments for My rottie has behavior issues <p> My female rottie is 11mos old.She was 8 weeks when i bought her.When she came home she slept in bed with me . and she started growling and getting in my face as to bite me.so i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filed she goes throught so much stress.They have to do her nails in two days.She gets so stressed she foams at mouth and trys to bite.She bit me today after she was getting nails done.she does want me around her food or toys.When i got her she was smallest and last pup.She was born in shed outdoors.She can be lieing down chewing rawhide and start growlling at me.She wo n't drink out of bowls.I have to get a pail of water and hold it for her.But she will drink muddy water outside.Shes a good girl.She has issues.I not real mobile.i got her for protection.But this is too much.Please give me some advice.Thanks <p> May 14 , 2016Rating <p> rottweilerNEWby : charlene Manley <p> My female rottie is 11mos old.She was 8 weeks when i bought her.When she came home she slept in bed with me . and she started growling and getting in my face as to bite me.so i stop that.Now when she goes to get nails cut and filed she goes throught so much stress.They have to do her nails in two days.She gets so stressed she foams at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was getting nails done.she does want me around her food or toys.When i got her she was smallest and last pup.She was born in shed outdoors.She can be lieing down chewing rawhide and start growlling at me.She wo n't drink out of bowls.I have to get a pail of water and hold it for her.But she will drink muddy water outside.Shes a good girl.She has issues.I not real mobile.i got her for protection.But this is too much.Please give me some advice.Thanks 152137 @qwx562137

@@50394248 @3894248/ <h> A Rottweiler Challenging his/her owner ? <p> You mentioned on your web site that a Rottweiler will challenge its ' owner ( and may therefore not be suitable for first time owners , etc ) . <p> Can you give some examples of a Rottweiler challenging its owner and how best to deal with them ? <p> HiAlthough many Rottweilers will ' challenge ' their owners as they grow and mature , so do the pups of many other breeds as well . It 's a developmental stage , very similar to that of human teenagers who challenge their parents during adolescence . <p> Because Rotties grow into big , strong dogs , who are very intelligent and inclined to be stubborn at times , it 's important that their owners be able to handle them physically ( ie walking them , moving them off furniture and so on ) and that they are confident enough to project an aura of ' leadership ' so that the dog has confidence in them and obeys . <p> It 's difficult to give very specific examples as all dogs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive pulling on the leash ( or stopping dead to sniff around etc. ) instead of walking to heel . Or it could be food-guarding ( or toy guarding etc. ) , or the dog could suddenly decide that they want to sleep on the bed when they 've previously not been allowed to , or refuse to get off their owners lazy-boy when told to ..... the possibilities are pretty wide ! <p> Sometimes the dog will just become ' dead weight ' and passively refuse to do something , other times they may growl or even snap at their owner , again this often happens with many , many adolescent pups of ALL breeds , and it 's not a Rottie-specific trait . However , with a small dog this behavior is often easier to deal with and seen as less threatening , in a large-breed pup it needs an owner who wo n't back down and who can physically move the dog if necessary . <p> However , do remember that Rottweilers do n't need harsh , punitive or ' heavy-handed ' discipline , they 're very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving corrections are much more successful . Being combative or aggressive with a Rottweiler will usually just backfire as the dog will become stubborn and may even become belligerent in response .

It may be a ' possessive ' behavior ( ie he thinks you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions you and your wife are generating make him anxious and unsettled . Or , most likely , it 's a bit of both . <p> You 'll need to be patient with Beemer on this . Correct him by gently telling him ' no ' if he gets between you or gets pushy with your wife . Do n't allow him to control your behavior . <p> It might also help to make your most lengthy and amorous behavior private - in terms of keeping Beemer out of the room . If he sleeps in your bedroom perhaps it would be better to start him off sleeping elsewhere regularly - a comfy bed in the kitchen for example . This way he wo n't feel ' banished ' . Every kiss or hug should n't have to take place out of his sight though , he needs to get used to some affection being shown . <p> If he seems anxious in general ( and rescue dogs sometimes are , even a long time after they 've been in their forever home ) I 'd recommend getting him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Amazon , probably in your local petstores too ) . These work in a totally natural way to reduce anxiety or fear in a dog . We use them for separation anxiety , stress caused by a house-move , when we bring a new puppy or dog into the home , and so on . They 're often very effective . I think you might find wearing one would help Beemer feel less stressed . <p> They do take about 24 - 48 hours to start working , so not immediate response , but worth the wait . <p> I 'd also recommend that you make sure your wife is involved in Beemer 's day to day care . He needs to see her as his ' alpha ' as well , and to recognize that both the humans in his family are higher up in the ' pecking order ' than he is . Having her take turns to feed , train and groom him will help with this . 152137 @qwx562137

When she is laying down getting ready to go to sleep or already asleep , and we or our other dog lay beside her or even touch her she growls and shows her teeth , sometimes she even snaps at our other dog . <p> I 'm not sure how well she was taken care of in her previous home because if you even raise you voice at her she acts and sounds as if you beat her half to death . <p> Any advice and opinions would be greatly appreciated . I refuse to get rid of her she is our baby . We just want to help her . <p> HiAt 9 weeks old your puppy is a tiny baby , and it 's only in extremely rare cases that you see true aggression at this age . Any growling or snapping is more likely to be a normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that makes her scared or uncomfortable . <p> The way your little girl reacts to a raised voice indicates that she 's either a pretty nervous puppy , or has maybe been treated a little too roughly previously . I really hesitate to be guess at how a puppy has been treated in an earlier home , or by a breeder , because it 's too easy to assume that a puppy who acts scared , or hates men etc. etc. has been mistreated . Often it 's simply that the pup has a naturally anxious personality inherited from her parents genetically , or learned by watching an anxious momma dog for example . But occasionally of course there has been a problem with the way a puppy has been cared for . <p> Regardless , your pup needs to learn that she should n't be afraid or scared of you but you should never raise your voice , or your hand , to a puppy . That will only teach her to fear you ( and rightly so ) and will make building a relationship of love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is likely to react to this sort of treatment with stubborn defiance - adult Rottweilers do not respond well to an ' in your face ' attitude or treatment . <p> She does need to learn that she must not growl or snap at anyone , and this is taught through constant firm , but loving , corrections . I 'd recommend checking out my stop puppy biting and taking care of a puppy pages for tips and advice on helping her learn the correct behavior . <p> She will need lots of love and attention , and also plenty of ongoing socialization to help build her self-confidence and the bond between you . She 's not a ' bad ' puppy and definitely there 's absolutely no reason to think that she needs to be found another home or anything like that . Raising puppies is like raising children and there are always going to be challenges , phases and stages they go through , and so on ... but the relationship is for keeps . Normal puppy behavior can often be misinterpreted by new owners , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more suspicion than many others . <p> I 'd also suggest getting her enrolled in a formal obedience class for puppies as soon as she 's had all her puppy vaccinations - it will benefit all of you . 152137 @qwx562137

It 's very similar to the behavior you see in human tweens and teens - they 're trying to figure out who they are and to become more independent . <p> And .. in the same way we parents continue to set rules and boundaries ( and to enforce them ) for our teenage children , we need to do the same thing for our canine children ! Rottweilers are by nature strong-willed and highly intelligent , but they are also eager to please and very trainable . It 's important that you put a stop to this ' bossy ' behavior right away because you do n't want it to become a habit , or for your pup to get the impression that he is in charge . <p> First of all , make some very basic changes to what your pup is allowed to do . Do not let him get up on beds or furniture , or lie in doorways or passages to block them , or go through doors before you , or lie on your feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet or winding around you , or jump up on you etc. etc . These are all ways in which dogs try to assert their authority or superiority , and your pup should n't have either . <p> I 'd recommend checking out my Free Puppy Training Tips page and making sure that your pup is well-trained in these areas . He should obey you quickly and without question . Pay particular attention to the ' Leave It ' command , and work with him daily until you can take anything from him without complaint - this is very important . <p> Also , read my Dog Food Aggression page and follow the guidelines there . Even if he is n't showing signs of this right now , it is probably not far down the road . You need to be able to control ALL his resources without him complaining , that will show he respects your authority and is vital . <p> Rotties are very smart , and fair-minded , and do n't respond well to harsh or punitive training methods , so always use positive reinforcement and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving him a shake by the scruff , you will need to stand your ground , but do n't be rough with him . A quick , firm shake and a verbal ' No ' are enough , and then either redirect his attention to something he IS allowed to have/do , or if he continues to resist and complain , give him a ' time out ' in his crate for 15 minutes and ignore him . Losing your attention and interaction is a big punishment to a puppy and at this age a time out in his crate should n't affect his housebreaking at all . <p> Make sure that you enforce your house rules firmly , but lovingly , and that everyone does the same . A pup can get very confused , and anxious , if he 's allowed to do something one day , and corrected for it the next . Or if different family members have different rules for him . <p> This is a stage your Rottie is going through , and it will end , but it can be trying none the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-behaved he is as an adult , and given the speed or growth and the eventual adult size of this breed , it 's important to get it right . Just be patient and consistent and firm with your boy and he will learn what is expected of him . <p> It 's highly recommended to get a puppy into at least one basic obedience class so that he can get some formal training and you can both benefit from the experience of a professional trainer . Some hands-on help can often make all the different and the socialization is an added benefit for your pup . If he 's not already enrolled in a class I think getting him into one would be very beneficial for you both . <p> One more thing ... never back off from doing something if he complains about it . If you do this he will see that a growl can control your behavior or actions and that is not what you want . If after several weeks of following these suggestions you do n't see improvement , or you are concerned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone ( very rare , but it CAN happen ) , then I strongly suggest that you find a dog behavioral specialist to help you assess his behavior and help you deal with it effectively . <p> Do n't over-react because he 's a Rottie , but do n't ' under-react ' either , take steps to eliminate this behavior now so that he can grow up to be the best he can be .

I would like to share my experience I had today at the park which almost cost me my girls life .. I am not exaggerating and hope this gets around to all dog owners &amp; lovers in Nanaimo and everywhere . <p> Angel was wearing her chain collar and as we were about to leave her friend , a Pyrenees came and wanted her to stay and play .. I always tend to remove her collar and at this point it was on .. They ran off to play and I did think about removing it but figured since we will be leaving in a few minutes .. no big deal .. Well that decision almost cost me her life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight and as I and others were running over I knew immediately that the Pyrenees ' mouth was caught in her chain .. Of course as he tried to free himself the bouncing and twisting of it was choking her out ! ! The more they tried to separate the tighter the chain was getting .. I tried ' flicking ' it off his teeth and well we all know what injuries that can lead to . As my Angel was laying on the ground with her eyes starting to look confused and empty I envisioned her dying right then and there and somehow I found the strength to bear hug the Pyrenees and wrap my arms and legs around him while on my back and some ' hero ' came out of nowhere and I ca n't honestly tell you how he managed to free his jaw from the chain . <p> The whole incident was less then 2 minutes . Angel did exhibit some signs of shock when I got her home but is fine .. The Pyrenees to my knowledge did not lose his canine or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more when I can get back to the park . Of course that wo n't be until my injuries heal .... My right middle finger was almost amputated at the first knuckle and my index finger was torn . Both required stitches and at this point the extent of the damage is not known . My left hand has several puncture wounds and not much could be done for that . I can only say that the injuries I sustained were , to me , a small sacrifice in saving my dogs life and her friends teeth . <p> I would love to thank the gentleman who helped us , I 'm not sure where he came from , and all the others in the park today .... from the person who held Angel while I tried washing away the blood , to the lady holding the tap on for me , to the one who called my husband for help and the one who locked up my car for me and gave me her roll of paper towel .... I thank you all from the bottom of my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got through this situation and have my baby here with me still . <p> I will be getting in touch with animal control to report this and find out what I can do toward having these type of collars preferable banned from being worn at dog parks . This type of situation possibly happening was discussed on many occasions by many at the park which is why I always remove her collar when we visit . However this is a perfect example of how it can only take a minute for the worst to happen .. <p> I PROMISE you will never see Angel wearing this type of collar/chain again ever ! ! ! <p> Judy &amp; Angel ... <p> UPDATE : I received a call from the dogs ( Deuce ) owner and I am so glad to say that he did not lose any teeth and has also recovered fine .. Now my turn ... <p> Thanks for sharing this frightening story Judy . It 's definitely one that every dog owner should hear ! <p> I do want to point out here that chain or prong collars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) have a useful function and are safe to use for walking or training your Rottweiler . I always use prong collars in both of these situations . <p> BUT the risk factor for accidental injury or even death is there if you allow your dog to wear this type of collar at any other time . <p> From Judy 's story it 's easy to see how even a couple of minute playing with a friend could easily have had tragic consequences . Your pup or dog does n't even have to be with another dog to be in danger though ..... if a collar like this gets caught on something he could choke to death within minutes . <p> Please NEVER allow your dog to wear a chain collar ( of any type ) when playing with other dogs , or even when he 's at home , in his crate etc . Save them for walking and training only , when you 're right there to supervise . <p> If you 've never considered the dangers before , I hope Judy 's experience will give you reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angel survived her terrifying experience , and I hope that Judy 's fingers heal 100% If by sharing her story even one pet can be saved from injury or death caused by a chain collar then the experience wo n't be for nothing . <p> Sue from **25;433;TOOLONG <p> Update ....

They are both fine now . <p> Since then we only keep collars incase we leave the property . But they have been wearing chains . <p> I never had a problem with the chains but will be discussing with my husband about taking the off when at home . <p> Feb 04 , 2013Rating <p> Victory update ! ! ! NEWby : Judy &amp; Angel <p> Apologies it took me so long to give an update .. On Oct 27 2012 we were victorious in our goal.Collars with chain attachment must now be removed prior to entering the ENCLOSED off-leashed dog parks here in Nanaimo BC.That is choke , martingale and prong type collars.While we have met very little resistance to the new rule , contrary to the comment posted in the link , it is working out great.Few enter but with the community standing together raising awareness to the new rule and sharing education as to why it was implemented all understand and remove the collars.Many come from other areas and are not aware of the changes but are grateful as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park regularly and speaks to people about the new rule if they see it being violated but at this point it is all about awareness , education of the dangers and sharing the changes implemented.Animal Control has stated very clearly that fines will be imposed if they encounter repeat offenders as it would be a blatant disregard for the dogs safety .. I am so fortunate to have my girl , Angel , with me here today and am proud of the community standing together and giving me the strength and courage to fight for this change.I would like to thank the 300+ people who signed my petition and the training experts who contributed and helped me make the enclosed off-leash dog parks here in Nanaimo a safer place to meet , play and ultimately go home alive and uninjured due to the dangers of training collar in play areas .. Hope other comunities will follow and we have set a precedent .. Here is a link to the article after the decision .. <p> I have been in front of our Parks , Recreation , and Culture Commission here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that it was passed for second reading.I am only saddened that the other owner did not stay on board and get this implemented with me.It would have been an honour to do it on behalf of both the dogs involved .. It was the love for my girl and her furry friends that gave me the strength to keep the fight going.I will be hosting a ' wagging ' party to celebrate in mid Oct when this gets passed as I am confident it will .. weiner bobbing contest and all .. lol .. Can not wait to have a safe place for the canines to meet and go home uninjured and most important ALIVE ! ! Will update in Oct sometime .. arf ! arf ! <p> Jul 17 , 2012Rating <p> Memory fails us .. NEWby : Judy <p> Well I will be the 1st to say I do not recall the EXACT things that happened.When one is in survival mode to save their dogs life , memory does fail .. I do remember clearly it was what sounded like a ' vicious ' fight that got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as each dog was crying , yelping and obviously very scared and possibly in pain .... I have since learned that the media does ' creative ' editing and have since spoke with you regarding this , IF I have correct who the poster is .. Minor facts as to whether I was re-entering or leaving to me is irrelevant .. What is important is neither dog is traumatized by this tragic ordeal and that I can share my story and prevent this from happening to others .. I am only grateful that it was the dog it was as any other dog may have had a different out come and my girl Angel may not be here .. My goal is to bring attention to these type of training tools and there proper use which clearly is NOT in a play area .. The dogs have since met up and are fine .. I have met my hero and have had a chance to thank him .. FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART .. for his kind act of getting involved .. Again without him I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to defend my stupidy on this sight or any other for using a chain collar and being naive to the dangers.I will say that I will do anything to bring expose to the dangers of the collars and try my best to have them banned from ENCLOSED dog park play areas in my community.We currently only have ( 1 ) one and I do n't think that is to much to ask for .. One safe place to play .. If it only saves one dogs life and educates many my goal has been achieved ..

I know how terrifying it was . I was right there . I do n't agree with some of the things you said about this incident , but nevertheless , it 's just about these " choke chains .

If they were approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them or give them permission , then Roxy may have felt that they were a threat and so she was protecting her territory . <p> At this age she 's an adolescent and her guarding instincts are just starting to surface , many pups are not sure what to do with these strange feelings and tend to over-react rather than under-react ! You will need to make sure you are always with her when people come into your home so that you can show her that they are friends and allowed in , and correct any attempts she makes to ' guard ' . <p> If she 's not familiar with people visiting , or well socialized with other people or pets then I 'd recommend starting work on that right away . Also enroll her in a basic obedience class so that you can get some hands-on help with training and become more comfortable correcting her and get a better understanding of her behavior . <p> Rottweilers rarely get second chances if they make a mistake ( whereas a chihuahua who growls and nips a visitors ankles will likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you MUST take action here to ensure that Roxy learns what is acceptable behavior . <p> In my opinion Rottie owners have an extra responsibility in that they have to protect not just their own dog , but the breed as a whole - and to do that we need to ensure our dogs behave in a way that is admirable , not nerve-wracking . 152137 @qwx562137

She has been cage trained since she was 8 weeks old &amp; has never been to the toilet in there ( she was house trained within around 2 weeks ) , she never howls when she is left alone &amp; all in all she is a very well behaved &amp; friendly dog . <p> I 'm not completely sure as to how long we should be walking her though . Bella gets plenty of playtime in the garden &amp; house but for most of the day she is in her cage as me &amp; my wife both work . My wife comes home every lunch time &amp; spends an hour with her . We just do n't want to walk her too much as we know it can cause problems with their joints . <p> Also we 're a little concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14.4kg at the moment . She is on a good brand of food which was recommended by the vet ( Royal Canin ) as this is high in nutrients etc . <p> Hi PaulIt sounds as though your pup is doing very well overall , Rotties learn very fast and are , in my experience , actually one of the easiest breeds to raise and train as long as they get lots of love and attention plus consistent and loving discipline and enough socialization . <p> Seems as though you 're doing everything right so far , great job ! <p> Bella looks lovely , and from the photos she does n't look underweight even though she 's below average in terms of weight for her age . Of course there is no such thing as an ' average pup ' they 're all different , and genetics play the greatest role in the eventual size/weight of a puppy . Diet and overall health are important too , but make less impact than genes . <p> Her bone size is probably in perfect harmony with her weight which is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just not a huge Rottie . They were not originally bred to be giant dogs . The food you are using is a good brand and if it suits Bella then I 'd keep her on it . <p> Keeping a pup lean is much better for growing joints and ligaments , as is keeping her exercise level moderate . Once she 's fully mature ( anywhere from 18 months to 2 1/2 years for most females ) she can afford to be more energetic and jog with you etc . For now I 'd say a daily walk of about 1 mile is fine , you could even go a mile and a half or so , but do n't overdo it yet . Games in the yard , hikes in the woods , visits to the park etc. are all good too and should be regular occurrences . <p> The biggest thing with these pups is to have patience and not try to rush their growth/maturity ( either mental or physical ) . Every pup is different and will grow or mature at a different rate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . As long as Bella is happy , healthy and active do n't worry about , she 's doing just fine . 152137 @qwx562137

BUT I do n't free feed ( basically leaving a food bowl down all day ) and just I feed them once a day only at this age . Most dogs will eat what they need . <p> The higher quality foods are much more dense in terms of nutritional value and therefore a dog needs to eat less of a premium food to feel satisfied , and to get the nutrition he needs . This also cuts down on waste products which come out the other end ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average weight for a young adult , if he has a big frame and heavy bones he may add another 10lbs before he 's finished growing . However , you do want to keep him on the ' lean ' side rather than carrying too much weigh as that can adversely affect his bones/joints . Have your vet check him out so that you know whether he 's about where he should be in terms of weight for his size . <p> Exercise is also important to help build muscles and prevent excess weight . Do n't overdo it though as dogs do n't need to diet and exercise to lose weight ! Just make sure he has at least two daily walks or active play sessions each day . 152137 @qwx562137

Doctors said her body need zinc . <p> What should i do ? Please help me . <p> Thanks and Regards , dev <p> Hi DevYou can check out my Rottweiler Breed Standard for more information on the optimum weight/height for adult Rottweilers - according to both the AKC and ADRK breed standards . <p> An adult female should ideally be be between 22 and 25 inches in height ( at the withers ) and as your pup is now 11 months old she 's probably pretty much on track . She will reach her full height a while before she reaches her full weight . <p> As for the white hairs in her coat , I 'm not a veterinarian and your vet is obviously the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of coat color changes ( or hygromas ) being due to a zinc deficiency . Normally signs of this would include hair loss , scaly skin around the eyes , nose on the pads and maybe on the legs/body as well , plus a dull and lifeless coat . If she 's being fed a high quality diet there 's no reason for her to need additional zinc that I can see . <p> The hygroma is probably caused by her sleeping on a hard surface and the resulting pressure on her joints causes either a hygroma or a callus . This is common in large and giant breeds who spend a lot of time on a hard surface , and is usually seen on the elbows . Giving her a more comfortable place to sleep , or encouraging her to use her dog bed rather than the tile floor is the best thing to do . If the hygroma becomes very large or infected your veterinarian can treat it for her . <p> If her coat is turning white all over her body , and her nails/paws/nose are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition called Vitiligo . It 's pretty rare in Rottweilers but can happen and it may be a genetic or hereditary problem . There 's not a lot of documentation or research to study on this but it seems that it can be triggered , or at least made worse , but injury , stress or illness . It 's a loss of skin pigmentation and as far as I know there 's no real ' cure ' . <p> Copper supplementation and other vitamins may help , but it 's important to discuss this with your vet as too much of anything can be dangerous , including vitamins . Although it does n't look very pretty , generally Vitiligo is n't dangerous to a dog 's overall health and hopefully your girl is healthy otherwise . <p> Of course , it could be another condition entirely , but only your vet can really make an accurate diagnosis . 152137 @qwx562137

True , purebred Red Rotties are very rare ! <p> You can definitely see in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looks like such a sweetheart too - typical Rottie grin : ) <p> I also explain that these rare color-ways sometimes produce dogs with more health problems than the accepted black-and-tan dogs , are not eligible to be shown , and do n't fit the breed standard .

We spend at least 4-5 hours with him a day bonding . <p> Thanks , Jay <p> Hi JayYour pup is an adolescent and this is typically when their behavior becomes more challenging , but with enough exercise , socialization and correct/ongoing training he will come through this phase unscathed , and so will you ! <p> If he 's being left alone for hours at a time then he 's simply displaying his excitement and joy at seeing you again . Rottweilers need regular companionship and can become very emotionally attached to their owners . <p> It 's perfectly normal for him to be happy to see you , but it 's not okay for him to jump all over you or behave like a wild thing . To control this you need to be working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him enrolled in a formal obedience class as soon as possible . It 's much easier to learn something when you 're being shown how to do it , than from written advice . In this case you need to learn how to get your pup to respect and listen to you , and to look to you for guidance on his behavior . <p> Reprimanding him from jumping with a firm ' no ' is obviously important but you will need some hands on help and ideas on how to teach him this is not okay . It sounds as though he may be suffering from a little separation anxiety which makes him overreact when he sees you . Lowering the emotional level of your homecomings may help with this ( ie ignore him for a few minutes when you come in , do n't make eye contact and do n't make a big fuss of him ) this will allow him to rein in some of his excitement before you greet him calmly . You can check out this webpage for more information on dealing with canine separation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the info . should be helpful to you . <p> Also , he needs lots of exercise to help burn off that nervous energy and plenty of safe , sturdy chew toys to keep him busy while you 're gone . Getting him a place at a doggie daycare , employing a pet sitter or a dog walker to give him a break/exercise while you 're gone , or other similar ideas may also help . As he matures and gets some training under his belt he will settle down . Adult Rotties are generally not high-energy dogs . 152137 @qwx562137

@@50394308 @3894308/ <p> Hi RamyaRottweilers are not vicious , mean or dangerous dogs if they 've been properly bred and raised . In fact they are extremely loyal and loving , while also being protective of their family . <p> However , they do need an experienced dog owner , or one who is willing to take the time to learn about the breed , and raise them properly .

We socialized him a lot at dog parks up until he was about a 1 1/2 yrs old when we moved to an area where there were no dog parks . He house-trained amazingly quick as a pup ... and never goes in the house ( unless he gets sick ) . He has never showed any destructive behavior either with the exception of chewing one of those " egg-crate " mattresses we had given him to sleep on and a comforter once ... but he was still young , less than 1 yr old , and never since . He is neutered . He is loving to the point of almost annoying , lol . <p> However , there have been some odd behavior changes lately with him . First off , our 12 yr-old son bent down to pet him about 6 months ago and he snapped at his face and actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing an attitude problem where he has become stubborn , ignores us , totally disregards our commands . I had lost my job so I am at home all day with him but I dread if anyone comes to the door . He nearly takes the door off the hinges and rips my feet up with his claws trying to get at the person knocking . Me telling him to " sit or stay or it 's ok Rocco " does nothing . He definitely outweighs me . He is more obedient with my husband by far . But I do n't understand because as a pup , I was the one who for the most part trained him with shake , sit , stay , etc . <p> When we have company he totally does his own thing , jumping up , bouncing around , knocking things over even after being told otherwise after giving the visitor the chance to pet , etc . He just wo n't calm down that 's it gotten to the point where we need to remove him from the room which I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family . I used to always take him with me in the car when I would go to the store but anymore I am scared to because at red lights if someone pulls up next to us he goes nuts at the window ( i 'm afraid he will bust it ) and even though i park all the way in an isolated part of the parking lot i can hear him going crazy in the car when I come out of the store ( very quick errands .. less than 5 mins ) . he never used to do this . <p> We never feed him scraps and buy him special rottie food by iams , but sometimes he will go on a hunger strike and not eat for 2 or more days . everyone loves him so much but we are all getting to our wits end because of the way he has been behaving . i do n't  want to say he is a hassle but he 's being a hand full . i gave you a few specific examples but basically the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . can u please give me some insight ? <p> thank you so much . i want to do whatever we can to help him.lisa <p> Hi LisaI 'm sorry to hear that you 're having so much trouble with Rocco right now , and I know how difficult this must be for you to deal with . A full-grown Rottweiler is a handful if he decides to be challenging ! <p> Your Rocco is now fully mature , and an attitude change during late adolescence through maturity is very common . He is asserting his independence and authority and trying to move himself further up the ' chain of command ' . This is natural and does n't make him a bad dog , or aggressive etc. , but it definitely does need to be dealt with , quickly and effectively . <p> I strongly recommend that you get Rocco signed up for some obedience training with a qualified dog trainer asap . I 'd suggest starting out with an evaluation from the trainer so that he/she can decide whether or not Rocco needs private lessons to begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may want to call around some of the obedience classes close to you . Do choose a trainer who is familiar with large , guardian breeds and who understands that they benefit from positive , rewards-based training and do NOT need a ' heavy handed ' approach . <p> Rocco is challenging you for authority and although he is doing this to a lesser degree with your husband , you both need to attend classes with him and learn how to control him and to communicate your authority in a way he understands and accepts . It 's dangerous to have a dog who is as big as this but out of control in certain situations . Rotties are very intelligent and strong willed but they 're also very loyal and eager to please , I honestly think that with a bit of professional ' hands on ' help , you will be able to overcome this difficult behavior and everyone will be much happier . <p> I know professional training costs money , but in this situation I personally feel that it 's the best approach to take and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back under control .

Do n't be tempted to encourage him with tidbits or ' gussy up ' his meals as that will only lead to eating issues later on . He may not eat as much as you 'd like right now , but he wo n't starve himself and as soon as he starts to feel more at home and relaxed , his appetite will return . <p> I hope this helps some and wish you the best of luck with your dog .

Is that true ? <p> Thanks , <p> J. Krouse <p> Hi JerryI personally doubt that your Rottweiler would fail to protect you if he felt that you , your family , or your property were in real danger or under threat . <p> Rottweilers are very discerning guard dogs , guarding does NOT mean being aggressive or defensive when there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we do n't possess and are able to ' feel ' people 's emotions and intentions . If someone was to approach you or your family with the intention to hurt you , he would realize it and take care of it . <p> My dogs have never had to defend me or my home and generally welcome every single person who visits . But one time I had a tradesman come to the house and for whatever reason my female Rottie did not like him . She did n't growl or bark , but she followed him like a shadow and stared at him the whole time . She was ' on alert ' . I 've no idea why , but she felt something and I 've no doubt at all that if he 'd threatened me in any way she would have been on him in a second . I totally believe your boy has the same instincts . <p> Being neutered will not remove his guarding instincts , they 're genetic and hard-wired into his brain . A neutered or spayed dog will protect their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Rottweilers are very loyal , loving dogs but they need close interaction with their families to reach their full potential . Being outside all the time wo n't prevent your Rottie from protecting you , but it will rob him of a lot of happiness and attention - making his life so much less than it should be . Getting a female for him will not make him more protective and in my personal opinion it 's really not fair to get another dog for that kind of reason . <p> Never try to make a dog more protective than he feels the need to be , because those instincts are finely tuned and work the way nature intended . If you try to shape that behavior it usually causes problems and the dog either becomes fearful and anxious or hyper-reactive - neither of which you want and both will interfere with him being able to protect you should a real need arise . <p> Hope this has helped .

And now the problem is i have 2 rottie ( a pair ) and 1 doberman female , i prefer to walk my doggie 's late at night . i could n't handle 3 in leashes because they are not properly trained for walking , so i take them one by one . <p> when i take any one doggie out the other two starts to bark like hell , so i have tried to take two rotties at a time by i 've ended up in falling down only . so what can i do the barking really disturbs others while they are sleeping . And they all are more than year old so them barking is loud enough to wake up the whole block . <p> so help me out in this situation . Joshua <p> Hi JoshuaThis is a tricky one for sure . First of all I 'd have to recommend that you work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to manage . My Leash Training A Puppy page has lots of tips and advice to help you with that . <p> The barking problem is difficult , and I 'm honestly not sure what you could do to help the situation . I have a couple of suggestions/ideas but whether or not they will work I 'm not sure . <p> 1 . Get a couple of Kong toys , and fill them with peanut butter and put them in the freezer . Then when you go out with one dog , give the others a Kong each to keep them busy . Or get a couple of special toys/bones to use too , you can rotate between the toys/bones/kongs on a daily basis so they do n't get bored . It may not work for long , but it could help . <p> 2 . If you have crates , crate the dogs with their toys before you leave and put the crates in a room with the door closed to muffle the sound of their barking . <p> 3 . A no-bark collar may be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the citronella spray rather than the tone or pulse in this situation . They 're not my favorite idea , but if it 's really causing a disturbance and you ca n't do this any other way , then it may be worth a try . <p> 4 . The only other thing I can think of is to walk your dogs earlier , even if it 's not as convenient for you . If you do this while working on the leash training , then eventually you should be able to walk at least two of them together later on if necessary . <p> If anyone else has any good ideas for Joshua , or has had a similar problem , please feel free to share by using the ' comments ' feature below . Thanks <h> Comments for Taking my rottie for a walk <p> I only have one rottie but I have found that a tough toy filled with his fav treats works wonders ! ! He has some seperation issues and the toy seeme to keep is mind off the fact that I 'm leaving at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. If I were you I would start there . And if that does not work I would try seperating the dogs before you start the walks .. ( crates if you have them ) I am completely against bark collars so personally I would stay away from that ..

Many other breeds are the same way , Rotties are not difficult to feed as such . <p> It 's very important to feed puppies a high quality , premium puppy food and the best puppy food for a Rottie is one designed specifically to meet the needs of a large breed pup .

However , it does sound as though your girl is extremely passive and trusting , which is unusual in a guardian breed like this . <p> Obviously there 's a lot of positive things about having a dog who is very friendly and non-aggressive when you have children around , but I would expect her to react to strangers coming on to your property . <p> First of all I 'd suggest having her examined by your veterinarian to make sure that there 's nothing physically wrong with her that could explain her behavior . If she is 100% healthy , then having her evaluated by a professional dog trainer or behavioral specialist would be the next step . <p> You do n't ever want to try to encourage aggressive or defensive/guarding behavior in a dog as that can cause all sorts of problems . However a professional trainer will be able to answer your questions on this subject . <p> Although the pup will definitely take it 's lead from the older dog in lots of ways , he will have his own personality and temperament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of guarding .

@@50394335 @3894335/ <p> Whether or not you want to add raw meat to your pup 's diet is up to you . He will certainly enjoy it , but he needs a lot more than just the protein for meat . <p> Adding something as tasty as raw beef to his bowl can make a puppy a bit ' picky ' when it comes to food because he 'll obviously prefer the meat over the dry food . As long as he continues to eat a HIGH QUALITY large breed puppy food ( and I 'm afraid Purina food does n't fit that bill ) the meat will be just the icing on the cake , but he does n't actually NEED it . <p> Hope this helps .

However , as a remedy for a hip joint that has ' popped out ' ( if that 's what 's happened ) , I personally do n't think it 's nearly enough . <p> I 'm not a veterinarian though and I suggest that you take your dog into your veterinary clinic for a full exam . If he 's in pain your vet should be able to prescribe both anti-inflammatory and pain-killing medications which should help . He may need other treatment to help his hip/s both to treat the immediate problem and to help prevent it recurring . <p> There are certain supplements that can help strengthen joints and so on , but if your dog has a problem to the extent that the joint can pop out of place , these are not going to be useful . <p> I wish I could help more , and this is just my personal opinion , your veterinarian is obviously the professional . Your dog is relying on you to help him , so talk with your vet again and see what needs to be done . 152137 @qwx562137

@@50394343 @3894343/ <h> Food aggression in Rottweiler <p> My 5 year old rottweiler is still very food aggressive even after multiple attempts to train her . <p> I 've just stopped hanging out near her bowl while she is eating . I just put her food down and walk away to avoid confrontation . <p> What should I do to end this food aggression for good ? <p> HiFood guarding or food aggression in a 5 year old dog is probably well ingrained and habitual by now , and you will need to devote a lot of time and patience to retraining her in this area . <p> If you have n't already followed these steps then I 'd suggest that you start now , and take it slowly and carefully . You want to avoid confrontation and be sure you do n't get hurt . <p> First of all , start hand-feeding her all her meals . That means either letting her eat her food from a handful held in your palm , or even feeding her a few pieces at a time in your fingers . The idea is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from YOU , that you control it , and that your hand near her food is okay . <p> I 'd recommend doing this for at least two weeks before moving on to this ...... <p> Get some of her favorite treats , store bought , home made or just fresh liver , ground meat , hot dogs - whatever she loves . Then when she 's eating drop a piece or two into her bowl very carefully . Do this every mealtime for another two weeks , so that she comes to realize that your hand near her bowl means that she 's going to get a tasty morsel . <p> Then once she 's okay with that , start picking up her bowl to put the treat in it , and then giving it back to her . <p> Even once she 's got to this stage , you 'll need to do it regularly so she does n't ' forget ' that it 's okay . Also , make sure that you do n't allow her to be dominant in any other areas . Aggression or assertiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you are unable to do any of the above with her , or have tried this unsuccessfully then I can only suggest that you talk to a professional dog trainer or behavioral specialist and get some hands-on help . This sort of behavior ca n't be allowed as it could lead to someone getting bitten , so do whatever it takes to treat it now . <p> I hope this helps and wish you the best of luck with your dog . <h> Comments for Food aggression in Rottweiler <p> I have had many dogs like yours and found that there is a way for you to take control . <p> I would personally hand feed your dog , meaning you sit on a chair and place the bowl onto your lap and make your Rottweiler sit in front of you .

Repeat the word LEAVE IT as you go . <p> You have to do this every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then when the two weeks have ended you place the dog bowl onto the ground with nothing in it and with another bowl of food in your hand . Spoon the food into his bowl one at a time . And use the command Leave It when you do n't want him to snatch it out of the dog bowl . This training gives you more control of your dogs aggression . <p> I say within a month of this your dog will no longer have food aggression . <p> It 's all about trust ..... <p> Tip : when yo give the LEAVE IT command you must say it in a growling way .... <p> Dec 04 , 2010Rating <p> food aggressionby : Julie <p> have you trained your rottie to " sit and wait " , if so then before you put the food down tell her to " sit " them " wait " and when you are ready tell her " ok " ?

You are in charge , not your puppy . If you back off or are nervous , or over-react by getting angry or combative with him you will cause problems and more than likely the behavior you 're trying to correct will get worse rather than better . <p> So for example , if your pup growls when you pick him up DO NOT put him back down , or smack him or shout at him . Instead , continue to hold him securely and gently , while firmly telling him ' No growl ' . Use a low , calm but firm voice . If he continues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muzzle-wrap technique that I mention on my Stop Puppy Biting page . This involves gently but firmly wrapping your hand around his muzzle , and holding it closed for a few seconds while you repeat the ' no growl ' or ' no bite ' command . <p> You need to use a verbal correction , with the muzzle wrap only if necessary , every time he growls or snaps at you . Be patient and consistent and do n't expect instant results . Puppies learn through repetition so it 's a build up of the same cause-and-effect scenario that actually does the teaching . I hope I 'm making myself clear here ! <p> A Rottweiler puppy is just a baby dog , like a baby dog of any other breed . He is not aggressive by nature and needs love , affection , loving discipline and guidance the same way any other puppy does . Expect the best from him and treat him well and that is what you will get . 152137 @qwx562137

When finished i say good wee . <p> Then i go back inside . Also try not to have water bowls around the house as this encourages them to drink and the more they drink the more they want to pee . <p> And also what works best is having your dog on a lead when your inside so that way when he is about to do something you can take him outside to pee .

The problem is getting out of control and they are getting older now 4 months now please tell me in details what to do in order to eliminate the problem . <p> They are almost house broken and i want to let them free in the house and this problem is limiting me from doing that . <p> HiI 'm afraid to say that this situation is unlikely to get better if the pups are 4 months old and your older dogs ' behavior has been like this consistently . The older the pups get the less tolerant he is likely to be . <p> You 're right to be worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , and if there are any serious altercations between them and your Belgian Shepherd , then someone is likely to get hurt . When you have more than two dogs who are fighting , the ' pack instinct ' kicks in and the other pups/dogs are likely to join in - usually attacking the weaker party and this can result in very serious injury , even death . <p> If they 're all males then you are in for some difficult times and you 're going to need to be very vigilant and proactive about supervision and corrections . They should all be neutered in order to reduce some of the aggression and territorial conflicts . If you have a female she should also be spayed , as male to male fights over a female in season are serious . <p> You may be able to get them to accept each other if you supervise short periods of interaction between your older dog and the pups , but one at a time . Correct your Shepherd if he gets aggressive to the point of biting or attacking , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' out of his hair ' that 's natural . Also correct the pups if they get too much ' in his face ' and make sure there are plenty of toys and love and attention for everyone . I would n't recommend allowing them bones or edible toys when there are two dogs together , as food guarding may occur . <p> Once your older dog can tolerate one of the pups at a time , you could try to introduce the two of them , for a very short period . But it 's something that you will need to approach very slowly and with a LOT of patience . Also , I 'd strongly recommend that you never leave them alone together unsupervised .... not until you 're 110% sure that they LOVE each other . Even then I 'd personally be inclined to crate them separately , or put them in different rooms or enclosures when you 're out . 152137 @qwx562137

Please help what can i do . Also he is somewhat trained-- not great but some . <p> Hi StephanieI think your basic problem here is that Marino is n't properly trained , and he has n't learned to respect your authority . A dog does n't obey you because he knows you 're stronger physically , but because he understands that you have more authority than him . Marino does n't feel that way . <p> I strongly suggest that you get him enrolled in a basic obedience class and start from there . Although he 's an adult , he 's still perfectly capable of learning new behavior - it will just take him longer . You need some one-on-one help to learn how to become the ' alpha ' in this relationship ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice ) . Rotties respond best to loving but firm authority . <p> The ' come ' command ( aka the ' recall ' ) is the hardest command to teach and the last one a dog wants to obey ! It takes a lot of time , practice and patience . For now you are going to need to make sure that Marino ca n't get out of your home or your yard . Sooner or later he 's going to get hurt or in trouble if he keeps running away . <p> I 'd also strongly advise you to have him neutered . It will help to eliminate the times he runs away because he 's chasing after a female in season . Just because he 's a nice looking dog that does n't mean you should breed him . Unless he 's a show-stopper with an excellent pedigree , and you have an equally fine female to mate him to , it will be better to have him neutered . <p> Get him started in training asap and you should be able to begin to improve his behavior . Best of luck . 152137 @qwx562137

Three or more dogs tend to revert instinctively to pack behavior , if that is aggressive in any way it can lead to the two ( or more ) stronger dogs picking on the weaker one , depending on the size difference and attitude of the dogs this can be dangerous . <p> The neutering will reduce male-to-male aggression and often helps calm an adolescent male , but it 's not a ' quick-fix ' it will take time for the hormones to reduce . I do n't believe there is a ' surge ' after the surgery , and would guess it 's the stress and changes that are triggering your Rotties misbehavior more than anything physical . <p> You 've only had him one week so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a new pup/dog to be on their best behavior for the first few days/week or so and then once they start to feel at home they become a bit more difficult as the real adjustment starts . This stage will also end , it just takes time . <p> I 'd make sure that you are always close by when your new boy is with one of the other dogs , but do n't ' hover ' . Only intervene if someone is really getting hurt or is scared . <p> A true dog fight , especially between big , strong dogs , is scary and difficult to deal with if you are alone . You need some sort of help . I would recommend having either a small pepper-spray or a small ABC type of fire extinguisher on hand to use JUST IN CASE of a bad fight developing . <p> I 'm not saying this will happen at all , but I have big dogs and two of the females do not like each other , so I prefer to be safe than sorry . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Again , not saying you NEED to worry about a fight , but it 's best to be prepared . The leash that Ed uses on this video might be worth investing in . <p> I think doing a little work with your new Rottie and a professional trainer would be a really good idea . It will also help you both bond and communicate better . <p> What you 're seeing now is most likely just normal pack type behavior and the dogs will figure it out and everything will settle down given a little time . It 's easy to over-react to this sort of thing , especially when it involves dogs with a ' reputation ' ( such as Rotties or Pitbulls ) because in spite of our best intentions some of those myths take root in our heads . <p> BUT , it is always better to err on the side of caution .... so use common sense , be prepared , get some professional input but do n't get too worried about this being a huge problem . Most likely it wo n't be . 152137 @qwx562137

His head started to widen and flatten , the ears started to look " proper " , and the snout started to shorten up .

@@50394370 @3894370/ <p> The first thing to think about is how your resident dog acts around other dogs ... is he aggressive or very defensive of his property ? The next question would be , is he trained to the point where he will listen to you and accepts you as the ' alpha ' figure ? <p> Right now your Rottie is an adolescent and probably going through the typical teenage-type phases . He 's young enough that accepting another dog into the house should n't be a huge problem for him , but that 's providing he is dog-friendly and respects/obeys you . <p> Given that this is the case , then I 'd personally recommend getting a female pup , of a medium to large breed ( not tiny , and not giant ) . That should be the best ' fit ' .

As long as no-one is getting hurt or very scared , it 's best to let them figure this out on their own - with you playing a supervisory role and just being there to make sure it does n't get out of hand and to give corrections if the behavior warrants it . <p> I hope this has helped .

As these pups are only 13 weeks old it 's early to see real fighting , but as you say one is more ' aggressive ' than the other it could be that she has a very dominant personality and that has sped up the process . <p> This is difficult to deal with and obviously with dogs as big and strong as Rottweilers any serious fights can result in real damage . Dealing with this is challenging even for experienced Rottweiler owners , and I can imagine how scary and difficult it is for you . It 's not your fault but probably your lack of confidence is making the situation worse because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be able to control them both and defuse problems . Even then this does n't always work , but if they feel that you 're not in control then the more dominant one of the pair will consider herself the ' leader ' I 'm afraid . <p> I 'd strongly suggest getting them both into formal training classes right away as it will help you to gain confidence with them and help to show them that you are in charge . You may also want to get some private training sessions and help to become more adept at dealing with them . <p> I know that you love them both and obviously you want to do what 's best for them and make sure no-one gets hurt . It may be that the best way to do that is actually just to raise one of them though and find an excellent , loving home for the other one . It 's much easier to find good homes for dogs when they 're puppies , and right now they 're still young . If you wait it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricky finding good homes for Rottweilers and similar breeds because they seem to attract the attention of potential owners who do n't understand them , and want one so that they 'll appear ' macho ' or for other wrong reasons . So if you decide to go that route , please be very picky about the person you allow to take your pup . <p> I 'm sorry that I ca n't give you a more positive answer here , but given all the elements here I 'm concerned that you may have bitten off more than you can chew ( it happens ! ) and that you really need some professional help and perhaps even to rethink the whole situation . <p> It can probably be ' managed ' with lots of work on your part , but only you can make the call as to whether you think you 're up to it . I wish you lots of luck and hope that the situation gets resolved in a way that keeps everyone happy . <h> Comments for 2 female rottweilers , age 13 weeks old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started with one ( got her at 9wks , Daisy ) but she was nipping and chasing the kids so much that my husband suggested getting a playmate for her .... so we got Molly 3 wks later .

I too was concerned about being the " leader " with them and so we got Barkbusters in home dog training and it has done wonders ! ! ! They do playfight and yes one has established dominance ( daisy of course ) but one thing that works well is spraying them with a spraybottle or shaking a can with coins in it to get their attention when fighting .. also helpful to esstablish that you are pack leader , do n't allow them to pass through doorways before you , or walk ahead of you , teach them to " sit " before you give them the food .... hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy them : - ) 152137 @qwx562137

You can check out my Caring For Big Dog Breeds page for more on these . <p> The most important thing to do is to make sure that he 's eating a premium dog food that has been specifically designed for his size and activity level . Look for a food that contains extra calories for energy , plus highly digestible proteins and fats .

I say rescued but he was our neighbors dog and . We have known him and his sister since they were 6 weeks old . <p> Just became owners of the male as of December this year . We have 2 other dogs , An APBT and a ASTAFF/Boxer cross who got in to a fight w/the Rotti resulting in an emergency vet visit . Our local vet just built a new website and sent out these little magazines that have a client personalized cover that has our dogs breed profiles and health reminders on it as well as a link to the section of the web site that is set up for her clients and their specific dogs breed . <p> It states that Rottweilers , Dobermans , and Pitbulls should be vaccinated by your vet only because these three breeds of dogs have different immune systems and the vaccines are not as effective . My thoughts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Rotti had not been vaccinated that we knew of and that if the actual owners gave him up to us that I would vaccinate him for everything but rabies myself as we had done with our other rescued pit bull , she saw that as a chance to make some money by telling us that our dogs are different and would absolutely need a vet to administer shots . That 's a $65.00 office call $75.00 exam , $50.00 for the vaccines.for each dog . <p> Now if this is true about these dogs being so much different then I will gladly shell out the cash but I do n't believe that it is true , what say you ? <p> Hi ChandraWell , firstly I have to make it clear that I 'm not a veterinarian myself and do n't have the training , knowledge and experience that veterinarians do . I 'm purely a Rottweiler owner and lover and any advice or input I have is based on my own personal experience and knowledge - a vet is always going to know more ! <p> However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I think that what your veterinarian is saying has some merit and truth , but may be taking it to the extreme . <p> Rottweilers definitely do have a weakness in their immune system when it comes to Canine Parvovirus ( and if your adopted Rottie was not fully vaccinated against this as a puppy , and vaccinated annually since then , he could be in danger ) . It 's very important to make sure Rotties have FOUR sets of the Parvo vaccine ( usually given as part of the combination shots ) and that they 're given at the right time , and intervals . <p> Other breeds which may also be at higher risk of Parvo include Doberman Pinschers and Pitbulls . <p> Rotties also tend towards allergies , and that could have something to do with their immune function , but I ca n't say that definitively . Pitbulls and other similar breeds such as AmStaffs and English Staffys ' tend to be predisposed to Mange . This is also a condition which tends to appear in dogs whose immune system is weakened , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Personally , I 've always had my dogs and puppies vaccinated by my veterinarian . I know many reputable breeders , and owners too , do vaccinate their pups/dogs themselves , but it 's just not something I feel comfortable doing . However , if you use the same vaccines that your vet would use , and you follow the recommended protocol in terms of timing , then personally I do n't see why vaccinating them yourself should be less safe . Rabies of course has to be done by a licensed vet . <p> This is a personal decision that you have to make , and the only thing you have to be sure about is that the dogs all get their vaccinations up to date , with the right vaccines and right timing . Whether you do it yourself , or have your vet do it is something you need to feel comfortable with after you 've thoroughly researched the situation . <p> I wish I could help more , but hopefully this will give you a bit more info and assist in your decision-making .

We recently tried to leave the dog at home for a hour or so with it roaming the house because the previous owner said that he did that with them and was fine . <p> It did n't go well with us though , he marked his territory well through out the house and scratched up some doors pretty good .

We have to leave him alone sometimes and we want to do it right . <p> What 's the best method for training a 18 month rottie who has previous training from other owners . He was not kennel trained by his previous owners but he is very well trained in other aspects of youth . Please let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi PatrickYour Rottie is a very handsome boy , looks big too ! <p> The scent-marking and scratching that you describe is to be expected given the newness of this dogs ' situation . He will likely be a bit confused and maybe anxious right now , Rotties tend to bond closely with their owners and are often one-man dogs , so readjusting to new owners and a new home can take some time . <p> A crate would definitely be the best way to go for now , that way you will be able to leave him without having your house/belongings damaged . As he 's almost an adult , he will have good bladder/bowel control and since he 's already well-behaved , hopefully you wo n't have too many issues getting him used to the crate . <p> Get one that is big enough for him to be comfortable , but not have tons of space around him just in case he decides to try to mark it or urinate in it . Also , do n't get the cheapest construction - they 're okay for pups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robust crate . Usually I recommend the fibreglass/plastic enclosed crates , but in your pups ' case you may want to go with a wire crate as he may feel less restricted in it and it wo n't be so scary for him .

Give him a treat when he gets in - or throw it in so that he follows if he wo n't go in voluntarily . Trying to force a Rottweiler to do anything is difficult , especially until you have bonded and he obeys you without question , so a treat or two can work wonders ! <p> As it sounds as though your boy has been trained in general , and is good natured and not too nervous or anxious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

She 's like a little ( or not so little ! ) sponge and she soaks up the emotional atmosphere around her , you want her to be absorbing calm , not more craziness ! <p> Use the tips and advice on my Dog Food Aggression page if you feel that Jager is guarding or protecting her food unduly . But if she 's just anxious and nervous when eating , try giving her her meals in a quiet , private place ( ie in the EMPTY kitchen , or in a laundry room , back hallway etc. ) where she can eat in peace and relax a little . <p> It sounds as though you 're working hard with Jager and that she 's actually doing okay overall , just remember that she 's still a puppy , roughly equivalent to a human toddler , and has a lot of growing and learning still to do .

Topaz was a peace keeper with the other Rottweiler 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of her off spring specifically one named Riley he is what a rottweiler should be . <p> He has the best temperament you could ask for even his vet thought so and she is now the owner of a Topaz grandbaby by Riley , Riley has the black with rich red mahogany markings , he is a super nice size Rottweiler that has a stretched tree trunk body , his head is block style with a look that give 's you a expression of his thoughts and character , not to mention the well defined markings that are of rich mahogany color over the eye 's , on the cheeks , the paws that lead up the leg , and on the chest in the shape of a bow tie . <p> This bloodline is sought after by even the most perfectionist Breeder 's , Handler 's , Trainer 's and/or current/future/past Owners . Riley is the total package as he is out of Topaz and his father is Baby Boy Gil a son of ( Champion Gil Crni Lotos ) who is known for his championship titles across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also known for producing healthy puppies time and time again that are able to be titled and clear all necessary health clearances needed on a parent before they breed to insure the best possible puppy . <p> The Crni Lotos line is seen over and over again on several different breeder 's website as well the offspring he produced nationally . Topaz will live on in her offspring , ( Riley ) will be the best possible prospect to keep that generation of dogs alive and producing in hopes to achieve the best specimen of the Rottweiler Breed ! 152137 @qwx562137 
@@50394398 @3894398/ <p> Hi NathanielI 've just answered another owner of a 4 month old Rottweiler pup ( female that time ) who had the same question ! <p> As I said there , it 's important to remember that a 4 month old puppy is a baby ... and that Rotties are slow to mature and develop . The bigger the male , the later he matures in my experience . <p> Your boy looks good and his muzzle looks fine , he 's got nice thick-set bones from what I can see and his color is good . You wo n't really see how his head is going to fill out until he 's much older , and from now until he 's about 18 months to 2 years ( or even longer ) he 's likely to look quite out of proportion and gangly , maybe even a bit skinny , as he 'll be an adolescent . My biggest male looked like a ' bobble-head ' toy for quite a while : o ) <p> He will get his full height before he has put on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be patient . A Rottweiler is an incredible dog and is so much more than the size of his head , or shape of his muzzle ! They truly have the heart of a giant and all your little guy needs is lots of love and attention , loving discipline , proper healthcare and an excellent diet in order to grow into the adult his genetic ' code ' allows for . <p> Best of luck with your pup , I think he 's going to be a very handsome adult . 152137 @qwx562137

I 'm sure it must be doubly so in other places ! <p> Rawhides are ' okay ' , especially for smaller puppies but only if you supervise the pups with them at all times . Also , I 'd only ever use pressed rawhide , and the extra-large sizes , that way your pups ca n't rip off large pieces so easily . If the rawhide does become soggy or soft , and they start to tear pieces off you need to remove the whole thing and give them a new one . <p> ' Bully Sticks ' are another good alternative , these are actually edible which is both a plus and a minus . It 's good because they 're safe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't last too long . And giving them too often can cause tummy upsets . <p> Natural bones would probably be the best option for you , cow-hocks and other large bones that ca n't be splintered work best and are by far the safest . To avoid upset tummies ( again ) , you can clean the bone of as much meat as possible , but if your puppies are used to eating raw meat then they would be fine . These types of bones have an almost endless play value . <p> Other natural chew toys include pig ears ( although like the bully sticks these are edible ) and animal hooves . <p> You can also buy natural and sterilized bones from online stores if you can have them delivered to your location - I 'm not sure exactly how that works though . <p> I 'd recommend checking out this website as it has lots of bully sticks , bones and other chews . I 've no idea whether you could actually purchase from them from where you live , but it will give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A last thought would be that most dogs LOVE rope toys , and these have the added advantage of keeping their teeth clean due to the abrasiveness of the rope .

But the only thing is he gets excited about everything new/old , human/dog. he is very pushy with both human &amp; dogs . <p> i did his positive training in florida and i moved to indiana recently &amp; did his CGS training here Dog whisper way . the trainer here asked me to use Shock collar and i use it every now and then . i 'll use that when i 'm taking them for a walk or some time in house . and i do know that shock collars are to enforce command and not to train . Sometime i 'm confused between positive training and Cesar Milan way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant . but the thing is both ways he is disciplined when i 've treat in my hand or shock collar on his neck . <p> I put him on treadmill , walk him everyday , play tug every day , that way he is calm down a bit but now he is charged on again . i 'm thinking about training him to pull carts but i have n't got the right help yet . So can you please help me with his behavior and giving me some tips to get him disciplined . Thank u ...... <p> Hi SumitOverall it sounds as though you 're doing a fantastic job with your boy , and he 's has done ( and is still doing ) a lot of different activities . <p> The first thing I 'd say is to remember that even though he 's a big boy , at 15 months he is still a puppy . In fact , he 's pretty much the equivalent of a human teenager . If you think about the way teenagers act you can often see the similarities in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy , and he 's also got the emotional and physical changes of adolescence going on in his body . Plus his guarding instincts etc. are maturing . It 's a lot for a pup to deal with and more often than not , there will be an overflow of energy ( both physical and mental ) which will show up somehow . Sometimes it 's seen as ' pushy ' or overexcited behavior , other times it may be stubbornness , testing rules/limits , incessant jumping or mounting and so on . In my experience it 's worse with the males than females . It 's perfectly normal and will diminish as your pup grows and matures . <p> However , of course you ca n't just let him run wild and do as he pleases , so you exercise him physically and mentally ( with training ) and discipline him ..... all of which you are doing regularly . Do be careful not to OVER stimulate him though , he needs plenty of quiet time to relax ( preferably with a couple of really good , tough dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewing ! ) . <p> I 'd recommend getting him a crate , if you do n't already have one , and using it regularly so that he has quiet time which will help him to wind down . If you do already have a crate that 's good , but make sure that you use it . He should spend at least a couple of hours a day alone and quiet ( not necessarily in one stretch though , an hour here and an hour there is fine ) . Also try to keep to a regular daily routine of exercise , training , socialization , food , quiet time and sleep , that way he 'll feel secure and more relaxed than if his days are all different and full of stimulation . <p> Cart pulling would probably be excellent exercise for him , but I 'd wait until he 's at least 18 months and more physically mature before starting that type of exercise . You do n't want to cause any excessive strain on growing bones , joints and ligaments . <p> I honestly think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just continue with consistent and loving corrections when he gets too excited , that you 'll see improvement . Be patient with him and give him time to mature and settle down , it sounds as though you have an excellent pup and that you 're doing the very best for him . <p> Best of luck with both your pups . <h> Comments for Over excited 15 months old Rotty ..... <p> Thanks Susan your tip waz a great help . more than help it was satisfying . i 'll be having lot of questions as my female pup 's growing too . and we are gon na breed . i really do appretiate your help and ur precious time .

He 'll also need to be dewormed by your veterinarian at least 3 times , and to be on regular heartworm preventative and flea/tick preventative . <p> All purebreeds tend to have a predisposition to certain health conditions and Rotties are at risk of canine hip dysplasia , elbow dysplasia , certain heart conditions and eye issues .

@@50394414 @3894414/ <h> my 3 year old MALE rottweiler does not seem to want to mate , why ? <p> Male dogs are very sensitive to a female in season and generally know exactly when the timing is right .

I think the difference lies in her muzzle shape/width/depth but I 'm just not exactly sure ! <p> She definitely has a ' look ' which I have seen before and is strong in some bloodlines . ' Typey ' is possibly a good description . <p> She 's still a puppy and has nice strong features for one so young , I would guess that she 'll ' grow into them ' and as she gets bigger and heavier her face will change some , maybe becoming less distinctive , maybe not .

@@50394421 @3894421/ <h> my 8 month Rottweiler puppy cowers <p> when approaching other dogs and/or people she seemd to be afraid ? or shy , not really sure , will she outgrow this and become more self confident ? <p> most certainly contrary to the image people have about the breed . <p> Hi FrankRottweilers are like any other breed in that each and every dog is an individual . Although they are a guardian breed , not every dog will be confident and bold . <p> A shy , or nervous , personality can be a genetic trait , or it can be a result of the way a dog is raised , lack of proper socialization and so on . <p> At 8 months a pup is also likely to be going through a ' fear period ' when they are more likely to be afraid of , or react oddly to , circumstances or people that they 've previously been comfortable around . It 's a developmental phase . <p> Do n't ' baby ' your pup if she reacts fearfully , but do n't scold her either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass that on to her . Proper , formal training sessions and lots of socialization will help her to gain in confidence and lessen this sort of reaction/behavior . <p> Socialization is an on-going process form most dogs , and is particularly important for breeds like the Rottie who naturally tend to be a little ' stand-offish ' . <p> If your pup is happy and healthy in every other way , this is simply an area you will need to concentrate on in order to improve things and I strongly recommend getting her into a local training school so that you can learn the basics and get off on the right foot . She 's still a pup and has plenty of time to learn . <p> Best of luck . <h> Comments for my 8 month Rottweiler puppy cowers <p> My pup was the same way.He was afraid of everything It was actually a little embarressing but I love him so much I said it 's my dog and that 's how he is.At about 5 months he started changing and getting protective around the house.I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there own so that't what i 'm doing.He is 6 months old and continually getting more protective.He is well socialized and mostley protective at home.He is fine with anybody I let in the house , people outside are sometimes severly challenged by him if to close to the house.I 'm sure you will have a similar experience . 152137 @qwx562137

We flew him to Oklahoma University to hopefully get some answers . We were devastated we did n't know how to help him . He lost half his body weight but never lost his spirit . He was and is a fighter . <p> For those of you who do n't know , we had numerous tests run including a DNA test . We found out why he was so sick . He had been over vaccinated by the breeder as a newborn through 8 weeks with the Parvo ant-virus . This killed his immune system . We knew he 'd been given extra . We were told he needed them because of the area he was born in Parvo was rampant in Rottweilers . Our excitement fogged our brains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important thing is his DNA results . I wo n't share them . But what I did find out from the Laboratory is the PUPPIES themselves are the only decisive Gene in determining whether they will be long or short haired coats . Meaning , does n't matter what the parents coats are . You ca n't breed in and ca n't breed it out . Do n't be fooled . It 's like a dark haired father and a blond mother having a red haired child . The father immediately runs for a paternity test only to find out the child is his . <p> Our puppy is older , he has special needs . His immune system attacks and compromises itself when he is stressed or ill as well as he has to be on a special diet . He is still training to be a companion dog because he enjoys it .

First off if all of you did your research most pure breds came from mixing breeds way back . The long hair comes from Burmese Mtn Dog , AKC has been trying to get rid of this gene by inbreeding dogs which is what AKC does , it 's called line breeding . It 's a practice I do n't much care for , that is why they fault the long hairs , you can show them and that is all . I have that gene cause my dog has thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Years ago my very first Rott was the long hair , hard to find now . I have 2 AKC reg rotties and do breed , I will not try to breed out the long hair . I also agree with Dawn who got her pup from me , for whatever reason the long hair gene does make them a bit sweeter if that 's possible , I think even a bit smarter . <p> Oct 04 , 2014Rating <p> Ozzy updateNEWby : Dawn Struble <p> Well just an update on my new long hair Ozzy . He 's gained over 10 lbs this past 5 weeks . He 's getting His new teeth and I 'm in love all over again . I 'm also glad I know I have a long haired rot this time . My last one was n't apparent til about 9 months . This one is going to be stunning . After having 5 , I just think the long hairs have just a smidge sweeter personality . I 'm not a show dog person or a breeder . If you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having so much fun with this very smart very social sweet boy . I take him everywhere with me and even though he 's one of six pups in my kids and my homes he plays plays and plays . He also looks is so similar to my previous rot in personality and looks . I could not be happier and yes I want looking and my patience paid off . Please breeders do n't get rid of the coated or different pups . They are pure and need a good home . Just glad the last one of his litter was for me . My prayers were answered ! <p> Oct 03 , 2014Rating <p> Long Haired RottieNEWby : Cheryl <p> Hi , I just wanted to comment on the Long Hair Rottweiler . We were blessed to have a litter of Championship Rottweilers and YES , our Bitch was inseminated and out of 11 pups she gave birth to a runt male , rare long haired pup . We named Conner . This is a very rare genetic as the breeder we worked with called an glitch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may think . We kept him as a pet for our girls and he lived to the age of six when he developed bone cancer and he lost his battle and will to live and we let him pass . <p> Although sad , most breeders will humanely euthanize these pups at birth because they are not breed standard . Which is understandable if you are a breeder and you show or sell your stock . <p> I would love to share a picture of Conner if you wish to see him . He i stunning . <p> Thank you and we have owned five wonderful Rottweilers . Conners mother gave me 14 beautiful , wonderful loving years of her life to me . She lost her battle with kidney cancer in 2006 . We have since not been able to add another Rottweiler to our family after losing five our hearts are simply to crushed . Yet every one I see I have the same thought , maybe it is time . When we do we will be rescuing one in need .

My point is that if you want a pet and know that you want a rotties there are many options in purchasing a puppy . Also it is up to the buyer to be informed and make the right decisions when it comes to buying a pup . There are way too many dogs that are unwanted and put down due to people not getting the right dog for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some rotties have long hair is because of bad people beading bad dogs and that is just plain ignorant . It is a recessive gene that can happen in almost any line of rottie pups . Nowadays DNA tests are available and if you purchase a pup , the breeders should have had these tests done on both parents . Again it is up to the buyer to do their homework . About me ... I have always neutered or spayed my dogs . I am not a BYB and my dogs have never been parents . I just got my latest rottie pup after looking for almost a year . Sorry for this long posting but it just bothers me when I see the " professional " breeders say how great they are and how bad BYB are . The professional breeders have reasons to stop BYB and with many of them it is all about money . I have 3 dogs and it takes all my time taking care of them and loving them . So many professional breeders have 5-6 and more dogs . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their family when you have so many . They are kept in kennels or runs and not treated like pets . They are treated like Money Makers . Last point is that there are good and bad with both BYB breeders as well as the so called professional breeders . Make sure you do your homework about the rottie breed as well as the people you buy them from . I think we all can agree that there are way too many dogs that end up in shelters due to irresponsible buyers and sellers of rotts . <p> Aug 27 , 2013Rating <p> Money MakersNEWby : Anonymous <p> I know my comment will upset some people . First thing I want to say is that , the puppy mills are the real threat to any breed of dog . They produce inferior puppies with many genetic problems . The conditions in these puppy mills are horrid . Now the part that will upset some . I see many postings on many forums on how bad back yard breeders(BYB) are and how they are ruining the breed . This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as some professional breeders are unethical . Over the last 30 years I have purchased many dogs , many breeds from BYB 's . If you do your homework , see the puppies , look at the lineage , spend time with the puppies and the owners , I do not see any issue with buying puppies from the RIGHT breeders . When you buy from BYB , do your homework and are looking for pets , they can be a great place to purchase a dog . I know that many of the postings about how bad BYB 's are come from the so called professional breeders . I know many professional breeders are great people who are looking to improve the breed and are good places to purchase a puppy . I do think that one reason that some professional breeders hate BYBs is that it cuts into the money they make . They can charge huge amounts of money for a pup that is no better then you will get from a BYB . On a hole these professional breeders charge huge amounts of money , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many not have been conceived or not born . I hate the reservation process , you put a large deposit down in the hope you may get a puppy . The will never give your money back and will tell you that your deposit will be transferred to the next liter . I know one person who waited two years and never got a puppy . <p> Aug 14 , 2013Rating <p> Had two , Raven and CaesarNEWby : Anonymous <p> I 've had coated rotties on both ends of the " friendly " scale . <p> Raven was the sweetest , sweetest rottie , but Caesar was another story .

Raven was on the smallish side , 80 pounds , and she could be trusted with babies , cats , puppies , and the elderly .

One is male and the other is female . Thanks ! <p> Hi Francis . Firstly I have to say that the ONLY way to be absolutely sure that a puppy is purebred is to have registration papers from a REPUTABLE organization ( such as the KC in the UK or the AKC in the USA or the ADRK in Germany ) . I am not sure if there is an equivalent organization in the Phillipines for dogs bred there , but I 'm sure you know the answer to that . <p> If you have these types of papers for both parents and the puppies , and have seen the pedigrees for all , then you can be fairly sure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what type of quality of dogs they are from . Purebred Rottweilers ( or any breed ) can be healthy and conformationally correct representations of their breed , or sickly dogs or have poor breed characteristics . If you simply want a pet dog then as long as parents and puppies are healthy then they do n't need to be show quality in terms of conformation and looks . There is room for both types of dog . However , pups who are not healthy or whose parents are not healthy , or who have not had at least basic health testing done are not a good choice . <p> Finally , these puppies look as though they could well be purebred Rottweilers , although they are not necessarily great representatives of the breed . The female looks better in terms of size and body/head shape , but as long as they 're healthy either pup will most likely make an excellent pet . <p> Rottweiler characteristics are temperamental as well as physical and the loving , loyal , intelligent traits are more important in pets than show-ring looks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rottweilers , certain bloodlines still pass this on , although they are often a fault and not acceptable for showing . <p> I hope this helps . Anyone else who has input please feel free to help Francis out . <p> Sue <h> Comments for Hi ! would like to check if this is a pure rottweiler <p> Your dog is more than likely pure Rott . Often the white comes from over breeding . Puppy mills are common for this . I bought a girl years ago because I wanted to get her off that Rott farm .

He has always had excellent house training and knows to go to the toilet outside . <p> We also have a 3 yr old Golden retriever bitch . We were wondering whether he has started this to try and show her who is ' boss ' ? or whether it may be us he is trying to dominate with his territory marking ?

It may not stop the behavior entirely at this point , but it should help it to decrease . <p> Secondly , it 's important to realize that this is n't a housebreaking issue , it has nothing to do with his potty training , obedience training and so on . It 's a totally instinctive action and he is doing it to show that your home is his territory . The fact that you also have an adult female in the home will also encourage him to do this as he 's staking her out as ' his ' , this will be even more apparent if she 's not spayed . <p> You 're going to need to be very vigilant with him and supervise him closely at all times because you have to correct him firmly ( do n't shout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior and he does n't know it 's wrong ) ever single time he lifts his leg to spray . I 'd recommend using his crate a bit more than you normally would during this training period as it will help you to avoid him spraying when you 're not watching him . If this happens it interferes with the training . <p> There are products you can use in conjunction with the supervision and corrections that will help protect your furnishings and carpets during his ' learning curve ' . They 're called ' belly bands ' and are sort of like doggie diapers , but are designed especially for male dogs and wrap around his middle , covering the penis and therefore catching any urine . 152137 @qwx562137

I 'm such a big fan of how you have chosen to help all Rott lovers like us with your experience and knowledge . Luv u for that . <p> France as you see in the photos has grown up quite a bit since the last post but the limping problem does n't seem to leave him . I feel very bad when i see him going through this pain . He does n't whine about it , never , unlike me. he 's a brave boy . i 'm sure he must be in pain as he limps in the front legs . <p> Earlier we assumed that he must have Panosteitis , which should have subsided as he is 10months now . <p> I visited the Vet , he has given certain ligament and joint strengthening tablets and powder.We have been giving him ( Beapher HD tablets ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to diagnose the problem . <p> I have seen him limp every time he gets up after his rest . if i take him for his walk , after his initial limp , he walks and runs just about fine . so i 'm thinking that its not something major because otherwise he would limp all the time . <p> I also think this has caused him not gaining enough weight since last three months . he was 32 at 6.5 months and he is 37 at 10 months . <p> And getting him not to jump , frolic or run is so difficult as he gets excited so easily . i 'm assuming if he rests and does n't run around for a week he might be able to recover . <p> Need your help and advice . <p> Hi Sand - generally I do n't answer questions here , but since I remember France I 'll give you my opinion : ) It still sounds to me as though Pano is the problem , and although it should have improved by now , it can last for longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as your veterinarian has examined him and not found an explanation it might be worth waiting another couple of months . If France is still limping this way by a year old , then I 'd probably recommend another vet visit and a referral to an orthopedic vet specialist for further evaluation . <p> Rotties have a high tolerance for pain and will push through almost anything , this can make things worse so although it 's difficult do try to keep his exercise fairly low key . With Pano though regular running etc. should be fine , just still no jumping or pounding along on hard surfaces . Do n't worry about his weight gain , it will naturally start to slow down now . He looks just fine , and carrying extra weight will put more strain on his joints , ligaments , bones etc . Lean is better for a Rottie , regardless of age . <p> Sorry I ca n't be more help , but hope this puts your mind at rest just a little . Hopefully France will stop limping soon , or your vet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriately . Good luck to both of you . 152137 @qwx562137

The Rabies shot has to be given yearly by law and you obviously are doing that so no problems there . <p> Because Rottweilers are so at risk of contracting Parvo I would most definitely recommend that you have your Rottie vaccinated against that annually .

The intra-nasal ( nose drops ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sub-cutaneous ( needle ) which is only effective for about 6 months .

Choose one with ingredients that he has never eaten before , most of these foods use more exotic ingredients so that it 's easy to do just that . <p> Personally I would n't recommend Iams , in my opinion they do n't produce the quality foods they once did . Blue Buffalo IS a good food , but if your pup is sensitive to any ingredients then it 's not the quality , but the type of ingredient that 's causing the issues . <p> Once you 've got him on a hypoallergenic dog food , give him only that for 2 months and see if there is any improvement . Also stick to all-natural , hypoallergenic treats with a single protein source ( one that is in the food you 've chosen ) this will avoid getting a reaction from treat ingredients . <p> Hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he seems itchy and uncomfortable , there are many things you can do to relieve that .. check out this page for more information and tips on this - Canine Skin Allergies <p> If your vet gave you an antibiotic called ' Albon ' then I would suggest giving it to your pup as it treats internal parasitic infections such as coccidia . Sometimes a fecal sample can show negative for these organisms but the pup still has them in his digestive tract . Giving him the medication could n't hurt . <p> The same pretty much goes for a general antibiotic too , although it 's possible that a short-term bout of loose stools can be caused by these , the benefits of treating an infection if there IS one should outweigh that . <p> If your pup has been dewormed regularly then the dewormer may not be necessary , but if you 're not sure about when/if he was dewormed then he needs it ! BUT giving him several medications at once when he already has loose stools could make the problem a whole lot worse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he 's finished up with the antibiotic ( or at least until you 're sure it 's not causing digestive upset ) before going ahead with the dewormer . <p> BUT I 'm not a veterinarian , this is just my opinion which comes from experience , not professional qualifications . Your veterinarian should be your number one port of call when you have a health concern . It 's perfectly okay to seek a second opinion if you 're not 100% sure your own vet is getting to the root of the problem too . Your pup is relying on you to take care of him so you need to follow your instincts . <p> Luckily this pup seems happy and healthy overall , so one of these measures should help solidify his stools and all will be well . Just take it slowly and do n't overdo the treatment all at once as it 's important not to make things worse ! <p> Hope this helps , please let me know how it all turns out if you get the time . <h> Comments for 4 month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog foods when my little girl got the runs . My rottie seemed to get dry skin as a pup ( one year now ) from a few different kinds .

After a vet visit ( and nothing wrong with Pickles , haha ya my rottweiler is named Pickles. ) they told me to have her fast for a day and then put her on a rice diet slowley adding in chicken or beef . This took care of the diarrhea but I thought that perhaps it was her food since she was otherwise very healthy . I changed her and my pitbull named Blue on to a food called Orijen ( http : //orijen.ca/ if you would like to read about it ) .

Well , it got worse . I would go home every few hours to check on him and he had accidents in the house . That 's Monday and Tuesday . Wednesday , I am ready for the vet . My vet is out so I took him at 8 this morning and left him and went to my office across the street from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had no parasites . They called and asked to run blood tests .

Bright red blood . and he strains and afterwards it oozes out . I had to run back to the office and finish up some things . I am only ten minutes from home and plan to be home by 5 . I called the vet about the blood . They said , " we are n't surprised by that ... but it 's NOT normal . " What does that mean . They said to just give him another pill tonight and also give him the special diet food they had me buy . I spent $400 today at the vet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be concerned ? Should I go to another vet ? ( i wo n't lie , I can only afford so much , but this dog is my LIFE and I will do whatever and ask family for money if I have to ) . <p> I just wanted a second opinion . Or has anyone else had this happen ? <p> This dog is truly my soulmate dog . I lived with my ex for six years and we broke up and fought over this and the other female rotty for six months . Finally , when the male would n't eat because I was gone , my ex gave in and he and I are happily reunited . <p> I appreciate any feedback or help . <p> Thank you ! <p> Hi Jax 's momI 'm so sorry to hear what 's happening with Jax , and I can imagine how worried you are . <p> It definitely sounds as though something odd is going on and any sudden change like this is cause for concern . Did your vet give you any kind of diagnosis ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for Jax , perhaps an antibiotic and maybe an anti-inflammatory ? <p> Bloody diarrhea is definitely NOT normal , and in a young unvaccinated ( or partly vaccinated ) pup , Parvo would be my first guess . However , I 'm assuming that Jax is fully vaccinated , so that 's unlikely to be the problem . <p> Although your vet said ' no parasites ' I would personally suggest you ask if they tested for coccidia and giardia , both these are parastic illnesses but it may require more than one fecal test to actually get a sample that contains a parasite or two . I 'd recommend having Jax tested for both of these , even if he 's been tested once . Both conditions can cause bloody diarrhea and other intestinal issues . <p> Blood in the stool basically indicates inflammation in the colon/bowel and sometimes repeated diarrhea itself can cause the inflammation , regardless of what started the problem . In this sort of situation an anti-inflammatory medication can be prescribed to help settle things down . <p> I 'm not certain changing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you have the food now as long as you make the change-over slowly and carefully it should n't hurt even if it does n't help . However , when you have this sort of ' vicious cycle ' of intestinal upset , sometimes a 24 hour ' fast ' can help . <p> If you want to try this , just allow him plenty of water for 24 hours , but not food . After the 24 hours is up , you can try giving him plain white boiled rice with maybe a little clear chicken broth , and then slowly work up to letting him eat his dog food again . I would check with your vet before doing this in your situation because Jax is on medication , and you want to be sure that it wo n't hurt his tummy if it 's not taken with food . <p> If you are n't happy with what your own vet is prescribing , or doing for Jax , then by all means do n't feel shy about seeking a second opinion . He 's your baby and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong and help him feel better , so follow your instincts on this . <p> I hope this helps some and I wish you the very best of luck , hopefully Jax will be back to his old self and feeling great again soon . <h> Comments for Rottweiler Pooping Bloody Diahrrea - already been to the vet and not happy <p> I am relieved to hear Jax is doing better . I just wanted to add something in case it helps you and other Rottie lovers out there . I 'm not a vet , but I do know that there are many similarities amongst human and dog diseases . I had a bout of food poisoning many years ago that sounds exactly like your poor dog 's symptoms . Some symptoms of toxicity from bacteria can take 5 days to show up--therefore folks often miss the connection between slightly tainted food and their illness . The doctors took some tests , but in the end did not give me anything to ease my suffering ( I had no insurance at the time ) and told me to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found pure food-grade kaolin clay at a healthfood store , mixed it with water , and drank it down . It absorbs everything in the digestive tract and is extremely gentle and non-toxic . It gave me relief within hours . It 's the kind of thing to keep on hand rather than trying to find it after your animal gets sick . Keep the powder in a glass jar with a tight lid ( mason jar works great ) as the clay will absorb odors even from the air . It will last basically forever , as it is just purified earth . Be aware that it also will absorb any medication in your dog 's digestive system--which may render them ineffective . I am not suggesting you ignore a vet 's advice , but I find vets as well as doctors often do n't have a clue about simple , natural remedies to support the body , relying usually on drugs instead . The chicken broth ( unsalted ) and rice was also great advice and another home remedy which works for humans too . Good luck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Feb 25 , 2011Rating <p> He 's doing betterby : Jax 's Mom <p> Thank you guys for your comments ! It 's awesome that you all care as much about your " kiddos " as I do . Thank you again ! <p> I called the vet again and the most he would say ( after all of the those tests he performed - I went through it - they did every test possible , ) he said he THINKS it 's irritable bowel , colitis . But not positive . <p> The only pills he got were to help the Diarrhea . No antibiotics . I did what he said - two pills yesterday . When I got home from work , he had had an accident , but not too much blood . Just a small amount . <p> This morning , I took him out and his feces was ALMOST solid ! So I am feeling much better . I am going to see how it goes over the weekend and take him to another vet next week to double check . <p> To answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad about the trash , things like that . He does n't do that anymore . But he does love his toys and rawhide . The rawhide usually upsets his tummy so I now only use the pork kind . I may even cut that out , even though he will NOT be happy . He is a bone addict . <p> On eating and his behavior , other than not wanting to go anywhere ( he used to LOVE car rides and want to go everywhere ) he is normal . He 's hyper . He 's sleeping fine . He 's eating . He is drinking more water than usual , but I am guessing he 's a bit dehydrated . <p> I have cut out his treats , too . He is pretty spoiled so I just am giving him hypoallergenic treats I got at the vet right now until he 's all better . <p> He loves rice so I will try that if he gets it again . I will check on him at lunch today and see how he 's doing ... <p> Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to check into the other possible diagnosis you guys sent and see if that 's an option . <p> OH , and yes , he had his vaccinations in January and is always up-to-date and is on Hart Guard and Revolution . <p> I did talk to my ex and he said when he had Jax , he did this for about two weeks but he did n't bother taking him to the vet ( glad I got him back . ) Which leads me to believe it is something irritable . <p> The low white blood cell count still concerns me but I will look into that , as well . <p> I am defintely finding a new vet , too . I was really happy with them . They are super nice . I just do n't like these vague answers about my baby . I used to want to be a vet . I still wish I had instead of being in the corporate world .

This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of it ! <p> Jax 's Mom <p> Feb 25 , 2011Rating <p> Right to be concerned.by : Sherry <p> First , I do n't blame you for being concerned . Any good animal lover would be , in your shoes . That being said , I agree with the above post . I also would like to add that usually bright red blood is n't cause for alarm unless it is in large amounts . Dogs do have a tendency to eat the darnedest things ... could there be the possibility Jax ate something that might scratch inside ? Something as simple as a small piece of chewed plastic could do enough of a scratch coming out to cause blood . Has your vet even mentioned the possibility of the dog eating something that has splintered or scraped inside or even blockage ? Just a thought . In this case , small amounts of blood are not alarming , but large amounts are cause for concern and possibly the need for an ex-ray or scan of some type to make sure something has not punctured somewhere or blocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ? Is he still drinking plenty ? Is he still alert and normal otherwise or down ? Does he seem uncomfortable or can he get comfortable ? There is a lot about a dogs behavior that will help more accurately diagnose , but tummy troubles can be confusing . Any time you are not comfortable with a Dr 's opinion , you are always allowed to seek a second opinion ... it is your right for any member of your family that is under your direct care and not capable of making their own choices in those matters . If you are not comfortable and are still worried , you have the choice of wait and see ( following the vet 's advice ) or seek another opinion . You know your dog best and he depends on you to make the best choice for him ... which I am sure you will . <p> I hope everything turns out to be nothing serious with Jax and he is back to his normal self quickly . It is always difficult for me when one of my babies goes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extra bills . Just went through a very trying time with my pup and the vet so understand how you feel about doing whatever it takes to make sure your baby is ok . I 'll keep you guys in my prayers .

If you check out my Rottweiler Breed Standard page you 'll see that the medium range of adult height at shoulders ( withers ) for a male Rottweiler is between 63 - 64cms , and the correct adult height for a male ( ie within show specs ) is 65 - 66 cms . So your pup is right on track . <p> However , regardless of that and even if he was short for his age , adult height , weight and build are mostly determined by genetics ie. his parents ! <p> Obviously a good diet and proper veterinary care allow a puppy to reach his full potential , but his maximum height is set by his genes as is his natural ' normal ' weight .

Mainly if he is asleep and he is startled . But last nite my husband rolled back the chair and accidently hit Zues . He growled and started showing his teeth.My husband pulled his choker and held it tight for a minute . Zues was unharmed but I felt that it maybe was to much . This is my first rottie and my husband 's second rottie . Is it necessary to use a choker collar or force to show a rottie who the master is ? ? ? <p> I know they are a very stubborn breed I just do n't think that using force is good ... Please help me understand the breed better .. Also would letting him on my bed cause this recent shift in his personality ? <p> Thank you .... <p> Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's what this site is all about . <p> As for this recent development , it seems as though Zues is feeling very at home and secure now and is starting to try to ' test the boundaries ' and house-rules . That is normal for an adult male , but it is something you definitely need to take charge of . <p> Growling when startled from sleep is very common in all breeds , and not really surprising . If he growls at you in that situation , tell him " NO growl " firmly , and continue whatever it was you were doing . He will learn that you 're not happy when he does that . <p> The episode with the chair definitely needed a stronger correction than just a verbal ' No growl ' , but Rottweilers do n't need heavy-handed or harsh discipline . In fact being overly pushy in correcting them can result in an increase in aggression and definitely triggers their stubborn streak . A dog knows when he 's done something that does n't please you and accepts a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's ' too much ' then their inborn sense of cause-and-effect is upset and they get difficult . <p> I would n't let him sleep on your bed , or up on the sofa or other furniture while he 's trying to be ' bossy ' . It gives him an inflated sense of his own importance . Choke chains can work for Rottweilers when being walked or corrected , but I actually prefer to use a prong-collar because although it LOOKS nasty and like it would hurt , it is actually much safer to use and less likely to cause injury ... <p> Rotties are very strong and have dense neck muscles , they barely register being pulled on a choke chain and the amount of pressure required to make them feel it can actually bruise , or even crush , their larynx . However , with a prong collar it needs just a firm tug for them to be aware of the correction and no damage is done . <p> Rather than pull on the choke chain and keep the pressure on for a minute or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be better to use a short , sharp ' pop ' on the collar ( and you may want to try a prong collar ) combined with a verbal correction . Also getting hold of the loose skin on the back of his neck and giving it a quick shake while correcting him verbally may also work . <p> Zues is n't a bad boy , this is normal canine behavior and a developmental phase . It 's up to you to show him both firmly AND lovingly what is okay and what is n't . He will pick up on it quickly . <h> Comments for how do I show my rottie who is master ? ? <p> i ve adopted a one year rottie and it was very aggressive at its former home but when it reached here at my place it 's very lazy and silent what can i do coz i got to for guard . <p> Mar 16 , 2011Rating <p> thank youby : charlotte <p> thank you for the suggestions ... we have starting using the scruff of his neck to correct him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have tryed ...

I use the pin method starting from birth to correct any actions that I disapprove of , nipping , chewing etc . Since starting from a young age while doing this it does n't  take hardly any effort at all to do so . Just a light grab of the scruff and light pressure pushing towards the floor they go to the laying postion and you hold there until they calm down , while saying no to what ever they have been doing wrong . At first you might have some opposition which is normal , you just have to be consistant with this sort of correction and it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my wife feeling powerless and intimidated by this breed but she is able to pin out 120lbs male with minimal effort and he knows who 's master after that point . He usually has a sorry demeanor right after and licks us in the face after the correction . You 'll find yourself doing this quite a few times a day until they get the point , but like I said overtime it gets far and few in between as time goes on . It only happens now when he wants to test the rules , typical Rott ! To me this does n't  make him mean or aggressive at all its actually made him more of a big baby like rotts are 152137 @qwx562137

@@50394465 @3894465/ <h> Nervous about bringing a baby into our 2 Rottie household <p> by Diane ( Southern NJ ) <p> Hi . We have 2 German Rotties- Lilah ( 100 lbs , 6 yrs old , been with us since she was 8 wks ) &amp; Max ( 125 lbs , rescued 2 years ago , we think he 's about 8 &amp; aging quickly ) . Lilah is super dominant/alpha/stubborn . Max is submissive to her/loves to wander when he thinks we 're not looking/naps a lot . They 've fought in the past , but with more regular exercise &amp; stronger leadership from me ( they 've always seemed to listen to my husband even though I 'm the one who 's around more &amp; in charge of their care ) , there 's only been 1 fight in the past 7 months . <p> Lilah 's jealous of any attention Max gets from anyone , but especially my 9 year old stepdaughter . Her possessiveness of her is usually the root of the issue . Now , I 'm pregnant with my 1st &amp; I honestly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am VERY worried about Max . He has a very strong prey drive that seems to have intensified . For as slow as he 's become , if he sees something small or furry , he 's a young pup again on a mission . It does n't even have to be small - he chased a 6 point buck out of our yard &amp; deep into the woods last summer.Max was picked up as a stray , found wandering ( his favorite thing to do ) the streets of Newark . When he goes after something , it 's does n't seem to be a vicious crazed beast , it seems like that 's what he had to do in the past to survive , to eat . <p> We had a friend with a yorkie who used to stop by before Max joined the family . Lilah tried to play , but Benny was too small for her . She never tried to hurt him . We brought Benny over once after Max arrived . He scratched my friend 's car up trying to get to Benny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max almost brought me down to get to Benny who was terrified &amp; curled himself around my neck and under my hair to hide . Another time last summer , a friend was over with her 2 yr &amp; 1 yr old . Max wanted nothing more than to get to the baby . I had to physically lay on top of him to keep him from overwhelming the baby &amp; because in my gut , I did n't like the intensity he was showing trying to get to him . I did n't trust him . <p> Max is great with my stepdaughter , but I worry that he might view a baby and it 's movements as prey , not a member of the family . I want to work with him on this , but we do n't have access to too many parents who are willing to let their children be our guinea pigs in order to get him used to having a baby around . And I 'm not going to ask . <p> Hi DianeYou obviously know your dogs very well , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - that is very important . <p> From what you say about Max 's behavior it seems as though he has a very strong prey drive ( many Rotties do ) and this may have been intensified by events in his life before he came to live with you . <p> Given his previous behavior around small animals and very young children , I would be negligent if I said " do n't worry , he 'll be fine " because I think you actually have reason to be cautious here and to be very proactive about dealing with this behavior now , before your baby arrives . <p> It 's really impossible for me to try to deal with this sort of situation online and I 'm not a professional dog trainer , simply a Rottie owner and dog lover with a lot of personal experience ! I strongly recommend finding a local dog trainer who is familiar with large breeds ( such as GSD 's , Rotties and so on ) and have them meet Max , work with him some and assess his behavior . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your control and now is a good time to start . <p> Make sure that whoever you choose only uses positive , rewards-based methods and does n't subscribe to the idea that large guardian breeds need loud , harsh or punitive training methods . You 'd be surprised how many professionals still think that way . <p> As this is going to be your baby and part of his family - and will smell like your family and so on , Max may not feel that he/she is prey . He may accept the baby right away and know that he needs to protect it , not be suspicious of it . However , this is definitely not guaranteed and it would be foolish to take any chances . You will need to introduce them very slowly and carefully and obviously never leave Max ( or Lilah for that matter ) alone with the baby unsupervised , ever , no matter how good they seem to be with him/her . Max will have time to build a relationship with this baby and a tolerance for the sounds and movements a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very basic instinct and once instinct kicks in a dog really is n't thinking , he 's simply reacting and it 's coming from a very old , deep part of his brain . He 's not being ' bad ' or vicious , just a canine hardwired in a certain way . It will be up to you to make sure that there is n't a situation where this could cause harm to your baby . <p> In most cases this sort of behavior can be handled with lots of time , consistent training and vigilance , and the earlier you begin the better . You 're already a step ahead of the game because you 're aware of the potential problems and are ready to deal with them , so hopefully this will all have a happy ending . <p> I hope this has helped and I wish you all the very best of luck . <h> Comments for Nervous about bringing a baby into our 2 Rottie household <p> Dear get a grip , No worries .

@@50394469 @3894469/ <h> General Questions <p> by Chris ( Roanoke VA ) <p> Hello all , <p> I got a Rottie puppy at 9 weeks old , He is now 16 weeks I just have a few questions for some of the experienced people . I feed him Blue Buffalo Large Puppy Breed food , since he is 16 weeks now can I go to 2 times a day feeding . <p> Also I am struggling with his " nipping and biting " I could use some suggestions . I have 2 children and I really would like to solve this . He has a Nylabone , Rawhide bone , some rubber chew balls and a Kong ball . <p> Lastly , I am thinking about buying a " dog safe electric fence " any comments regarding those ? I do n't have a fenced in yard and I want him to be able to run more then he does right now . I take him for 2-3 30 minute walks a day and play with him with toy 's another 1-2 hours daily . <p> Thanks for the help ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puppy : ) Blue Buffalo is a good food and at 16 weeks you should be able to feed him twice a day without any problems . He may need a bit more per feeding , but you 'll soon figure out what he wants/needs by how much he eats each time . During the first year or so puppies have fluctuations in their appetite , usually corresponding to growth spurts ( and the ' lull ' in between ) . Just try to keep on top of that and be aware of how much he 's eating , or is n't at any given time . <p> I 've never used an electric fence for my dogs so am not sure which type it is you mean . Invisible fence ? I 'm sure other visitors can fill you in there . <p> As for the nipping and biting , this is perfectly normal although it can be frustrating and sometimes painful ! Follow the advice on my page that talks about puppy biting and be patient and consistent . He WILL learn but it takes time . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also use blue dog food , I am hoping rotties are prone to hip problems that if I started him out young with the supplements that are in that food that it will help as he gets old , since I adopted Max at 7months I started him on chix/rice puppy but always had loose stools my trainer suggested that the puppy food was to rich and changed to adult lamb/rice and that was perfect.I also no longer do rawhide anything , Max use to take them in the yard and twice I heard him choaking , he would chew them small enough and try to swallow the rest after reaching in his throat to get it that was enough , kong toys he did n't like and was smart enough that when I filled them with chopped treats he would bang them on the ground until they feel out game over.try JW toys very durable , great product <p> Jul 12 , 2012Rating <p> Dog food and chewingNEWby : Martha <p> Hi , I heard that Blue Buffalo is good .
