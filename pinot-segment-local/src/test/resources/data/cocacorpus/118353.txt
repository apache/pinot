This book was even better though because he has his sweet wife in the book as well . The chapters shift back and forth between him and his wife and there is one chapter that they talk together . It is so touching and so wonderful ! Some of the chapters come from talks that were given in the past and other chapters had things I had not heard before . This book is directed towards mothers though I believe single , child-less and older women could get something out of it as well .

Since I am not a mother , I did n't really expect it to apply to me much . But I love the Hollands , so I decided to read it first . I was so glad I did . For me , the second chapter by Patricia Holland was just what I needed . The message about priorities and taking care of ourselves as women was just what my little soul needed . The one thing that stood out to me was how she admonished us to not compare ourselves to others so that we can not only be less critical of our selves , but so we can also appreciate others gifts more fully . <p> It 's a great little gift book , but I recommend getting one for yourself too .

@@22087983 @2087983/ 3628 @qwx203628 <h> The Way Back to Heaven <h> The Power of the Parable <p> Sometime in my early life " in the dawning of my awareness that God had truths to share with me , and goodness to instill within me , and beauty to show me if I would listen , and be open , and observe " I received , in a few brief moments of internal seeing , a key to life . It came in a series of images somewhat like a parable " " The Parable of the Crystal Stairs " " and I have learned from it ever since . God is a gracious and a giving God . As my life progressed , I came to view with greater clarity and appreciation the interior landscape that played out in the creative drama of my mind , and was able to more thoughtfully apply its realities to the lives and experiences around me . <p> Perceptions given or enhanced by the Spirit are living things and grow continually throughout our lives . Their ability to guide and grant truth never diminishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple , and particularly true of the figurative , the symbol , the story , the similitude , the parable . That is the way of God . That is part of what it means to be infinite . God always runs ahead of our needs and , in his anticipatory seeing , prepares the way . Our job is to pay attention , to remember , and then to draw strength , insight , and intelligence from life ? s encounters , God 's gifts , and past endowments of mercy . We then come to understanding , recognition , and , above all , wakefulness . In that wakefulness we learn to be compassionate , to be kind , to show mercy , to love , and to be non-judging " to want as our deepest desire to think and feel and see just as Christ and the Father do . <p> The Parable of the Crystal Stairs has one dominant , clarifying vision " there is only one way to get to heaven . This sounds obvious , but it is remarkable how many people have uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their way is the way , to the exclusion of all others , or in believing it does n't much matter , as all roads lead to Rome , or they are simply apathetic or agnostic . To find that singular way back to heaven is humanity 's highest searching . I am a Latter-day Saint speaking to Latter-day Saints , and though we may feel quite comfortable on our path " and with our plan " if we 're not careful we 'll miss the whole point and get lost in the details of living a Mormon life . I fear too many of us live in a lingering sense of inadequacy and misty guilt , weights from which we would be liberated . Jesus came to show us not only how to climb but also how to remove the burdens we will allow Him to remove so that the stairs rising before us may not seem so insurmountable . <p> Ultimately I have come to believe that the climb " the ascent up the crystal stairs " has more to do with being and becoming than believing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never-to-be-forgotten truth . They are deeply interwoven but do not balance equally across the beam when weighed . Being and becoming almost always lead to correct and proper believing and doing , but the reversal of those positions does not necessarily hold true . We will explore this . People are usually somewhat surprised to learn that faith , in its earliest definition , seemed not so much centered on our assenting to a set of statements about God 's nature and our relation to Him as much as it was focused on creating our character ? the way we see and treat others , our pattern of thinking , and the quality of our soul . The stairs are there to help us on our upward journey ; we all have different steps on which to work . All are beautiful when mastered . Those that are easy for you may be a lifelong struggle for me . In a sense , the placement and sequence of the stairs are individualized for us in our Father 's grand mercy and wisdom . We also all carry with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our climb is to be successful . Those can be painful and soul-stretching moments . I have stared into the contents of my own burdens with both a desire for release and a tenacious grip that whispers , " In time , yes , but not now . " Yet the stairs forever beckon and we would be home . <p> Joseph Smith once wrote to William W. Phelps " perhaps the most poetic soul of the Restoration " " Oh , Lord , when will the time come when Brother William , Thy servant , and myself , shall behold the day that we may stand together and gaze upon eternal wisdom engraven upon the heavens , while the majesty of our God holdeth up the dark curtain until we may read the round of eternity , to the fulness and satisfaction of our immortal souls ? Oh , Lord , deliver us in due time from the little , narrow prison , almost as it were , total darkness of paper , pen and ink ; ? and a crooked , broken , scattered and imperfect language . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images , metaphors , and symbols " are one of the ways the Lord holds up that dark curtain . We see rather than read ; we sense rather than reason . So I offer a parable here in the hope that it may enable us to see , perhaps just a tiny bit more clearly , " the round of eternity " and our place within it . <p> I do not remember the context in which this parable came to me ; it happened so very long ago . I have no recollection of the catalyst , the source of contemplation that marked its creation . Perhaps that is best . Only the images have remained , but they have nourished me for a lifetime . I will portray the Parable of the Crystal Stairs in the pages that follow as I recall that first experience and subsequent pondering , followed by what I have learned from life and from the scriptures about the setting of the stairs , the distracting stairways of the world , the burdensome packages we all carry that delay our desired ascent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Builder and the beauty of some of the individual stairs we must climb . What awaits at the top of the stairs came to my understanding later in life and continues to be refined . I conclude with those insights . <p> Our earliest scripture tells the story of those who thought they could build a structure high enough to get to heaven , and of the consequences of that mistaken belief . In contrast , the prophet Jacob dreamed of a ladder sent down from heaven by God , with rungsstepsthat we could ascend to return to Him . In The Way Back to Heaven : The Parable of the Crystal Stairs , award-winning author S. Michael Wilcox helps us discern the " stairs of man " from the " stairs of God . " Using the metaphor of a beautiful crystal stairway , he shows us the difference between a focus on " being and becoming " and " believing and doing " in our life 's journey .

He attends church with a friend and discovers the healing love and acceptance of Christianity when he attends the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Cairo . Eventually seizing the opportunity to be baptized , Muhammad changes his name to Tito ( the Italian version of Titus ) and embraces the gospel tightly .

I could n't put it down . I finished it just moments ago , and the book has changed my life forever . <p> In many ways , Tito 's story is terribly tragic . He is disowned by his family , he loses the love of his life , he is repeatedly beaten and mocked , and he suffers fifteen years in prison for his beliefs before finally being released in 2006 for medical reasons--particularly diabetes , stroke , and heart problems . But at the same time , Tito 's story is one of glorious redemption .

Tito 's life is a reminder to me that no matter how dark life may seem to be , Christ will never forsake us . He will ALWAYS be there . <p> One note : In the book , Tito does not mince words in his descriptions of abuse , drug and alcohol use , sexuality , and harsh prison life . Some of his descriptions are graphic and are obviously not meant for children . However , for adults of all Christian faiths , I offer my highest recommendation for " My Name Used to Be Muhammad " .

This all-new , three-part seminar is designed to help parents get past the test of raising teenagers . Dr. Lund draws on his extensive background as a marriage and family mediator , as well as his experience of surviving his own eight teenagers , to deliver practical information and real solutions .

I think the over all message is an essential one , that motherhood is the best and most important job one could have . And the illustrations are gorgeous !

I could n't picture myself reading this page to my daughter and giving her the impression that mothers are off the hook when it comes to learning big words !

Is this teaching children to make decisions based on fears and what-ifs ? <p> I understand that this story may be trying to capture the way a child might think---flitting from ambition to ambition and dropping various interests based on really superficial reasons . But children are so impressionable , I worry about unintended lessons being taught here . <p> Of course , the ending tries to show how the main character can use all her talents and skills as a mother , which is also a fantastic point to drive home , and it partially remedies my concerns with the story .

When I downloaded this album , I had to listen to it immediately . The songs are written in the perspectives of those who were in contact with the Savior . Very touching music performed by the very best talent including Due West , David Archuleta , Katherine Nelson , SheDaisy , and others ! I have n't been able to stop listening to these uplifting songs , especially at a time when there is so much garbage out there . This is something I can listen to with my son and feel good about . I hope NTB can continue to write and perform their music !

@@22088076 @2088076/ 3628 @qwx203628 <p> Are science and religion in conflict with one another , or do they support each other ? Does one 's belief and allegiance to science discredit or disavow religion - or vice versa ? Many great scientists such as Newton and Einstein spoke and wrote freely of their religious thoughts and feelings , seeing no fundamental conflict between them and their science . Today there is a tendency to emphasize conflict more than harmony . Sometimes people of faith are criticized as blind , naive , or shallow , while scientists are painted as arrogant , unfeeling , or deceived . Educated dialogue between these two camps has too often been reduced to shallow platitudes or , even worse , silence . <p> The chemist who developed the absolute rate of chemical reactions theory , Henry Eyring , wrote , " The scientific method which has served so brilliantly in unraveling the mysteries of the world must be supplemented by something else if we are to enjoy to the fullest the blessings that have come of the knowledge gained . It is the great mission and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth , the life , ' that they might utilize the discoveries of the laboratory to their blessing and not to their destruction . " Eyring 's teachings suggest that when the discoveries of the scientific method become working partners with faith , each enhances the other to the blessing of humankind . <p> Truth is not in conflict with itself . Religious truth is established through revelation , and scientific inquiry has uncovered many facts that have thus far stood the test of time . It is incumbent upon us to seek insights into all truth to mesh together , where possible , its parts at their proper interface . We discover bridges between scientific and religious knowledge best if we pursue them through study , faith , and ongoing dialogue .

We learn something about the answer to the question from a simple historic fact : In 1842 , the Prophet Joseph Smith took time to attend several meetings of the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo and give personal instruction to the women there . He did this at a time of great personal turmoil , when persecutions were raging and his responsibilities were heavy . He did it at a time when society barely acknowledged women as having any kind of status at all . On six separate occasions , he taught the women personally about their privileges , their opportunities , their obligations , and the blessings the Lord had in store for them in His kingdom . <p> The Beginning of Better Days includes Joseph Smith 's six timeless sermons to the women of Nauvoo , along with personal essays from Sheri Dew and Virginia H.

For some reason this book was not one she shared and when she started following how she interpreted its counsel our communication has crashed .

The book tells the reader to set up boundries against the spouse until you feel safe- which in principle I can see , but the boundries and distances are not a mutually discussed activity ( pg 58 ) and as I read it , really just seem to be an effort to empowerment of identifying how the spouse can " control " her surroundings .

In recent years I have begun to read many books , articles , and the like that seek to expand the underdeveloped field of LDS apologetics . The mainstream Christians began developing and fine-tuning their " Arguments in Defense of ... " centuries ago , but the LDS branch of the Christian faith , young though it may be , has been sorely lacking in this area . By not making fact-based apologetic discussions a serious piece of Sunday School , Seminary , Institute , Devotionals , and even General Conference , the faith that many hold so dear has been losing adherents , largely because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to change , and change quickly . Books like Hales ' represent a step in the right direction . <p> Section by section the contributors to Hales ' project present clear , concise , well-researched , and thoroughly readable theses on a wide variety of vital contemporary topics . The writers do not shy away from difficult subjects , and they are quick to give readers the assertions and arguments of dissidents and critics , as well as those of the apologetic community , which helps greatly in understanding why some of these topics are or have been controversial . In such a presentation , the curious and concerned are invited to choose for themselves which side of the argument they find most compelling . I did n't feel much , if any , information was deemed too " vexatious " to divulge , and the range of topics covered was quite adequate , though two or three more books on additional issues could easily be written- and I encourage Hales to do so ! <p> ' A Reason for Faith ' is the perfect book for the difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was previously " taboo " or " controversial " for church members in a concise , clear way . The essays provided many answers to subjects I previously had been afraid to research ( Kinderhook Plates , rumors about Joseph Smith ) . This does n't mean that the book answered every single question I had , but it provided general , official answers for every topic . If you or someone you know is looking for answers on controversial or difficult topics and do n't know where to look , this book is an excellent place to start .

He served as a missionary on the original mission to the Lamanites , participated in Zion 's Camp , was Second Counselor in the First Presidency for five years , and for twelve years was the principal doctor for the Saints in Ohio , Missouri , and Illinois , until his death in 1842. 3627 @qwx203627 <h> Reviews 3633 @qwx203633 3632 @qwx203632 <p> Excellently researched book that demonstrates the significant contributions and faith of this veteran in the gospel By Warren , Submitted on 2015-02-25 <p> Few are acquainted with Joseph Smith 's second counselor in the fully organized original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely know more than the Lord 's admonition to put his house in order ( along with the entire First Presidency ) or that he was labeled an " apostate " . This book ably fills a gap in the collective memory of the Latter-day Saints regarding a man who gave everything to the Restored Church and was a faithful friend to Joseph Smith . There are documentary treasures about Williams ' contribution to the existence and dedication of the Kirtland Temple , including compelling evidence the temple was built on Williams ' consecrated land and a very sacred spiritual experience . It contains a biographical sketch of Williams from Joseph ( which he rarely gave ) and the attendant prophecy regarding Williams . It shows a man who was soft spoken , particularly compared to his counterpart , Sydney Rigdon . The one fault Joseph identified in Williams was a lack of confidence in himself , which would account for his failure to defend himself in the face of accusation . One sees the curious dichotomy of Joseph wishing to drop Sydney for the " millstone " Joseph described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Presidency , and Joseph calling for a sustaining vote of Frederick , but the saints voting him out . In the record you find that only one branch of the Church voted Williams out of the First Presidency ( in abstentia ) despite the vocal support of the likes of Edward Partridge . One also sees the efforts of several , including Hyrum Smith to reconcile competing branches ' votes and retain Williams . There is evidence of Williams ' continued loyalty to the prophet and the Church in the midst of accusations . For example , Williams visits Joseph at Liberty Jail just days before Williams ' excommunication ( in abstentia ) for " abandoning " the saints . <p> Conspicuously absent from the historical record is a public rebuke from Joseph Smith , which Joseph was not shy in giving where warranted . Also conspicuously absent is any public criticism of Joseph by Frederick . There is a friendship and love between the men that leads Joseph to name a son " Frederick Granger Williams Smith " . <p> The documents unfold a picture of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line with a temporarily befuddled Parley P.

Parley speaks of Frederick 's faithfulness in the Church in which Frederick died a faithful member two years before Joseph 's martyrdom . <p> There are many more gems regarding the practice of law ( as a justice of the peace ) and medicine ( as the saints ' primary doctor in Ohio , Missouri and Illinois ) . Williams ' medical ledger is gem of its own as a ' whose who ' of members of the church receiving treatment . Here you see that Joseph Smith and Frederick G. Williams signed the elder 's license of one of the first African American saints , Elijah Abel . One finds that the firm F.G . Williams &amp; Co. did not just print materials for the Church but other entities in the community near Kirtland . This book identifies the extant documents and puts them in context .

Read the next 354 pages to find out ! But not even , because the story on page 6 will probably not be referred to again , let alone its searing question resolved in specific . <p> You see , some will read that partial-story on page 6 , and then just set the book down with an awful despair that inspiration may just be an illusion after all . Why ? Because they never got the rest of the story . They are left to piece together the concepts that follow in the rest of the book in order to write their own explanation for the story on page 6 . <p> Faithful Latter-day Saints deserve much better clarity about an absolutely crucial point of doctrine . A priesthood holder 's life revolves around it , as does any sister 's . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers , " nevertheless , we can hope for CLARITY , especially about issues that rock the core of a diligent Latter-day Saint 's heart . <p> Someone might say , " Well , then just read the remaining 354 pages ! " Perhaps . But there 's something to be said about the following quote : " If you ca n't fit your idea on the back of my business card then you do n't have a clear idea . " Most great ideas are simple . With the issue of ' can I really trust divine inspiration in my life ' , it would have been nice to be given a clear idea . We did n't get it there at the outset where it should have been . <p> Amazing ! ! By Tasha , Submitted on 2015-02-25 <p> this book is so powerful , it really helps you understand personal revelation , well worth the read . <p> This is the first time I 've read Lund , and indeed , he 's left a great first impression ( pun intended ) . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he simply paints a collage including personal and others ' anecdotes , apostolic and scriptural references , and thoughtful reflection . Perhaps the strongest point in the book is it 's easily applicable , and should be applied . My only minor quibble ( I stress the word " minor " ) is that if you 're well-versed in Oaks and Packer , you 'll be seeing a lot of General Conference material that you probably already have marked up in a box somewhere . But , then again , that 's also a great strength to the book . Overall , definitely worth your time . Just make sure to have a pen handy . <p> " CLICK !

By Ann , Submitted on 2015-02-25 <p> Gerald Lund makes you think as you read this book . Think about where you stand in your relationship with the Lord , and how open you are to inspiration , or just wishful thinking ! You could race through the book and set it down and that 's the end of it . But the wise student would think , ponder and apply how prayer , meditation and putting into practice what Elder Lund says can truly benefit their lives <p> Inspiring !

When I first purchased it I was concerned with it 's length and why it would take 350 pages to explain the topic . I am amazed that the concept has so many facets to it . There are so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ways that we prevent ourselves from receiving it . This book was simple and easy to read . Elder Lund provides many examples of how to apply these principles to our lives and I would highly recommend it . <p> Truly Amazing book ! By Carolyn , Submitted on 2015-02-25 <p> I finished reading the book . L love the book ! This book should be on the book shelf in every LDS home . I found myself highlighting just about every page in the book . Gerald Lund talks on the delicate nature of personal revelation and its application in our lives . It is a wonderfully written book and should be read more often throughout the year . I know I will be reading the book again and again as it has helped me to understand how personal revelation works in my life .

I highly recammend this book . <p> Makes clear a vital component of the gospel.By Gayle , Submitted on 2015-02-25 <p> I absolutely loved this book . Brother Lund 's last conference talk was a mini-version of the book---I understood revelation so much better after reading this . The explanation of the types of revelation and the range , from a quiet thought or feeling to personal visitations , was a revelation in itself . Brother Lund explained that the more subtle types are much more common , the ways most of us receive revelation on a regular basis , while the more spectacular types are much more rare and reserved for times of particular need . ( So we do n't need to feel badly that we do n't seem to get those more " flashy " types of revelation . ) This is a book that bears reading and re-reading . <p> Very inspirational bookBy Zach , Submitted on 2015-02-25 <p> I borrowed this book from a friend , and had a hard time giving it back ! : ) It is a powerful book that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
