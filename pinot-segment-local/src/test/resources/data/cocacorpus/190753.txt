In particular , management believes that core operating earnings , pretax income before restructuring costs and other special items , adjusted net income , adjusted earnings per share and tax expense excluding the impact of restructuring costs and other special items are useful measures in assessing the Company 's financial performance by excluding certain items that are not indicative of the Company 's core operating performance or that may obscure trends useful in evaluating the Company 's continuing operating activities. -

Further , management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting future periods . <p> Core operating earnings , pretax income before restructuring costs and other special items , adjusted net income , adjusted earnings per share , tax expense excluding the impact of restructuring costs and other special items and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for pretax income before equity income , net income attributable to Lear , diluted net income per share attributable to Lear , cash provided by operating activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of profitability or liquidity. - In addition , the calculation of free cash flow does not reflect cash used to service debt and , therefore , does not reflect funds available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial measures , as determined and presented by the Company , may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies . <p> For reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP , see the attached supplemental data pages which , together with this press release , have been posted on the Company 's website through the investor relations link at http : //www.lear.com . <p> Given the inherent uncertainty regarding special items and other expense in any future period , a reconciliation of forward-looking financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is not feasible. - The magnitude of these items , however , may be significant . 30064 @qwx650064 30069 @qwx650069 <p> Information in this press release relies on assumptions in the Company 's sales backlog. - The Company 's sales backlog reflects anticipated net sales from formally awarded new programs less lost and discontinued programs. -

Lear will now introduce product and technology solutions as one of seven consumer-focused dimensions : Comfort &amp; Convenience , Commonization , Craftsmanship , Environmental , Flexibility , Infotainment and Safety . These categories highlight dimensions of consumer emphasis where Lear innovation can make vehicles more attractive to consumers and potentially influence a purchasing decision . <p> With the core dimension strategy , Lear underscores its ability to provide automakers with the interior features categorized in the most frequently mentioned areas of importance by drivers as well as Lear 's customers .

This year 's program featured eleven categories of nominations covering applications that demonstrated remarkable cost and environmental improvement while providing added value in weight and performance . <p> Lear 's FreeForm technology enables cost-effective manufacturing of large interior plastic panels with multiple materials in one machine .

" <p> Unique to the manufacturing process is the ability to mold large components in one 60-second cycle time , eliminating secondary parts , presses , labor and equipment . In addition to delivering a complete part with less downstream assembly and lower operating costs , a major benefit is enhanced quality as a result of the QTI 's ability to produce molded-in gaps to produce crisp lines and improved fit and finish . <p> Another key advantage is flexibility .

Dozens of teams made up of OEMs , tier suppliers , and polymer producers submit nominations describing their part , system or complete vehicle module and why it merits the claim as Year 's Most Innovative Use of Plastics .

American Real Estate Partners , L.P. ( " AREP " ) , an affiliate of Carl Icahn , has made an offer of $36 per share in cash to purchase all the outstanding shares of Lear . As members of an independent special committee of the Lear Board , and on behalf of the full Board of Directors , we recommend that you vote in favor of the AREP proposal . Our position is outlined in the Proxy Statement that has been mailed to you . <p> Some Lear stockholders have publicly opposed the merger . In addition , Institutional Shareholder Services ( " ISS " ) has recommended a vote against the transaction . ISS states that while the AREP merger proposal offers fair value , it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's standalone value . This led ISS to the conclusion that the strategic rationale for the transaction " although reasonable , is not necessarily compelling . " <p> In this letter , we would like to address the principal concerns raised by critics of the transaction and review the major reasons why Lear 's Board strongly recommends a vote in favor of the AREP proposal . In order to provide additional time for you to evaluate the company 's response to recent criticisms of the proposed merger with AREP , we have rescheduled our Annual Meeting of Stockholders for July 12 , 2007 . <p> It was just over a year-ago , when Lear shares were trading in the mid- teens and many industry analysts and observers were speculating about the company 's viability . Since then , Lear has completed several strategic initiatives but key industry trends and longer-term risks have not improved . At the time of the AREP offer , $36 per share represented a meaningful premium compared with Lear 's recent trading history : 29% above the price one month prior to the offer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ISS , our financial advisors , the special committee and full Board of Directors , all concluded that the AREP proposal offers fair value to Lear stockholders . Traditional valuation techniques support the fairness of the $36 per share offer price and indeed , imply a premium valuation depending on the assumptions and benchmarks utilized . ISS acknowledges that the $36 offer is in-line with fair value based on its own discounted cash flow analysis . The transaction value ( including off-balance sheet financing ) represented a multiple of 6.2x 2007 EBITDA at the time of the merger agreement and 6.1x EBITDA based on our latest 2007 outlook . Additionally , there is no dispute that Lear had a reasonable opportunity to seek out higher offers and actively did so . We contacted 41 potential strategic and financial buyers without receiving a single competing acquisition proposal . <p> Fundamentally , the decision of whether to support the AREP proposal comes down to whether the incremental value implied by Lear 's Long-Range Plan outweighs the execution risk inherent in that Plan . In this regard , even those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lear as the automotive industry undergoes unprecedented levels of distress and restructuring , particularly in North America . The principal difference between those who support and oppose the transaction lies in how one assesses the significance of these risks relative to the opportunities presented by Lear 's Long-Range Plan . <p> While we acknowledge that this assessment may very well depend on a given stockholder 's investment horizon , we ultimately concluded that industry conditions in the company 's major markets are likely to continue to be challenging for the foreseeable future , posing significant execution risk to Lear 's standalone plan . We strongly believe that the special committee , the full Board of Directors , management and our advisors are in the best position to weigh these risks and opportunities . In our view , critics of the AREP transaction are significantly underestimating these risks and the impact they could have on Lear 's business . <p> In referring to execution risk , we are not speaking of the traditional risks inherent in the cyclical automotive business , but rather the impact of long-term structural change that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second half of 2006 Lear 's largest three customers announced capacity reductions in North America totaling 2.6 million vehicles . At the same time , demand for light trucks and large SUV 's is under continuing pressure , due to high fuel prices , increased global competition and environmental concerns . According to a June 9th New York Times article , pickup truck sales are down 5% so far this year from a " weak " market last year . For 2007 , U.S. automakers expect to post the lowest sales of pickups in seven years . In addition , major Asian automakers are aggressively seeking to further penetrate this vehicle segment . These trends are very significant to Lear since about 85% of our net sales in North America are from the domestic automakers and about two-thirds of the company 's revenue in North America comes from light trucks . Light trucks in North America constitute high- content platforms , and , therefore it will be difficult to offset declines in this segment with new business in Asia and other growth markets . <p> In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in North America , lower sales of high-content vehicles and an increasingly competitive global market , poses challenges to our organic growth . Historically , Lear has enjoyed a substantial sales backlog and robust revenue growth ; however , the outlook for net sales over the planning horizon is relatively flat . Accordingly , the projected improvement in Lear 's earnings is driven primarily by major restructuring actions which are costly to implement and carry significant execution risk . These restructuring actions began in 2005 and are expected to continue for a number of years , with the most challenging actions yet to come . <p> While Lear has a strong market share in Seating , it is weighted toward SUV 's and light trucks . Going forward , the company needs to become more vertically integrated and accelerate its move to low-cost regions to remain cost competitive and maintain margins . While growth with Asian automakers offers significant opportunity , this is a long-term prospect . Also , the emergence of Asian suppliers is a potential longer-term threat . In the Electronic and Electrical segment , Lear 's operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of aggressive global competition . In our view , this segment will require significant investment to strengthen our market position and continue to evolve our global footprint . <p> Focusing on recent improvements in the company 's financial performance , ISS and certain stockholders have suggested that Lear is on the road to a significant recovery . To some extent , this is true . Our Long-Range Plan forecasts improvements in our earnings each year during the planning period , including 2007 . We would , however , caution against placing too much emphasis on the first half of this year . Improved performance so far this year is primarily due to higher-than-expected production on certain platforms in North America and the accelerated realization of cost improvements in International operations . The more favorable performance in the first half of 2007 has not materially changed our longer-term outlook . To this point , the consensus 2007 full year forecast for industry production in North America has remained largely unchanged ; with J.D. Power now forecasting lower production in 2007 and subsequent years , as compared with prior forecasts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some are now taking a more positive view of the near-term outlook , we would caution that in the highly- competitive automotive market , sentiment can change very quickly . <p> In its report , ISS suggested that the desire to invest for the long-term and escape Wall Street 's quarterly earnings focus were driving forces behind the proposed AREP transaction . This is not true . While the company does indeed need to maintain a long-term focus to be successful and short-term expectations can be distracting and potentially harmful , the driving force behind the AREP transaction was the Board 's commitment to maximize shareholder value . The Board 's decision to recommend approval of the AREP transaction to stockholders followed a Board-initiated strategic planning process that began in 2005 . We were quite prepared to consider the AREP proposal when it was made and had the benefit of Board members with many years of experience in the automotive industry and with acquisition transactions . The Board took great care to evaluate every aspect of the AREP proposal , and was actively involved in overseeing the negotiations with Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been much speculation about our CEO Bob Rossiter 's motivation in this transaction , we can assure you that Mr. Rossiter 's personal interests had no impact on the decision-making process or outcome . While Bob had a role in representing the company in the negotiations , given his extensive knowledge of the company and industry , there was active oversight by the special committee and significant involvement by the committee 's financial and legal advisors on all substantive issues . Ultimate authority for the AREP negotiations rested with the special committee and the Board . In this matter , Bob acted at the direction of the special committee and , as he has consistently done during his entire 35-year career , in the best interests of the company and its stockholders . <p> Finally , the suggestion that the company was seeking to evade " intense corporate governance and social responsibility scrutiny directed at public corporations " is inaccurate . Under the AREP transaction , Lear would be the largest subsidiary of a publicly-traded NYSE corporation and would be indirectly subject to many of the same public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for its business is stability - not less scrutiny . Volatile industry and market conditions can , and have , impacted the ability of the company to execute its Long-Range Plan . Lear management does believe with a strong financial sponsor the company can more efficiently accomplish the major restructuring necessary to remain competitive and better respond to strategic opportunities when they arise , without being impacted by fluctuations in the price of its stock and the perceptions they create . In this regard , we would again point to the first quarter of 2006 when unfounded market speculation and panic led to fears of a Lear bankruptcy . <p> In summary , Lear is a great company operating in a volatile industry that is undergoing unprecedented levels of distress and massive restructuring . Longer-term trends are not favorable - and it will take a continuation of industry-wide consolidation and restructuring , including substantial additional investment to secure the longer-term future . While the company has implemented a number of near-term initiatives to improve shareholder value , significant industry risk remains . ISS acknowledges that " there are indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the company 's management and Board of Directors are in the best position to assess these risks , and the potential impact on Lear 's future results . In this regard , some of the views expressed by opponents of the transaction , including attempts to minimize the potential impact of the serious financial issues impacting our major customers , are totally inaccurate . <p> Based on a very careful , deliberate and objective process of assessing Lear 's overall business outlook , the Board has concluded that the offer of $36 per share is a fair price , and we urge you to vote in favor of the merger proposal at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders now scheduled for July 12 , 2007 . <p> This letter is being mailed to the stockholders of Lear Corporation who are eligible to vote at the annual meeting of stockholders being held for the purposes set forth in the proxy statement which was first mailed to Lear stockholders on or about May 23 , 2007 , as supplemented by a Supplement first mailed to stockholders on or about June 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock as of the close of business on May 14 , 2007 are entitled to notice of , and to vote at , the meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the meeting .

Morgan Joseph was engaged to provide an opinion as to the fairness to AREP , from a financial point of view , of the consideration to be paid by AREP in the merger , including to comply with provisions of indentures governing AREP indebtedness .

Morgan Joseph Opinion ? ) that , as of such date , and based upon the assumptions made , matters considered and limitations of its review set forth therein , the consideration to be paid by AREP in the merger was fair , from a financial point of view , to AREP . <p> The description of the Morgan Joseph Opinion set forth in this section is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Morgan Joseph Opinion . You are urged to read the Morgan Joseph Opinion in its entirety for a description of the procedures followed , assumptions made , matters considered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review and analyses undertaken by Morgan Joseph in furnishing to the API Committees the Morgan Joseph Opinion . The Morgan Joseph Opinion is filed as Exhibit ( c ) ( 4 ) hereto . <p> The Morgan Joseph Opinion is addressed and was furnished solely to the API Committees and addresses only the fairness , from a financial point of view , of the consideration to be paid by AREP in the merger . It does not address the merits of the underlying business decision by AREP , the API Committees or any of AREP ? s affiliates or constituents to propose , consider , approve , recommend , declare advisable or consummate the merger , and does not constitute a recommendation to AREP , the API Committees , AREP ? s full board of directors , the holders of MLP units , or any other AREP constituent , person or entity as to any specific action that should be taken ( or not be taken ) in connection with the merger or as to any strategic or financial alternatives to the merger or as to the timing of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan Joseph Opinion , Morgan Joseph reviewed and analyzed , among other things , the following : <p> ? <p> the February 6 , 2007 draft of the merger agreement ( which at such date Morgan Joseph assumed was , with respect to all material terms and conditions thereof , substantially in the form of the definitive agreement executed and delivered by the parties thereto ) ; <p> ? <p> the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by Lear with the SEC for its fiscal year ended December 31 , 2005 , the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed by Lear with the SEC for its fiscal quarters ended April 1 , 2006 , July 1 , 2006 , September 30 , 2006 , and certain other filings made by Lear with the SEC under the Exchange Act ; <p> the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by AREP with the SEC for its fiscal year ended December 31 , 2005 , the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed by AREP with the SEC for its fiscal quarters ended March 31 , 2006 , June 30 , 2006 and September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by AREP with the SEC ; <p> ? <p> certain other publicly available business and financial information concerning Lear and AREP , respectively , and the industries in which they operate , which Morgan Joseph believed to be relevant ; <p> ? <p> certain internal information and other data relating to Lear and AREP , respectively , and their respective business and prospects , including budgets , projections and certain presentations prepared by Lear and AREP , respectively , which were provided to Morgan Joseph by AREP ? s senior management ; <p> ? <p> the reported sales prices and trading activity of Lear ? s common stock ; <p> ? <p> certain publicly available information concerning certain other companies which Morgan Joseph believed to be relevant and the trading markets for certain of such other companies ? securities ; <p> ? <p> the financial terms of certain recent unrelated transactions which Morgan Joseph believed to be relevant ; and <p> ? <p> the resolutions of the board of directors of API , dated February 2 , 2007 , establishing and appointing the membership of the special committee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mandate with respect to the proposed merger , a complete and correct copy of which were provided to Morgan Joseph by AREP ? s senior management . <p> Morgan Joseph also participated in various conferences with certain officers , directors ( including the members of the API Committees ) , employees and outside consultants of AREP and its affiliates concerning the business , operations , assets , financial condition and prospects of AREP and Lear , respectively , and undertook such other studies , analyses and investigations as Morgan Joseph deemed relevant to the Morgan Joseph Opinion . <p> In performing its analyses , numerous assumptions were made with respect to industry performance , general business , economic , market and financial conditions and other matters , many of which are beyond the control of Morgan Joseph , Mr. Icahn , API , AREP , Parent , Merger Sub and Lear . Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by Morgan Joseph are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results , which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such analyses . Additionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which those businesses or securities might actually be sold . Accordingly , the analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty . <p> In preparing the Morgan Joseph Opinion , Morgan Joseph assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all financial and other publicly available information and data used by it and did not attempt independently to verify such information , nor did Morgan Joseph assume any responsibility or liability to do so . Morgan Joseph also assumed and relied upon the assurances of senior management of AREP and its affiliates that no relevant information had been omitted or remained undisclosed to Morgan Joseph , and Morgan Joseph did not attempt independently to verify any such information , nor did Morgan Joseph assume any responsibility or liability to do so . Morgan Joseph assumed that the forecasts and projections of Lear , which were provided by AREP ? s senior management and reviewed by Morgan Joseph , had been reasonably prepared based on the best current estimates , information and judgment of AREP ? s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future financial condition , cash flows and results of operations of AREP and Lear and their consolidated subsidiaries , respectively . Morgan Joseph neither made an investigation of any such forecasts or projections or the assumptions on which they are based , nor did it assume any responsibility to do so . Morgan Joseph further assumed that the transfer of substantially all of the assets of Lear ? s North American interior business segment to IAC North America will be completed and that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the merger agreement , without any economic or material further amendments thereto or modification thereof , and without any waiver by AREP or Lear of any of the conditions to their respective obligations thereunder . <p> Morgan Joseph made no independent investigation of any legal , accounting or tax matters affecting Lear , AREP or any of their respective affiliates , or the merger , and Morgan Joseph assumed the accuracy and completeness of all legal , accounting and tax advice provided to AREP and the API Committees by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional advisors . Morgan Joseph did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties , assets or facilities of Lear or AREP , nor did it make or obtain any independent valuation or appraisal of such properties , assets or facilities . Morgan Joseph also took into account its assessment of general economic , market and financial conditions and its experience in transactions that , in whole or in part , it deemed to be relevant for purposes of its analyses , as well as its experience in securities valuation in general . <p> The Morgan Joseph Opinion necessarily is based upon economic , market , financial and other conditions as they existed on February 9 , 2007 and does not address the fairness of the consideration to be paid by AREP to holders of Lear ? s common stock in the proposed merger on any other date . Morgan Joseph expressed no opinion as to the price at which the depositary units of AREP or any other securities will trade at any future time . <p> In connection with furnishing to the API Committees the Morgan Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are summarized below . These analyses were presented to the API Committees at a meeting held on February 9 , 2007 . The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Morgan Joseph in this regard . The preparation of an opinion regarding financial fairness involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analyses and the application of these methods to the particular circumstances , and , therefore , such an opinion is not readily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description . Accordingly , notwithstanding the separate analyses summarized below , Morgan Joseph believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors considered by it , without considering all of its analyses and factors , or attempting to ascribe relative weights to some or all of its analyses and factors , could create an incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying the Morgan Joseph Opinion . <p> The financial forecasts and forward-looking financial data of Lear and AREP , which were furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its analyses , were prepared by the management of Lear and AREP , respectively . Morgan Joseph was advised by the API Committees that neither Lear nor AREP publicly discloses financial forecasts or forward-looking financial data of the type provided to Morgan Joseph in connection with its review of the proposed merger , and , as a result , these financial forecasts and forward-looking financial data were not prepared by Lear and AREP , respectively , with a view towards public disclosure or in accordance with any AICPA or other prescribed accounting guidelines or published best practices for public company financial forecasts or projections . Morgan Joseph was specifically informed by management of Lear and AREP , respectively , that these financial forecasts and forward-looking financial data were based on numerous variables and assumptions developed and applied in good faith by management of Lear and AREP , respectively . These variables and assumptions are inherently uncertain , including , without limitation , factors related to general market , industry , economic and competitive conditions . Accordingly , Morgan Joseph was informed that actual results could vary significantly from those set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No company or transaction used in the analyses described below is identical to AREP , Lear or the proposed merger . Accordingly , an analysis of the results thereof necessarily involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the proposed merger or the public trading or other values of AREP , Lear or companies to which they are being compared . Mathematical analysis ( such as determining an average or median ) is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected acquisition or company data . In addition , in performing such analyses , Morgan Joseph relied , without any independent verification , on projections prepared by research analysts at established securities firms , any of which may or may not prove to be accurate . <p> The following is a summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Joseph in connection with the Morgan Joseph Opinion . <p> Using publicly available information , Morgan Joseph reviewed the purchase prices and multiples paid in the following selected merger and acquisition transactions involving companies in the automotive interior systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial terms of the proposed merger ( the ? Selected Transactions ? ) , presented below in Acquiror/Target format ( with parenthetical reverse chronological date of announcement ) : <p> Morgan Joseph applied a methodology similar to the one it used in its selected publicly traded companies analysis described below , but relied on multiples derived from merger and acquisition transactions involving target companies in industries similar , although not identical , based on their participation in one or more product segments in which Lear competes . These product segments include , but are not limited to , automotive interior seating , electrical distribution systems and select electronic and other products . <p> Morgan Joseph considered all of the Selected Transactions ( which ranged in transaction value from $4.725 billion to $452.8 million ) as a group and did not view any single transaction to be more relevant than the others . The financial information reviewed by Morgan Joseph included the purchase prices and multiples paid by the acquiring company of the acquired company ? s financial results over the twelve-month period preceding the acquisition ( ? LTM ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Based on this analysis , Morgan Joseph derived a valuation range of 5.1x to 6.8x Lear ? s 2006 adjusted EBITDA of $856.0 million to arrive at an implied share price range for Lear of $28.71 to $47.80 , yielding a median implied share price of $38.50 . The merger consideration is within this range of implied share prices . The implied share price range set forth above assumed adjustments to EBITDA to eliminate the results of Lear ? s North American interior business segment , which is pending divestiture , and to eliminate certain charges considered to be of a non-recurring nature including goodwill and fixed asset impairment and restructuring charges ( the ? EBITDA Adjustments ? ) . Lear has classified such business segment in Note 2 to Lear ? s consolidated financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31 , 2006 as constituting ? assets and liabilities held for sale ? . The range of EBITDA multiples applied by Morgan Joseph reflect the 25 th percentile , at the low end , and the 75 th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Selected Transactions . <p> Using publicly available information , Morgan Joseph reviewed the stock prices ( at February 2 , 2007 ) and selected market trading multiples of the following companies ( the ? Selected Companies ? ) : <p> ? <p> American Axle &amp; Manufacturing Holdings Inc. ; <p> ? <p> Dana Corp. ; <p> ? <p> Faurecia SA ; <p> ? <p> Johnson Controls Inc. ; <p> ? <p> Magna International , Inc. ; <p> ? <p> TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. ; <p> ? <p> Valeo SA ; and <p> ? <p> Visteon Corp . <p> The financial information reviewed by Morgan Joseph included market trading multiples exhibited by the Selected Companies with respect to their LTM , their 2006 estimated financial performance and their 2007 estimated financial performance . The table below provides a summary of these comparisons : <p> Multiples Observed from the Selected Companies <p> 25 th Percentile <p> 50 th Percentile <p> 75 th Percentile <p> Multiple of Enterprise Value : <p> /LTM EBITDA <p> 4.5x <p> 4.9x <p> 5.7x <p> /2006 Estimated EBITDA <p> 4.7x <p> 5.5x <p> 6.2x <p> /2007 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiples shown in the table above exclude Johnson Controls from the averages . Johnson Controls is a direct competitor of Lear in the automotive seating business . However , approximately 43% of Johnson Control ? s revenues in fiscal 2006 and approximately 66% of operating income , excluding restructuring costs , were derived from businesses other than Johnson Control ? s automotive interior systems and products . As a result , Morgan Joseph believed that Johnson Controls multiples were not indicative of comparable public companies in the automotive parts industry . <p> The financial information reviewed by Morgan Joseph also included market trading multiples exhibited by Lear with respect to its LTM , its 2006 estimated financial performance and its 2007 estimated financial performance , as set forth in the table below : <p> Multiples for Lear <p> Multiple of Enterprise Value : <p> /LTM EBITDA <p> 6.8x <p> /2006 Estimated EBITDA <p> 6.8x <p> /2007 Estimated EBITDA <p> 5.4x <p> Based on this analysis , Morgan Joseph derived a valuation range of 4.5x to 6.2x Lear ? s 2006 adjusted EBITDA of $856.0 million to arrive at an implied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielding a median implied share price of $30.45 . The merger consideration is within this range of implied share prices . The implied share price range set forth above took into account the EBITDA Adjustments . The range of EBITDA multiples applied by Morgan Joseph reflect the 25 th percentile , at the low end , and the 75 th percentile , at the high end , of the range of the Selected Companies . <p> Because of the inherent differences in the business operations , financial condition and prospects of Lear , and the business operations and financial condition of the Selected Companies , Morgan Joseph did not rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected publicly traded companies analysis . Morgan Joseph also made non-mathematical , qualitative and subjective judgments concerning differences between the characteristics of the comparable companies and Lear which , in its judgment , could affect the values of such companies . The non-mathematical qualitative and subjective judgments made by Morgan Joseph included an evaluation of the different stages of maturity and the industry cycle of each Selected Company . <p> Morgan Joseph selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculating Lear ? s implied weighted average cost of capital ( ? WACC ? ) . Lear ? s WACC was calculated by using various assumptions , including , but not limited to , an assumed cost of equity of 14.4% to 18.1% , an assumed pre-tax cost of debt of 8.5% , and an assumed marginal tax rate of 38% . The WACC calculation resulted in an approximate 11% discount rate for Lear which was used as a midpoint for the 10%-12% discount rate range . <p> Morgan Joseph performed a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the present value of the stand-alone , unlevered , after-tax free cash flows that Lear was projected to generate over the calendar years 2006 through 2010 , based on internal estimates provided by Lear ? s and AREP ? s managements . Unlevered free cash flow represents the amount of cash generated and available for principal , interest and dividend payments after providing for the funding of Lear ? s ongoing business operations . These cash flows were discounted to a present value using discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 12.0% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discounted cash flows were added to a range of estimated ? terminal ? ( end date ) values , which was calculated by using the EBITDA Exit Multiple Methodology . <p> This method calculates the terminal value by applying multiples ranging from 4.5x to 5.5x , based on EBITDA multiples paid as per the comparable transactions analysis , to the projected 2010 EBITDA of Lear . The implied terminal values were then discounted to present value using 10.0% to 12.0% discount rates . The present values of the implied terminal values of Lear were then added to the present value of the after-tax free cash flows to arrive at a range of enterprise values . The table below provides a summary of the range of enterprise values . <p> Enterprise Value <p> Free Cash <p> Flow as of <p> December 31 , <p> 2006 <p> 4.5x <p> 5.0x <p> 5.5x <p> WACC <p> 10.0% <p> $ <p> 1,958.5 <p> $ <p> 5,323.1 <p> $ <p> 5,697.0 <p> $ <p> 6,070.8 <p> 11.0% <p> $ <p> 1,914.8 <p> $ <p> 5,159.7 <p> $ <p> 5,520.3 <p> $ <p> 5,880.8 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ <p> 5,351.0 <p> $ <p> 5,698.8 <p> This analysis indicated an implied equity value per share range for Lear . The table below provides a summary of the range of implied equity value per share range . <p> Although the Discounted Cash Flow analysis produced values higher than the consideration to be paid by AREP in the merger , Morgan Joseph believes that the analyses described in the Morgan Joseph Opinion must be considered as a whole and not on an individual basis , and that to consider it otherwise than as an entirety could potentially present an inaccurate or misleading description of such analyses . <p> Morgan Joseph reviewed the premiums paid for 317 selected publicly announced U.S. domestic transactions announced between February 2 , 2006 and February 2 , 2007 having transaction values of between $1.0 billion and $10.0 billion . Morgan Joseph then compared the average premiums of these transactions based on per share market prices of the target company at reference points of one day prior to transaction announcement , one week prior to transaction announcement and one month prior to transaction announcement , respectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of approximately $36.00 per share in cash to Lear ? s stock price at the same reference points as well as to Lear ? s average stock price over a one-month , three-month and twelve-month period . The following table shows the average premiums of the above mentioned transactions and the implied premium based on the merger consideration . <p> Target Offer Premium to <p> 1 Day Prior <p> 1 Week Prior <p> 1 Month Prior <p> Average Offer Premium <p> 52.3 <p> % <p> 69.0 <p> % <p> 24.9 <p> % <p> Lear Merger Offer Premium <p> 3.8 <p> % <p> 4.0 <p> % <p> 29.2 <p> % <p> AREP and Morgan Joseph entered into a letter agreement dated February 1 , 2007 relating to the services to be provided by Morgan Joseph in connection with the proposed merger . Pursuant to the terms of such letter agreement , AREP paid $375,000 to Morgan Joseph upon execution of the engagement letter and $375,000 on February 9 , 2007 upon the delivery of the Morgan Joseph Opinion to the API Committees . AREP also agreed to reimburse Morgan Joseph for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including certain fees and disbursements of its legal counsel . Such fees and reimbursements were not contingent upon consummation of the merger . Under a separate letter agreement , AREP agreed to indemnify Morgan Joseph against liabilities relating to or arising out of its engagement , including liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws . <p> In the ordinary course of business during the past two years , Morgan Joseph ( i ) was engaged by the API Committees to provide fairness opinions to the API Committees in January 2005 in connection with certain acquisition transactions similar in nature to the proposed merger involving the acquisition by AREP of certain companies in which affiliates of Mr. Icahn owned capital stock , for which Morgan Joseph received aggregate fees of $1,000,000 , and ( ii ) has been engaged by the API Committees to provide fairness opinions to the API Committees in connection with ( a ) a potential transaction involving the acquisition by AREP of certain debt instruments and the assumption of certain rights and obligations under certain derivative securities of a certain publicly traded company held by affiliates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees of $750,000 upon delivery of its opinion to the API Committees and ( b ) an additional potential transaction involving the acquisition by AREP of all of the capital stock owned by affiliates of Mr. Icahn of a certain closely held company , for which Morgan Joseph has received a fee of $375,000 upon execution of an engagement letter in connection therewith and would receive an additional fee of $375,000 upon delivery of its opinion to the API Committees . <p> In accordance with the letter agreement , Morgan Joseph ? s opinion is addressed solely to the API Committees , solely for their use in connection with their review and evaluation of the consideration proposed to be paid by AREP in the merger . Neither the Morgan Joseph Opinion nor its underlying financial analyses may be relied on by any person or entity other than the members of the API Committees , in their capacity as such , without the prior written consent of Morgan Joseph . In accordance with the letter agreement , no holders of MLP Units , or any other AREP constituent , person or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opinion or underlying financial analyses in connection with any voting , credit extension , audit or other consideration or assessment of the relative merits , risks or financial reporting requirements of the merger , or otherwise . Morgan Joseph ? s view is that its duties in connection with the Morgan Joseph Opinion extend solely to the API Committees and that it has no legal responsibilities in respect thereof to any other person or entity under the laws of the State of New York , the laws which govern the engagement letter agreement between AREP and Morgan Joseph . Morgan Joseph states in the letter agreement that it would likely assert the substance of this view and the disclaimer described above as a defense to claims and allegations , if any , that might hypothetically be brought or asserted against it by any persons or entities other than the API Committees with respect to the Morgan Joseph Opinion and its financial analyses thereunder . Morgan Joseph also states , however , that because no court has definitely ruled to date on the availability of this defense to a financial advisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairness opinion , this issue <p> necessarily would have to be judicially resolved on the merits in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction . The letter agreement provides that there can be no assurance that such a court would apply the laws of the state of New York to the analyses and ultimate resolution of this issue if it were to be properly briefed by the relevant litigants and presented to the court . The letter agreement also provides that , in all cases , the hypothetical assertion or availability of such a defense would have absolutely no effect on Morgan Joseph ? s rights and responsibilities under U.S. federal securities laws , or the rights and responsibilities of the API Committees under applicable state law or under U.S. federal securities laws . <p> In connection with its review and analysis of the proposed merger of Merger Sub with and into Lear , American Real Estate Partners , L.P. engaged A.T . Kearney , Inc. to conduct a business diligence review of Lear and to provide a strategic assessment of Lear , its competitors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the A.T . Kearney Report . A.T .

AREP instructed A.T .

It does not address the merits of the underlying business decision by AREP or any of AREP ? s affiliates or constituents to propose , consider , approve , recommend , declare advisable or consummate the merger , and does not constitute a recommendation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? s depositary units , or any other AREP or Lear constituent , person or entity as to any specific action that should be taken ( or not be taken ) in connection with the merger or as to any strategic or financial alternatives to the merger or as to the timing of any of the foregoing . <p> The A.T . Kearney Report was prepared and delivered not for purposes of assessing the fairness to AREP or Lear stockholders of the merger or the consideration to <p> be paid in connection with the merger , but as part of a general business strategy consulting assignment intended to educate AREP with respect to the industry in which Lear operates and Lear ? s competitive position within that industry . The A.T . Kearney Report was not intended as a valuation of the fair market price per share in connection with the merger and it does not address the merits or fairness of the merger or the merger consideration . <p> Project Methodology <p> In connection with furnishing the A.T . Kearney Report , A.T . Kearney reviewed and analyzed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the automotive industry and the automotive Tier I market generally and the seating and electrical and electronics markets specifically ; information provided by members of Lear ? s management team ; onsite interviews of Lear executives ; and publicly available information on Lear and Lear ? s major customers and competitors . <p> A.T . Kearney assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all publicly available information and data used by it and did not attempt to independently verify such information , nor did A.T . Kearney assume any responsibility or liability to do so . A.T . Kearney also assumed and relied upon the information and projections provided to it by AREP and Lear and that no relevant information had been omitted . A.T . Kearney did not attempt to independently verify any such information , nor did it assume any responsibility to do so . <p> Throughout the course of its engagement , A.T . Kearney ? s representatives were in contact with AREP in order to respond to specific instructions about the scope of its due diligence . <p> Summary of Findings <p> A.T . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its business : <p> ? <p> The seating market shows growth potential because seats are increasing in content and are increasingly used for vehicle differentiation ; <p> ? <p> Lear operates in a seat market with consolidated competition and rational pricing ; <p> ? <p> Lear has strong people , operations and systems ; <p> ? <p> Lear is favorably viewed in the industry and is trusted by most auto makers to deliver major programs ; and <p> ? <p> Lear ? s business has a strong balance of market presence in North America and Europe with a growing Asian presence . <p> A.T . Kearney identified the following concerns with respect to Lear and its businesses : <p> ? <p> Generic risks associated with the North American based automotive Tier I market , including declining sales from the traditional ? Big 3 ? auto makers ; cost pressures from auto makers and raw material pricing volatility ; <p> ? <p> Lear ? s ability to quickly transition sales and associated cost structure from North America to Asia and Eastern Europe are impacted by a significant union presence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will create excess capacity in that region ; and <p> ? <p> A softening of Lear ? s revenue pipeline in 2008 and 2009 with limited commercial opportunities in that timeframe . <p> A.T . Kearney concluded that Lear is a well-positioned major seat supplier with a much smaller , sub-scale electrical and electronics business and made the following conclusions with respect to Lear and its businesses : <p> ? <p> In late 2006 and projected into 2007 , Lear has improved operating income levels to 3.2% and has rebounded from a weak performance in 2005 ; <p> ? <p> Lear is executing a restructuring program for a total restructuring savings of approximately $125.0 million annually with an investment of approximately $300.0 million over the 2005-2007 timeframe ; <p> ? <p> Lear enjoys a strong relationship with its major customers and has successfully executed new program launches ; <p> ? <p> A review of 10 of Lear ? s major programs representing in excess of $4 billion in revenues indicated that all programs reviewed were positive contributors with manageable risks ; <p> Lear is implementing a metal strategy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which requires it to increase competency in this complex area ; <p> ? <p> There is softness in the North American revenue pipeline in 2008 and 2009 that can be offset by aggressive sales activity in the near-future and/or increased restructuring and cost savings efforts ; and <p> ? <p> The Electrical distribution business is 4th in the market place , while electronics is a sub-scale niche player : <p> ? <p> While these businesses are stable performers , their smaller size and differing competencies may require strategies different from that for the seating business . <p> You have advised Bank of America , N.A. ( ? Bank of America ? ) and Banc of America Securities LLC ( ? BAS ? , and together with Bank of America , the ? Commitment Parties ? ) that AREP Car Acquisition Corp . ( ? AcquisitionCo ? , the ?
