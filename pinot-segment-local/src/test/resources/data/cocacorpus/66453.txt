Do n't forget to include author 's last name and page number ( MLA ) or author , date , and page number ( APA ) in your citation . Shown below are some possible ways to introduce quotations . The examples use MLA format . <h> You can use a full sentence followed by a colon to introduce a quotation . <h> Examples : <p> The setting emphasizes deception : " Nothing is as it appears " ( Smith 1 ) . <p> Piercy ends the poem on an ironic note : " To every woman a happy ending " ( 25 ) . <h> You can also begin a sentence with your own words , then complete it with quoted words . <p> Note that in the second example below , a slash with a space on either side ( / ) marks a line break in the original poem . <h> Examples : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most unnatural murder " ( Shakespeare 925 ) . <p> The speaker is mystified by her sleeping baby , whose " moth-breath / flickers among the flat pink roses " ( Plath 17 ) . <h> To quote a critic or researcher , you can use an introductory phrase naming the source , followed by a comma . <p> Note that the first letter after the quotation marks should be upper case . According to MLA guidelines , if you change the case of a letter from the original , you must indicate this with brackets . APA format does n't require brackets . <h> Examples : <p> According to Smith , " Writing is fun " ( 215 ) . <p> In Smith 's words , " . . . <p> In Smith 's view , " . . . <h> Another way to introduce a critic 's words is to use a descriptive verb , followed by a comma . <p> Avoid using says unless the words were originally spoken aloud , for instance , during an interview . <h> Examples : <p> Smith states , " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks , " . . . <p> Smith writes , " . . . <p> Smith notes , " . . . <p> Smith comments , " . . . <p> Smith observes , " . . . <p> Smith concludes , " . . . <p> Smith reports , " . . . <p> Smith maintains , " . . . <p> Smith adds , " . . . <h> If your lead-in to the quotation ends in that or as , do n't follow it with a comma . <p> The first letter of the quotation should be lower case . <h> Examples : <p> Smith points out that " millions of students would like to burn this book " ( 53 ) . <p> Smith emphasizes that " . . . <p> In Smith 's view , " . . . <p> Smith interprets the hand washing in MacBeth as " an attempt at absolution " ( 106 ) .

@@21438676 @1438676/ <h> Prospective Students &amp; Parents+ <h> Employers+ <h> Related Links+ <h> Applying to Graduate School <p> Attending graduate school , either immediately after graduation or after a few years of work experience , is an option that many people consider part of their career development . If you are considering a profession such as law , medicine or college/university teaching where education beyond the baccalaureate level is required , going immediately after graduation would probably be your choice . Many new college graduates , though , are unsure of their career interests and goals and view the graduate experience as a way to " find " themselves . This view can present a problem at the graduate level as many programs and professors expect you to have clearly defined interests and an area of specialization . <h> Consider the following factors in deciding when to go to graduate school : <p> Some graduate programs , including many MBA programs , strongly encourage people to get work experience first . See if this is the case for your field of interest . <p> How do you feel about more tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more studying leave you cold ? If so , you may need a break , even for only six months or a year . <p> How does a graduate education fit into you personal and professional interests and growth ? Try not to use graduate school as a way to postpone making difficult decisions . You might feel even more pressure and confusion later on . <p> If your undergraduate grades are marginal , you may need to work while taking courses part-time to demonstrate to a graduate department ( and perhaps yourself ) that you are capable of succeeding . <h> Obtaining Information About Schools and Programs <p> The single most effective method is talking to professors and graduate students . Since many of them have studied or worked with professors at other schools , they know about the reputation and research orientations of departments across the country . <p> Guides to graduate study are located in the Career Library ( Career Services Center ) . Some books describe graduate admissions and education in specific disciplines such as medicine , law , business and psychology , while others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions of higher education . These guides identify and briefly outline academic programs , financial aid resources , costs of study , application requirements and other helpful information . Some undergraduate program offices , such as pre-law and pre-medicine , have small information centers with pamphlets , books , graduate school bulletins and other resources . <p> Visit some schools if at all possible . This will give you a much better " feel " for the programs you visit . Make arrangements in advance to meet with faculty , the individual who coordinates the applicant review and some graduate students . If you can not visit , call someone there . Request specific information about the research being conducted , course content , course content and admissions criteria . <h> Admissions <p> The specific criteria and their relative weights vary , depending on the academic discipline , particular educational institution and number of applicants . Faculty , books and articles can provide specific information about GPA and admission test score criteria . Certain programs have very high GPA or test cutoff points , while for others , work experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . Do not assume that you can never get into a discipline . Remember that course requirements differ from one graduate program to another . <p> You generally do not need to have an undergraduate degree in the same or a closely allied field . Check to see what courses are required , however , the course work can be taken subsequent to graduation , if necessary . At some universities you can complete these courses as a non-degree graduate student seeking to become qualified for a program . If the programs you first investigate are admissions criteria that you can not meet , look for related programs in other fields with less stringent criteria . You may discover a challenging , relevant program or field that you have not considered . In addition to the complete application form , items required by you for application might include graduate admission test scores , transcripts , letters of recommendation , an essay or statement of intent . <h> Graduate Admissions Tests <p> The tests required vary by type of graduate study . The most common admissions tests include the Graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Test ( GMAT ) for Business schools and the Law School Admissions Test ( LSAT ) . You can register for many of these tests online . The schools ' catalogs will specify which test you need and will often indicate average scores needed to be competitive for acceptance . You should plan to take the appropriate test approximately one year before your anticipated matriculation date . You can obtain test information from the locations shown on the following page . <h> The Application Process <h> Transcripts <p> Official transcripts of your undergraduate work and any other graduate work you have completed must be sent to the graduate schools . This may be done at the end of your junior year or in the middle of your senior year or , for those going on later , at any point after you have graduated . Contact the registrar 's office to have your transcripts sent ; anticipate a fee for this service . <h> Letters of Recommendation <p> Ideally , you should begin to think about this a year before applying to graduate school in order to ensure that professors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to write good references . Most graduate programs require that two or three recommendation letters be sent . Some programs enclose evaluation forms to be filled out by each reference . <p> School prefer and sometimes require that at least one and sometimes two references be on the faculty or staff of a university or college , preferably in the same department where you are currently studying and/or in the same field in which you are applying to do your graduate study . If you have worked in a job related to the field , a supervisor may provide an excellent reference . <p> When approaching people for reference letters , ask each person if s/he knows you well enough to write a meaningful letter . Also provide as much " lead time " as possible , a month or more if possible . If the individual appears reluctant , politely say you can find someone else . <p> To help the person write a relevant , favorable letter , it is best to provide a copy of your resume , your goals for graduate school , the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been requested to complete . Also include a stamped , addressed envelope unless the school has specified a different procedure . Do n't be afraid to check with each reference one or more times prior to the deadline to see if the letter has been sent . Many people with good intentions get busy and forget the deadline . <h> Application Essay <p> Most schools will require that you write an essay or statement on your background and interests as they relate to your field of study . These are often used as an opportunity to see you beyond the " numbers " in the admissions criteria . Many schools will also ask you to provide short answer essays to specific questions within your field to assess your knowledge and understanding of the field you are entering . These essays are one measure of your ability to write , to build arguments and to think critically . They also assess your enthusiasm for the field of study , creativity , maturity and uniqueness . <p> Applications differ in the extent to which the writer is requested to write essays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or more long essay questions about the applicant 's purpose and direction . Some applications for science programs do not even have short-answer questions about the candidate . In this case , a cover letter addressing the three points listed above will help you " stand out from the crowd . " Have someone review your essay for content , grammar and spelling . Often the best people to critique your essay are your adviser or your recommendation letter writers as they will be able to tell you what to stress and what to minimize or delete . Take your time developing your essay(s) ; they are often the most crucial part of your application . <h> Financial Aid <p> Three kinds of financial aid are available : <p> Work programs , such as graduate assistantships and college work study programs ; <p> Monetary awards , including grants , fellowships and scholarships ; and <p> Loans , usually administered through banks , the government or the educational institution . <p> " Peterson 's Guide to Graduate and Professional Programs ; An Overview , " located in the Career Services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial aid . Because every graduate school has its own application process and system of awarding aid , you must obtain that information directly from each of the institutions to which you are applying . You can check with both the financial aid office and the graduate academic department . <p> Graduate assistantships pay tuition and a stipend for living expenses . Most are administered by academic departments and involve either 10 or 20 hours of work per week . Teaching assistantships involve assisting a professor with graduating , office hours and recitation sections or being responsible for the entire teaching of one or more courses . Research assistantships involve assisting ongoing research and can evolve into conducting your own research project for a thesis . Administrative assistantships are much less common and can involve managing a small facility such as a computer lab . <p> Loans and college work-study programs are awarded on the basis of financial need . To determine need , many graduate schools require that the applicant submit the FAFSA , the Free Application for Federal Student Aid , which is administered by the U.S. Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these options , talk with a graduate financial aid officer , or visit www.fafsa.ed.gov . <p> For additional information on financial aid , check out FinAid : The Financial Aid Information Page ( www.finaid.org ) or the Department of Education 's Student Guide ( www.ed.gov/finaid.html ) .

As of August , 2012 , only SOC eligible students ( military ) may be enrolled in catalog years older than 2005 . <h> What is a catalog year ? <p> Degree requirements change from time to time . This does not happen every year , but degree programs are frequently reviewed for relevancy to the field of study and evolving practices within higher education . " Catalog year " refers to the specific degree requirements for your degree at the time of your initial enrollment . Students may stay on their initial catalog year for up to eight years . If your degree is not complete ( or is not going to be complete ) within eight years of initial enrollment , you must move up to a more recent catalog year . This rule does not apply to SOC eligible students . <p> Any student may request to be moved to a more recent catalog year , but none may select a catalog year that is older than their initial enrollment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Why does n't my audit show my ... <h> Minor requirements ? <p> Minor requirements are not calculated in the overall degree completion totals . The total remaining hours on the degree audit is the number the financial aid department uses to calculate the amount of financial aid needed for each student . Since minor requirements are outside of overall degree requirements , they can not be calculated in the total remaining hours for the degree . <h> Overall GPA calculation ? <p> Columbia College does not chart transfer credit grade point average . As a result , the overall GPA section only displays your Columbia College GPA . <h> Second Major ? <p> If you have a double major , only one will display at the top of your degree audit . Both majors ( and any additional majors you may have ) and their associated requirements are listed on your degree audit ; they appear in order after your degree basic requirements section . <h> Pre-requisites section ? <p> Pre-requisites are not included in the overall totals or listed on the degree audit unless they also fulfill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalog , course schedule , syllabi , or your advisor for assistance with pre-requisites . <h> Do I have to take another class to fulfill 0.3 hours remaining for a requirement ? <p> Probably not . <p> In most cases , this remainder is the result of transfer work from a school that operates on a quarter-length term ( rather than semester-length , as Columbia College does ) . The translation of quarter hours to semester hours can cause this transfer credit to appear as a decimal . Often this small remainder can be made up by excess hours that the student has earned which could also apply to the degree audit area in question . <p> Contact your academic advisor to see if you need to submit a waiver form , or to pursue the steps towards adjusting the way your credit applies to the degree audit . Some courses apply to certain degree requirements , when other courses could be applied which work better for your overall requirements . <p> You may need more upper level courses in your major , as it is possible for upper level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not to your major area core . <p> Individual courses applying to more than one area on the degree audit is referred to as double dipping . <h> What do Optional and Classical mean ? <h> Classical vs. optional general education requirements <p> Students who completed 36 or more semester hours of transfer credit with a grade of " C " or better prior to their initial enrollment at Columbia College are eligible for the optional general education requirements . Optional general education requirements allow more courses to fulfill the first part of the general education section of the degree audit than the classical general education requirements do . <h> Why are both classical and optional general education requirements showing up on my audit ? <p> Both classical and optional general education requirements appear on an audit until you are eligible for your first enrollment with Columbia College . The amount of transfer credit you have prior to your initial enrollment with Columbia College will determine your eligibility for either the optional ( 36 or more transfer credit hours ) or classical ( up to 35 hours in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been determined , based on your transfer credit totals , only one set of requirements appear on the degree audit . <h> Can I switch from optional general education requirements to classical requirements ? <p> Yes . <p> In some cases , the classical general education requirements allow for more of the students transfer credit to apply to the degree requirements . Students who are eligible for the optional general education requirements as a result of carrying 36 or more hours of transfer credit may request to pursue the classical general education requirements . Please see your advisor to discuss the benefits of each set of requirements , and for assistance with requesting the change . <h> Do I have to take every course in the natural science/math section of general education ? <p> No . <p> The natural science/math section requires completion of five semester hours . Degree audit lists the three possible ways this requirement may be met : <p> two unrelated science lectures ( totaling five hours ) <p> a lecture and lab for the same science course ( totaling five hours ) , or <p> one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Degree audit charts your progress towards completion of all three of these , identifying the requirement as complete as soon as one of the sub-requirements is met . Once the overall requirement is complete , the requirement options that you chose not to pursue no longer appear on your audit . <h> Why do n't the classes I 'm taking now show up on my audit ? <p> Degree audit only applies completed credit towards degree requirements .

For many students the increased number and length of college reading assignments is a new demand on their time and energy . They may not be fully prepared to undertake this level of participation .

The lecture will then be a review of the material , not an introduction to new information . <p> Break lengthy reading assignments into small segments .

It serves not as an exhaustive document of positions you 've held , but as a summary of the skills and knowledge base you can offer to an employer and a demonstration of your ability . <p> Resumes differ from industry to industry and sometimes from position to position . Your resume also can be modified toward a specific industry . For example , technical resumes need to highlight computer skills earlier than marketing resumes . Do n't  limit your experiences to just paid work . Volunteer , extracurricular and athletics are all activities that are appropriate for a resume . <p> You do n't  have long to make an impression with your resume . Trying to overwhelm the reviewer with everything you have done rarely works . You should highlight skills and accomplishments you have that will make you a good match for the opportunity . <h> Step One : <p> Alumni will want to focus on their work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations . <h> Step Two : <p> Consider the type of position you will be applying for , how you fit and what might set you apart from the rest of the applicants : <p> Consider the industry and/or organization you will apply to . What will they value in an employee ? What skills do you bring to them that will catch their eye ? Are they going to be primarily concerned with hard skills like laboratory knowledge or familiarity of general accounting practices ? Or are soft skills like teamwork and customer service proficiency more important ? It 's possible it 's a combination of both . <p> Next , think how you have demonstrated ability in those areas . For instance , if you are going to apply for a position in public relations , employers will want to see the ability to communicate effectively , think creatively and connect with a wide range of individuals . Even if your prior experience is n't in public relations , can you demonstrate these abilities through other means ? <p> If you plan on applying to different industries or job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in applying for a human resources job and a sales job will want to have different skills and experiences highlighted . <h> Step Three : <p> Craft your resume . <p> Avoid using commonly used templates , as they do n't  offer a lot of flexibility . See our Resume Guide to learn successful ways in organizing and detailing a resume , using the right verbs and what information to keep off . <p> Remember , your resume needs to be readable in 30 seconds to one minute . Use spacing , bolding , underlining and italicizing to pace your resume , highlight sections and let the reader quickly find the information they are looking for . <p> If you are a traditional undergraduate , you want to keep your resume to one page . If you are an alumni or nontraditional student with substantial work experience , you should aim for no more than two pages . If you do go to two pages , make sure the second page goes to at least half the page . Remember , you can expand your margins , going to at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margins . <p> If you do include a career objective , it should be brief , clearly stated and consistent with the accomplishments and demonstrated skills on your resume . An example would be " Internship within a stable financial institution requiring strong analytical and organizational skills " or " Full-time opportunity utilizing C++ and Javascript programming skills " <p> Experience and education should go in reverse chronological order your most recent first , then on down <p> Keep in mind , a resume is an example of the attention to detail you will bring to the workplace . This means there is no room for typos , bad grammar or inconsistent formatting <p> Do n't  use a narrative style when discussing your experiences bulleted , concise statements will make a bigger impact <p> Create a " References " page that goes on a separate sheet . Choose three references and list out their name , title , company they work for and contact information . Use only professional or academic references , not personal . <p> When your resume is completed , generate a . pdf and . rtf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , use the . pdf version . <p> The following information is unneeded on most resumes : Date of birth , marriage status , name of supervisors for employment ( unless they are going to go on a references page ) , street addresses of your employers or social security numbers .

A student who remains enrolled beyond the 60% point is considered to have earned all awarded aid .

If no positive action is taken by the student within 45 days of being notified , Columbia College will notify the U.S. Department of Education of the students overpayment situation .

@@21438882 @1438882/ <h> Information for Parents+ <h> Paying for college+ <h> Campus visit+ <h> Student loans <p> Student loans can be very helpful when paying for college . They can make up the difference in affording that last piece of the tuition bill . On the other hand , what most people do n't  consider at the time is that those student loans must be repaid . <p> Loans are borrowed money that require repayment with added interest . So you can pretty much guarantee you 'll pay back more than what you originally borrowed . <p> Consider this important tip when dealing with students loans : Only borrow as much as you need . <p> Students are not required to accept the entirety of a loan offer . For instance , if your student receives a financial aid package that includes a $5,000 loan offer but you only need $1,500 to cover remaining expenses , consider only accepting the $1,500 . This will cover immediate expenses without accumulating unnecessary debt to repay . <h> Quick Facts about Federal Student Loans <p> There are multiple types of federal student loans available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through which the U.S. Department of Education is the lender . <p> There are four types of Direct Loans , defined by the office for Federal Student Aid as follows : <p> Direct Subsidized Loans are loans made to eligible undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need to help cover the costs of higher education at a college or career school . <p> Direct Unsubsidized Loans are loans made to eligible undergraduate , graduate and professional students , but in this case , the student does not have to demonstrate financial need to be eligible for the loan . <p> Direct PLUS Loans are loans made to graduate or professional students and parents of dependent undergraduate students to help pay for education expenses not covered by other financial aid . <p> Direct Consolidation Loans allow you to combine all of your eligible federal student loans into a single loan with a single loan service . <p> The biggest advantage to Direct Subsidized Loans is that the U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on the loan until repayment terms begin .

Perkins loans are available to undergraduate and graduate students demonstrating exceptional financial need . <p> All student loans accrue interest on a daily basis . A payment made on a student loan directly applies to an outstanding interest balance before any of the payment is applied to the outstanding principal balance ( the amount owed before interest ) . <p> Federal student loans often offer lower interest rates than private loans from banks or other sources . <p> Typically , federal student loans become due after a designated grace period once a student leaves college or drops below half-time enrollment . Direct PLUS Loans require repayment once the loan is completely disbursed . <p> You can choose from several different loan repayment plans to accommodate your financial situation . Extending repayment will likely increase the amount of interest paid on a particular loan . Learn more about repayment plans .
