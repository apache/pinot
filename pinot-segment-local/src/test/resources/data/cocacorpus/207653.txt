@@43107410 @3107410/ <h> BIG : Movie Theaters Fill Bucketsand Bellies <h> by Jayne Hurley &amp; Bonnie Liebman , December 2009 <p> ShareThis <p> What 's the healthiest snack to buy at the movies ? You can go for 400 to 1,200 calories ' worth of popcorn that ( at many theaters ) is essentially fried in one to three days ' worth of saturated fat . Or you can buy a package of candy with 300 to 1,100 empty calories ( plus at least half a day 's sat fat if it 's chocolate ) . Soft drinks dispatch another 150 to 500 calories to your thirsty fat cells . The best snack at the movies ? No snack at all . <p> Information compiled by Amy Ramsay with help from Melissa Pryputniewicz . <h> POPCORN <p> At Regal , a medium ( left ) and a large popcorn each has 1,200 calories and three days ' worth of saturated fat . <p> " Did you know that popcorn is among the healthiest " and tastiest " snacks around ? " asks the Web site of the Popcorn Board , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe that 's one reason people fork over $4 to $8 for a bag or tub of popcorn when they enter a movie theater . It sounds like they 're munching on a stalk of broccoli , for goodness sakes . <p> Turns out the Popcorn Board is rightif you 're talking low-fat popcorn or ( fat-free ) air-popped . Eating a tub of movie theater popcorn is more like eating an 8 oz. bag of potato chips , and that 's assuming your theater pops in the best oil available and you get it without the " buttery " topping . <p> Here 's what we found when we sent samples of popcorn and toppings from the three largest theater chains to an independent lab for analysis . ( Each gave us nutrition facts for its popcorn . But just to be sure , we analyzed samples from three different theaters for each chain . For two of the chains " Regal and AMC " we went to theaters in the Washington , D.C. , area . For Cinemark , our samples came from Texas , Illinois , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theaters in 39 states plus the District of Columbia , Regal is the largest chain in the United States . It pops in coconut oil , which is 90 percent saturated . ( In contrast , lard is 40 percent saturated . ) <p> Translation : A " small " popcorn ( that 's about 11 cups ' worth ) with no buttery topping has 34 grams of saturated fat . So even if you split it with a friend ( unlikely ) , you each get nearly a day 's worth of artery paste . And it gets worse from there . <p> A " medium " ( 20 cups ) or a " large " ( also 20 cups ) has 60 grams of sat fat . Of course , a large means a free refill ( Yay ! ) , so there 's no limit to the damage you can do . <p> Just kidding . It takes years to clog those arteriesand years for your blood pressure to respond to the salt shock ( 550 milligrams of sodium " a third of a day 's worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or large ) . <p> The calories , on the other hand , may show up much soonerand where you least want them . <p> Budget 670 for a small and 1,200 for a medium or large . You could think of each small as a Pizza Hut Personal Pan Pepperoni Pizza and each medium or large as two . But the two pizzas pack " only " a day 's worth of sat fat " nowhere near the three days ' worth in a medium or large popcorn . <p> How can a medium and large at Regal each hold the same 20 cups of popcorn ? <p> Simple . The taller medium comes in a bag with straight sides , while the squatter large comes in a tapered tub that 's wider at the top ( see photo ) . The tub sure looks like it holds more . Other than for the free refill ( shudder ) , why else would moviegoers pay $8 for a large ( a medium is $7 ) ? <p> Another oopsy-daisy : According to Regal , a medium has 720 calories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower than our lab results . Oh well . What 's an xtra 200 to 500 calories when your snack hovers around the 1,000-calorie mark ? They do n't call them tubs for nothing . <p> Toppings : - For customers who think plain popcorn is n't soaked in enough oil , Regal offers a " buttery " topping . According to Regal and the topping manufacturer , it adds 130 calories to a small , 200 calories to a medium , and 260 calories to a large . <p> We analyzed the topping to make sure that it had no trans fat . But we did n't check to see how much topping the concession staff at Regal " or any other chain " adds . Odds are , it varies . And odds are , it 's more than what Regal claims . <h> AMC Theatres <p> AMC , the nation 's second-largest chain ( with 307 theaters in 30 states and the District of Columbia ) , also pops in coconut oil . The only good news : AMC 's popcorns are n't as super-sized as Regal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> According to AMC , a small popcorn contains 225 calories . In fact , the small AMC popcorns that we bought weighed about 50 percent more than the company claimed . Our AMC smalls contained 370 calories and 20 grams of saturated fat " about what you 'd get from that classic healthy snack : eight pats of butter . <p> Based on what we were served , AMC lowballs its other sizes as well . <p> For example , the company 's 430-calorie medium morphed into 590 calories and 33 grams of saturated fat . And the 660-calorie large became a 1,030-calorie behemoth with 57 grams of sat fat . It 's like eating a pound of baby back ribs topped with a scoop of H+agen-Dazs ice cream ( except for the extra day 's worth of sat fat in the popcorn ) . <p> What 's next : fun-house mirrors that make you look skinny on your way out of the theater ? <p> Toppings : - Fake-butter fans must love AMC . The chain let 's patrons pump their own " buttery " topping . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablespoons on a large , like Regal claims to use . With 120 calories per tablespoon , you should be able to squeeze another 200 to 500 calories into the bucket of fat cells in your lap . <p> The OmniHeart diets were n't designed to melt pounds , even though many of the participants were overweight or obese . <p> " In fact , we made sure they did n't cut calories or we would n't have known how much each diet mattered , " says Janis Swain , an OmniHeart dietitian at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston . <p> In a separate study , Sacks put 800 overweight adults on diets that were high or low in fat , carbs , or protein . After two years , weight loss was about the same.3- " So there is also a tie for weight loss , " he notes . <p> However , we 've tweaked the diet to make it easier for people to lose " or not gain " weight by cutting caloric beverages and eating foods that are less calorie dense . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to eat . <h> Cinemark <p> Cinemark , with 296 theaters in 39 states , deserves some applause . The nation 's third largest chain pops in non-hydrogenated canola oil instead of coconut . <p> If you share an unbuttered ( 8-cup ) small with a fellow moviegoer , each of you will walk away with about 200 calories ( seasoned with 340 milligrams of sodium ) . <p> That 's the best you can expect from movie theater popcorn , unless you ask the theater to pop you a batch without salt . ( All the Cinemark , AMC , and Regal locations we called said they would do that . ) <p> A medium popcorn ( 14 cups ) at Cinemark reaches 760 calories and a large ( 17 cups ) hits 910 calories ( and 1,500 mg of sodium " an entire day 's quota ) . Since when is half-a-day's-calories ' worth of corn , oil , and salt called a " snack " ? Maybe since America started competing in the Sumo Belly-Lifting Olympics . <p> Toppings : - Cinemark may use the healthiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the pump . <p> At some Cinemarks , the topping is essentially the same " buttery " non-hydrogenated soybean oil used by other chains . So for each tablespoon that you ( or the servers ) pour over your popcorn , you 're adding another 130 calories that ( we 're guessing ) you wo n't burn by the end of the day . <p> At other Cinemarks ( especially in the West ) , the topping is made from real butter . Would you add butter to your French fries ? <p> So get out the calculatorand that extra dose of Lipitor . You just turned your large popcorn into two Big Macs . <h> Sodas and Combos <p> A bag or tub of popcorn can make you thirsty , and theaters are n't about to let their customers suffer . So they offer sodas to wash down the salt and oil . <p> At Regal , a medium combo ( a medium popcorn plus a medium drink ) has 1,160 calories . That 's like eating six scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese , four bacon strips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A small ranges from 16 ounces ( 2 cups ) at Cinemark to 32 ounces ( 4 cups ) at Regal . Assume that about a quarter of it is filled with ice . Even so , you 're talking 150 to 300 calories ' worth of sugar ( unless you get a diet soda or water ) . <p> A large is only for those who possess a reinforced bladder ( or arrive with a supply of Depends ) . It ranges from 44 ounces ( 5-+ cups ) at Cinemark or AMC to 54 ounces ( nearly 7 cups ) at Regal . Okay , so you may not need an extra 400 to 500 calories " and 26 to 33 teaspoons of sugar " right now . But who knows ? Maybe a famine is just around the corner . <p> To save you money ( how thoughtful ) , theaters offer combos . For example , for a mere $12 , Regal hands you a medium popcorn and a medium soft drink , and AMC dishes up a large popcorn and a large soda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie ) that you do n't realize you 've just swallowed 1,400 to 1,600 calories ? <p> A combo for two people is even more economical . At Regal ( 1 large popcorn and 2 medium sodas ) and AMC ( 1 large popcorn and 2 large drinks ) , you pay about $17 for roughly 2,000 calories . What a deal . You 'll still have money left over for dinner and dessert after the movie . <p> True , you might be a tad less hungry if you go back for a free refill . The problem is , you have to walk all the way to the concession stand for it . That 's dozens of steps ! <p> Maybe someday theaters will have employees walk up and down the aisles offering free refills of popcorn and soda during the movie . In the meantime , they could at least offer bigger buckets . Maybe garbage bags would work .

Its recommendations , if implemented , would increase scientific knowledge around GE crops and their benefits , potential risks , and impacts . <p> One of the report 's most significant findings is that there are no food safety or human health impacts from eating foods and ingredients made from currently engineered crops . That should give consumers confidence about the safety of eating foods that have those ingredients . The report also found significant evidence of the development of resistant pests and weeds when GE crops have not been used in a sustainable manner .

I am glad that you are not promoting full-calorie Coca-Cola , which promotes diabetes , heart disease , obesity , and other health problems . But Diet Coke and other sodas sweetened with aspartame may raise consumers ' risk of cancer . <p> A prominent laboratory conducted three major studies of aspartame and found that it caused cancer in both rats and mice .

Scientists generally accept that if a chemical causes cancer in lab animals it likely increases the risk of cancer in humans . <p> While the Food and Drug Administration still considers aspartame to be safe , the Center for Science in the Public Interest urges consumers to avoid this chemical . We think it makes sense to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for absolute proof that aspartame causes cancer in humans . <p> Your endorsement carries great weight with your millions of young fans . To the extent that your endorsement encourages them to begin drinking Diet Coke , or to drink more , your endorsement is likely increasing your fans ' risk of cancer .

What follows are CSPI 's current ratings of artificial and natural no- and low-calorie sweeteners , excerpted from the group 's Chemical Cuisine guide to food additives : <p> - <p> Acesulfame-potassium. - Roughly 200 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used with aspartame in Coca-Cola Zero and Diet Pepsi . In the mid-calorie Pepsi Next , it is used with sucralose ( and high-fructose corn syrup and sugar ) . Besides being used in foods , it is sold in packets under the Sweet One brand name . The manufacturer 's safety studies of acesulfame-potassium conducted in rats in the 1970s were of mediocre quality , but suggested the ingredient might cause cancer . CSPI recommends avoiding ace-K . <p> Aspartame. - This widely used artificial sweetener is also about 200 times sweeter than sugar and sometimes labeled with the brand name NutraSweet . Aspartame is the sole sweetener in Diet Coke and Diet Dr Pepper , and is the major sweetener used in Diet Pepsi ( which also has ace-K ) . Three key studies funded by an independent lab ( rather than by a maker of aspartame ) found that the sweetener caused lymphomas , leukemias , kidney , and other cancers in rats and mice . That should be reason enough for the Food and Drug Administration to ban aspartame from the food supply , says CSPI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neurological symptoms in a small number of people . ( But do n't believe most of the nonsense about aspartame on the Internet . ) The group recommends that consumers avoid it . <p> Monk fruit extract ( mogrosides ) . - The monk fruit , a food consumed in China for centuries , contains super-sweet chemicals called mogrosides . Extracts of the fruit , which are 200 times sweeter than sugar , are being used in a smattering of foods and beverages . Monk fruit extract is sold in packages of Nectresse ( along with some erythritol and a little sugar and molasses ) . Monk fruit extract is natural and may well be safe , but CSPI recommends caution because it has been poorly tested in animals . <p> Neotame. - Neotame is a chemical cousin of aspartame , but about 40 times sweeter , meaning much less is needed to sweeten foods . One shortcoming , which may account for its scarcity in packaged foods , is that it has a somewhat different taste profile from sugar or high-fructose corn syrup . CSPI ranks it as safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent researchers . <p> Saccharin. - CSPI recommends that consumers avoid saccharin , the original artificial sweetener discovered in 1878 . It is used in Sweet'N Low packets , Tab soda ( which also now contains aspartame ) , and a few diet foods . Saccharin is over 300 times sweeter than sugar . In animal studies saccharin caused cancer of the bladder , uterus , ovaries , and other organs . Human studies have been inconsistent , but some found an association with higher cancer risk . In 1977 , the Food and Drug Administration proposed banning saccharin , but Congress intervened and permitted its use with a warning notice . Congress killed the warning-notice requirement in 2000 . Because of its bitter aftertaste , saccharin has generally been supplanted by aspartame and other newer and better-tasting artificial sweeteners . <p> Stevia leaf extract. - This natural , high-potency sweetener " about 200 times sweeter than sugar " is extracted from the South American stevia plant ( now also grown in the American west and in Southeast Asia ) . The purified sweetening agents are called rebiana , rebaudioside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extract . As a table-top sweetener , it is sold as Truvia , Pure Via , and other brands . Coke , Pepsi , and other companies are experimenting with rebiana in beverages . CSPI says it is probably safe , but should be better tested ( new additives are normally tested for long-term effects in two animal species ; rebiana was tested in only one ) . <p> Sucralose. - Sucralose , the key ingredient in Splenda , is made by reacting sugar with chlorine . It is about 600 times sweeter than sugar and widely used , often together with aspartame or ace-K , in foods and beverages . CSPI downgraded its rating of sucralose from " safe " to " caution " after the same lab that tested aspartame announced , though has not yet published , a study that found that sucralose caused leukemia in mice . <p> " We 're most concerned about aspartame , because in several studies it caused multiple kinds of cancers in laboratory animals , " said CSPI senior scientist Lisa Lefferts . " Based on those studies , the FDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that research , it should at least commission independent studies to settle the issue . " <p> CSPI says that for most Americans , the increased risks of obesity , diabetes , and heart disease from consuming sugar drinks probably outweigh the risks posed by artificial sweeteners . Diet sodas may help some people lose weight , if those drinks replace full-calorie sodas " and if people do n't replace the saved calories with extra calories at other times of day , the group says . <p> " The best beverage choices are water , seltzer , seltzer mixed with a little fruit juice , low-fat or fat-free milk , or unsweetened tea , " Lefferts said .

The new petition is asking for expanded relief by covering all meat and poultry products , not just ground products . Since CSPI 's 2011 petition , two multi-state outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant- Salmonella- Heidelberg linked to non-ground chicken products from Foster Farms have sickened 750 consumers and hospitalized 233 . In the second of those outbreaks , USDA allowed contaminated products to remain on the market for nearly 10 months as the- number of those sickened doubled . CSPI says that USDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant- Salmonella , uses its authority in an arbitrary and inconsistent way " putting consumers at risk . <p> In 1994 , USDA declared- E. coli- O157:H7 an adulterant after it sickened more than 700 consumers and caused three deaths from undercooked hamburgers . The agency acted again in 2011 when it declared six strains of shiga-toxin-producing- E. coli- to be adulterants , though those strains were n't linked to a single outbreak in the United States from meat or poultry products . CSPI is also asking USDA to institute a sampling and testing program to detect the presence of the Heidelberg , Typhimurium , Newport , and Hadar strains of **30;147;TOOLONG . Declaring strains of- Salmonella- to be an adulterant means that USDA could get tainted meat and poultry products out of the marketplace before they were linked to illnesses . <p> " The Foster Farms outbreaks should have served as a wake-up call to USDA , but the agency keeps hitting the snooze button , " said CSPI food safety director Caroline Smith DeWaal . " USDA should be testing for antibiotic-resistant strains of- Salmonella- to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now can do for the most dangerous strains of- E. coli . Antibiotic-resistant- Salmonella- is no less dangerous and kills twice as many Americans each year . " <p> The fact that USDA has initiated numerous recalls in outbreaks involving antibiotic-resistant- Salmonella- is further proof that the agency knows that the strains are adulterants capable of causing injury , according to the petition . <p> One reason USDA said it denied CSPI 's 2011 petition was that ordinary cooking is sufficient to kill- Salmonella . But CSPI said USDA failed to provide any scientific support for that assertion , and pointed to a number of studies indicating that consumers ' cooking , handling , and cleaning practices do- not- adequately control the hazard at home . USDA considers- E. coli- O157:H7 an adulterant in beef in part because it acknowledges some consumers ' preference for rare , medium rare , or medium beef .

Here 's the latest on some remedies . <h> - <h> SLEEP HELPERS ? <h> - <h> Exercise <p> " There is a growing consensus that regular exercise can improve sleep , " says Matthew Buman , a professor of exercise and wellness at Arizona State University . <p> In the largest study to date , Stanford University 's Abby King and colleagues recruited 66 people aged 55 or older who exercised less than an hour a week and complained about their sleep . <p> " We chose people with typical mild to moderate sleep complaints who would love to sleep better but who did n't have a sleep disorder like chronic insomnia , " says Buman , who helped analyze the data . <p> Thirty-six of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week of aerobic exercises , stretching , muscle strengthening , and balance exercises . They were also instructed to do 30 minutes of aerobic exercise at home at least three days a week . <p> The 30 volunteers in the control group were offered weekly classes on nutrition and other topics , but were n't told to exercise . After 12 months , the exercisers reported feeling more rested in the morning than the control group.11 <p> " What 's unique about this study is that it was the first to actually periodically measure the brain waves during sleep of people who were engaged in moderate-intensity exercise during the day , " Buman notes . <p> The brain waves showed that the exercisers fell into a stable sleep four minutes sooner and awoke fewer times during the first third of the night than the control group . ( Both groups slept about the same amount of time " six hours a night . ) <p> The results were " modest and less dramatic than we originally expected , " conceded the researchers , who were also disappointed that exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . <p> " A few short studies in younger adults have shown that on days they exercise they 're likely to have more slow-wave sleep that night , " Buman notes . <p> Exercise is most likely to help people whose sleep is the worst and who have been exercising the least , adds Buman.12 <h> - <h> Valerian <p> " Valerian does have sedative properties in animals , " says sleep researcher Diana Taibi of the University of Washington . " But when you look at the studies in people , the effect on sleep , if any , is very small . " <p> Most research on valerian " is poor quality , " Taibi notes . One problem : " Although valerian is foul smelling , many of the studies did n't conceal the odor , so people knew if they were getting it , " she says . " And since sleep disturbance is largely a psychologically conditioned problem , if someone takes something expecting it to help them sleep , it probably will . " <p> In Taibi 's trial , she and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered from insomnia either 300 milligrams of a valerian extract or a placebo 30 minutes before bedtime every night for two weeks . ( The researchers stored the placebo next to the valerian , so it smelled just like the herb . ) After a two-week break , the women switched to the other pills . <p> " When they were taking valerian , the women did n't fall asleep any faster , sleep any longer , or report any better sleep quality than when they were taking the placebo , " says Taibi . In fact , the women were awake for an average of 11 minutes more the nights they were taking valerian.13 <p> ( The valerian used in the study was made by Pharmavite , which claims that its NatureMade brand of valerian is " supported by clinical trials . " ) <p> " Our results are consistent with most of the 29 previous studies in people with insomnia , " says Taibi . What 's more , she adds , none of the most recent studies , which were also the most carefully controlled , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taibi notes , none of the studies looked at valerian tinctures , which are solutions of valerian extracts in alcohol . " The effects of tinctures could be entirely different , " she says . " But since it has never been tested , we do n't know . " <h> - <h> Melatonin <p> " Melatonin is a hormone produced in the brain at night that precedes the onset of sleep but does n't necessarily cause sleep , " says Harvard 's Jeanne Duffy . <p> In 2004 , the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research &amp; Quality ( AHRQ ) concluded that melatonin is n't effective in treating most " primary " or " secondary " sleep disorders . ( " Primary " means that doctors can find no cause of the insomnia . " Secondary " disorders are caused by other conditions " depression or sleep apnea , for example . ) <p> But the AHRQ found that travelers with jet lag or night workers who took melatonin ( usually 5 or 6 milligrams ) slept an average of 18 minutes more than similar people who took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any faster or sleep any better , though.15 <p> The AHRQ also found that melatonin might help with an uncommon condition called " delayed sleep phase syndrome , " in which patients typically fall asleep hours after midnight and have difficulty waking up in the morning because their " internal clock " is off . <p> In two studies , melatonin helped patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome fall asleep an average of about 40 minutes earlier than usual.16,17 " Melatonin can help pull their sleep timing back somewhat so they can go to sleep earlier and get up earlier , " says Taibi. <h> - <h> Other " Aids " <p> Kava. - " Although scientific studies provide some evidence that kava may be beneficial for the management of anxiety , " notes the National Institutes of Health 's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine , it " is not a proven therapy for other uses .

The WHO warns that kava should n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or anxiety . <p> Yoga. - " Yoga might help with sleep by promoting relaxation , " says Taibi . However , evidence from controlled studies is elusive . In the only trial in the U.S. and Canada in adults , women reported no better quality of sleep after participating in a low-intensity yoga program for four months.18 <p> Warm baths. - " Body temperature typically is high until right before you go to bed , " notes Duffy . " Then there 's a rapid decline . " The lowest- <p> temperature is reached just before- morning . " The drop in body temperature is one of the physiological triggers for sleep , " says Taibi . When you take a warm bath , the dissipation of heat afterwards can set off that trigger , she explains . In two studies , when 23 women in their 60s and 70s with insomnia took a hot bath ( 105- F ) 90 minutes before bedtime , they awoke less during the night than when they took a lukewarm bath ( 100- F ) or no bath at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more restful.19,20 <h> - <h> SLEEP HURTERS ? <h> - <h> Caffeine <p> " People do n't realize how much caffeine can interfere with sleep , " says Thomas Roth , chief of sleep medicine at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit . " They think that if the caffeine is out of their system , they 're okay . But they may not be . " <p> Caffeine affects sleep by interfering with adenosine , a compound found in every cell in the body . " In the brain , it pushes you to sleep , " Roth explains . " If you inject adenosine into the brain of an animal , it will go to sleep . " <p> While you 're awake during the day , your brain is building up its levels of adenosine , says Roth . The adenosine is dissipated while you sleep , unless you do n't sleep long enough to get rid of it all . That 's where caffeine comes in . <p> Caffeine binds to adenosine receptors in the brain . That prevents the adenosine from entering nerve cells , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people know that caffeine can disrupt sleep if it 's consumed in the evening , " what is n't widely known is that caffeine taken earlier in the day can disrupt sleep later that night , " says Roth . <p> When nine healthy young men who regularly drank one or two caffeinated beverages a day consumed 200 milligrams of caffeine at 7 a.m. , their sleep was affected 16 hours later when they went to bed at 11 p.m. , even though they had no more caffeine during the rest of the day and the level in their blood was approaching zero . ( A 16 oz. grande brewed coffee at Starbucks has 330 mg of caffeine . ) <p> It took them 11 more minutes to fall into deep sleep , and their total sleep time averaged 10 minutes less than on a night when they consumed a placebo instead of caffeine in the morning. - 21 " Ten minutes is n't a big deal for a single day , " says Roth . " But it is a big deal as a nightly issue . " <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just before bedtime , it will put you to sleep more quickly for the first couple of hours and increase your slow-wave sleep , but then it will spoil your sleep during the latter part of the night , " says Roth . <p> " After about two hours " the time depends on how much you 've had " your body starts to clear the alcohol from your system , " he explains . " You begin getting fragmented sleep , which is waking up briefly and repeatedly , and then disrupted sleep , which is awakening from dreams and returning to sleep with difficulty . " <p> If you regularly drink alcohol to fall asleep , Roth adds , its sleep-inducing effect eventually wears off , but you 'll still have fragmented and disrupted sleep . <p> Women and older people are especially vulnerable because the same dose produces higher levels of alcohol in their blood and their brain than it does in men and younger people . Another hazard : older people who drink before going to bed may be unsteady if they have to get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <h> The Bottom Line <p> Sleeping six hours a night or less may raise the risk of diabetes , heart disease , obesity , and insulin resistance . <p> Aerobic exercise may improve sleep . <p> Melatonin may help with jet lag , night work , or delayed sleep phase syndrome .

Dairy products ranked as the leading cause of hospitalizations linked to foodborne illness ; second to leafy greens in the numbers of illnesses ; and second to poultry in the numbers of deaths . While CDC does not give much detail , CSPI 's own analysis and ranking of the 10 Riskiest Foods Regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( 2009 ) identified ice cream and cheese as among the top 10 causes of illnesses linked to outbreaks . <p> The risk from dairy products has increased in recent years with the increased rise in popularity of unpasteurized raw milk and cheeses .

@@43107786 @3107786/ <h> FDA Urged to Require Better Labeling of Sesame , an Allergen <p> November 18 , 2014 <p> ShareThis <p> The Center for Science in the Public Interest is- asking the Food and Drug Administration to require that sesame be disclosed on food labels- in the same manner as milk , eggs , fish , shellfish , tree nuts , peanuts , wheat , and soy are disclosed . In 2004 , when Congress passed the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act , those " Big 8 " allergens were understood to account for about 90 percent of allergic reactions caused by food . But numerous food-allergy experts cited by CSPI consider sesame to be an emerging cause of severe allergy , affecting an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 people in the United States . And for those allergic to sesame , the ingredient can trigger life-threatening anaphylaxis . <p> The 2004 law requires manufacturers to list the common name for allergens on food labels , instead of , or in addition to , their lesser known names . A label for a pasta listing semolina as an ingredient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a product with whey must disclose that it contains milk . In the case of sesame , less familiar terms such as tahini and gingelly might not alert a sesame-allergic individual . Moreover , " natural flavorings " or " spices " could contain sesame . <p> The regulatory petition filed by CSPI today also asks that the agency raise awareness among restaurateurs and other food service providers about sesame 's potential to cause problems . <p> A restaurant meal sent Brian Heller 's 10-year-old son Garrett to the emergency room in an ambulance , even though the family was assured that the meal contained no sesame . Garrett recovered . But the incident inspired Heller to take action to protect others . <p> " Consumers allergic to sesame , and the parents of children who are allergic , need to know whenever a food contains sesame so they could avoid a life-threatening adverse reaction , " said Heller , 48 , a technology lawyer who lives in Vienna , VA . " Parents should n't bear that responsibility alone . I do n't want my son to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent of a child with serious , potentially anaphylactic allergies , I need to know if the buns or breads I 'm buying were made on shared equipment with sesame seeds . " <p> The Canadian government considers sesame to be a major food allergen and Canada , the European Union , Australia , Israel , and New Zealand all require explicit labeling of sesame-based ingredients . CSPI says the FDA could use its authority under FALCPA , as well as its broader authority under the Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act , to require that sesame be labeled clearly . In 2009 , in response to a 1998 CSPI petition , the agency similarly required food manufacturers using the dye carmine , made from the cochineal insect , to use the words " carmine " or " cochineal " on labels . That substance also causes occasional life-threatening anaphylactic reactions . <p> " The 2004 law was an enormous advance for those who must avoid one or another common allergen to safeguard their health , " said CSPI executive director Michael F.

And some boast about their " buttery taste , " though almost all margarines and other spreads try to mimic butter . <p> Five minutes in the spreads aisle could make your head feel like whipped butter . Luckily , buying a decent spread is pretty simple . Look for one that does n't contain partially hydrogenated oil and that has as little saturated fat as possible .

According to the Food and Drug Administration , if a food has less than 0.5 grams of trans in a serving , the label can say " 0 grams . " <p> Is 0.3 or 0.4 grams of trans fat too little to worry about ? It may matter more than you think . In 2004 , a panel of scientists advising the FDA considered a limit of 2 grams of trans per day . So a spread that 's labeled " 0 grams trans " could supply nearly a quarter of a day 's limit in every tablespoon . That 's not trivial . <p> On the other hand , a tablespoon is roughly equal to three pats ( or three teaspoons ) of butter , and many people use less than that on a slice or two of toast . <p> We found several dozen spreads " our Best Bites " that have no partially hydrogenated oil and no more than 1.5 grams of sat fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our favorites : Country Crock Omega Plus and Plus Light , Olivio Light and regular , Promise activ Light and regular , Promise Light , Promise Buttery , Smart Balance Light with Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Omega Light , and Smart Beat Smart Squeeze .

The extra sat fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat came from Smart Balance . But few people fall into this category . <p> Instead , most of us get plenty of saturated fat from foods like cheese , chicken , and even low-fat milk , yogurt , and icecream .

It also has 0.4 of naturally occurring trans fat , which does as much harm as the artificial trans in partially hydrogenated oil . Yet some people insist on butter no matter what . <p> If that 's you , check out Land O'Lakes delicious Light Butter with Canola Oil .

More than 10 percent of fruits and vegetables sold are now organic . By any measure , organic foods are starting to enter the mainstream American diet . <p> And with good reason . Organic produce often has higher levels of potentially healthy compounds . And organic farms may fare better in droughts , do n't use synthetic fertilizers that contaminate groundwater , and are more hospitable to critical pollinators like bees and butterflies . <h> NUTRIENTS <p> A : Yes . In about 60 percent of the studies , organic food is higher in some nutrients than conventionally produced food . About 30 to 35 percent of the time , there 's no statistical difference , and in 5 to 10 percent of the studies , the nutrient levels are higher in the conventional food . That 's based on studies that compare the same varieties of fruits and vegetables grown in similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparisons . <p> In a recent Stanford University review " which claimed that organic produce is n't more nutritious than conventional " only half the studies were done that way . <p> Q : How much higher are the levels in organic foods ? <p> A : Generally about 5 to 15 percent , but they can be 30 or even 100 percent higher . In a two-year study of tomatoes purchased in Barcelona markets published this spring , organic tomatoes had twice the level of some polyphenols as conventionally grown tomatoes.1 Polyphenols are antioxidants and may be one of the main reasons fruits and vegetables are healthy for us . <p> Q : Why do organically grown plants have more beneficial compounds ? <p> A : The two key factors are the stronger natural defenses of organic plants and a dilution effect in conventional plants . <p> Plants in an organic field have to fend off a range of insects , so their natural defense mechanisms are turned on earlier and more fully manifest themselves . As a result , they have higher concentrations of defensive compounds that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect ? <p> A : If you keep putting on more and more nitrogen fertilizer the way conventional farms do , you drive yields up and produce bigger plants . But this dilutes the plants ' levels of vitamins , minerals , and polyphenols . <p> For example , in the fall you see beautiful , huge apples in stores that are incredibly juicy and very sweet . Those apples were grown in conventional orchards where farmers have pushed up yields and pushed up sugar concentrations by using a lot of nitrogen and irrigation water . <p> The trees have to do something with the extra nutrients , and the easiest thing is to convert them into sugars . These apples are juicy and sweet , yes , but the concentration of vitamins , minerals , and phytonutrients in them goes down . That 's a classic example of the dilution effect . <p> Q : Does that affect shelf life ? <p> A : Yes . Take apples . Organic apples store longer , and this has been shown all over the world . It 's because they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their skin , which helps to retard the growth of molds and bacteria that lead to spoilage . <p> Conventionally grown apples have diluted levels of these natural antibacterial antioxidants . Plus their extra nitrogen and sugar is exactly what spoilage bacteria and molds need to grow . <p> Q : What about contaminants that cause food poisoning ? <p> A : Both organic and conventional foods can be a source of food poisoning outbreaks . However , in an organic system , there 's a much higher level of microbial biodiversity , so there are more naturally beneficial microbes in the system and soil . <p> Studies show that when you introduce pathogens into an organic system , they often do n't survive very long because the biologically rich community of organisms that 's naturally there either competes effectively with them or uses them for lunch . <p> Q : And in conventional plants ? <p> A : Pesticide use in conventional agriculture tends to reduce microbial biodiversity , both in the soil and on the surfaces of the plant . So when a pathogen does take hold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pathogen populations can grow . <p> Most bacteria need nitrogen , and a ready source of nitrogen can fuel spikes in their levels . So in conventional systems that have an excess of nitrogen , there 's extra " gas " that can drive up pathogen levels . <h> PESTICIDES <p> Q : Are organic foods pesticide-free ? <p> A : No . Although organic foods are grown without the use of synthetic pesticides , they can pick up traces blown in the air from conventional farms or from water or packing materials in processing plants . <p> Q : Are pesticide levels on organic produce much lower than on conventional ? <p> A : Yes , but if you measure the difference only in terms of the number of residues found , it 's not nearly as dramatic as when you take into account the levels of the pesticides found and how toxic they are . <p> We developed and computed a Dietary Risk Index , or DRI , for the residues found in conventional versus organic strawberries , apples , grapes , blueberries , nectarines , pears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's DRI averaged 24 , while the organic fruit 's DRI was only 3 . That 's impressive . <p> Since most consumers first seek out organic food to reduce pesticide risks , this shows that people get what they pay for . <p> Q : Is imported produce riskier ? <p> A : Yes . One of the big changes in pesticide risk over the past decade is that the difference between domestic and imported produce has grown . When Congress passed the Food Quality Protection Act FQPA in 1996 , which reformed pesticide use , about three-quarters of the dietary risk from pesticides in the food supply was from fruits and vegetables grown in the United States and one-quarter was from imports . <p> Now probably 80 percent of the risk is from imports and only about 20 percent is from domestically grown food . Today , the highest-risk fresh fruits and vegetables almost across the board are imported . Consumers are exposed to these mostly from December through April . <p> Q : Why the change ? <p> A : The Environmental Protection Agency implemented the FQPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . It reduced the numbers and rates of pesticide applications and lengthened the interval between the last application and the harvesting of food . <p> These changes lowered the dietary risk of domestically produced food , but they had no impact on imports . <p> Q : How significant are the differences ? <p> A : Some are dramatic . The last time the government analyzed domestic and imported peaches for pesticides was in 2008 . If you calculate the DRIs for each sample it tested , 98 of the 100 most risky peach samples were imported from Chile , one was from Argentina , and the other was from the United States . Of the 100 peaches with the lowest DRIs , 99 were grown in the U.S. <p> So if I were a domestic peach grower and saw peaches high on a dirty dozen list , I would be pretty upset . The EPA , the U.S. Department of Agriculture , and Congress need to start driving down the high-risk residues in imported fruits and vegetables , to at least match the reductions achieved by U.S. growers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pesticides that are on conventional foods ? <p> A : The evidence now is compelling that low-level exposure to organophosphate insecticides from food and the environment has been contributing to a suite of neurological and developmental problems , such as lost IQ points . These problems can be hard to measure in an individual , but are profound for society as a whole . <p> Q : How extensive has the impact been ? <p> A : David Bellinger of the Harvard Medical School published an important analysis this spring looking at the risk factors that contribute to lower IQs in children.2 He drew on high-quality studies that looked at medical conditions like preterm birth and pediatric bipolar disorders and at the environmental contaminants lead , mercury , and organophosphate insecticides . <p> From these studies , he estimated that prenatal exposures to organophosphate insecticides were probably causing a greater loss of IQ points among some U.S. children aged five and younger than anything other than preterm births and lead exposure . <p> While the risk to a given child is small , the exposure is so widespread that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The harm is primarily to children ? <p> A : Pound for pound , children are exposed to more pesticides than adults . And their developing bodies are more sensitive to the adverse effects of pesticides . <p> That 's why pesticide regulation must focus on protecting the developing fetus and protecting children , especially during the first two years of life , but also through adolescence . The brain continues to grow and the nervous system continues to develop throughout the teenage years . <p> Q : What 's the evidence of harm ? <p> A : It 's challenging to get proof of harm to children or adults . The most compelling evidence is for chlorpyrifos , an organophosphate insecticide . It 's almost certainly the riskiest pesticide to humans that 's still widely used on food crops . <p> In two studies published last year , researchers followed 400 children born around the year 2000 to women living in New York City 's low-income neighborhoods.3,4 Some of them lived in public housing projects where exterminators used chlorpyrifos to kill insects in the buildings . <p> When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urine to measure how much insecticide the fetuses were exposed to in the womb . They 've been tracking the children for 10 years now . <p> Q : What impact did chlorpyrifos have ? <p> A : The kids from mothers with the highest levels of chlorpyrifos or other organophosphates during pregnancy were at greater risk for multiple developmental deficits , including slightly lower IQs when they were six to nine years old . <p> In a similar study of California farmworkers ' families , children of mothers with the highest levels of organophosphates during pregnancy had IQs that were 7 points lower than children of mothers with the lowest levels.5 <p> Q : How is that related to food ? <p> A : A quarter of women of reproductive age in the United States in 2000 had average levels of organophosphates in their bodies comparable to the levels found in the high-exposure group of women in the California farmworker study.6 <p> Since then , the EPA has banned nearly all home uses of chlorpyrifos , and has severely restricted most other uses of organophosphates in homes , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use primarily in agriculture . So most of a woman 's exposure now comes from food . <p> It makes sense when you realize that a person eating 3 or 4 servings of vegetables a day is probably exposed to 3 or 5 or 6 organophosphates on a daily basis . It 's easy to understand how pregnant women could have these in their bodies . And very low levels may be harming their children . <p> Q : Has n't organophosphate exposure decreased since 2000 ? <p> A : The EPA has driven down pesticide levels in domestically grown produce , but much less so in imports . We 'll have to wait for the next government survey of our health status and levels of contaminants like chlorpyrifos to determine whether there has been a meaningful decline in residue levels in women . <p> Q : And eating organic foods would lessen the exposure ? <p> A : Yes . When researchers at Emory University in Atlanta gave children organic fruits and vegetables to eat instead of conventional ones , chlorpyrifos fell to almost undetectable levels in their urine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disappointed that the EPA has not acted to end all the uses of chlorpyrifos that lead to residues in food or beverages , given our deepening understanding of the many ways that chlorpyrifos exposures can disrupt normal fetal development , leading to cognitive deficits that could have serious lifelong repercussions . <p> Q : What about adults ? <p> A : Residues in food rarely are high enough to pose acute risks to healthy adults . The concern for adults is with long-term degenerative diseases such as cancer , heart disease , diabetes , and dementia . <p> Much of the evidence of harm comes from studies on animals or on farmworkers , their families , and others who face the greatest exposures and the greatest risk . But these studies raise concerns about the rest of us , who are exposed to lower levels . <p> The evidence was strong enough for the President 's Cancer Panel to recommend in 2010 that consumers choose , to the extent possible , food grown without pesticides or chemical fertilizers.8 <p> Q : Are people who eat more fruits and vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A : Yes . That 's why the single most important diet change you can make is to eat more fruits and vegetables and less bad fat , added sugar , and highly processed foods . The second most important thing is to seek out organic fruits and vegetables . <p> Q : How hard would it be to lower the pesticide risks in food ? <p> A : The EPA could reduce by one-half or more the dietary risk in the U.S. food supply by selectively targeting just a few pesticides applied to no more than a dozen crops . Of the 200 pesticides found on our food , just six account for 66 percent of the total risk . One of them is chlorpyrifos.

Besides being bad news for men who have taken selenium in the hope of avoiding prostate cancer , the study comes at an inconvenient time for Bayer Healthcare , which was- notified recently- that it will be sued if it continues to claim that the selenium in its One A Day vitamins for men reduces risk of the disease or otherwise benefits the prostate . <p> Today , the- Center for Science in the Public Interest- filed a- formal complaint with the Food and Drug Administration- over the various prostate claims on One A Day 's labeling . The claim that the selenium in One A Day Men 's Health Formula reduces the risk of prostate cancer gives the product the status of an unapproved drug , and is therefore illegal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another men 's supplement that selenium " supports prostate health " is deceptive and illegal since it is unsubstantiated by scientific evidence and implies that the product can reduce the risk of prostate cancer . No published studies have investigated whether selenium helps or hurts when it comes to the only other common prostate problem , benign prostatic hyperplasia , or enlarged prostate . CSPI says the FDA should seize existing stockpiles of the deceptively labeled products until the company corrects the labels . <p> Coincidentally , on June 19 , the FDA authorized a very negatively worded " qualified health claim " which Bayer is unlikely to use , according to CSPI . It reads : <p> Two weak studies suggest that selenium intake may reduce the risk of prostate cancer . However , four stronger studies and three weak studies showed no reduction in risk . Based on these studies , FDA concludes that it is highly unlikely that selenium supplements reduce the risk of prostate cancer . <p> Even if Bayer wanted to use that new claim , it could not since it only applies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the selenate form of the mineral in One A Day pills . <p> To prevent consumers from being misled , CSPI said that FDA must halt not only the claim that selenium reduces the risk of cancer , but also the milder claim about supporting prostate health . CSPI says that " supports prostate health " is deceptive because there 's no good evidence to support it . <p> On June 18 , besides notifying Bayer of a potential lawsuit , CSPI filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission over Bayer 's advertising . Some of the leading prostate cancer researchers in the country wrote the FTC in support of CSPI 's complaint . Bayer has yet to respond to CSPI 's demand letter , but- news reports- indicate that the company may already be retreating from claiming selenium reduces risk of prostate cancer , but has not promised to remove the more generally deceptive claims concerning " prostate health . " <p> In the- latest study , published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology , researchers at the University of California at San Francisco looked at men with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive cases of cancer in men with high selenium blood levels and the V genotype for an antioxidant enzyme found in most cells . Seventy-five percent of men have the V genotype ; only 25 percent of men have the AA genotype which seems to reduce their risk of aggressive prostate cancer . The findings " indicate caution against broad use of selenium supplementation for men with prostate cancer , " the authors wrote . <p> Yet- another study , this one published this month in the journal Circulation : Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes , found that men with higher blood selenium levels were more likely to have hypertension than men with lower blood selenium levels . <p> The most ambitious examination ever conducted to see if selenium prevents prostate cancer , the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial ( SELECT ) , was actually halted early when researchers discovered that besides not preventing prostate cancer , selenium supplements might have been causing diabetes in the men assigned to take it . <p> " Bayer must be stopped from promoting its selenium-containing products as a means of reducing prostate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior nutritionist David Schardt . " Not only does selenium not prevent cancer , supplementation with selenium may be harmful . " <p> Bayer is a repeat offender when it comes to misleading claims on labeling and advertising , according to CSPI . In 2007 , it paid a $3.2 million fine as part of a consent decree reached with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice over weight-loss claims made in connection with another One A Day product . Bayer is also running a $20-million corrective advertising campaign about its birth control pill Yaz at the behest of the FDA and a number of state attorneys general . <p> " By violating the terms of the FTC consent decree , Bayer could be held in contempt of court , " said CSPI litigation director Steve Gardner . " The FTC should penalize Bayer substantially , and require corrective advertising . In addition , the FDA should coordinate with the FTC to stop all claims that fall within its jurisdiction . " <p> In separate letters , today , the CSPI urged- Major League Baseball- and the- Prostate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign- for Bayer One A Day . Bayer and MLB jointly contribute $10 to the foundation for every strikeout thrown by a major league pitcher . The amount of money that the charity stands to gain in a typical season , then , would be in the $350,000 ballpark , in all likelihood a small fraction of the profits that Bayer rakes in from the deceptive labeling and advertising .

But the group says the agency should revise its proposal to include a Daily Value for added sugars and to further lower the Daily Value for sodium to 1,500 milligrams . <p> " Nutrition Facts labels have helped millions of Americans select healthier diets and have spurred food companies to compete more on the basis of nutrition , " said CSPI executive director Michael F.

The move , which paves the way for a prohibition , or at the very least , strict curbs on the fake fat 's use , was hailed by the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest as a major step in protecting consumers from artificial trans fat , a potent cause of heart disease . <p> " Artificial trans fat is a uniquely powerful promoter of heart disease , and today 's announcement will hasten its eventual disappearance from the food supply , " said CSPI executive director Michael F.

I hope that those restaurants and food manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall and promptly replace it . " <p> Though small amounts of trans fat occur in meat fat and milk fat , most of the trans fat in the food supply has come from industrially produced partially hydrogenated oils . Like saturated fat , trans fat raises one 's LDL , or " bad " cholesterol , which promotes heart disease . But unlike saturated fat , trans fat lowers one 's HDL , or the " good " kind of cholesterol that protects against heart disease . Trans fat may also promote heart disease in other ways , such as by damaging the endothelial cells that line blood vessels . <p> In 1993 , soon after trans fat was first strongly linked to heart disease , CSPI urged the FDA to require trans fat labeling , and in 1994 formally- petitioned the agency- to require a line for trans fat on Nutrition Facts labels .

Typically , the reformulated products were- lower in saturated fat as well as trans fat . To this day , though , many varieties of microwave popcorn , frozen pies , cookie dough , biscuits , frosting , and other foods still use the- discredited fake fat . Diamond Foods ' Pop Secret Premium Butter Popcorn has 5 grams of trans fat per serving " and it 's not uncommon for people to have more than one serving of popcorn at one sitting .
