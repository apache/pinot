You can use already colored rings like enameled copper , or use Kodiak 's clever idea of color coding the rings with felt tip markers . Anything that will help you keep the rings separated will work . You will need to be able to hold onto all of the rings , keeping them in a specific order until your starter piece is stable enough to hold normally . For that reason , I like to use very flimsy rings made of something like 24 or 22awg enameled copper . These can be easily closed with your fingers , so you can hold onto the rings without having to deal with pliers at the same time . The quality of your closures is unimportant in the beginning as long as there are no gaps big enough for another ring to slip through . I hold the rings along the bottom edge between my thumb and first finger . You should do whatever works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place holders until you reach a point where everything is stable enough that it does n't just fall apart on you . 20awg/3.0mm rings are a good size to use for your starter piece . <p> NOTE : I have also added a section at the bottom of this tutorial on how to tell if you are weaving JPL 5 correctly . <p> Step 1 . Lay out piles of opened rings in a line in front of you in the order that you will be adding them . This tutorial will use these colors in the following order . 1-RED , 2-YELLOW , 3-GREEN , 4-BLUE , 5-PINK <p> Step 2 . You will start with a 3 ring mobius with the first 3 colors . Notice that along the top edge , each new ring added is in FRONT of the previous rings . <p> Step 3 . Before you add 4-BLUE , flip 1-RED up so that it is in front along the top edge . <p> STEP 4 . Now add 4-BLUE through the middle of all the rings and place it with the top edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bottom so the top edge is in front . <p> Step 6 . Add 5-PINK through the middle of all the rings and place it in front along the top edge . <p> Step 7 . Flip 3-GREEN up from the bottom so it is in front along the top edge as usual . <p> Step 8 . Things change a little at this point . You will now be putting each ring through ONLY the last 4 rings . So , flip 1-RED up halfway . You will now add 6-RED through the last 4 rings and place its left edge above 1-RED . <p> Step 9 . Flip both RED rings up , still in their overlapping position , so that they are in front along the top edge . <p> Step 10 . Flip 4-BLUE up as usual . <p> Step 11 . Flip 2-YELLOW up halfway and add 7-YELLOW through the last 4 rings placing the left edge above 2-YELLOW . <p> Step 12 . Flip the YELLOW rings up as usual . Your piece should be getting stable enough that you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flip 5-PINK up as usual . <p> Step 14 . Flip 3-GREEN up halfway and add 8-GREEN through the last 4 rings placing the left edge above 3-GREEN <p> Step 15 . Flip the GREEN rings up as usual . <p> Step 16 . Flip 6-RED up . <p> Step 17 . Add the next BLUE ring . <p> Step 18 . Flip the BLUE and YELLOW rings up and add the next PINK ring . <p> Step 19 . Flip the PINK and GREEN rings up . Can you tell where the next ring should be added ? <p> Step 20 . That 's right , through the last 4 rings and angled the same as the 5th ring back . I knew you could do it ! <p> Continue adding rings , always through the last 4 rings and oriented the same way as the 5th ring back . Be sure to frequently look back to make sure that each ring is placed exactly right , or you will have to perform an autopsy to fix it . <p> LONG ... <p> You can make any JPL , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this tutorial by using a simple formula . <p> # of rings in the starting mobius = ( JPLx +1 ) /2 <p> So for JPL7 , you would start with a mobius of 4 because ( 7+1 ) /2 = 4 . Then flip ring #1 up , add the next ring , etc , just like in this tutorial . Then , when you get to the point of repeating the spiral , add each new ring through the last 6 rings and above the 7th ring back . <p> JPL9 would start with a mobius of 5. ( 9+1 ) /2 = 5 . Then flip ring #1 up , add the next ring , etc , just like in this tutorial . Then , when you get to the point of repeating the spiral , add each new ring through the last 8 rings and above the 9th ring back . <p> LONG ... <p> HOW TO TELL IF YOU ARE WEAVING JPL5 CORRECTLY <p> First a picture of JPL5 and not JPL5 TOP : correct BOTTOM : incorrect LONG ... <p> Same picture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Top chain is started correctly . Bottom chain is started incorrectly . LONG ... <p> The close-up of the correct one next to a rendered picture from the tutorial above . LONG ... <p> A picture of how you can tell if you have woven JPL5 correctly . Adjacent rows ALWAYS lean in opposite directions to each other . In the correctly woven top chain , the yellow row leans with the left side of the rings under its neighbor and the right side of the rings over its neighbor . The adjacent pink row leans with the left side of the rings over its neighbor and right side of the rings under its neighbor . Opposite leans . This back and forth lean with each adjacent row goes all the way around the chain . In the bottom chain the yellow row and its adjacent blue row have the same lean . This does not happen in correctly woven JPL5 . <p> If you have any questions about this tutorial , I will be happy to try to answer them . 79010 @qwx279010 79009 @qwx279009

Newcomers to the boards are often overwhelmed by a flurry of new terms , or worse , terms they already thought they knew the meaning of but which mean something completely different in this new context . <p> The purpose of this article is to provide a brief background for the terms a new mailler will need to understand to get started in the on-line maille world . <p> Weaves A maille weave is the design of the minimum repeatable unit in a particular kind of maille . The term ' weave ' should not be confused with the term ' pattern ' which describes the overall design of a finished piece , and can contain one or more weaves in various configurations . <p> There are scores of basic weaves known , with names like European 4 in 1 , Japanese 6 in 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the name of a weave *rarely* has anything to do with its origins , but often can be descriptive of its design . In addition to the basic weaves , there are literally hundreds of variants based on one or more of those weaves , many of which also have their own unique names . To make things worse , not everyone agrees on these names , so be sure you know for certain which one someone is referring to in conversations . <p> There is a basic system in naming that can help you out with simpler weaves . The appellations 4-in-1 , 8-in-1 , 12-in-2 , etc. refer to the number of rings which pass through the interior plane of any one ring in the weave . For example , European 6-in-1 is a weave of the European family in which every ring in the weave has 6 others passing through it . This system also allows description of weaves in which a basic design is enhanced by doubling or tripling ( or more ) rings in the weave . For example , Japanese 8-in-2 is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled ( hence " in-2 " instead of " in-1 " ) and has 8 rings ( 4 rings doubled ) passing through it . <p> Wire Gauge The basis of all maille production is wire . There are a number of issues regarding wire you should be aware of in order to communicate clearly on the subject . <p> The diameter of the wire you are using is extremely important to any design . It affects the choice of ring size , the weight , and the strength of a project . The simplest way to measure wire diameter is using one of the standard measurement systems such as decimal inches or metric . Unfortunately , most suppliers and users of wire have been in the wire business since long before these systems came into common usage , and use much older and less intuitive GAUGE systems . <p> The confusing part of this is that there are many gauge systems to choose from , and somehow the system you use never seems to be the one the person you 're talking to uses . The two most common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and American Wire Gauge ( AWG ) , also known as Browne and Sharpe . Make sure you specify your system when talking about wire , and make sure you know the other party 's as well . <p> Rings The basis of maille construction is the ring . Several simple concepts encompass most discussion on this topic . <p> Rings are usually either purchased pre-made from a commercial supplier , or produced by the mailler him/herself . In this case , the rings are normally made by winding wire into a coil around a cylindrical shaft called a mandrel , then cutting coils into rings . The coiling process can be done by hand , by means of a coiling apparatus wherein the end of the mandrel is bent into a handle and inserted into blocks ( hand-cranked ) , or by ' power winding ' , a risky practice wherein the mandrel is inserted into the chuck of a power drill . <p> Rings can be described in any number of ways , but at the core , two basic measurements define a ring ; 1 ) Wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The diameter of a ring can is usually described using one of two different systems ; Inner Diameter ( i.d. ) or Outer Diameter ( o.d ) . In the maille community , most use the i.d . method ( owing to the ease of finding mandrels of standard sizes ) , but always make sure . <p> A convenient means of discussing ring sizes is the aspect ratio ( a.r. ) of a ring . This is nothing more than the mathematical ratio between the diameter of the ring and the diameter of the wire . It 's convenience comes from the fact that weaves will have the same properties for rings of the same a.r. , regardless of the actual size of the rings . Aspect ratio let 's you scale your designs up and down , and discuss them clearly with others . <p> When a ring is produced , the gap between its two ends is called a kerf . Obviously , the larger the kerf , the more effort must be put into closing the ring . Once the ring is closed by the mailler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is tightly butted together . <p> Bolt Cutters - Heavy-duty compound cutters used for thick or hard wire . Characterized by having triangular cutting edges which meet point to point . <p> Diagonal Cutters - The most common kind . These can be found in all shapes and sizes , and have wedge-shaped cutting edges , one side of which is flat in the plane of the cut . Specialized versions of this type include flush cutters , which make a cut on which one side is clean and flat , and double-flush cutters , which supposedly make a cut on which both sides are clean and flat . <p> End Cutters/Nippers - Have a cutting edge which cuts perpendicular to the plane of the handles . Often used for heavy-duty work . The profile of their cutting edge is much like that of a diagonal cutter . <p> Jeweler 's Saws - Look like a cross between a jigsaw and a hacksaw . They use extremely fine blades and are used to make almost perfectly flush cuts , albeit slowly . <p> Patterns The whole point of making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product . The following is a list of terms in general use for various items maillers often want to make or use with the things they make : <p> Byrnie - A shirt made of maille which comes to the waist and has no sleeves . <p> Haubergeon - A shirt made of maille which comes to the hips/upper thighs and has short sleeves . Historically , these were also often laced up the sides . <p> Hauberk - A shirt made of maille which comes to the knee or mid-thigh and has half to full sleeves . Late versions of the hauberk included maille mittens . <p> Mantle - A circular drape made of maille with a hole in the middle for the wearer 's head . It covers the shoulders , upper arms , and upper chest . <p> Coif - A head covering made of maille with or without an integrated mantle . Usually worn over a padded cloth head covering which is unforunately often also called a ' coif ' . 79010 @qwx279010 79009 @qwx279009

I personally use Paint Shop Pro . If you 've got Adobe Photoshop and have wrapped your head around it then you probably wo n't need this part of the article . However , for the purposes of this article I am going to use free software , in particular GIMP - the GNU Image Manipulation Program . Do n't worry if you 've never used it before ( I had n't before I decided to write this article ) , as I 'll walk you through with screen shots . GIMP Can be found at http : //www.gimp.org . <p> Spreadsheet software : Again you can use any spreadsheet package you like for this as long as it is capable of importing a text file . I personally use Microsoft Excel but have used openoffice.org Calc as well . As it is free , we 'll be using Calc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found at http : //www.openoffice.org . <p> Maille pattern software : For this you will use the ever-useful IGP tool created by Zlosk . Again this program is free , and works on PCs only , not on Macs . It may be possible to run with an PC emulator . IGP can apply images to maille graph papers but also has a very useful text output tool that you will be using to create your inlay . IGP can be found at http : **35;0;TOOLONG . You may also need the . NET Framework if not already installed on your machine in order to run IGP . This is also linked to from Zlosk 's download page . <p> Part 1 <p> A bit of prep work : <p> First of all you need to make sure your image is in digital format . If it 's not then you will either need to scan your image or take a photo of it with a digital camera . <p> Secondly , you need to note that inlays work better with a tight Aspect Ratio ( AR ) . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weave is any looser than this the image can seem to fade as there are more " holes " in the fabric . This is however , a recommendation only . If the inlay is intended as part of a piece of clothing or armour then you will want an AR the same as the rest of the project or risk not being able to move . <p> Next comes a bit of maths . <p> You need to do one of the following : a ) decide how big the final inlay needs to be and how many rings you want to weave . This will determine the size of ring you will need to make/purchase. b ) decide how big the final inlay needs to be and what size rings you will be using . This will determine how many rings you will use and ultimately the resolution of your inlay. c ) decide what ring size you will use and the number of rings you will weave . This will determine the final size of your inlay . <p> TRL has some useful information in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European 4in1 for any particular size . This can come in handy when working out the above . <p> Next you need to decide if you are going to use the whole image or if you just want part , like a face . You 're probably only going to want a part of the image you will need the select tool . <p> Highlight the area of the image you want to use by left clicking at the top left of the part of the image you want to select . Hold the left mouse button down and drag the pointer to the lower left corner of the area you want to select . The selected area of the image should now be bounded by a dashed box like this . <p> Now you need to copy and paste this selection to a new image . Go to the edit menu and select " copy " to copy this part of the image to the clipboard . <p> Next , to use this selection as an image on its own , go to the edit menu again and select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Your new smaller image should now fill a new workspace like this . <p> Close your original image at this point ( without saving any changes ) and save your new image as something new . Give it a name like " masterimage " so you do n't save any changes over it . <p> Next you need to reduce the size of the image to match the bit of maths you did earlier . <p> For arguments sake my inlay will have a fixed width of 150 rings . For a normal portrait style photo this will give somewhere between a 25,000 and 30,000 ring inlay depending on the height . <p> Go to the image menu and select the " scale " tool . You will now see the scale tool appear like this . <p> Input the new width and the height should automatically snap to the correct corresponding size when you move the cursor to the height box . If it does n't snap to maintain aspect ratio then you will need to click the little picture of a chain at the side to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your image will be resized like this . <p> Next you need to reduce the image to a dithered black and white dot matrix image . <p> Hit convert and your image will be rendered down to a black and white dithered image . <p> Now save your image with a new name using the " save as " feature in the file menu . <p> OK , now you have successfully transformed your photo into a 1-bit image , but it is still black and white . I guess this is OK if you 're doing your inlay in black and white metals , but what if you are making it from say , aluminium and copper . <p> You can use the colour exchange tool to change one colour in the image to another which will give us a better idea of what the finished piece will look like . <p> First the image needs to be converted back to a full colour image while retaining its 1 bit appearance . This is a simple operation done by using the mode tool again . <p> From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . This keeps the image as a black and white 1 bit image but increases the palette size to allow us to change some colours around . <p> Now to change the colour . From the colour menu , use the " map " tool and select " colour exchange " . <p> You will now see the following menu . <p> At the top you can select the colour you want to change and at the bottom you can select the colour you want to change it to . <p> If you click on the relevant colour block by the " From Colour " and " To Colour " titles you will see the following colour selection tool . Play around with the colour settings until you get something close to the desired colour . <p> When selecting the " From Colour " you can use the eye dropper tool towards the bottom right of the colour select window to pick the colour from your image . <p> For this example I 've changed the black to an orangey colour to represent the copper and changed the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important to change the white away from white even if only very slightly , as IGP can encounter problems when dealing with the RGB value 255 255 255 for white . This is a known quirk in the program but is a compromise between functionality and speed . <p> Hurrah ! That 's the image editing done with . <p> Now you just need to save your file . It is best to save the final image as a bmp or gif . DO N'T save as a jpg as IGP does n't support loading jpeg files . <p> Previewing your inlay : <p> You can skip this step and go straight to loading the image into IGP but it 's definitely worth previewing your image to make sure it 'll look OK when finished . The best way to do this is to load the image you 've just created into IGP2POV . <p> Do n't panic . You do n't need to know how to use POV-Ray . IGP2POV handles all of that for you . POV-Ray just needs to be installed so that IGP2POV can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got these bits of software installed so open up IGP2POV and it should look like this . <p> For " File in " browse for the image you created earlier . Leave the info for " File out " alone . Input whatever ring data you have for the rings you 'll be making the inlay from for ring parameters . Select " Right Way " for stretch . <p> Now click " Render " . IGP2POV will now create a script and then call POV-Ray to render it . This can take a few minutes depending on the speed of your computer . <p> You should end up with an image something like this . <p> If at this stage you 're not happy with how the inlay looks then you may want to go back and play with the colour settings of the original small image you created before reducing to black and white . Try exploring the functions in the colour menu to see if you can get the results you want . A good place to start is with the brightness and contrast settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern : <p> Assuming you are happy with the result then you now need to process the image with IGP . <p> Open IGP and you should be presented with a screen that looks like this . <p> Go to the File menu and select " open " . Open the small image you created earlier NOT the large one you just rendered in IGP2POV . <p> Do n't worry about what the image looks like when it 's loaded or what graph paper it 's in . At this point you are only interested in the text file you can output from IGP . <p> To output the text file click the " Count colours " button on the right hand side of the IGP screen . This will bring up the following window . <p> At this point we can change the RGB values of the colours to something more meaningful . <p> You can do this by single clicking the RGB value in the colour column on the left . IGP will display the corresponding colour in the box on the right . Now double click the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text box into which you can type your more meaningful text . Be careful on versions of IGP prior to 0.6.0.5 as double clicking on the white space or total line can crash the program . <p> Here I have used Cu to represent copper and Al to represent Aluminium <p> Now you 're going to save this info as a CSV file . To do this , click on the " Save as text ... " button . Then , when you are presented with the save window you will need to change " Save as type " at the bottom to " All ( *. * ) " and make sure the file name you enter has the extension csv . <p> Click " Save " <p> Now you need to open the CSV file in OpenOffice.org Calc . <p> Before the file loads you will be presented with a screen that asks how to handle the file . <p> You will need to make sure that the " Merge Delimiters " , " Space " and " Other " boxes are ticked and put a colon into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the csv file will now load and be presented like this . <p> The info from the original text file has now been split into rows and columns which make it easier for us to work with . Each row in the spreadsheet is a row of links in the inlay and each column contains counts of contiguous rings in any one colour/material . <p> This is essentially our " knitting " pattern . The numbers at the very top tell us how many of each ring you will need in total for the project . Looking at the first line of info you can see that the first row of links starts with 26 copper rings followed by 1 aluminium ring then 19 copper rings and so on . <p> You can now play around with column widths and font sizes to print this spreadsheet on as few pages as you can manage . 79010 @qwx279010 79009 @qwx279009

It can also be described as Crenelated-3 Sheet with a third layer of large rings . <p> The original sample that was shown here uses 14g galvanized steel rings purchased from The Ring Lord , 1/2 " I 'd for the flat rings and 1/4 " I 'd for the vertical rings . This combination of AR is what Blaise would probably call absolute* . It can be worked maybe a little bit more , but it is already fairly tight in places . Further experimentation by ShadowFire ( See : Triskelion/Aura Variant Sheet/Tao of the Dragon Sheet ) indicates that with this combination ( or a similar combination ) of rings , the piece will start to curve in on itself and become concave . <p> The sample in the new image uses 12AWG ( .081 " , 2.052mm ) salvaged electrical copper wire wound on a 1/2 " ( 12.7mm , 7/0SWG ) mandrel and cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/4 " machine cut bright aluminum rings . This seems to allow indefinite sheetability . I 've got a triangularish patch approximately 4-6 " ( have n't measured it yet ) on a side with no signs of tightening up .

This combination bends far enough I could make a bracelet for most people , but it will not bend back upon itself without damaging rings . <p> Also , take a close look at the junctions in the new image . The six small rings passing through that opening " pinwheel " in order to fit smoothly and keep the sheet flexible . It does n't matter which direction you pinwheel these rings , and it does n't seem to matter whether you pinwheel them all the same direction or not , as long as they are pinwheeled . If you are concerned about somebody taking a close look at a finished piece in this weave , you might want to pay attention to your pinwheel directions , but otherwise , just make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around with ring sizes to eliminate this pinwheeling requirement . 79010 @qwx279010 79009 @qwx279009

@@26699448 @399448/ 79008 @qwx279008 <p> For the sake of clarity and brevity , Japanese 8 in 2 Cube will be referred to in this article as ' J8-2C ' . <p> J8-2C is a relatively simple weave that can be used to sculpt almost any 3-d shape . It requires a minimum aspect ratio of approximately 3.5 ( Ed - 3.8 was later found to the minimum ) , and seems to work best around an AR of 3.8 . This tutorial contains instructions on how to build one basic 3x3 cube unit of the J8-2C weave . <p> Since this weave is composed entirely of doubled rings , these instructions can also be used to construct Japanese 4-1 Cube Weave simply by substituting one ring or higher AR for each pair of rings shown . The instructions will refer to each pair of doubled rings as a ' link ' . A given link will be called a ' base ' link if it is parallel to the horizontal , or as a ' connector ' link if it is perpendicular to the horizontal . <p> J8-2C is composed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer configuration , referred to in this tutorial as a ' level ' , is simply a sheet of Japanese 8 in 2 sheet weave . The second , referred to as an ' interstice ' , is the invisible glue that holds the levels together , and gives the cube its internal support . The interstitial base links are often left out by the novice weaver , producing a " floppy " cube . Pay special attention to these ' invisible ' layers . <p> Step 1 : <p> Start by connecting two links together . <p> Step 2 : <p> Treating one link as a base , and the other as a connector , add three more connector links to the base . <p> Step 3 : <p> Add a base link to the open end of each connector link . <p> Steps 4 &amp; 5 : <p> Add 2 connector links to each of the new bases . <p> Step 6 : <p> Add base links to the four open corners of the resulting sheet . <p> Step 7 : <p> Now an interstitial layer must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding two connector links through two adjacent corner connectors of the level below . <p> Step 8 : <p> Connect a base link through the two new connectors . <p> Step 9 : <p> Complete the interstitial unit by adding two more connector links through the base ring and the connectors of the level below . <p> Step 10 : <p> Add three more of these units to complete the interstitial layer . <p> Step 11 : <p> To add the next level to the weave , repeat steps 1 through 6 , adding each connector link through the corresponding connector link of the interstitial layer below . <p> Step 12 : <p> Repeat steps 7 through 10 to create the next interstitial layer . <p> Step 13 : <p> Again , add a level by repeating steps 1 through 6 , adding each connector link through the corresponding connector link of the interstitial layer below . <p> Continuation : <p> This weave can continue outward on all three axes , allowing it to produce any shape .

@@26699518 @399518/ 79008 @qwx279008 <p> Well , hello there , all of you amazing maille artisans ! I 've started recently ( Within the last four days ) the start of a maille shirt . Now , the uninitiated in my life who CONSISTENTLY force me to call it chain maille are not here , so I can begin with my questions . <p> The mandrel I am using for creating my own rings ( I cut them with the thinnest dremel cutting discs I have . Flat join is so nice ) is 1/4 " , and , being the gimboid that I am , I was buying wire for my jig that I built , and looking at 16ga , thought it looked a little ... flimsy , so I went and bought 50ft of 14ga galv. steel wire . <p> Is it still possible to have a decent looking maille shirt with 14ga rings that are 1/4 " I 'd ? And while I do know that 3/8 " is usually the size for 14ga , according to what I 've looked up , is it still okay to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will post pictures of my progress as I go ( Sticking with 14ga for now ) , due to the fact that I am currently short a computer , and borrowing one from someone else so I can use this site . <p> Everyone should have a summer of " Why Not " . It allows you to do new things . <p> yes , 14swg is a good wire size for a shirt . keep in mind that 14swg galvanized will be very heavy to wear . <p> a word of caution . i do n't recommend cutting galvanized with a dremel cut off blade . the fumes that heated galvanized produce are very toxic . if you must use a dremel , make sure you have a fan blowing for ventilation . a more ideal set up would include oil or other lubrication applied directly to the cut point . <p> I am aware about the danger of the fumes generated from cutting , and part of the reason I 'm glad I have a backyard table I can cut them on . Safety glasses and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off of spray paint fumes , I made sure to have a chemical filter respirator ) . <p> Thanks for the link , though . I 'm passing it on to some other people I know who are interested in making maille . <p> ( Wide backyard space . I do n't cut things inside for health reasons , a.k.a . I live with a bunch of other people , and the ventilation system is weird . ) <p> I 'm always looking to figure out ways to upgrade , so thanks for the advice on the lubrication . Unfortunately , I can only get 8 rings max out of a coil when I am cutting with my thin cut-off disc before it explodes on me ( The disc , not the wire ) . I 'm adding your advice with the lubrication to my list of needed upgrades . At some point , I hope to make my jig an all-in-one ring production center . <p> Everyone should have a summer of " Why Not " . It allows you to do new things . <p> The fumes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , nor Methyl Ethyl Ketone ( bad enough ) -- but they are noxious . Google up " metal fume fever " " foundry flu " and " Anvilfire Paw Paw Wilson " ( deceased ) for a clear picture of what kind of trouble you *could* get into . At low levels , it 's not much . At really high levels , it 's not good . <p> Filings or dust really are not a problem . A paper dust/etc. mask is close to overkill for keeping your breathing-parts untroubled in the face of powdered zinc and iron with a touch of carbon in it . ( " For what , we ask , is steel without a touch of carbon in it -- ? " ( /Gilbert &amp; Sullivan ) ) <p> ************** <p> For a mailshirt in either 16ga or 14ga , I accept boltcutter cuts for speed of cutting -- up to 1 cut stroke per second -- and durability of cutter : no consumption of cutting tool . Then I butt such links facet to facet rather than straight on point to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of round , acceptable in an armor project ( even mailshirts of riveted links are so ) , but still a tight , fairly smooth closure . <p> Dremel grind cutting is better suited for projects smaller than a shirt of approximately 25k rings or more . You 've noticed it consumes hours as well as cutting discs . Cutters are comparatively swift as hand tools go . There is coiling/cutting machinery , which some professional sellers like Knuut , occasional poster here , use to fill orders . There is such a thing as saw cutting , both pro and amateur . <p> 5/16 " link I 'd gives substantially more room to work with in 14ga , and is about as small a link diameter as I would go with in that wire . 3/8 " , while quite convenient with this wire and more open , is just convenient , not sacred or anything . And lighter . In butted-link mail that 's no small consideration , particularly if you 're actually going to use your shirt for anything more active than a doorstop ( dismal prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) wire , .063 " wire diameter , really starts to come into its own about at 1/4 " link I 'd . It has a link Aspect Ratio ( q.v . by searching this site ) of 4 , which is about ideal for **28;74;TOOLONG , all in all . It suits this slenderer wire well , and I recommend it . In a 5/16 " I 'd , such wire does a better job if you go to the trouble of riveting it , for fifteen times the strength . 18ga soft wire is about the ultimate feedstock for riveted-mail projects : light-ish , at 5/8 the weight of the same size links in 14ga , fifteen times as strong , and infinitely greater in bragging rights and for lectures about ancient war technologies . Which fascinate some people . <p> Back when mail was a commonplace instrument of war , they also never made headdresses nor other jewelry of it : mail was like a parkerized semiauto pistol , a tool of war , plain and simple , nothing but . <p> For riveted stuff , 16ga is doable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , special use mail , such as on very exposed or very vital spots . In armored sword fighting , this often means the neck . 16ga would be entirely right for a 14th-c. mail camail , hung off a 14th-c. bascinet helmet to protect all the neck and drape on the shoulders . It is a modestly sized mail project too , coming to about 5k links . The riveted shirt to go with , you might prefer to use 18ga wire for that . Or if possible , avoid the mailshirt altogether , as some swordplay groups can -- the SCA . To a lesser degree , the HEMA schools . <p> I 'm aware of metal fume fever , foundry flu , the various names for something that I would rather not have under any circumstances ( Stuff like that can lay me out for weeks - it 's bad when I get sick ) . <p> First off , MASSIVE info dump . I appreciate it , but WOW , that 's a lot of info . <p> I 'm aware of the problem I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That I cut myself - Hit 1ft after 6 hours of off/on work . Mostly connecting it on work lunch breaks ) in regards to the density and weight . The weight 's not the problem . Because I go up against people with some fairly skookum weapons in the Amtgard group I am a part of , this was more to try and stave off getting hit directly with a buddy 's weapon , a great he affectionately calls " Tombstone . " <p> While , yes , 16ga would have been the BRIGHT idea for me to start out with , and , yes , I 'm aware of the different maille creation types ( Riveted would be cool if I had the better materials , or the time to dedicate to it ) . I 've got 250ft of 14ga Galv . Steel wire , and I started with 1/4 . <p> Considering how I end up " butting " the rings , they close REALLY nicely . My cut is not fully straight , but slightly to an angle , something which I 've now seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When I get a decent-sized piece , I 'll post a picture so you can see Gimboid 's First Maille . <p> ( As a note , I MAKE all of my own rings . It 's cheaper and far less time-consuming than the wait for a package to be shipped to Western Canada , where I live . The cutting discs that I use are cheap enough that I can set aside my good cutters for other projects and when I 'm pulling coils off of my mandrel . ) <p> Also , Konstantin , I 've seen a fair amount of your posts in this site , and a lot of them I go back and use as reference information . <p> Everyone should have a summer of " Why Not " . It allows you to do new things . <p> I 've , like , only ever worked in galvy myself , what with the armor-nerd thing through the SCA , with which you may be somewhat familiar . Minus any Magic Missile water balloons -- or was that Dagorhir ? -- and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite like Amtgard in many ways . SCA polearms ( halberds , bills , blade-on-a-stick ) mostly get their warheads shaped from stiff foam , like the stuff they pack electronics in for shipping in their cartons . Resilient safety thrusting heads are a feature . <p> So the mail 's kind of simply a part of an overall hobby , a means to its ends . Riveted mail of skinny wire is slowly becoming more common in the SCA , and the steel groups like HACA , HEMA , and ARMA preferred to start out with riveted mail , often gotten of Indian make , where it is the primary industry of one small village . <p> 250 feet of 14ga wire is , well , not that heavy an expense ; it can always be reserved for larger-link ( ca. 3/8 " I 'd ) projects later . For more bang for your Canada buck , see what 's available from the town lumberyard -- anywhere they might sell galvanized wire by the pound , because that is cheaper than anything a hardware store will do for a package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did that , they clipped off not only the X number of pounds of galvy wire I ordered , but some extra as well to guarantee I had gotten the quantity . There 's no market at all for short cuts of wire . Try fence supplies people also -- just anyone other than the ordinary sort of hardware store and their precut wire packages . Contrariwise , any price near $1CDN/lb of wire is a very good price , and even just sort of nearish will do , once you compare what you paid for 250 feet in what sounds just from that to be a package of wire from a hardware store . Not that it has n't its place if that 's all the wire you need , but you 're looking at thirtyish pounds of galvy , everything included . <p> There was actually only one place in town that sells this kind of wire . It 's at a Home Depot , and they sell the rolls in 50-ft sections . <p> Just going to point out one thing - I 'm in Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy on my soul ) , so I have not been able to find anything larger . The town " lumberyard " is the exact same place I get the 50ft rolls . <p> Also , the fencing supply , I used to work for them , and I remember their stock quite well ( They do n't have galvy , or any other wire in a usable gauge for me . ) <p> Everyone should have a summer of " Why Not " . It allows you to do new things . <p> Damn ! Do you have a welders ' -supplies place in/near your town ? There , you can get nongalvanized wire in myriad diameters . You 'd have to process the stuff a bit -- and a bit more for making riveted mail ( an anneal/normalization ; those differ a little and either would work ) . <p> Otherwise , looks like your one on-your-own recourse is online ordering . They bring the world right to your door now -- in cardboard boxes . You 'd be looking for one that weighs fifty pounds . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between store-buying and mailorder is inquiring if one of your two choices in town is willing to make a special order of something for you : in galvy , 14 , 15 , or 16 gauge , and quite a bit of it . You might have to do a bit of talking , but gee , just how would they object to selling some wire , eh ? ( And if they do , you can always politely ask them just why . The answer may be illuminating . ) <p> Wire price breaks usually get seen by retail customers around the 50-lb mark . <p> Do you reside , in the mundane and corporeal world , in Kamloops BC , as Ominous Valley would suggest ? <p> Wesco Industries Ltd sells wire rope , or cable . Cable can be unlaid . It is likely to be high-tensile stuff , pretty difficult to coil conventionally , but there are unconventional techniques that get that tough ole wire to cooperate ... we may speak of them ; let me know . <p> The best sort of cable to undo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather lean sort of cable comprising wires of around 16 gauge . Since there are a bunch of ways to arrange the strands of cable/wire rope , some research and inquiry is in order online , but it 's simpler if you can lay hands on the stuff in town -- something like seven-wire guy wire/cable is about the simplest . Undo a length of that and you 've got seven times that length of linear feet of wire . Does n't matter if it comes out wiggly ; coiling fixes that and tidily . 79010 @qwx279010 79009 @qwx279009

A rotational step ( RStep ? ) of 60 degrees for JPL6 results in this : <p> In my previous thread I tried to overcome the intersecting by rotating every 4th , 5th and 6th ring and by using a lateral offset . The first method did n't proof to be a good idea , the second method led to interesting new weaves . <p> With that in mind I started thinking about Joshua 's JPL6 . Not so much his weave , looks fine despite the inconsistent skip , but more his idea for a workaround of a double alternating lean , which is great . <p> To get a consistent spiral with a double alternating lean I figured I would need to split the spiral ( pictured above ) in half by seperating the even and uneven rings . Then for each rotational step I could rotate the even rings clockwise or counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four variants . To make it easier to understand I used steel for the uneven rings and bronze for the even rings . <p> Basically these spirals have a consistent alternating skip . Personally I think any workaround to make an even JPL breaks the JPL rules and should be named differently . So I will need to come up with a suitable name for these spirals . <p> It may take a while before I make these weaves because I still have to try the ones from the other thread . I do expect that each one of these four variants can be made . The method I used does n't work for JPL4 but it should work for higher even JPLs . <p> I 've come up with the name Twin Spiral 6 for them . Perhaps some code to differentiate the weaves . I could use a 3 digit code to indiciate RStep1/RStep2 , Up/Down and Flipped/Non-Flipped or find out the alternating ring skip pattern for each variant . <p> So much for 8 different variants .

@@26699549 @399549/ 79008 @qwx279008 <p> I have been looking into making Celtic Strap as my next project , but I am running into some confusion with the ring sizes . I am using Lorraine 's tutorial on Celtic Strap and the CGI tutorial on Celtic Visions to make the first basic units . <p> However , both tutorials show only using 2 ring sizes , while in the weave description for Celtic Strap , 3 ring sizes are listed ( 1/4 " 16ga , 5/32 " 18ga and 3/16 " 18ga rings ) which have ARs of 4.2 , 4.1 and 3.4 , respectively . I am unsure with AR 's to use for Celtic Strap . I have looked at other images in the forums or gallery that list many different AR combinations . Some applications are listing three rings sizes as being used , but I only am planning to use 2 as in the tutorial . <p> Long story short - I need some help with what ring sizes/ARs I should be using for Celtic Strap . I 'm looking to make it in the 18g size range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring sizes for Celtic Strap are a bit tricky . The wire diameter ( WD ) of the smaller rings needs to be a little smaller than the WD of the larger rings so that you can get them all in there . The small ring should just fit inside the large ring as well . My suggestion for rings fromTRL in stainless would be 18g 7/32 " and 19g 1/8 " . Those should work , but I have not tried them personally . I 'd love to see a picture when you are done ! <p> Thank you for the response ! I know rings from TRL can be different from others - so I pose another question <p> If I wanted to make it in aluminum to practice ( Bright Aluminium from TRL as well ) , would 18g 3/16 and 20g 5/32 work ? <p> Thanks again , I appreciate it . <p> I 'm sure those sizes wo n't work . You want the large ring to have an AR of around 4.8 . TRL 's 18g 3/16 " BA rings have an AR of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5/32 " BA have a outer diameter that is much too large to fit inside an 18g 3/16 " ring . <p> I still think , even with the BA , that you should use TRL 's 18g 7/32 " and 19g 1/8 " rings . <p> I purchased the ring sizes you suggested from TRL and I just received them : The sizes do not work . The smaller ring is a tad too small . When one smaller ring is closed in one of the first four sections , it makes it impossible to insert another in one in the other holes . The three 18g rings JUST fit in the small ring and there is no room for the bigger , outer rings to still stay in the center sandwiching the small middle ring . I hope this explanation makes sense . <p> I also hope that I am just doing it wrong and the ring sizes actually DO work . I am talking about the BA rings . If anyone can confirm the sizes it would be greatly appreciated . At least aluminum is cheap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very helpful to know if the rings are the actual size and AR that TRL says they are . It always makes me feel AWFUL when I suggest a size that does n't work . I make my own rings , and can only go by what the site says the rings dimensions actually are . 79010 @qwx279010 79009 @qwx279009 
@@26699556 @399556/ 79008 @qwx279008 <p> . . . when you consider the fact that many people , including a few who should know better , are wearing armor made out of 55-gallon barrels or worse ( carpet armor still exists .... ) <p> I may be spoiled from living in Southern California , but I have n't even seen an out-of-Kingdom picture of anybody taking the field in carpet in more years than I can recall . It 'd still absorb the thwacks of rattan sticks as well as ever , but the state of the art as enthusiastically promulgated at , say , The Armour Archive is quilted layers of fabric , not indoor-outdoor carpeting . It 'd be hotter to wear than the quilted stuff , for one thing . <p> For SCA Youth Boffer , the Society 's juvenile division , I do n't know . <p> Blue plastic barrel will be with the SCA a long time yet -- thick enough to do good , simple to work , and there 's no hammering to wake up the neighbors forming it as would be the case with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period-plausible as being something worn between the fall of Rome and the first two years of the 17th century . Elizabeth I of England died in early 1603 . <p> It is until such time as you spend a maximum of three or four dollars at a hardware store for 3 feet of steel rod stock . That 's lawn mowing money , I 'd point out . Costs even less going to a scrapyard and getting lucky , or having a steel store cut you off a few feet from one of their ten foot pieces in stock . ( Though that stuff will rust . You could spraypaint it . ) <p> Quote : <p> . . . as are the cutting methods at the moment . <p> Which will suit armor pieces and galvanized wire -- usin ' mail , not gawkin ' mail . But jewelry and Faire gewgaws in various chain , etc. are what sell for cash . <p> In the SCA game , mail shines especially in two places : about the neck as a camail hung from a helmet , most particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of armoring skirt that does n't impair the legs ' movements . These are both difficult to protect with plate coverage and to still allow full or full-enough motion . Eventually they developed the articulated plate gorget for the neck . The hips generally were n't as completely exposed and were partly covered with the steeled war saddle anyway when you were a-horse . But still , the hip sockets and pelvic girdle generally made do with something skirtlike and they hoped for the best . <p> I once saw a Japanese personna that made his armor entirely out of the stuff . It looked FANTASTIC--as in , guys who work with the stuff for a living had to get pretty close to notice it was plastic . A coat of laquer or two did the trick . If more people did that , we 'd be begging for it ! <p> My first armor .... well , it got me on the field . My home-made , pinch-cut , poorly constructed hauberk was an improvement of several orders of magnitude in every way imaginable , including ability to absorb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Teutonic Order 's arms ( a gift from my wife ) . Simple , elegant , hid the ugly , and made me look good on the field . <p> lorraine : <p> Quote : <p> I think there needs to be a middle ground between aesthetics and techniques . It 's important to develop good habits from the start . <p> Fair enough . No sense in developing bad habbits . That said , closing pinch-cut links properly is no more damaging to one 's closures than closing any other kind of link properly . It 's a bit different , but the fundamental concepts are the same . To demand new people use " proper " cutting techniques is something else entirely , though . Sure , close the links properly--but when you 're just starting out I 'm much more concerned about hooking you than making your first few pieces look museum-quality . <p> Quote : <p> And using the correct ring sizes needs to be emphasized . Byzantine looks <p> That 's a gray area , for me . Too much depends on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste of the mailler , the buyer , etc . Though they will inevitably learn minimal aspect ratios--I remember my first few attempts at Half Persian Sheet 6 ..... <p> Quote : <p> I think part of the problem is that many many people who first get into chainmaille jewelery making do n't know the various methods of cutting rings and do n't know how to educate their customers . <p> Agreed . However , there are two additional factors here : <p> 1 ) The first pieces one makes with a new technique are crap anyway . Does n't matter what you 're making , or what the technique is--the first few are throw-aways , or perhaps stuff you keep for yourself/give away as gifts . It 's part of the learning process . Pinch cuts are fast , easy , and good enough to rpactice new weaves with . Once mastery ( or at least competance ) is obtained , you can move on to other cuts if you choose . And once you 've been doing it a while , you have your favorite cut and probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking anymore , for example , regardless of whether it 's a new weave or not , but that 's because I 've been doinig this a while . <p> 2 ) Is the intent here to be a mailler , or a jeweler ? They are not mutually exclusive , but they 're different . A jeweler should know a number of techniques in addition to maille--including piercing , the process of using a jeweler 's saw ( though I forget if that 's the general term , or just when you use it on sheet metal ) . If one wishes to be a jeweler , learning how to make saw cuts is pretty much absolutely fundamental ; it was literally the first thing my professor taught me in that class . And cutting links is no different than cutting anything else , really . And if you 're going to be a business , diversification is pretty much critical ; you ca n't really make a living just doing maille . <p> Neither is an issue for the hobbiest . People like me are in this for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major concern for the professional--just making money is enough of a concern to override those issues ! But both are worth bearing in mind , I think . <p> Ivanova : <p> Quote : <p> Maybe I 'm a minority here , but I like score and break . <p> I do too . And except for a few rare folks who specifically look at the cutting method , I 've never had anyone comment on it . Simply put , outside of people like us who geek out over this stuff , no one cares . Score-and-break can , if done properly , give functionally perfectly smooth closures ( meaning you 'll never notice them , nor will they snag on anything , including silk ) . If you do it properly , there 's no need to break out the saw . Takes time to learn , but then , it takes time to learn how to use a jeweler 's saw , too ( those blades break constantly ) . <p> Paradox : <p> Quote : <p> But ... What is " score and break " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutters , creating a weak point . Then you snap the wire off at that point , by pulling from the other side such that the wire bends at that weak point . The trick is to go far enough into the wire so that it snaps off at that point , but no so far that you cut it . In actuallity , cutting wire with wire cutters pushes the material apart until it breaks ; score-and-break simply controls the process , and minimizes " smooshing " ( ie , pushing material to the sides , creating a flat part of the link ) . Those flat parts are what cause the scratching our resident Spartan mentioned . <p> Again , do n't think of it as cutting ; think of it as denting the wire , then torquing that dent in such a way that the wire breaks right there . <p> There 's some fun overlaps with geology here--what 's actually happening is that you 're creating defects in the crystal latice , and applying stress in such a way as to control the motion fo those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces ( which is what a break is , essentially ) . You can reverse this process at pretty much any point prior to breakage by heating the metal up to a certain point , then quenching it , thus creating new crystals without those specific latice defects . The exact same thing happens with rocks undergoing various types of metamorphesis . But that 's a completely different topic . <p> Also , you 're not as limited as you think . Look around your home--I 'm sure you have a variety of pens lying around , offering a range of sizes . Those make pretty good mandrels . Takes some trial and error , and a few broken pens , but you can get a good feel for what size rings you need for different weaves by experimenting with those . Nails can work too , if you file down the pointy ends ( Home Depot sells some really big ones for pretty cheap ) . DO NOT use bolts , or anything threaded--you will destroy your wrist taking the wire off those things . Trust me on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Goto page Previous1 , 2All times are GMT .

Now , the uninitiated in my life who CONSISTENTLY force me to call it chain maille are not here , so I can begin with my questions . <p> The mandrel I am using for creating my own rings ( I cut them with the thinnest dremel cutting discs I have . Flat join is so nice ) is 1/4 " , and , being the gimboid that I am , I was buying wire for my jig that I built , and looking at 16ga , thought it looked a little ... flimsy , so I went and bought 50ft of 14ga galv. steel wire . <p> Is it still possible to have a decent looking maille shirt with 14ga rings that are 1/4 " I 'd ? And while I do know that 3/8 " is usually the size for 14ga , according to what I 've looked up , is it still okay to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will post pictures of my progress as I go ( Sticking with 14ga for now ) , due to the fact that I am currently short a computer , and borrowing one from someone else so I can use this site . <p> Everyone should have a summer of " Why Not " . It allows you to do new things . <p> yes , 14swg is a good wire size for a shirt . keep in mind that 14swg galvanized will be very heavy to wear . <p> a word of caution . i do n't recommend cutting galvanized with a dremel cut off blade . the fumes that heated galvanized produce are very toxic . if you must use a dremel , make sure you have a fan blowing for ventilation . a more ideal set up would include oil or other lubrication applied directly to the cut point . <p> I am aware about the danger of the fumes generated from cutting , and part of the reason I 'm glad I have a backyard table I can cut them on . Safety glasses and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off of spray paint fumes , I made sure to have a chemical filter respirator ) . <p> Thanks for the link , though . I 'm passing it on to some other people I know who are interested in making maille . <p> ( Wide backyard space . I do n't cut things inside for health reasons , a.k.a . I live with a bunch of other people , and the ventilation system is weird . ) <p> I 'm always looking to figure out ways to upgrade , so thanks for the advice on the lubrication . Unfortunately , I can only get 8 rings max out of a coil when I am cutting with my thin cut-off disc before it explodes on me ( The disc , not the wire ) . I 'm adding your advice with the lubrication to my list of needed upgrades . At some point , I hope to make my jig an all-in-one ring production center . <p> Everyone should have a summer of " Why Not " . It allows you to do new things . <p> The fumes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , nor Methyl Ethyl Ketone ( bad enough ) -- but they are noxious . Google up " metal fume fever " " foundry flu " and " Anvilfire Paw Paw Wilson " ( deceased ) for a clear picture of what kind of trouble you *could* get into . At low levels , it 's not much . At really high levels , it 's not good . <p> Filings or dust really are not a problem . A paper dust/etc. mask is close to overkill for keeping your breathing-parts untroubled in the face of powdered zinc and iron with a touch of carbon in it . ( " For what , we ask , is steel without a touch of carbon in it -- ? " ( /Gilbert &amp; Sullivan ) ) <p> ************** <p> For a mailshirt in either 16ga or 14ga , I accept boltcutter cuts for speed of cutting -- up to 1 cut stroke per second -- and durability of cutter : no consumption of cutting tool . Then I butt such links facet to facet rather than straight on point to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of round , acceptable in an armor project ( even mailshirts of riveted links are so ) , but still a tight , fairly smooth closure . <p> Dremel grind cutting is better suited for projects smaller than a shirt of approximately 25k rings or more . You 've noticed it consumes hours as well as cutting discs . Cutters are comparatively swift as hand tools go . There is coiling/cutting machinery , which some professional sellers like Knuut , occasional poster here , use to fill orders . There is such a thing as saw cutting , both pro and amateur . <p> 5/16 " link I 'd gives substantially more room to work with in 14ga , and is about as small a link diameter as I would go with in that wire . 3/8 " , while quite convenient with this wire and more open , is just convenient , not sacred or anything . And lighter . In butted-link mail that 's no small consideration , particularly if you 're actually going to use your shirt for anything more active than a doorstop ( dismal prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) wire , .063 " wire diameter , really starts to come into its own about at 1/4 " link I 'd . It has a link Aspect Ratio ( q.v . by searching this site ) of 4 , which is about ideal for **28;104;TOOLONG , all in all . It suits this slenderer wire well , and I recommend it . In a 5/16 " I 'd , such wire does a better job if you go to the trouble of riveting it , for fifteen times the strength . 18ga soft wire is about the ultimate feedstock for riveted-mail projects : light-ish , at 5/8 the weight of the same size links in 14ga , fifteen times as strong , and infinitely greater in bragging rights and for lectures about ancient war technologies . Which fascinate some people . <p> Back when mail was a commonplace instrument of war , they also never made headdresses nor other jewelry of it : mail was like a parkerized semiauto pistol , a tool of war , plain and simple , nothing but . <p> For riveted stuff , 16ga is doable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , special use mail , such as on very exposed or very vital spots . In armored sword fighting , this often means the neck . 16ga would be entirely right for a 14th-c. mail camail , hung off a 14th-c. bascinet helmet to protect all the neck and drape on the shoulders . It is a modestly sized mail project too , coming to about 5k links . The riveted shirt to go with , you might prefer to use 18ga wire for that . Or if possible , avoid the mailshirt altogether , as some swordplay groups can -- the SCA . To a lesser degree , the HEMA schools . <p> I 'm aware of metal fume fever , foundry flu , the various names for something that I would rather not have under any circumstances ( Stuff like that can lay me out for weeks - it 's bad when I get sick ) . <p> First off , MASSIVE info dump . I appreciate it , but WOW , that 's a lot of info . <p> I 'm aware of the problem I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That I cut myself - Hit 1ft after 6 hours of off/on work . Mostly connecting it on work lunch breaks ) in regards to the density and weight . The weight 's not the problem . Because I go up against people with some fairly skookum weapons in the Amtgard group I am a part of , this was more to try and stave off getting hit directly with a buddy 's weapon , a great he affectionately calls " Tombstone . " <p> While , yes , 16ga would have been the BRIGHT idea for me to start out with , and , yes , I 'm aware of the different maille creation types ( Riveted would be cool if I had the better materials , or the time to dedicate to it ) . I 've got 250ft of 14ga Galv . Steel wire , and I started with 1/4 . <p> Considering how I end up " butting " the rings , they close REALLY nicely . My cut is not fully straight , but slightly to an angle , something which I 've now seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When I get a decent-sized piece , I 'll post a picture so you can see Gimboid 's First Maille . <p> ( As a note , I MAKE all of my own rings . It 's cheaper and far less time-consuming than the wait for a package to be shipped to Western Canada , where I live . The cutting discs that I use are cheap enough that I can set aside my good cutters for other projects and when I 'm pulling coils off of my mandrel . ) <p> Also , Konstantin , I 've seen a fair amount of your posts in this site , and a lot of them I go back and use as reference information . <p> Everyone should have a summer of " Why Not " . It allows you to do new things . <p> I 've , like , only ever worked in galvy myself , what with the armor-nerd thing through the SCA , with which you may be somewhat familiar . Minus any Magic Missile water balloons -- or was that Dagorhir ? -- and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite like Amtgard in many ways . SCA polearms ( halberds , bills , blade-on-a-stick ) mostly get their warheads shaped from stiff foam , like the stuff they pack electronics in for shipping in their cartons . Resilient safety thrusting heads are a feature . <p> So the mail 's kind of simply a part of an overall hobby , a means to its ends . Riveted mail of skinny wire is slowly becoming more common in the SCA , and the steel groups like HACA , HEMA , and ARMA preferred to start out with riveted mail , often gotten of Indian make , where it is the primary industry of one small village . <p> 250 feet of 14ga wire is , well , not that heavy an expense ; it can always be reserved for larger-link ( ca. 3/8 " I 'd ) projects later . For more bang for your Canada buck , see what 's available from the town lumberyard -- anywhere they might sell galvanized wire by the pound , because that is cheaper than anything a hardware store will do for a package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did that , they clipped off not only the X number of pounds of galvy wire I ordered , but some extra as well to guarantee I had gotten the quantity . There 's no market at all for short cuts of wire . Try fence supplies people also -- just anyone other than the ordinary sort of hardware store and their precut wire packages . Contrariwise , any price near $1CDN/lb of wire is a very good price , and even just sort of nearish will do , once you compare what you paid for 250 feet in what sounds just from that to be a package of wire from a hardware store . Not that it has n't its place if that 's all the wire you need , but you 're looking at thirtyish pounds of galvy , everything included . <p> There was actually only one place in town that sells this kind of wire . It 's at a Home Depot , and they sell the rolls in 50-ft sections . <p> Just going to point out one thing - I 'm in Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy on my soul ) , so I have not been able to find anything larger . The town " lumberyard " is the exact same place I get the 50ft rolls . <p> Also , the fencing supply , I used to work for them , and I remember their stock quite well ( They do n't have galvy , or any other wire in a usable gauge for me . ) <p> Everyone should have a summer of " Why Not " . It allows you to do new things . <p> Damn ! Do you have a welders ' -supplies place in/near your town ? There , you can get nongalvanized wire in myriad diameters . You 'd have to process the stuff a bit -- and a bit more for making riveted mail ( an anneal/normalization ; those differ a little and either would work ) . <p> Otherwise , looks like your one on-your-own recourse is online ordering . They bring the world right to your door now -- in cardboard boxes . You 'd be looking for one that weighs fifty pounds . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between store-buying and mailorder is inquiring if one of your two choices in town is willing to make a special order of something for you : in galvy , 14 , 15 , or 16 gauge , and quite a bit of it . You might have to do a bit of talking , but gee , just how would they object to selling some wire , eh ? ( And if they do , you can always politely ask them just why . The answer may be illuminating . ) <p> Wire price breaks usually get seen by retail customers around the 50-lb mark . <p> Do you reside , in the mundane and corporeal world , in Kamloops BC , as Ominous Valley would suggest ? <p> Wesco Industries Ltd sells wire rope , or cable . Cable can be unlaid . It is likely to be high-tensile stuff , pretty difficult to coil conventionally , but there are unconventional techniques that get that tough ole wire to cooperate ... we may speak of them ; let me know . <p> The best sort of cable to undo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather lean sort of cable comprising wires of around 16 gauge . Since there are a bunch of ways to arrange the strands of cable/wire rope , some research and inquiry is in order online , but it 's simpler if you can lay hands on the stuff in town -- something like seven-wire guy wire/cable is about the simplest . Undo a length of that and you 've got seven times that length of linear feet of wire . Does n't matter if it comes out wiggly ; coiling fixes that and tidily . 79010 @qwx279010 79009 @qwx279009 
@@26699578 @399578/ 79008 @qwx279008 <p> Hi , my name is Spam and I am new to this . I got interested many years back when I wore a full maille suit in Germany and then found out about jewellery items when I went to a knife meeting in Sheffield where a guy had made maille from stainless rings he had cut by hand . It has took me a few years to then start off myself and I recently made a byzantine bracelet as my initial project in copper which is starting to develop a nice patina . <p> My background ; I come from a military background and ater 14 years decided to quit and move back to UK with my family , trained as a gas engineer and have struggled ever since ! After splitting with the ex , I got into conservation work , but am now getting back into the gas industry and with the next 7 weeks travelling between Sheffield and Leeds via train , I am hoping to fill my time working on maille . I already have a few people wanting some stuff making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn some nice new weaves as I know about three so far ! <p> Anyway , cheers for having me on board and thanks to Alex for notifying me tat registrations were back on the go . I hope that is the last of your spambot woes , I know hw much of a pain they can be . <p> Cheers ! A landmark post too , it takes a bit of time to get to 1500 ! Just getting my eyes uncrossed , as I am working on another bracelet ! I need to seach the forums for things such as what people think to be decent pricing and such like , I do n't want to rip folk off but I do n't want to sell myself short although I know I 'll never get rich from bending metal rings ! It is very addictive though , I hope to be able to create some interesing stuff as time goes by . 79010 @qwx279010 79009 @qwx279009
