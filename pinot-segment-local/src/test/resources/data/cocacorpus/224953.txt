This approach is organized around the narrative metaphor- the notion that how we talk about ourselves and our conflicts shape how we perceive and react to these conflicts - and is permised on the idea that language plays a central role in constructing who we are or how we engage or behave with others . Interest-based approaches assist people to resolve disputes by focusing on needs , yet their perception of their conflict may remain intact . They may miss the opportuinity to explore the influence that dominant and highly influential cultural narratives have on their conflict . Narrative approaches to conflicts resolution invite participants to uncover and build upon alternative views of the conflict that may foster increased and authentic empathy and rapport between the disputants .

Establishing and Transferring of Command <p> The first , trained or most qualified responder from the ESS team who arrives on site establishes initial command until they are relieved or command is transferred . The reception centre ( RC ) or group lodging ( GL ) should have a list of pre-identified individuals available to fill the role of RC or GL Manager .

Incident Action Planning <p> The incident action plan ( IAP ) is an oral or written plan that communicates the overall incident objectives for a specific period of time known as an operational period . <h> Operational Period <p> An operational period is the length of time set by Management to achieve a given set of objectives .

In a smaller incident , it is not unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is common to have twelve-hour operational periods for many larger incidents , however they should be no longer than 24 hours . <h> 6 . Comprehensive Resource Management <p> Resources are defined as equipment , supplies , personnel , teams , or facilities available for assignment in support of the response . Comprehensive resource management includes consistent processes for categorizing , ordering , dispatching , tracking , recovering , and demobilizing resources . <h> 7 . Unity and Chain of Command <p> Chain of command refers to the orderly line of authority within the ranks of the organization , with lower levels subordinate and connected to higher levels . Unity of command ensures that each person in the organization reports to and takes direction from only one supervisor . <h> 8 . Manageable Span of Control <p> Span of control is the number of personnel that one supervisor manages , usually expressed in a ratio of supervisor to subordinates .

@@99529778 @3729778/ <h> Activity 3 : Identifying Resilience Strategies <p> Strategies determine ways of reaching your goals . They are actions that get you to your goals . To begin , you should prioritize which areas of resilience you want to address . Some areas of resilience will be related to reducing disaster risk , such as those suggested by the Hazard Resilience Index ( HRI ) and some dimensions in the Disaster Management category of the Aboriginal Resilience Index ( ARI ) . Other areas of resilience , such as those suggested by the Community Resource category of the ARI , will be related in more subtle but equally important ways . For example , increasing community members ' participation in community events can be critical in recovering from disaster . Increasing their trust of local government can help with their willingness and ability to follow directions during a disaster . <p> The Aboriginal Resilience and Strategies ( ARS ) report and the Hazards , Risk , Resilience and Strategies ( HRS ) report will provide you with a list of strategies to address each of the dimensions or hazards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buttons below to create the Strategy Reports . <h> Create Report <p> Once you have created your Hazards , Risk , Resilience and Strategies Report and your Aboriginal Resilience and Strategies Report , - you will have the option to create a Hazard Resilience Strategy Action Plan and Aboriginal Resilience Strategy Action Plan by targeting specific strategies that will enhance disaster resilience in your community . <p> Are resources ( time , money , people ) available to address this area of resilience ? <p> Is addressing this area of resilience is in keeping with our community vision and goals ? <p> There is an opportunity to get creative in thinking about resilience strategies. - One approach is to simply look at your resilience profile to see what should be priority areas to work on. - However , sometimes you can see links between two or more characteristics of resilience .

Finally , the strategies should address both short and longer term goals <p> To start , review your Integrated Disaster Resilience Profile Template and those resilience characteristics you have marked as important ( e.g. , starred ) in the ARI and the HRI reports .

Mastering dispute resolution skills requires the ability to use skills and processes contextually - to adapt them as needed to different circumstances . Underlying any process of dispute resolution are assumptions about how human beings understand conflict , why they get involved in disputes , the types of behaviours and communication styles humans engage in and the meanings of resolution . Understanding these assumptions enables learners to assess when adaptations may be needed to meet particular circumstances , and what the disparate effects of particular processes might be on particular disputants . Course topics include : what is theory ; theories of conflict ; culture and conflict , worldview and dispute resolution ; and meanings of resolution . On-line course methodology includes a series of readings , exercises , and group discussions ( there are no mandatory synchronous components ) .

Many Aboriginal communities do not have disaster plans and may worry that this section is therefore not relevant to them , but many of the characteristics ( check boxes ) in this section have to do with things that do n't rely on formal disaster planning .

These things include increasing awareness through education and public safety campaigns , ensuring that common safety precautions ( e.g. , smoke detectors ) are in place , knowing who has special skills and equipment that might be helpful in an emergency or disaster , and knowing what to do and when should an emergency or disaster occur .
