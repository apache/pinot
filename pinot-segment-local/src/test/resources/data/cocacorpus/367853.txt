Of 95 providers interviewed who are employing sepsis solutions , 69 percent reported improved outcomes with up to a 50 percent drop in mortality , while 23 percent said it was too early in deployment of the technology to have reportable results . Providers also reported improved outcomes in terms of reduced treatment costs , length of stay and readmissions . <p> " Up to half of hospital deaths are due to sepsis , according to research published in The Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) , " notes KLAS analyst Kody Hansen , who co-authored the report with KLAS analyst Jon Christensen . " While this is an initial report , KLAS is committed to ongoing research on sepsis solutions as we seek to help vendors and providers work together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> According to the report : <p> Adoption of Cerners and Epics sepsis technology is higher than all other sepsis solutions combined , with customers of both reporting improved outcomes , including mortality reductions . " We have been using ( the Cerner sepsis ) product for seven months with excellent results " , said an IT Director quoted in the report . " The protocols and criteria are very inclusive and thorough . Reducing septic shock and sepsis is very beneficial to us and our patients . The solution has reduced length-of-stay numbers , mortality , and readmissions . " While Cerners sepsis solution is easily deployed , Epic users report the need for significant in-house effort for implementation and integration into workflows . Use of sepsis solutions by other EMR vendors lags , though MEDITECH recently developed a solution for sepsis . <p> Because most EMR vendors lack easily deployed sepsis solutions , some providers are looking to other sources . Infection control and surveillance vendors such as Wolters Kluwer and VigiLanz are perceived as most focused . " ( The Wolters Kluwer ) POC Advisor pulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these rules and then shoots alerts to mobile devices , " observed one CMIO . " We are giving needed information to providers at the point of care no matter where they are .

" Health Catalyst and LogicStream Health leverage their analytics to provide retrospective views of clinical effectiveness and spur effective end-user change management . <p> KLAS interviewed 102 providers who have not adopted sepsis solutions , finding that 53 percent are considering an EMR module or in-house development using the EMR platform , 19 percent are considering a third-party solution , and 28 percent are not considering solutions .

@@101582509 @5782509/ <h> The Little Engine That Could " My Journey to KLAS <p> 28 Apr 17 by Bob Cash 0 views <p> Many are familiar with the story The Little Engine That Could . For those unfamiliar , the story tells of a stranded train attempting to get toys to the children on the other side of the mountain . Several train engines passing by refuse to help , with various excuses for their lack of sympathy . Finally , a little blue engine offers humble assistance , exclaiming " I think I can ! " again and again until the obstacle ( the mountain ) is overcome and the toys are delivered to the mountain village children . <p> Working in healthcare for over 30 years at various large healthcare organizations , I often found myself enjoying most those times that I worked in the smaller , perhaps more personal sections of these organizations . Most notable were the smaller hospitals , where teams could work together in a personal way with a focus that was simpler and cleareran attitude of " let 's simply take care of and focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are our neighbors , our family , and our friends . " For a short while , I led Alta View Hospital , a small hospital that was literally across the street from my familys home . Two of our children were born in that hospital , and many of our neighbors and friends had surgeries , hospitalizations , medical tests , and doctor visits on the campus . <p> Over time and through growth opportunities , my career moved from small hospital to large , from personal and familial work relationships to more impersonal and bureaucratic . Certainly , less intimacy is not absolute in a larger organization ; there are always smaller work groups where strong , personal relationships can be forged , but the nature of the business becomes naturally less personal as the complexity of the organization grows . <p> Around 2007 , I first learned of KLAS , a local Utah company that I knew did some form of healthcare research with a focus on healthcare information technology . My introduction to KLAS was through a close associate who regularly extolled the virtues of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company as it touched the life of this associate . The companys business model and actual work remained a bit of a mystery to me , but the good vibes from afar were real . <p> Upon reaching a point in my career where I wanted to and could make a change , I determined to find an opportunity where my contributions were less obscured by the sheer mass of people and work involved in running a large organization . Should I consider teaching , consulting , or opening my own business ? In the midst of these musings , my associate friend suggested I take a look at KLAS . The good vibes drove me to explore KLAS , and a real opportunity emerged . <p> What I did not know and could not know without experiencing it is that KLAS is the little engine that could . From its early beginnings , KLAS has had its share of serious doubters . One friend of our founder , Kent Gale , shared his thoughts on the potential of the KLAS concept , stating , " While I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marketplace , I think there are too many barriers to ensuring fair and accurate comparisons , " adding to the handwritten note , " Good luck nonetheless ! " Nearly 20 years later , we chuckle a bit at this kind but misguided perception of potential . <p> Kent and his colleagues determinedly stated ( in their minds if not out loud ) , " I think I can , I think I can . " Now , thinking back , they can proudly say " I thought I could , I thought I could . " I , for one , know that KLAS , with its nearly 150 employees , has indeed climbed the mountain and is " delivering the goods : " accurate , honest , and impartial insights regarding vendor performance and ways for providers to succeed and vendors to improve . The influence of KLAS candid evaluations , representing interviews with thousands of end users , is now international in scope and influence . The company remains relatively small , but its influence is significant . I am more than happy to be on the train !

Luckily , at KLAS one of our favorite things to do is watch solid research bust the myths we thought were true . Today , I 'd love to take a dive into some of the red herrings of EMR satisfaction and shine some light from our data on what 's really going on . <p> What Are the Red Herrings ? <p> One of the most common hypotheses that KLAS hears on the phone is that it is " the older physicians who will never be happy with anything . " <p> Myth busted . The data actually seems to indicate that dissatisfaction levels remain fairly constant when we segment practitioners out by age group : <p> Another big misconception surrounding EMR satisfaction sits with the providers who often feel as though the grass is greener on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim , " If we could just afford to move to such-and-such vendor , then our end-user adoption and satisfaction problems would evaporate . " <p> The truth ? It is increasingly clear that a provider organization can be unsuccessful on any EMR . At the same time , KLAS is starting to learn some crucial differences that point to a greater likelihood that , yes , some EMR solutions are better designed . While an EMR change could help , it will not make up for a poor implementation or user culture . In many ways EMR satisfaction has less to do with the grass being greener on the other side and more to do with learning how to correctly landscape your side , so to speak . <p> So , what does make the difference ? The consistently statistically significant drivers of EMR satisfaction together tell a compelling story of the dangers of treating an EMR like a one-size-fits-all tool . Clinician background ( **26;0;TOOLONG ) , clinical specialty , and the users level of personalization are all significant predictors of EMR satisfaction . These factors point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caregiver positions , by specialties , and even among different clinicians of the same specialty and positionstemming from differences in clinical training and background . When a one-size-fits-all EMR solution forces clinicians into common workflows , clinicians often feel unsure and inefficient , fighting with the EMR to still work in their customized way . <p> While a level of variation in clinical care is clearly an enemy to the field of medicine , other variation is positive and neededsuch as the differences in workflows between an obstetrician and an ENT . <p> Supporting positive variation in medicine is the responsibility of all EMR stakeholders . EMR vendors must produce functionality that is personalizable to the needs of different caregivers . IT organizations must find a way to train different users on how to personalize and utilize the EMR according to their needs . Users also need to be patient and diligent in understanding that part of their responsibility is making the EMR work for their specific needs . <p> Our EMR Improvement Collaborative is still a fairly new initiative for KLAS , but already the insights were uncovering have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet , the whole point of calling this a collaborative is that we intend to collaborate !

Among the many impressive speakers , one that stood out to me was Todd Dunn , the Director of Innovation for Intermountain Healthcare Transformation Lab . <p> Befitting his title , Todd dove into the subject of innovation . Of his many insights , the metaphor that stuck out to me was the idea of " cube brilliance . " The idea being that , when were operating within only our own perspective , solutions oftentimes seem blindingly simple . Its easy in fact to be brilliant in our own sphere of influence . The tricky part of innovation , it seems , is exporting that brilliance into the context of those for whom we innovate . <p> Context is king when trying to innovate , according to Todd . Upon reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How often have we heard the marketing byline , " designed by doctors , for doctors " ? The inherit promise being that this solution will be intuitive and hassle-free because its creators understand the environment it will live in . <p> Todd quoted Leonardo Da Vinci saying , " the eye , the window of the soul , is the chief means whereby the understanding can most fully and abundantly appreciate the infinite works of Nature ; and the ear is second . " In essence , we cant expect vendors to truly innovate great healthcare IT solutions , unless they 're somehow able to see , hear and truly digest the context of their customers . <p> He also jokingly referred to " the love metric . " No , its not a measurement of Aphrodites productivity , but rather it seeks to measure , " What would the user LOVE for your innovation to do ? " A question that can not be effectively answered without getting to know the details of your customer and the problems they need solved . <p> Yet , placing vendors into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loading them onto a plane for a global tour , getting these international companies to digest the complex world that providers live in seems like an impossibility . Thankfully , where one speaker at UHIMSS posed a conundrum , another provided the answer . <p> Bob Cash , who leads our provider relations efforts , sat on one of the discussion panels at UHIMSS , he also took a few minutes to speak on a few of the different efforts that KLAS has been working on as of late . While KLAS cant act as the private jet for vendors , dragging them to and fro in an endless whirlwind of customer visits , what we can do is amplify the providers voice . For many years this has been , and will continue to be our focus : Delivering the needs of providers to the industry in a way that helps vendors become better . <p> Yet , as KLAS has followed Todds recommendations and put ourselves further into the context of those we serve , we 've become better able to innovate for them . As Bob explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Improvement Collaborative . As we 've spoken with providers following the wave of Meaningful Use EMR adoption , what we 've discovered is that for many their end users do n't  very much like the systems that were just so laboriously installed . <p> If we were to put the question of a " love metric " to these physicians , many would respond that theyd love for their EMR to make their job easier . Unfortunately , in some cases it can feel like the opposite . Bob was able to highlight some of these concerns , and explain the early data that KLAS has gathered from the EMR Improvement Collaborative . <p> Our hope is that we can tear down the " cube brilliance " of various provider organizations and help them to share their best practices with their peers .

" The world was moving from mainframes to client server based systems and the future of hands on electronic tools was unmapped . If someone could just tell the industry the truth about vendor performance , providers could make a better decision . The challenge laid before KLAS was clear . <p> KLAS first vendor comparison report published in 1999 was received excitedly by providers . How did KLAS get to that point ? It began at the San Diego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend to save money while I did my research on how to really help Provider organizations better understand their software vendor options . Twenty-four years marketing software to provider executives across the country gave me a large , fertile field of industry friends to start the ball rolling and guide KLAS . " Hurry up and measure the vendors . We need to know our options as soon as possible , " was the challenge voiced by CIOs and CFOs faced with pressure to pick a new EMR . <p> I was personally excited to see how each vendor rated to compare with my own projections as to how the first comparison would turn out . ( My projections proved to be off significantly ) . So , we published our first comparison report , " Performance Report Top 20 " in the spring of 1999 . That report was reminiscent of how sports teams were compared .

I would say it was standing room only , but in truth many people sat on the floor along the walls to hear how the vendors perform . <p> It did n't  take long for provider organizations to ask for KLAS to expand the products and services measured to include the broad range of software , expensive medical equipment and consulting services .

No farmer would be happy with watering only one-third of each row and certainly not less than ten percent . <p> Vendors can not be satisfied with simply providing the water to the head of the row or with sending a trickle halfway down the water row .

KLAS has more of a kitchen-table story , but I 'm still grateful to have been a part of it . <p> The idea for KLAS began in 1996 . Three of the four founders worked at Sunquest , which was preparing to go public at that time . As preparations progressed , proposals were made to deflate Sunquests industry-leading support infrastructure into a mid-tier model . The resulting cut to expenses would supposedly ensure that the IPO would be a beautiful launch . Having sold lab systems to many of Sunquests customers , Kent Gale , Leonard Black , and Scott Holbrook were frustrated at the impact this plan would have on their provider friends to whom theyd promised top-tier support . <p> The three men sat down on the steps of the city hall building in Tucson , contemplating why there was no transparent measurement of the industry they worked in .

By playing with the first letters of the founders names , Kent landed on " KLAS " ( Kent , Leonard , Adam , Scott ) . The title inspired a great marketing tagline : " Come to KLAS to be educated on vendor performance . " It also served well for recognizing great companies with " Best in KLAS " awards . <p> The name " KLAS " stuck , and it now represents the four men who either triggered the idea of the company or jumped in to make it a reality . <p> The first evaluation on a vendor was 180 questions long and was completed by Bob Blades , then the CIO at Loma Linda University Medical Center , in April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his responses was , " This is boring . " <p> Weve taken Bobs advice to heart and worked our way down to a concise , 20-question evaluation . <p> Bobs survey was the first of hundreds of thousands to come from KLAS provider partners around the world over 20 years . Once we at KLAS understood the amount of work that would be required to not only gather research , but to gather enough research to track trends in the industry , we committed to making it happen . <p> I recall collating the initial reports and binding them together by hand around our kitchen table in our Tucson home ( pictured above ) . In 1998 , we moved to the spare room of a two-bedroom college apartment in Provo , Utah . From there we moved to the basement of my first home , and finally into the now-vacated WordPerfect buildings . <p> KLAS stands as the realization of the idea that honest , accurate , and impartial data on vendor performance can change healthcare for the better .

We live in a world where your thermostat , your garage door , and even your fridge can all share data with your phone . From a patients perspective , its hard not to look at the sharing of medical records and ask , " What gives ?

KLAS today released the Interoperability 2016 report , which sheds some light on the unique hurdles faced by those in pursuit of HIT interoperability . <p> Many clinicians with little or no access to outside data feel that just accessing records is all they need .

It seeks to measure and report on one of the biggest and arguably most difficult trends in healthcare today . <p> This chart breaks down interoperability into 4 levels to show just how infrequently impactful interoperability happens in the United States . Out of all respondents , just 28% reach data access . Only 13% have the ability to easily locate vital data once accessed . <p> Furthermore , only 8% of that group get the data into a clinical view .

" And the selection of the next American Idol commences . For provider organizations , connecting to outside EMRs is a part of their everyday life , and the October Interoperability 2015 study gave them a chance to vote on the easiest and most difficult vendors to connect with when sharing outside patient data . Interoperability would be more amusing if it were a talent contest with little impact on patient care . However , putting the right information in clinicians hands in the best format and at the most appropriate time to help diagnose and care for patients is serious business .

Allscripts ended up slightly on the positive side of the ledger , while GE , Greenway , McKesson , MEDITECH , and NextGen Healthcare fell on the negative side . The exception was eClinicalWorks . Providers reported eClinicalWorks to be the most challenging vendor to exchange patient records with , as highlighted in this provider comment : " eClinicalWorks needs to make some real progress now .

I learned two things that day : first , becoming James Bond is n't a solid career path , and second , always check for fine print . <p> In adulthood , that second lesson has proven invaluable . " Terms and conditions may apply " accompanies every contest , sweepstakes , and advertisement these days . Even the radio is n't safe from the verbal equivalent of fine print as every commercial closes out with fast-spoken legalese . <p> KLAS is what you might call a large-print company in a fine-print world . As we seek to drive transparency in healthcare IT , we often act as the magnifying glass for the industrys " see dealer for details " problems . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nitty-gritty details of how we gather the very research that promotes this transparency . <p> In a perfect world , several things would occur as KLAS conducted research : <p> Wed have access to a full list of every organization and respondent who could or should give feedback . <p> We 'd obtain a 100% response rate from our randomly selected sample . <p> All participants would be honest , and their feedback would be accurately captured . <p> While we do n't  live in a perfect world , KLAS does take many steps to make sure our methodology runs as close to the ideal as possible . <p> Defining the Population <p> Right now , KLAS is actively tracking data for over 900 solutions in our database , which is updated daily . Given the immensity of the project , making sure that we have a solid sampling base for each product ( one large enough to obtain a random sample ) can be tricky . <p> Typically , our first solution is to work with the vendors themselves . We encourage them to share their full site lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists we receive are indeed complete . When we do n't  have a complete site-list , our team of researchers spends time digging through user groups , seeking referrals , and reading press releases ( among other methods ) to uncover as complete a list as possible . KLAS often finds , during our 30,000 proactive provider interviews each year , customers using nearly every solution imaginable . <p> In all our interactions , we consider the relationships we build with providers as paramount . The strong relationships we form allow us to ask more than simple scoring questions . Instead , we 're able to drill-down into what providers are doing that 's new , what other products they 're using and what trends they 're seeing firsthand in the industry . This goes a long way toward helping us succeed , even when we 're not able to work from a vendor 's site list . <p> Taking a Random Sample <p> One of the biggest obstacles in obtaining a truly random sample is the fact that KLAS can not control for a nonresponse bias when providers choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against those who , for whatever reason , can not engage with KLAS , and we still invite them to come and find insights from our data . <p> However , we do still need to overcome this bias as best we can . Our solution has been to try to build and strengthen relationships with the providers we meet . The better the relationship building of KLAS , the more likely that providers will become participants . It just so happens that we love working with the best and brightest in healthcare from across the world , so we call it a win-win . <p> It also helps that the senior leadership people KLAS interacts with often give feedback on a broad spectrum of solutions , helping to eliminate the nonresponse bias . <p> Conveying Accurate and Impartial Results <p> Of course , all of these measures amount to nothing if were ineffective at delivering these hard-gathered insights to the people who need them most . <p> I had a conversation just the other day with a provider in the middle of an EMR buying decision for her small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our reports to guide her decision .

For me , its sufficient to say that if KLAS had any " fine print , " it would say something to the effect of , " KLAS has no opinion . Only the data speaks .

Having spent the last 20 years delicately balanced between providers and vendors , we understand how to bring disparate parties together . But the EMR Improvement Collaborative is more than just gathering feedback from end users for internal purposes .

In order to do this , we need to measure our progress and learn when anyone progresses forward . <p> Here is how it works : <p> KLAS has worked with many healthcare organizations to build a common end-user satisfaction questionnaire . While every organization needs to tweak this questionnaire to fit their needs , the same common question set is sent out to users at many organizations . <p> The questionnaire is designed to provide insight on issues such as the amount/timing of training , individual efforts to optimize/personalize the EMR , the order-entry process , satisfaction with the EMR , desired changes , etc . <p> KLAS hosts this questionnaire so that findings can be benchmarked across organizations .

Among additional events , webinars on successful organizations best practices and an annual conference will provide further opportunities for open collaboration and learning to help solve problems surrounding the EMRusability , satisfaction , perception , productivity , efficiency , implementation , training , etc . <p> Today , 10 organizations have sent the questionnaire to their end users , with a return of over 3,500 questionnaires .

When Ireland carried out market testing of the EHR market back in 2015 the relationship analogy surfaced for the first time . <p> The market testing team felt the range of relationship choices from different vendors and how they wanted to be in a relationship with Ireland spanned everything from A shot gun wedding to a free and open relationship . <p> The idea of tying the countrys entire health system to a single supplier felt almost a little Fifty Shades of Grey. Particularly from a couple of the larger vendors who were keen to see Ireland adopt a single system country-wide : a relationship they certainly would dominate ! <p> The trajectory to deploy a new digital health solution could well be an analogy for proposing and getting engaged , you know where you want to get to but first you have to pluck up that courage and dive in . When an implementation begins we must have an end in mind but knowing the outcome at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball . I would challenge that the world is yet to see an implementation that can foresee the future , planning the benefits that we think will be released through making a healthcare system digital is as challenging as planning the rest of your life together with a new love , and yet just as essential . <p> The tools we need to plan the benefits of an EHR implementation need to be grown from others experience . It is why Ireland is in such a unique position , it can learn from nearly every jurisdiction in the world as it moves towards a digital fabric for health . Let 's all face it , we seek guidance from so many others when it comes to relationships , often so poorly qualified to give advice , simply experienced in the mistakes and lessons . <p> Digital implementation in healthcare needs to have an element of fun with the obvious serious point at the end . Just like the traditional engagement period of time I guess . Taking a health system on a journey to change has to be something that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of . So much can be done to ensure ownership of implementation remains with the clinicians who will be using the system , avoidance of IT being done to the system keeps the reality check in place . <p> Recently in Ireland the implementation of EHRs has been fun , because team cultures have been worked on . Real collaborations across a multiplicity of people types , led by clinicians who , because of years of experience running their working lives through things like multi-disciplinary teams , can get the most from so many different types of people . <p> Keeping the end in sight at all times is an absolute need for digital health implementations . The fact is , scope creep is the project killer . So in keeping with the analogy , the end in sight is perhaps the wedding day , and here scope creep here is just as bad and often caused by not being clear who is the owner of the day ( system ) really ! Clinical validation and decision making in the build of the EHR is crucial to a successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are some scary stories in the NHS where systems with 10,000 licences are only being used by 1,000 people because the system does not work in the way clinicians need . <p> The story of several electronic document management ( EDM ) systems in a few hospitals where black and white EDM was implemented by technologists only to discover that the positioning of the pink piece of paper or the highlight note was crucial to the way the clinician uses the system , are becoming too frequent . Bringing this back to the analogy , maybe this implementation was influenced by this being done in a " shotgun " fashion by the family of the bride ? The technologist doing IT to the healthcare system , like a family insisting on the wedding of the couple . The only way to ensure this does not happen is to empower the clinician and their team to be the leader of the project , just like for the wedding day the wife to be has to be in charge to ensure the day is exactly what the couple want it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will change , you can not just do the same as you always did , except now with a digital overview , or even just make it digital now and then go through business change later . <p> Becoming a married couple requires both parties to accept the world is changing and the relationship is now a symbiotic one requiring give and take , pull and push from both parties for it to succeed . The relationship of a health organisation that now has an EHR or other digital solutions needs to bring clinicians closer to the informatics people . <p> We in Ireland talk about trying harder to remove the terms that separate technology projects from business change projects to try to erase this issue coming up . The CCIO role helps here , a shining example of one of the interested parties attempt to get closer to the other . However , as with marriage this fix requires all sides to be active in making it work . <p> Where this analogy falls down I guess is the number of parties now involved in the delivery of digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time ! <p> Who owns the wedding ? All too often the response I hear is , the wife , the family or the payer when I listen to friends planning a wedding , and here the analogy also is strong . The tax payer of a country with a public health system needs to own the system , after all they are the payer . And yet my advice to anyone planning the wedding is seize your day , its your wedding and you should be in charge , and therefore we should be empowering the clinician and the patient , and dare I say , not the media , the influencers and the trend setters . <p> Healthcare is not our goal ; life is the goal of the system . The parallels to the relationship continue to exist beyond the initial implementation of digital solutions into the health system . <p> A clinical team will go through the pain point to deliver new life or new capability into the world . Birth of a system or the discovery that you are expecting twins is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relationship or in digital implementation . Once the object of your efforts is live in the hospital the world changes dramatically for everyone involved . <p> One of the key learnings that many jurisdictions have come to after a go-live is that the system being live is not the end of the journey . To maximize benefit from the system needs nurturing ; business change is a continuous journey of service improvement and the rate that technology is evolving and growing means that to simply stop the project once the new system is live would be like accepting that nothing more can be achieved . Like with a new baby the role of us , the parent of the digital solution is to enable learning to continue and the system to grow and evolve . The health care digital team has to learn to become the parent of each of its digital babies . <p> " The art of the clinician is to distract the patient whilst nature cures them , " is a quote from Voltaire . The role of technology in healthcare needs to follow a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver a seamless solution that catalyses integrated care delivery and can ensure that the goal of contextualised care for every person can be achieved . However , if we are to continue the analogy of relationships then we need to keep an eye out for another danger : the seven-year itch ! <p> Loyalty to the concepts of digital health must be maintained . Once the relationship begins it becomes very difficult to stop and go back , but also the system that has been put in place needs to be continually evaluated . <p> A happy marriage is one where all the partners continue to communicate and work hard to achieve goals and outcomes and a long term digital relationship needs similar consideration . Age old concepts of keeping the supplier hungry really need to be dropped in favour of a harmonious relationship with a shared goal in mind . After all , do we really want to consider keeping our life partners hungry for the next 60 years ? ! <p> What is the final stage of the relationship ? A friend commented that surely its death but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being able to act as a one whilst maintaining the individuality is a huge part of this . If we consider the matured relationship of clinicians and digital leaders then this would be a great outcome for us , particularly if we can bring the supplier into the same bed ? <p> All then goes full circle , and continuing to find unique ways to turn on the relationship gene is part of how we continue to learn and grow , and sometimes we really do have to evaluate where the relationship has got us and make changes . As with a digital partnership , there will need to be compromises along the way that lead , ideally , to a happier outcome for all . <p> As that English expert in partnerships , Wayne Rooney , is often quoted as saying , Perfect partners do n't  exist . Perfect conditions exist for a limited time in which partnerships express themselves best. The role of the digital healthcare leader though is to ensure that those conditions exist perpetually . <p> Talking about delivering all this to Ireland means I cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a current and quintessentially English ( I really hope he is n't ) footballer . Therefore , let me end with a quote from a wonderful singer songwriter from this wonderful country , Mr. Damien Rice , <p> " And so it is just like you said it would be , life goes easy on me , most of the time , and so it is the shorter story , no love , no glory , no hero in her sky . " <p> Maybe a moto for all EHR ( or , as autocorrect continues to tell me , HER ) implementers now and forever more , we are not heroes in the sky and we know its not like we said it would be , but , we are here to make life easy . We are here to make healthcare be about life , not about technology .

Imagine your parents frustrations <p> Imagine if the hospital EHR came in a box ready to deploy , would we be playing with the box within the first week I wonder ? Once upon a time we used to talk about a hospital without boundaries , in some areas that evolved to a liquid hospital , as we move to the next decade a new idea is starting to emerge , a new parallel , the digital hospital in a box . <p> No this is n't a chapter in the SIMS game or an elaborate Minecraft playground , this is where clinicians , patients and managers want to be ! The mobile experience has continued to evolve at such a pace that the expectation of what we can do with our devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go . A world that seems like it could be attainable with just a little different type of effort . <p> Twice in one week I have been shown patient applications on mobile devices that enable patients to take control of their care wherever and whenever they want to . <p> The digital Haemophilia support capability deployed in Ireland allows a patient to be in complete control of their care and the treatment plan they have , live from their very own smartphone . Ordering new treatment to be delivered and allowing the health system to track this treatment brings a level of patient safety never before seen . The solution also takes the theories of just-in-time efficiencies and applies them to healthcare . Just like the fast-moving consumer goods industries where just-in-time was invented , this has brought remarkable cost savings and the removal of so much waste in the delivery of drugs to the patient . <p> The second app is a collaboration between a charity , an academic partner , a technology delivery group and the health system . The epilepsy patient application now delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to people with this long-term condition . Communication with clinicians is important for any patient with any long-term condition , and the impact on patients with epilepsy has been particularly revolutionary . A patient can now record and communicate the frequency , type and severity of a seizure to their clinician who can use the app to securely communicate suggested changes to the drug and treatment regime . <p> For patients with a genomic sequence they can now see the geneticists opinion of their illness enabling the control of illness to be shared and the nature of the expert patient to evolve considerably . In a remarkably short period of time , some patients have been able to come off the drugs they have been on for long periods due to near real-time evaluation of efficacy of the drugs regime they are on and the shared ownership of data about their illness . <p> When we consider the impact of digital advances on healthcare one of three things can happen ; it can continue to evolve at a slow pace but a safe pace ; digital solutions can optimise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way healthcare is delivered . <p> The question we are asking ourselves as digital leaders in healthcare is , are we trying to change the way healthcare is considered and delivered or are we simply trying to improve it . A supercharged hospital in a box could be the answer we have all been looking for . <p> On a recent study trip to Barcelona I was lucky enough to meet the team from TicSalut . More than anywhere else I have seen , the Catalonian health system has cracked the mobile application and data problem for health , and the way they have done this is by taking the concepts of a mobile engendered Eco-System and making it real in every possible way . Catalonia has built the first box for the hospital to be packaged in ! How have they done it ? <p> First and foremost , they have managed to maintain control of the market place by offering a type of accreditation which has significant value to the builders of mobile applications . Their brand is trusted , respected and brings value to patients , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure an agility to market without stifling the innovation capability of its growth . <p> TicSalut have gone a step further than merely a kite mark for health apps though . As part of the accreditation process the organisation asks that , with patient consent , the data collected in the app is not only made available to the app supplier but also the healthcare system of Catalonia . A clinician can see the information a patient or carer has and from a clinical point of view decide if the information is a valid addition to the clinical record , accepting it into the EHR of the patient where appropriate . The patient then can see they clinical record and can make use of the information inside the apps they have decided to use themselves . All of this strikes me as a bit like a box with both sides pushed open , truly a system facilitating a new eco-system approach to the delivery of healthcare . <p> Innovations like these do n't  come overnight , of course . TicSalut have been building towards this for 10 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data can be achieved for the patients they serve . The concept of the health and wealth of the nation really being at the heart of what they are delivering . The links to innovation through universities and academic fellowships are now well established . The apps are always recommendations and not mandatory , also the patient still chooses the app that they want to use . Prescribing an app can take place but it still always comes back to a patient choice . <p> Throughout Catalonia where clinical apps are used they can also be rated and reviewed by clinician and patient , taking from the travel industry and sites like Trip Advisor the clinical solutions deployed via mobile are crowd source reviewed and the results of this adds weight to the kite mark applied to the app . <p> If we are to apply the successful digital lessons of other business areas then we need to wow the customer . Healthcare has a difficulty in defining its customer which makes this goal complex but , in the case of the hospital in a box this becomes easier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be part of the journey and the clinician who is delivering the care to understand the benefits of the information they are receiving , the veracity of that information . Maybe the much used three V definition of Big Data ( Volume , Veracity and Variety ) can find better application in simple clinical information ! <p> The new concepts of digital allows businesses to become services rather than costly ( sometimes wasteful ) capital expenditure items . Take for example the work Phillips has done at Schiphol Airport , by applying circular economy principles Schiphol Group and Philips have created a new way of working , a new partnership . Philips now has responsibility for delivering light to the airport , responsibility for the fixtures and fittings and ultimately the recycling of the fittings . By taking this responsibility Philips can offer their most innovative and cost effective lighting solutions as a service to the airport , making a capital free investment for Schiphol in lighting innovation . Now apply this to healthcare , and try to do it without creating perverse incentives . <p> An EHR service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budgetary challenges we all understand , can not be charged for digital solutions per bed or per patient basis easily . Doing this will instead cause a different consideration ; whether to put information into the EHR . Yet , the digital service model can still work . A hospital in a box , a digital solution deployed to the patient first can work in this way , we are seeing this with the consumer driven shift in primary care , Babylon Health , WebDoctor.ie and VideoDoc and others here in Ireland are all facilitating some service model type solutions to the delivery of primary care interaction . The patient becomes the payer for the service in a different way ; but in a way that enables innovation to be fostered rather than kept to a decade long cycle of investment . <p> Service solutions or the new term platform businesses are pivoting throughout the globe and becoming new innovations ; Tesla becoming an alternative power company , charging home based batteries overnight on off-peak electricity or Uber becoming a way of ordering the delivery of vaccinations direct to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ability to deliver health as a service to patients seems today to be hooked to the mobile capabilities though and particularly to this idea of the healthcare system in a box . In the space of a single piece of writing then we have managed to move from a hospital in a box to the whole healthcare system ! <p> Digital leaders in every jurisdiction of the globe are trying to consider where in the tipping point they are , " are we here to optimise the health system with digital ? Or are we here to enable a transformation ? " The " healthcare as a service " concept , facilitated by the healthcare system and being delivered in a digital box can transform the health systems of the world ! We know that digital is ready but the human factors along with the business change elements , are the more difficult parts to resolve . That 's why I believe the concept of a healthcare system in a box is useful , it simplifies what we are trying to do . Samsung talks about the unboxing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we can deliver , and then unbox the digital healthcare system then maybe we have a route to achieve the business engagement and change that so many healthcare systems need . <p> The healthcare system in a box provides for our ability to be a multi-channel business , at last the engagement of our hard-to-define customer base can be done comparatively easily as we suddenly have many more digital routes to engage through . Engagement has to be done on the needs of the customer rather than the organisation and therefore the idea of multiple channels means we can offer the ability to engage in the same way as so many businesses do who successfully put the customer at the heart of what they do , the box has so many routes into it ! <p> One of the advantages of moving to a concept where the digital hospital is delivered through the proverbial box could well be the ability to lock the hospital in a box and use it to protect the data and the experience of the patient . Recent cyber threats and the escalation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health professional , a new challenge to overcome . Placing the digital experience of the patient into their own hands provides healthcare with , at the very least , a new level of vigilance . We do n't  ask one person to adhere to hygiene standards to enable infection control best practice to become standard , we ask everyone , maybe that is what can be achieved by crowd sourcing the customer in the cyber threat battle . <p> We have had the cardboard box since 1817 , and now whether its Calvin and Hobbes creating a time machine ( or a transmogrifier ) , or the gag reel on the computer game Metal Gear ; the cardboard box is an accepted part of growing up . Even the national museum of toys in the USA has a box in it , the only non-branded toy it has as an exhibition . So , if the humble cardboard box can become a toy for all our children since the early 1800s then I am sure as a concept for healthcare it can become the answer to the truly patient focused electronic health record !

@@101582554 @5782554/ <h> The Liquid Hospital <p> 10 Mar 17 by Richard Corbridge 0 views <p> The Irish healthcare system has been on an exciting journey putting building blocks in place to create a digital fabric . In December 2014 , it was said to be 16 years behind the digital curve for health in Europe . Over the past two years Ireland has been able to catch up 6 of those years , and by the end of 2016 four more of those years had been chipped away as the progress gap closed . <p> There are a number of key projects that have become the foundations of all change and reform to the Irish healthcare system , these include ; an Individual Health Identifier , eReferral , ePharmacy and Irelands first digital hospital . <p> The Irish healthcare system can now uniquely and digitally identify every patient and member of staff increasing the ability to deliver enhanced patient safety significantly and the ability to manage performance based on information ten-fold . The system has broken down physical boundaries relating to the referral process by implementing fully an eReferral process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribe in the community using a process that maintains patient choice of pharmacy has been piloted successfully and is now implementing nationally . <p> The first fully digital hospital has been delivered into one of the busiest maternity hospitals in the EU and will now be implemented into every maternity system in Ireland . This solution sees IoT technology brought into the most complex of care delivery systems , saving lives through real time information analysis and the implementation of digital workflows across a whole care pathway - a first in the world . <p> This has led to many conversations around the breadth of how eHealth can change care delivery globally . Recently I was discussing how this can affect delivery of care , particularly in hospitals , with a learned colleague of mine who has come up with the phrase , the Liquid Hospital. Which I must say has grabbed my imagination completely . <p> The concept of a Liquid Hospital is not just supported by technology but is only possible through technology and modern innovation . Its no stretch of the imagination to picture it , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed change and ca n't be made so just through the implementation of technology . The thinking is starting to mature here and in November Irelands minister for health began to use the phrase , " a health system without boundaries . " After all digital does n't  recognise the physical boundaries of a hospital or GP clinic . <p> Moving away from concepts of episode-centric care will be a significant challenge any health care system worldwide . Let 's not forget even the concept of an Electronic Health Record ( EHR ) is based around recording the episodes of care that occur rather than around the patient . Breaking down the systemised walls for the provision of care will be key to the innovation that we describe here as the Liquid Hospital . <p> Yet even as the concept evolves , we note a flaw in the name . The Liquid Hospital does not refer to one institution or hospital - the concept really is around the delivery of seamless care and wellbeing support to people ( not just patients ) , however for the purposes of this article let 's stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The idea is quite simple really ; once the patient is in hospital the technology allows the episodes of care that the patient requires to come to them , rather than the patient being shipped around the hospital for different treatments and the risks that come with that . In other words , the system becomes clinical centric . I know from a stay in hospital in 2016 that being moved from ward to treatment room and back again is at best uncomfortable and at worst downright scary . The concept does n't  just stop there though . It seeks also to achieve that panacea of eHealth - a truly paperless environment . So that not only do treatments flow around the patient , so does information . <p> Imagine an outpatient visit to a liquid hospital . You arrive in reception and check in with a clinician who takes your identification and confirms back to you some details allowing you to confirm the reason for your visit . As a patient you have elected to collect information on your condition at home so you quickly synchronise the smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your medication record and real time recordings of how your condition makes you feel . <p> As your consultant comes to you they are fed this information to their tablet or computer and are analysing the outputs in the lift as they come to meet you in your own personalised consultation room . As the consultant comes into your room your records are shared on the display on the wall for both you and the consultant to consider . You have also elected to share the consultation output with your primary care professional and therefore the actions the two of you now collectively take are recorded and made available to them digitally and directly into their system ready for next time you the patient are with them . <p> Let 's say you elect to have a procedure related to your long-term condition . Whilst with your consultant you choose when and where that procedure will take place and you are electronically introduced to the clinician who will be your key point of contact when you return for the procedure . <p> Your consultant is then able to provide advice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the procedure and download this advice to your smart device for you to consider with your family when you are home . <p> Perhaps you also consider a slight change to your medication . The consultant is able to provide you with advice and guidance from around the world and connect you to patients like you with a similar condition via a secure social media outlet . This allows you to consider the impact of a change in medication with a peer group over the coming weeks and access some key support . <p> Your clinician can provide your new prescription directly to the pharmacist of your choice and you can call there on the way home , knowing your drugs will be ready for you . A copy of your prescription and your summary notes are also made available to you for your own health record as you have elected to keep this information in your own health vault solution in addition to the electronic record in the hospital . <p> A few days later , your long-term condition takes a turn for the worse and you decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your village . You ring the centre and are asked to provide the information you have collected over the last few days via your smart device , which you can do whilst you are on the phone . The primary care centre advises you to up the dose of medication ever so slightly and alter the time you are taking your prescription and within one day your illness settles down and you do n't  need to go in to the centre . <p> The time of your procedure and your short stay in hospital draws ever nearer . Rather than have to attend the hospital for a pre-op meeting you have decided to share your own collected data with your key contact in the week leading up to your visit and have a brief video conference with the clinician . All is looking well and the clinician does not need to see you face to face . Although you are a little anxious , the hospital has arranged for you to be part of a secure group on a social media site and you are able to communicate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar experience , and this goes a long way in settling your fears . <p> On the day of your attendance at hospital you check in comfortably with very little fuss . You are provided with a secure tablet PC that is linked to the hospitals Wi-Fi , and all your notes and updates will be on this device during your stay so that you have the comfort of seeing them as well as them always being with you during your stay . Its your choice throughout your stay as to who you additionally share the information with , electronically . You elect to send all information to your own personal record and some of the key facts to your primary care centre . You also decide to email your nearest and dearest a summary of each day to help them feel less worried about your time in the hospitals care . <p> After the procedure you are out of hospital very quickly . Your after care is already arranged and as you hand back the hospital tablet computer with your information on you can already see it has arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care centre . <p> The social care provision you require in the first few days is arranged online and again , as the patient , you have decided what information to share and with who . The social care clinician visiting you at home asks if they can view your record in more detail and you grant them access there and then . The information they are able to get from this satisfies any initial concerns they had and they are able to discharge you within three visits . <p> A Stretch of the Imagination ? <p> The technology is there to facilitate this . It has been available the last five years at least if not longer . The big change needed is perhaps twofold ; investment in the aspects of technology to drive this ( including training and development ) and the change in how care is delivered at a business and service level . Healthcare provision and change related to it is often compared to changing the direction of a sea bound oil tanker , but , if the description of this kind of benefit can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from clinician and patient alike maybe this could be an innovation we can make reality ! It certainly describes a system that puts the patient at the centre and yet is only just beyond our own reach . A tangible view , just over the horizon of eHealth in action . <p> Some countries across Europe are starting to put in place the building blocks to enable this change : in Scotland , a change to the commissioning model , facilitating health boards across all care delivery to allow the holistic delivery of care and here in Ireland , the HSEs own integrated care programme and reform programmes beginning the concepts of change , the creation of the Individual Health Identifier spoke about above and concepts like money follows the patient will all start to enable this dream to become reality . <p> Technology and a business change programme truly can break down the physical walls of the care institutions of the country and allow care to flow around the patient in a manner as transparent as H2O . Our 2020 vision sees health without walls made possible by digital advancements.

Answers were related to five key areas : <p> Solution Can the vendors tools and services meet core needs ? <p> Appropriately , most providers said that the capabilities of their potential PHM solution were top of mind as they went shopping . Almost as many had something positive to say about their solution , but nearly as many had significant complaints . The takeaway ? Capabilities are a good starting point but not a slam dunk . <p> Vendor Does the vendor have the expertise and integrity needed in a trusted partner ? <p> More than half of providers said they were attracted by a vendor characteristic . Most often , they leaned toward vendors either with a reputation as an industry leader or with whom the providers already had some sort of relationship ( e.g. consultants or EMR vendors ) . Providers had much less to say about their vendors character , good or bad , once the contract had been signed . The takeaway ? These things get a vendor in the door but become much less important after the sale . <p> A PHM solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunately , many vendors downplay how difficult it is to acquire , aggregate , and normalize data from the many sources that vendors claim their products can handle . As a result , twice as many providers expressed frustration as did gratitude about data access . The takeaway ? Before signing , make sure your data ducks are in a row by securing data sources and written time and quality commitments from vendors . <p> Cost Will the solution fit a budget and provide measurable return ? <p> Very few providers specifically named cost as a primary criterion . That does not mean that money is no object ; budgets will always be the first hurdle . The situation is rather evidence that PHM solutions are far from a commodity that can be indiscriminately bargained for . The takeaway ? Get ready to spend and/or compromise . <p> Service Does the vendor have the resources and willpower to help ensure that providers get the greatest possible value from their investment . <p> For many providers , acceptable service levels were an unspoken expectation ; only 10% said that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vendors shined once their customers realized how much ongoing work was needed to customize functionality and ensure a timely flow of reliable data .

When rating CommonWells future value , the over 240 provider organizations and 13 industry-leading EMR vendors had much different perspectives from each other . I am excited to provide clarity from the study findings and from ongoing research and industry executive statements right up to today . It makes sense to break this into three pieces : <p> What did the study find about CommonWell ? <p> How do industry and vendor statements map to what we found ? <p> What have we learned since the study ? <p> The vendors voted with their party : CommonWell members expect extensive future value , while non-members do not ( one voted for moderate value and the rest for minimal ) . Providers saw it differently . 27% of those whose vendor is a CommonWell member said it will have extensive future value , while 2% of non-member providers voted that way . Cerner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients saw it as having terrific benefit . One Cerner client CIO was ecstatic to connect his owned physicians on eClinicalWorks to his Cerner acute care solution via CommonWell when it is available . A large Cerner IDN client educated about CommonWell details stated , " It seems like Cerner really needs to get some advice from those who will actually use the system or who are experts in this area to make sure the technology will launch well . So I do n't  plan on going to CommonWell anytime soon . " Other than the positivity from athena and Cerner clients , CommonWell partner clients were more muted and saw CommonWell as a potential benefit representing larger participants like Allscripts , McKesson , Greenway , and MEDITECH . <p> Our goal was to include as many provider organizations live on CommonWell as possible in the interoperability study . To achieve that , last June we invited each vendor to give us lists of live clients . Jitin Asnaaniexecutive director of CommonWellalso pushed the vendors to provide us with lists . athenahealth gave us a list of 14 clients and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have live athena and Cerner CommonWell clients confirm the exchange of patient records . None of the other vendors provided live CommonWell clients for us to interview . athena clients confirmed that the universal connectivity in the SaaS environment is easy to turn on and works . Cerner clients generally have to specifically opt in , and that natural barrier creates slower adoption . Forecasts that 500 Cerner clients would be live by year-end 2015 have not materialized based on recent Cerner client interviews . We will watch the rollout this year to see how the forecasts play out ( e.g. , McKesson projects to have over 300 live clients by mid-year ) . It seems natural that growth will be slow at first until it reaches a tipping point . When announcements of hundreds of CommonWell clients do n't  clarify how many are live versus how many have contracted , it hurts confidence and trust . <p> What does this all translate into ? Few see CommonWell as a silver bullet , yet many envision it being a mainstream player . CommonWell discussions clarify that CommonWell will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to define the perfect CommonWell scenario . When players like athena participate in almost all collaborations and initiatives , it gives a sense of betting on any approach that brings value . The absence of Epic is described by Epic supporters as a smart , practical approach focused on connecting networks to networks , and some view the initiation of CommonWell as a counter-Epic activity . Providers excited about CommonWell say Epic is arrogant , operating in their own world , and ignoring great solutions . No doubt , CommonWell is here to stay regardless of whether Epic or others join in . Looking back at HIMSS in 2013 , nearly three years ago , I can clearly recall the announcement and my trek up to the podium to applaud Neal Patterson for taking such a proactive step .

It makes me think of the game of basketball . As every child learns to play the game of basketball , shooting stands out as a very important part of the game . Shooting leads to scoring , and scoring is what is displayed on the scoreboard . Without shooting , basketball would be a boring sport to watch indeed . Naturally , many players focus on developing their skill in shooting so that they can score and see their points on the scoreboard . <p> The PHM market has been a lot like the player learning to play basketball . The thing that we have been focused on most is what brings the quickest and easiest returns , or in other words , puts points on the board . The thing that puts points on the board most easily in PHM is taking care of high-risk and high-cost patients . When a high-risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns for a healthcare provider stack up very quickly . Points are put up on the board . We need to move past just putting points on the board . We need to focus on more than just shooting . Shooting is an essential part of the game of basketball , and being good at shooting is a great skill , but looking into the future , there are additional skills and abilities that are going to be needed to progress in the game . There is dribbling , passing , defense , set plays , and picks , not to mention referees , a time clock , and the opposing team trying to steal the ball away from you or block you . There are so many aspects to the game of basketball that focusing on just one will never get you to the NBA . <p> The underlying idea of population health is that we need to take care of the entire population , not just the high-risk patients who bring the greatest benefit to the organization . Taking care of the entire population requires interactions with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . It means practicing other aspects of population health besides shooting that are fundamental to the game . <p> Moving to the next league is going to happen , but whether providers are prepared for that next level will depend on the development of skills outside of shooting , or just chasing low-hanging fruit . In the rest of this series we will explore the fundamentals of PHM and the journey to becoming a winning team .

@@101582580 @5782580/ <h> Interoperability : How Perception Maps to Reality <p> 11 Mar 16 by Kent Gale 0 views <p> After the 1998 HIMSS conference in Orlando , I suffered through a month of some difficult stomach pains . I initially attributed the pain to stress and Popeyes spicy chicken . Ultimately , I found out that the pain was a result of ulcers caused by H. pylori bacteria . The use of an antibiotic solved the problem and eliminated the discomfort . Thank goodness for the discovery of H. pylori-caused infections and for the cure . It is valuable to know that the H. pylori discovery happened more than 15 years before the bacteria was accepted as the true cause of many ulcers . The belief or perception that most ulcers had a very different cause with mostly ineffective cures persisted for decades . Our CHIME panel of CIOs included a great question in the October 2015 Interoperability study that provided valuable findings worth reviewing today to eliminate misinformation and help you understand where perception matches reality . <p> Interoperability ( IO ) energy from lawmakers , federal agencies ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and competitive vendors establishes a perception that begs clarity around the performance and ability of different vendors in sharing patient data with outside provider organizations . The best way to validate these perceptions was determined to be an actual measurement . Healthcare providers were asked about their general perceptions as to which vendors struggle the most with IO . It was not surprising that Epic received three times as many votes as the next most-mentioned vendor ( 44% for Epic versus 15% for eClinicalWorks and 13% for MEDITECH , and the remaining vendors were much lower ) ; that was not surprising due to the prominent role that the press and competitors have in describing what providers perceived to be the truth . <p> In July of 2014 , Rep. Phil Gingrey , M.D. ( R-GA ) focused on Epic during a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing , stating the possibility " that fraud is being perpetrated on the American people . " RAND Corp . published a report in 2014 calling Epic a " closed system " relative to IO . The Federal Trade Commission made it public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spot any efforts to impede IO progress . The FTC capped off their stated concern by suggesting possible legislation aimed at penalizing vendors determined to be impeding the flow of patient data . <p> What , if anything , did our IO study results clarify ? eClinicalWorks is perceived to struggle with IO ( 2nd highest percentage ) , and actual provider experiences validate that the perception is accurate . eClinicalWorks was ranked last by providers on ease of connecting and overall IO capabilities . MEDITECH shared the limelight with eClinicalWorks and was voted least effective to connect with by their competitors and next to last on ease of connecting and overall IO capabilities by actual providers with hands-on experience . <p> The real clarity , and a surprise to many , is that while 44% reported a market perception that Epic struggles with IO , providers and competing vendors with actual Epic experience voted Epic the most effective to connect with . Tied with athenahealth with the best overall ratings by providers , Epic was tagged the best in five of the eight measurements , including vendor proactivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and standards , minimizing costs , and maintaining IO during upgrades . Epic also tied with athenahealth on ease of connection setup . The crowning confirmation that Epic is , indeed , the industry leader comes from their peers as five of nine picked Epic as the most effective to work with . While the perception of two of the vendors ( eClinicalWorks and MEDITECH ) is accurate , the perception of Epic is not . Having done more than 30 of the 250+ provider interviews myself , I found that the overall perceptions were routinely followed by the provider clarifying vendor ratings , helping me personally to better understand the overall context . <p> The findings are clear . As H. pylori is actually the bacteria that causes most ulcers , Epic , though perceived to struggle with IO , actually shares patient records equally as well as or better than any other EMR vendor in the market . 
@@101582581 @5782581/ <h> Interoperability - Applying Pressure <p> 31 May 16 by Bob Cash 0 views <p> More than forty years ago as I completed my Scouting First Aid merit badge , I learned that one of the keys in responding to bleeding is to apply pressure . Of course , applying pressure is not a one-size-fits-all approach . For example , for a simple scrape rather than a cut , applying pressure is not really necessary even though there is surface bleeding . On the other hand , with a puncture wound or a deeper cut , applying pressure is an essential early step to stop the bleeding . And in some rare instances , pressure to the site of injury alone is not enough ; stopping blood flow to the area entirely via tourniquet is the only way to stop the bleeding . <p> Given the requirements and timelines associated with MACRA legislation , pressure continues to be ( or is about to be ) applied to providers and HIT vendors alike as regulators continue to feel a need to " stop the bleeding . " But how bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right site or in the right way for each " patient " ? The ONC put out a request for information and is seeking input regarding the measurement of progress toward the 2018 MACRA-stated goal of " widespread exchange of health information through interoperable certified EHR technology . " Measuring progress is one way of " applying pressure " to stop the bleeding ; it is actually a method we at KLAS know well . Transparency is indeed one way to motivate progress . <p> In a recent meeting that I attended at a local HIMSS function , one CIO stated that " the most innovative thing we can do in healthcare IT is to say to Washington , stop ! " His suggestion was that the industry needs time to adopt solutions and optimize . This statement might suggest that the bleeding has stopped or that the flow has at least significantly decreased , and that there is time needed to allow for scabbing and healing to occur . <p> So are we bleeding in our efforts to reach widespread exchange , or are we at a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer , as is often the case , is that it depends . Early insights from providers in KLAS 2016 study on interoperability suggest that some provider organizations are definitely at the point of healing with very little bleeding , while others are hemorrhaging from a lack of resources , vision , and/or support from their EMR vendors . EMR vendors also run the full gamut , with several providing or moving toward providing great access to both intraoperability and interoperability , while others have not yet identified or implemented the technology or methods for increasing active exchange . <p> It does not appear that the bleeding has stopped to any large degree . There is certainly a need for continued pressure to move providers toward data exchange where outside data is accessible , easy to find , and in the clinicians workflow and ultimately benefits patient care . With that being said , there are already significant efforts in the market to apply that pressure , including collaborative groups like CommonWell and The Sequoia Project , efforts from the Argonaut Project and organizations like CHIME to establish and strengthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our 2016 KLAS study and others . Measurement is not the pressure needed from regulators . <p> Taking the view of providers , the regulators can intervene by more directly developing , implementing , and enforcing a national patient identifier and consistently applied standards . In a recent conversation I had with a provider heavily involved in standards development , he suggested that the funding of pilot programs to test newly developed standards would be a tremendous benefit . Daily , we at KLAS speak with providers who describe how difficult it is to effectively and efficiently connect to the wide variety of EHRs , and those providers say a major reason for the challenge is the lack of consistent standards . If government leaders want to help provide the necessary pressure to stop the " bleeding , " they should lead the effort to give providers the tools they need to not only slow the flow but also cauterize the wound .

This group came together with the express purpose of improving the industry surrounding population health management ( PHM ) . <p> I remember one particular interaction between three very passionate executives from competing companies . These executives spent at least 45 minutes in deep conversation regarding what particular services their customers needed beyond just the technology that each of their companies provided . <p> During that conversation , I heard these executives sharing what can best be described as details from their own PHM playbooks . <p> I could n't help but think that these three vendor executives truly understood what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

But , in spite of those complexities , the 2016 Keystone Summit on population health convened on a crisp autumn morning in September . <p> Interestingly enough , those providers asking for a summit on population health wanted more than anything to develop a definition of what population health actually means .

Clearly , establishing a strong track record matters ! <p> The above chart identifies the upcoming consultation needs that many hospitals and practices will face . In speaking with providers while preparing our upcoming report , I gained many insights into why these needs have arisen . Let 's break down a few of the bigger needs : <h> 1 . Implementation Services <p> HIT implementations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and implementation work continues as the top area providers need help with going forward .

Providers also would like to engage firms to assist them with go-live support and with training during implementations . <h> 2 . Healthcare Management Consulting <p> As healthcare grows more complex , providers continue to look for expertise to assist in navigating new trends and issues . The provider organizations interviewed for our upcoming consulting study state that they will need help tackling topics such as : <h> 3 . Value-Based Care ( VBC ) Consulting <p> The transition to VBC is still a daunting prospect for many organizations , and engaging outside help for strategies regarding VBC and population health remains a top priority for many healthcare organizations . <p> One VP of operations reported , " There is a tremendous amount of work that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will underestimate that work .

They call themselves experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningful for fear of being held responsible for it . When I call consultants , I want their opinions and . . . I want their expertise , but many times , their expertise is missing in the dialogue . " <p> " Sometimes we bring in a firm and ask for an orange , but then we get a banana . Sometimes we do n't  even get a fruit ; we get a vegetable . " <p> The second most frequently mentioned pain point for healthcare organizations occurs when some consultants on a project are inexperienced , lack the skills needed for the job , or are otherwise not the right fit . <p> " I am bothered by low-quality consultants . The engagement loses a ton of value when I cant trust a firm and I have to watch and vet their consultants . . . . I want to hire a firm that will monitor their own consultants and that will find the right resources for me rather than just sending me bodies to fill slots . " <h> 3 . Inflexible : Cookie-Cutter Approach and Lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is firms that come in with predisposed agendas , formulaic approaches , and an inability or unwillingness to listen to or adapt to customers needs . I am not saying firms should n't start with a proven playbook or frame , but listening to , understanding , and customizing to customers unique dynamics , culture , or business needs should come first . <p> " The struggles we encounter most often with consulting firms are generic models , templates , and strategies that are recycled . Healthcare is very local , and firms have to be careful about being conflicted . " <p> " When a firm comes into a market where they have not worked before and throws a generic approach at a customer , the customer spends a ton of time getting the firm to pay attention and develop a set of recommendations tailored to their situation . " <p> " One problem is the rigidity of some consultants . Sometimes , consultants believe they know us so well that they are n't willing to listen to us . They have their own ideas about who we are and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not Delivering on Promised Outcomes <p> The opposite of firms that keep their promises and demonstrate integrity are firms that overpromise and under-deliver . Some the larger consulting firms who are most mentioned for being able to partner with clients are also cited for overpromising and under-delivering in terms of both outcomes and timelines , leading clients to feel they have n't received the expected value from their engagements . <p> " We struggle with firms that overpromise and under-deliver . It should be pretty simple ; the firm just has to tell me exactly what they can do and then do it . They should n't make promises they ca n't keep . No one wins in that case . " <h> 5 . Non-Strategic : Lack of Additional Value and Insight <p> Lastly , healthcare organizations say that they encounter struggles when firms fail to be strategic and provide additional value and insight . This happens when firms fail to transfer knowledge , gain trust and buy-in from key stakeholders , establish good communication and relationships with staff and executives , or get on the same page as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have the most knowledge when they come in , and they are putting out fires , meaning that sometimes they start bossing the regular staff members around . Then our staff members feel like they have a worthless job , and they do n't  get to participate in anything new because the consultants take over . " <p> " The right consultants are knowledge-transfer mentors who provide support and then go away . We do n't  want frontline people . The consultants are either backfilling positions or have a specific skill that we do n't  have yet . " <p> My hope in presenting these gloomy findings is n't to discourage , but rather to provide helpful insights from the healthcare organizations I 've spoken withinsights that shed some light on potholes to watch out for or even avoid altogether . <p> In order to avoid many of these potholes , providers should focus on transparent communication between themselves and consulting firms , along with setting proper expectations before an engagement commences . <p> In addition to these blog posts , we 've published the full report on HIT Consulting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and final blog in my trilogy , I will share my excitement on the future outlook of consulting , including the emerging needs and top-of-mind upcoming projects for healthcare organizations .

The team that is challenged consistently has a coach that points the team one wayback to the fundamentals , back to basics . A good basketball coach knows that you have to get the fundamentals right before you can move to more advanced skills . The first fundamental step toward having effective population health is the process of getting the data into the system , cleaning it up , normalizing it , and making it digestible . Having one data source , ( for example , an EMR with clinical data ) presents a picture of the patient , but providers say that having more data sources helps them create a more complete picture of a patient . Having a better fundamental picture of a patient allows providers to take better care of their patient population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level , you have to make sure you have the basics covered . You have to have your data right . That enables better stratification of populations and results in a more complete picture of each individual patient so that you can help provide better care to individuals on a greater scale .

@@101582598 @5782598/ <h> Will You Survive the Journey to Value-Based Care ? <p> 19 Nov 15 by Warren Whitford 0 views <p> " Care providers are undergoing a period of rapid change as a combination of policy and market-driven incentives , programs , and activities are converging to establish provider-sponsored value in the marketplace . If the expectation set of purchasers is indeed changing , the market will place a premium on such provider enhancements . Thus the providers push to invest in new operating models will allow them to bear and manage the risk associated with caring for a patient population . " <p> The rapid change discussed by Governor Leavitt and its effects are already being felt by payers , providers , patients , and many other stakeholders throughout the healthcare ecosystem . As a result of this massive market shift , many consulting firms and purpose-built value-based care managed services firms are trying desperately to position themselves as the best resource to help providers successfully prepare for and operate in this new and exciting world of value-based care . <p> Value-based payment models promise greater financial return while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accountable care organizations ( ACOs ) , and other managed-care models tie financial returns to highly coordinated care and proactive population health management . All assume that the interests and behavior of patients , providers , and payers can be aligned to achieve common goals by sharing the risk of success or failure . Value and quality in healthcare improve when that risk is proactively managed , members are informed and engaged , and providers are supported in care delivery . Realizing these improvements is not easy , nor is it cheap . <p> According to one executive , John Tam , SVP at Evolent Health , " Success in a value-based world requires more than just being good at population health . Health systems also need to capture enough of the value they 're creating in order to grow , and not cannibalize , their enterprise . " <p> So the natural question would be , How does a health system capture that value and how much is it going to cost ? Payer and provider organizations generally have made extensive investments in both operational and analytical information technologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sending documents and data to one another , yet none is delivering on the need to bring together and share the full complement of health information required for collaboration and engagement , much less doing so in a timely fashion compatible with care management workflows . <p> We recently interviewed over 125 healthcare executives and confirmed that value-based initiatives and programs are growing in popularity and complexity . But not all organizations will be in a position to meet the requirements or to gain benefits immediately . Understanding which models are feasible and appropriate for your organization will be critical to investing in the right resources to ensure success . <p> Each of the many options have unique and challenging requirements . Governance and legal needs vary , as do contract and risk structures , requiring you to carefully evaluate and develop underlying infrastructure and payment methodologies to ensure long-term viability . Will you need to transform your organization in order to position yourself to enter into future risk-bearing agreements and continue to compete in your market ? <p> The fact remains that all value-based models require some degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulting firms that would like you to select them as a partner in that transformation . In producing our first-ever valued-based care services report , KLAS goal was to , first , identify the most essential capabilities providers need to succeed in risk-based contracts and , second , to identify which firms/vendors are currently driving value and improved outcomes in the value-based care advisory and managed services market . <p> According to the providers we spoke to , some vendors are closer than others to delivering the value and improved outcomes providers need to survive the transformation to value-based care .

As healthcare becomes increasingly complex , many organizations feel the need to look for advisory expertise to help them navigate new issues . Some even express a desire to enlist outside support that can help speed up their own initiatives . <p> We at KLAS have spoken recently with 230 healthcare executives that have worked with various consulting firms . Weve done so in order to help answer 3 questions for our healthcare provider friends : <p> What shared attributes lead to successful engagements with consulting firms ? <p> What are the emerging needs , and which firms are perceived to be best positioned ? <p> KLAS will be releasing the Healthcare Consulting 2016 report in a month , which helps deliver answers to these questions . <p> Having worked as a consultant myself , I am passionately engaged in exploring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Healthcare Consulting report , I 'll be sharing some of my own personal insights in this 3 part blog series . <p> Here are what I would call the Top 5 Attributes of An Advisory Firm : <h> 1 . Proficient : Superior Consultant Knowledge and Experience <p> Providers I spoke with say they are most successful when firms provide consultants that have strong industry experience as well as a wide , holistic breadth of technical knowledge . <h> 2 . Collaborative : Effective Partnering <p> I 've also found that a partnering attitude that puts the client first positions consulting firms for success . Before an engagement even begins , a consulting firm must listen to the client , understand the clients business needs and organization culture , and then provide an engagement tailored to achieve the best outcomes for that individual organization . <p> Several providers expressed their thoughts this way , <p> " I think it is important that a consulting firm listens to what we have to say and knows what our needs are . I do n't  want them to have a prescribed set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Our experience with a consulting firm should n't feel like the firm is going through their playbook and adapting what is applicable to us . Instead , consulting firms should find out what our issues are and help us fix those issues . " <p> " Consultants need to recognize the culture of the organization they are working with as quickly as possible so that they can realize benefits . They can make a bunch of suggestions , but if they do n't  have the right interdisciplinary skills to facilitate those changes for the key stakeholders who remain after they leave , we often do n't  get anything out of the service , which we pay a lot of money for . " <h> 3 . Trustworthy : Keeps Promises , Demonstrates Integrity <p> Those providers I spoke to want to work with consulting firms they can trust to keep promises and follow through on the achievable outcomes . This can also start before the engagement does , when advisers should set credible expectations . Consulting firms need to demonstrate integrity in following through on those expectations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it like this , <p> " Good firms deliver as promised . If a firm tells me they will do something , I expect them to do exactly what they say they will do . " <p> " The most critical thing is for firms to have high-quality people who can deliver what the company says they can . So firms should n't oversell their resources . " <h> 4 . Efficient : Has the Right Resources , Right Cost , Right Timeline <p> Consultants must be not only knowledgeable and experienced but also the right resources for the project at hand . Healthcare providers report that the most successful consulting firms are meticulous and consistent about aligning client needs with consultants skill sets . Along the same lines , clients say that firms must be conscientious about sticking to agreed-upon costs and timelines . <p> To quote a provider I spoke with , <p> " Knowledge and expertise in the industry in the area that a firm serves are obviously critical . Everybody always talks about getting the cheapest cost for a consulting company , but people get what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , longevity , the quality of outcomes , and success at other organizations . " <h> 5 . Strategic : Has a Strategic Approach <p> The final success attribute identified by healthcare organizations is demonstrated by firms that go a step beyond just offering knowledge and expertise . Such firms bring additional value by assuming a position of thought leadership and exercising strategic and collaborative guidance . Firms that take a truly strategic consulting approach will communicate proactively and effectively with clients , convince stakeholders to buy in , and use their knowledge empower continued healthcare success . <p> One provider explained , <p> " The most critical attribute of a successful consulting firm is really the ability to bring the right knowledge and skills to a project . Also , someone can be the most knowledgeable consultant in the world , but if that person ca n't establish a relationship of trust with stakeholders , then that resource is n't going to get anywhere . " <p> This is only the first part of a trilogy I 'm writing on this topic . Next week , I want to dive into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients when engaging consulting firms , and how those will affect outcomes for providers . My hope is that this information will help providers to be successful in their partnering with outside firms .

Instead of having to get up out of their desks and walk around the unit to find certain nurses , they just send the nurses secure text messages to let them know they have calls at the desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The idea of a complete and integrated communication system has started to solidify as the ideal among providers . We anticipate that the currently explosive market will consolidate into those vendors who truly listen to and satisfy provider needs . <p> The Secure Communication 2016 Report is intended to help providers seeking a communication platform learn the lay of the land , as well as identify which vendors offer the best solutions . We hope that providers will see the differences between standard and platform solutions and learn what best suits their needs .

Yet many providers hesitate to make the change from the tried and true fee-for-service model because , well , its difficult to track quality . <p> This is where HIT vendors come in . As providers increasingly see the shift from fee-for-service to VBC as inevitable , VBC solutions will become invaluable . When providers concentrate their efforts on improving overall patient health and can accurately track their performance , the providers and patients benefit together . <p> Recently , KLAS surveyed providers regarding this transition to value-based models ; providers discussed their feelings toward this trend , the VBC firms already in use , and their confidence in the value-based care model . Even though many VBC vendors claim to be leaders in the field , providers mentioned 125 unique vendors , 83 of whom were mentioned only once . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inevitable , a majority balk due to a lack of strong offerings from HIT vendors .

@@101582617 @5782617/ <p> In the first part of this blog post , we covered acute care EMR market share trends over the last four years and some of the pressures that led to Cerners acquisition of Siemens . This entry examines competitiveness and how Siemens does ( or does n't  ) change the market-share picture for Cerner . <p> For several years , Cerner has taken second place to Epic in the annual race to sign up new hospitals . Lately , that gap has been shrinking when it comes to raw hospital counts . In 2013 , Epic added 20 more hospitals than Cernerquite a difference from 2010 , when the margin was 137 hospitals . <p> Does this mean that Cerner is becoming more competitive ? Consider the following : <p> In 2013 , Cerner signed a very significant new customer right in KLAS backyard : Intermountain Healthcare . That deal , plus one other stemming from an IDN merger , accounted for 40% of Cerners 87 new hospitals . <p> Aside from Intermountain , Cerner won only two new IDN customers in 2013 , each with one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or were smaller standalone hospitals ( the latter averaging 79 beds ) . <p> Epics 2013 wins included 15 new IDNs that switched wholesale from other vendors . On average , each had 5 acute care hospitals with an average of 300 beds . <p> If the EMR market were high school , you might say Epic was winning the popularity contest and was just voted king of the promagain . <p> Enter Siemens With Siemens , Cerner will have the largest U.S. market share of any vendor : 1,132 acute care hospitals . They will also take that distinction away from Epic , who took it away from MEDITECH only last year . <p> The tag " largest market share " makes for a nice press release , but the big question is where things will go from here . After all , does n't  the popular saying go , " When you are at the top , there is only one way left to go " ? <p> On the one hand , " down " is almost inevitable . Siemens has been losing market share , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any customer departures . <p> On the other hand , Cerner could win over the Siemens customers that have been gazing at the exit door . Last year , 15 hospitals left Siemens . Only 2 of them switched to Cerner , and that was due to acquisitions by Cerner health systems . Most other switchers went to Epic . <p> If Cerner can build meaningful relationships with existing Siemens customers and demonstrate a realistic path for transition , they may see some success . And Cerner has a few things going for them : <p> Larger Siemens customers might find some appeal in the flexibility of Cerners offerings . Both vendors have a reputation for more open , mainstream technology . <p> Recent Siemens buyers tend to be smaller and more cost conscious . Two-thirds of current Siemens hospitals are under 200 beds .

( See our new report comparing the two vendors ) ( Currently available only on the myKLAS app : http : //bit.ly/myKLASapp ) . <p> In the End As my colleague Jon Christensen noted , Cerner faces an uphill battle . Historically , many big HIT mergers have been branded failures , and even some of the most successful were optimistically described as distractions . KLAS is currently speaking with Cerner and Siemens customers to find out their opinions , expectations , and plans . <p> I , of course , do n't  know what will happen , but I find this merger to be novel in that it is not being made in desperation . Cerner is a relevant player with or without Siemens . Personally , with this merger , I see less of what we at KLAS call " magical thinking " : Cerner does n't  seem to be claiming that a single stroke from a Wall Street pen will save both companies ( and all of healthcare as a side effect ) .

@@101582633 @5782633/ <h> Healthcare Security Maturity ? <p> 11 May 16 by Trisha Alexander 0 views <p> It is common to hear that healthcare is lagging behind financial services and other industries when it comes to information security . Unfortunately , it is also common to hear of patient health information breaches , phishing attacks on hospitals , and compromised personal health information . The frequency of these attacks and the lagging industry do not make for a great combination when it comes to patients feeling secure regarding their information and the realization that their information can easily be used in a multitude of compromising ways . As KLAS has delved into healthcare security research , we have found many interesting points about the state of security in the United States . One thing that has become evident very early on is that hospitals across the country are in drastically different phases of their security life cycle . <p> Weve spoken to healthcare facilities where security is not yet a conversation at the board level . One CIO said that her administration preferred to " keep their heads in the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security breaches would happen to them . Another CISO reported that his budget for security has tripled in the past year , that he meets regularly with his administration , and that the conversation around security is a regular agenda item at the board meetings each month . <p> While one CISO will sing the praises of a data loss prevention ( DLP ) system and the successes from having it in place , another CISO will tell us that he cant see the value of a DLP system because he ca n't hire enough resources to properly maximize the offering of the system . One CISO will tell us that his anomalous-behavior software is key in his security strategy , and another will express her concerns about being able to adequately train her staff to not click on phishing email links . The next CIO will tell us that the organization is desperate to hire a CISO but cant find an applicant that is available for the position . While the concerns are varied , the reality is that the risks are high , and healthcare leaders are facing numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there seem to be resources available to determine life-cycle positioning and lots of great advisory firms available to assist with everything from risk audits to road-map development , it does not seem that there is currently a widely accepted or utilized model . <p> Staffing , budgets , focus , time , tools , and expertise are just some of the criteria that differentiate the maturity of hospitals and health systems regarding healthcare IT security . The frequency of attacks and the increasing regulations surrounding HIPAA and government-regulated compliance continue to bring focus to the need for action in the healthcare IT security arena . <p> As we continue our HIT security research , we will work with healthcare providers to categorize provider organizations into levels of maturity and establish a checklist of what is necessary for the varying levels of maturity . This checklist , our focused research on innovative vendors that are helping make organizations feel more secure , and a look at core clinical vendors that align their security strategies with their healthcare clients will all be part of the extensive report we are co-publishing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 2017 .

@@101582635 @5782635/ <h> Top Ten Ways to Avoid EMR Implementation Potholes <p> 09 Jul 15 by Mike Smith 0 views <p> For KLAS recent report , Implementation Potholes 2015 : How to Smooth Out the Ride , we interviewed healthcare providers , vendors , and consultants to determine which EMR vendors provide the smoothest implementations and which potholes each of the vendors clients can expect . For access to the report and to see how each of the vendors perform , click here. * <p> As part of the report , we asked what best practices providers should employ to make the transition as smooth as possible . Our top ten findings are below : <p> Keep It Safe : Providers suggest that implementers consider going over their organization 's weaknesses with their vendor to facilitate an implementation-safe environment . Discussing organization weaknesses will encourage the vendor to open up about their own weaknesses and potential pitfalls that may arise during the implementation . <p> Measure Progress and Concerns : Another way to encourage open discussion with vendors is to provide consistent feedback on their performance in the form of score-cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Remember No Vendor Can Transform You : Vendors repeatedly stress to KLAS that they cant transform an unwilling organization . They stress that an attitude of change within an organization is essential for a smooth transition . Proceeding in an implementation without complete buy-in at all levels of the organization is a mess waiting to happen . Often , organizations can have an attitude of rushing to hit deadlines . Attitudes like this set organizations up for failure . <p> Set the Right Timelines : Vendors need to help providers understand how the organization will run differently because of an implementation project , and that understanding takes time . Timelines can be the enemy when the project is centered on hitting deadlines and not adopting true change . A better attitude is to plan to go live only when the organization is truly ready . <p> Remember the Past : Firms also stress the necessity of taking an honest look at the past successes and failures of an organization and vendor . Taking this perspective helps both organizations and vendors develop realistic expectations of what the end result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successes and failures an organization has had in the past can show providers where they are likely to succeed or fail in the future and allows organizations the opportunity to address potential issues . <p> Know Your Vendor : Understanding what a vendor can and can not do in regard to an implementation sets realistic expectations for what the implementation process will be like . It is also important to take a close look at the capabilities and limitations of the system being implemented . <p> Engagement at All Levels and Especially Engage the Brain : Utilizing the most informed and knowledgeable person in an organization can go a long way toward preventing pitfalls in an implementation . Organizations need to find the bandwidth to allow this person to commit to the implementation as his or her full-time responsibility . Also ensure that the chosen resource is the most knowledgeable about the system . <p> Engage Middle Management : Providers must create and maintain a safe environment for the vendor to alert them when they see issues with the competency of middle management and encourage vendors to not only raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is creating problems . The middle manager may just be in the wrong role for the specific implementation . Middle management must be bought in to the new systems and processes because they are probably the ones who created the processes and workflows being replaced . There will be sensitive egos , but getting middle management on board is crucial . If an implementation falls apart anywhere , it is usually with middle management because they designed the processes that are being replaced . <p> Transform the Organization from the Top Down : Although CEOs and CFOs may have had a role in getting a new system live , when it comes to the implementation and training , many organizations find a correlation between the executive teams involvement and the implementations success . Beyond just testing of the system by frontline providers , it is important to make sure the intricacy of the system is felt all the way up to the top . Executives should experience the training before the rest of the organization . Having the executives experience the training firsthand prevents the thinking that good enough is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the end users as the executives would want it to be for themselves . <p> Bring In a Third Party : Providers who have a firm playing a significant role in their implementation rate their overall satisfaction with their core EMR vendor five points higher ( on average ) than those who do n't  utilize a third-party firm . These firms are often involved in providing key leadership , tools and methodology , and a team of consultants . While third-party firms at times slow down implementations and increase overall costs , they increase the likelihood of seamless and successful go-lives.

Today , the vendors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vendors that are most and least effective to work with . <p> To capture a vendor perspective for the October 2015 Interoperability Study , we invited 15 EMR vendors to answer 13 questions . The 10 vendors that participated were the following : <p> *RelayHealth and Cerner ( Siemens ) responded with their respective parent companies . <p> In addition to specifically voting on peers that were most and least effective to work with , the vendors described the toughest industry challenges ; rated the potential future benefits of interoperability associations , standards , and initiatives ( including FHIR , The Sequoia Project , and CommonWell ) ; and described or listed their most successful interoperable clients . There was great agreement with provider responses on many of the questions , especially on the topics of interoperability issues and obstacles facing the industry . <p> What are you expecting to see as we list the EMR vendors voted the most and least effective to work with by their peers ? To be abundantly clear , we must note that one of the ten vendors that participated did not answer this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered in some depth , although one vendor simply answered " CommonWell members " as easiest to work with and " non-CommonWell members " as the most difficult . That response appeared to be a more future-focused response since that vendor had no live CommonWell connections as a backdrop . <p> Drum roll , please . . . Epic received four of ten votes as the most effective vendor to connect with , and Greenway was next with two of ten votes . Allscripts , athenahealth , eClinicalWorks , GE , McKesson , and NextGen Healthcare had one vote each , leaving Cerner and MEDITECH with no votes . Epics win was a surprise as those competitors with little public affinity for Epic tagged them as effective to work with . One stated , " Epic is technically highly capable and responsive , " and another said , " Epic has established communications protocols . " <p> MEDITECH had five of nine votes as the least effective vendor to work with , while Cerner got three of nine votes . eClinicalWorks had two votes , and Epic and GE each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three vendors describes MEDITECHs challenge : " MEDITECH does not support nearly the same level of data exchange or standards as other vendors do . " <p> Does this kind of measurement actually provide new information ? We find that it clarifies what was previously an unknown . Perceptions , rumors , media shout-outs , and even EMR vendor presentations that tee up perceptions or outright claims about their competitors can muddy the water so that the truth is lost and emotion based on misinformation plays a role in critical decisions . I thank those vendors that had the courage to anonymously say what is not said publicly . <p> NOTE : Next week we will focus on provider perceptions of EMR vendors that the providers do n't  actually work with .

While the pace of change varies in different communities , healthcare organizations must be proactive or risk being left behind . The transformation in how providers deliver and are paid for services is , and will continue to be , challenging .

Or is it a ploy to save money , guarantee a quiet adult evening , enjoy all the food for ourselves , and/or abuse our children ? It may be a stretch , but this parenting example seems similar to the outcry about data blocking , hoarding , and a self-serving unwillingness to share data and related proposals on how to penalize offenders . <p> The 2015 interoperability questionnaire encouraged providers to clarify any unwillingness to share . When isolated , there are many reasons for data blocking . Participants made it clear that they do n't  see their vendors hoarding data or inhibiting the sharing of patient records . Hoarding is willingly refusing to share data . Providers overwhelmingly report that their vendors want to share , but business revenue models and a lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the competitive nature of the U.S. market forces vendors to meet or exceed their competitors sharing capabilities . <p> The irony of the accusations against vendors is apparent when we look at the willingness of providers to share with each other , especially their competitors . 98% of providers declare they are willing to share , while only 82% report that their main competitor is similarly willing . The bottom line : 18% of participants think their competitor is data blocking and is not willing to share . At least one solution supersedes a providers ability to block the sharing of data . One CareEverywhere client , a physician who also serves as an executive , described the experience with CareEverywhere : " I smile when I treat a patient from outside our organization and I can easily pull in his or her full fidelity record . Our competitor is on Epic , and despite our CEOs desire to keep us isolated , there is a lot of clinical information flowing back and forth . In fact , we measure daily the number of records moving back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal . " Its worth noting that the increase in capability and adoption around CommonWell and the Carequality interoperability framework ( The Sequoia Project ) appears to be heading toward unrestrained sharing , and the 2016 interoperability study should add clarity . It is worth noting that a majority of providers do not expect efforts such as CommonWell or the Sequoia Project to , by themselves , bring significant value to future interoperability , but energy is growing . <p> Sadly , small physician practices are those being penalized most for data blocking and are creating the biggest sharing hurdles . A typical smaller practice loves to get patient records ( e.g. lab results , radiology results , TOC documents , etc. ) but is much less likely to invest in pushing important patient clinical data out to the other caregivers of their patients . A lack of resources ( time , money , and technical skills ) typically stands in the way of proactively sharing . The effects of this two-edged sword can be expanded as we consider where the government and others with an interest will find ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unwillingness to share and as we consider what these groups will decide can be done about those issues . The key is finding a common perpetrator to redirect so that patient records flow for better care . What if , until more effective connections are available through the collaboration , participants using CommonWell or Carequality opt to delay connections that would have immediate benefits to patient care but would consume time , custom efforts , and other resources ? Is that data blocking ? <p> So what happened with those two boys that went to bed early without dinner ? One , Bruce , became an engineering professor at the University of Utah , the other is Adam , President of KLAS . Will the outcome be as positive when the government looks to force accountability with penalties for data blocking ? Penalties will truly be a two-edged sword . Can the marketplace self-police ?

I remember one specific comment about how wealthy he was and how he was increasing his personal wealth dramatically , thereby expanding his self-indulgence . I caught myself chuckling as I reflected on the Bill Marriott I knew personally . He was an ecclesiastical leader in our community and a global industrial giant . I saw up close how he shared his wealth with many struggling individuals by making efforts to improve the community and by making large donations to major universities . For instance , he donated to the J. Willard Marriott Library at the University of Utah and the Marriott Center ( a 19,000-seat arena ) at Brigham Young University . But nothing said more about his approach to life than his home in Potomac , Maryland . Close to Marriott worldwide headquarters , Bill Marriotts neighborhood was full of exquisite large homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Marriott had many occasions to have church members in his home . Some of those members were just scraping by , and to help them feel at ease , Bill Marriott built a rather simple , ranch-style home . On the outside , Bill Marriott was at times portrayed as an industrial giant , going after all the money he could gather , but others saw the real man , a gentle giant , prone to sharing , almost to a fault . <p> So how does Bill Marriotts situation apply to interoperability ? It applies because there is a public view with a contrasting reality behind it . It is abundantly clear to me that the public perception of what is happening with interoperability is not in line with reality . I have seen many EMR vendors up close and personal , and there is a dramatic variance between vendors . I have had the privilege of debating , discussing , and sharing insights and thoughts with most of these industry senior executives , from Howard Messing at MEDITECH to Jonathan Bush at athenahealthmany would see these leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback from thousands of EMR clients , many of whom I have personally interviewed . And most importantly , I have seen what these vendor executives have declared publicly , compared their statements to what has emerged privately , and seen how that has mapped to their clients reality . <p> I get excited when I see these leaders proactively tackling the interoperability challenges in a public forum , like the KLAS Keystone Summit ( October 2015 ) . I get excited when their actions at forums match their clients perspectives and align with personal conversations . I am especially impressed with a number of EMR vendors that demonstrate great passion as they tackle the barriers to sharing patient records . It goes without saying that there is equally great disappointment when vendors say one thing and their clients report a different story . One vendor reported seeing the error of their ways , and they chose to eliminate inappropriate incentives by removing the corporate revenue objectives around interoperability interfaces . That type of commitment coupled with action is deserving of a high five ! <p> Most painful , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about competing vendors or groups of vendors ( e.g. Bill Marriott is a self-indulgent , money-grabbing industrial giant ) . To avoid the inappropriate focus on a particular circumstance , let me just say that enough is enough . The findings of the 2015 interoperability study are sufficiently specific to clear much of the air . Significant effort was taken to identify whether there is a villain , and there simply is not . Yes , there are challenges and different approaches to tackling those challenges , but our study did not find a sinister plot to prevent the exchange of data . The ongoing discoveries of the 2016 study will allow us to compare the information floating around the market with the reality of what is really happening . <p> It seems appropriate to quote one Keystone Summit participant attempting to simplify efforts and seeing a chance for all to work together : " Once the flow of patient data is ready , the challenge then becomes getting an entire network of users to trust an entirely different network of users .

It would be helpful to the industry if there were a higher level of data-sharing agreements or a minimum standard of data-sharing agreements that everyone could comply with . " <p> If you have n't taken the time to compare your perceptions with the findings of the 2015 interoperability study , you are invited to do so . It may be painful as some of your perceptions may have an emotional foundation . Let us know where KLAS missed the boat , where we were not clear , or where we should have drilled down more . <p> It is time to work together . It is our goal at KLAS to shine a light on what is really happening with interoperability , and the 2016 study will help !

During the past month , at least five healthcare organizations have reported being hit by computer viruses . The frequency with which healthcare cybersecurity breaches occur has caused a shift in urgency among executive teams .

Depending on the source , it is estimated that personal health records are worth 620 times the cost of financial information on the black market . The type of highly personal and sensitive information maintained by the healthcare industry is attractive to and holds great value for cyber attackers , potentially enabling identity theft and medical fraud . For these and many other reasons , healthcare cybersecurity is now an issue that is given attention by not only security officers or directors but also the general public because of the risk of the loss of personal health information that could negatively impact each of us as patients . <p> Government agencies , vendors , and patients alike are taking notice of the increased attention to the cybersecurity landscape and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are facing in trying to protect healthcare information .

Providers who saw a halfhearted effort from their vendor bemoaned the lack of engagement , while those who saw intensity in their vendor partners cheered . Early indicators of vendor commitment or passion may or may not play out in the long run . Is it better to give verbal agreement and not follow through or better to say less and do more ?

So for all the healthcare leaders I work with ( and the ones I do n't  ) , here are a few findings you might have missed this year . <p> -Taylor Davis KLAS Analyst <p> Note : All healthcare providers who are willing to participate with KLAS are able to gain access to the key findings of all public KLAS reports free of monetary charge . Click here to create a KLAS account . <p> Key Finding #1 : Engaging Patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that patient engagement is the wild west of population health and value-based care . Just last week , KLAS published a population health report measuring vendors on the strength of their data aggregation , risk stratification , care management , and patient engagement functionalities . Of the 24 vendors measured , only 1Enlihas more than 75% of their interviewed customers using patient engagement functionalities . In a related report , KLAS found that only 14% of interviewed respondents have an aligned patient engagement strategy with oversight from administrative and/or clinical leadership . As this industry shifts quickly toward value-based care , might the tools , processes , and methods for motivating patients to engage in healthy living become more valuable than the skillset required to perform a heart transplant ? <p> In KLAS first ever health-data security report , we interviewed CISOs and other C-level leaders to understand which vendors are being used to protect healthcare data . Over 150 vendors were identified , and over 70% of organizations reported using 4 or more vendors to ensure the security of their data . With millions of dollars being spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect healthcare information , many CISOs pointed out a disturbing fact : it only takes one incompetent employee to create a data breach of front-page proportions . <p> Anyone who has moved their family across the country knows that good professional movers can save you an incalculable amount of pain , frustration , and strained muscles . Similarly , most healthcare providers who have engaged with a managed services or consulting services firm in their transition to value-based care report that the money has been well spent . Lumeris , Valence , and Evolent Health all receive high marks from customers , who report improvements in their ability to deliver on the Triple Aim of healthcare . Who is the right fit for you ? While several of these firms deliver great results , the roads they take with customers are very different . Matching their strengths to your needs is critical when selecting a firm to help you move safely to value-based care . <p> And the 2014 Best in KLAS Award in the community HIS market goes to MEDITECH . . . with a score of 73.7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest satisfaction option is a 73.7 , providers are calling for better options . Since January , MEDITECH has released 6.1 , athenahealth has acquired RazorInsights , CPSI has acquired Healthland , and Epic and Cerner have continued to gain market share . The race is on , and the stakes are high for many community hospitals ; a failed EMR implementation is often the first step toward consolidation . <p> When we kicked off our interoperability study this year , it quickly became evident that very few people knew who led the market with regard to interoperability . For instance , the vendor whom providers perceived to be the weakest on interoperability ( Epic ) was actually a top performer when we measured experience instead of perception . Clarity provides an incentive for vendors to improve , and no vendor is close to a state of real interoperability maturity . In order to strengthen future measures , KLAS convened the Keystone Summit in October , and there a broad group of vendor CEOs and provider CIOs and CMIOs agreed by consensus to an objective measure for interoperability success going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the view of the clinician : are clinicians able to access outside records with the delivery , display , breadth , and usability that will really improve patient care ? To answer these questions , we will be turning to providers like you in 2016 . <p> If you judge the strength of a patient portal by the adoption rate , it turns out that some vendor bases are much stronger because they have dramatically higher adoption rates . Organizations using portals from Medfusion , athenahealth , Epic , or eClinicalWorks see patient adoption rates of over 20% , in some cases having over four times the adoption of organizations using other products . Differences in portal functionality , interoperability , and vendor support are dramatic . It is no surprise that 23% of customers interviewed wish they had purchased a different product or are actively planning to move . <p> It is clear that providers are quickly being pushed to become " payviders , " or provider-owned health plans that act as both payer and provider . As your organization jumps into becoming a payer , what tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for a whole new world of tools and vendors as you adopt functionality for claims administration , member engagement , quality analytics , claims editing , utilization management , and more . But be carefulour very first look into this market made it clear that there are very real differences in satisfaction and outcomes depending on the solutions that payviders adopt . <p> There are a staggering number of things that can wrong with an EMR implementation . And with nearly 1,300 U.S. hospitalsand tens of thousands of international hospitalsusing legacy EMR solutions or still using paper , KLAS published an implementation potholes report detailing the most common implementation failures and best practices by vendor . Whether it is the importance of finding the brain behind your revenue cycle solution or putting your executives through the clinical training first , learn a lesson from past failures as you take steps toward a successful go-live of your own . <p> Collaboration between customers on the same enterprise solution can be incredibly beneficial .

Clearly the story on global EMR adoption is still far from written . <p> In this years BI report , providers pointed to Dimensional Insight and Health Catalyst as the two vendors who help the most in delivering great insights and outcomes . The surprise ? Neither of these vendors is known for having the strongest BI product , but both are leaders at helping organizations use their tools .

The agent would search available flights , seats , rental cars , and hotels . Your paper ticket could be picked up or mailed to you . That piece of paper got you a paper boarding pass after you stood in line . If you accidentally lost your boarding pass or left it in the seat-back pocket of your first flight , you were stuck and had to rebuy the ticket for the next leg of your flight since your original boarding pass could be used by anyone to claim the original seat . Now you go online and find the flight , seat , hotel , and car you want . Your itinerary , boarding passes , reservation confirmations , notices of delays , and upgrades appear magically on your iPhone , including weather information , great places to eat , and the closest gas stations . So much for the good ol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interoperability ? <p> Our October 2015 interoperability findings confirmed that 91% of providers participating in information exchange were exchanging patient records with outside organizations . About three-quarters of those were pushing records ( TOC documents ) to others , typically in the form of CCDs . One third reported they were actually requesting and pulling records that were potentially consumed by their resident EMR . Now , what does " consumed " really mean ? That is the rest of this story , and it ties to our travel agent analogy . It would be terrific to have electronic records how , when , and where needed with appropriate peripheral information as desired . The reality is that faxing is the primary way that records are exchanged today . The move to electronic sharing is typically found in the use of the CCD , which is considered a step up from faxing , even with the complaints around the context and size of the document . Consuming the appropriate information is a challenge whether the information comes as discrete data or in a CCD . <p> In a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you , the relevant part of a patients record would show up in the doctors workflow at the right time . We are not even close to that yet , but there is progress , and some vendors are leading out as they facilitate the absorption and review of outside relevant clinical patient data . Cerner and Epic are the most proactive as described by their respective clients . The ability to parse a CCD and select allergies , medications , and so forth that can be absorbed into or replace an existing element within the EMR is of solid , ongoing value even though it is a manual activity on the front end . One Cerner client clarifies by stating , " There is a tool within the Cerner system . . . that combines CCDs by pulling them apart and bringing them back together in a logical view , no matter where the CCD came from . The Cerner workflow brings in the CCD so that the clinician can actually move medications from the CCD over to the medication list and the allergies to the allergy profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a doctor sees a patient , there is a notification that there is new outside data .

The users are asked what they would like to replace , add , or discard . The doctors can promote things or demote things . All CCDs from any other vendors EMR get treated equally . " athenahealth clients do n't  have the same utility for consuming CCD elements but confirm great value in the utility and placement of electronic faxes for ease of use by the clinician . <p> Electronic consumption described by clients of most EMR vendors ( such as eClinicalWorks , GE , Greenway , McKesson , and NextGen Healthcare ) is simply the practical placement of a pointer within the patient chart to the PDF or other icon relating to the CCD ( we have specific data regarding this on Allscripts and Cerner Siemens ) . A MEDITECH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The system comes up with a little flag that says there is external medical data available . When that flag is clicked on , the system displays a formatted C-CDA .

" <p> This approach is comparable to an electronic picture of the old-fashioned ticket in our travel analogyyou know , the one that was about the size of an IBM punch cardand for good reason.that is where the dimension started . Yes , vendors are taking steps in the right direction . The progress is picking up steam .

Although I get asked about many EMRs and market trends , there is no doubt that an energy hot spot is the two new acute care EMR market entrants : athenahealth and eClinicalWorks . Ill be talking through some provider FAQs and our research thus far around these two vendors and their acute care EMRs.Provider Question #1 : How did athenahealth and eClinicalWorks enter the acute care EMR market ? athenahealth officially entered the US acute care EMR market by acquiring RazorInsights in mid-January 2015 , followed by the purchase of webOMR ( the EMR platform developed by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ) just a few weeks later . Through these acquisitions , athenahealth brought on approximately two dozen hospital customers ( former RazorInsights hospital customers ) and has been signing new hospital customers since then . The go-forward inpatient product ( which customers report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application on the athenahealth platform ) is called athenaOne for Hospitals and Health Systems . eClinicalWorks officially entered the US acute care EMR market in early 2016 with the formal announcement of the partnership with Tidelands Health . This announcement builds upon eClinicalWorks previous inpatient EMR installs internationally . The inpatient product , called eClinicalWorks 10i , is self-developed and built ( not acquired ) . Since this announcement , there have been other hospitals that have signed with eClinicalWorks , and many others that have inquired about eClinicalWorks inpatient product and its progress in the market.Provider Question #2 : How many hospitals have purchased athenahealths and eClinicalWorks acute care EMRs ? Every year , KLAS validates the hospitals that contracted for a new EMR in the previous calendar year and reports the findings . The most recent report published reflects all contracts signed in the 2015 calendar year . In 2015 , KLAS validated that 24 hospitals signed a contract for athenaOne for Hospitals and Health Systems , and 2 hospitals signed a contract for eClinicalWorks 10i . KLAS is currently in the process of validating contracts that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we cant disclose specific numbers until the official publication of the report ( scheduled for early 2017 ) , we can state that there has been much activity impacting the acute care EMR market share of both of these vendors.Provider Question #3 : Which types and sizes of hospitals are considering these vendors , and what are some of providers reasons for doing so ? The large majority of athenahealths new hospital contracts are coming from hospitals with fewer than 50 beds ( with the announced partnership with University of Toledo Medical Center being the largest ) . As KLAS has validated and interviewed these hospitals that have recently contracted with athenahealth , many providers have pointed to athenahealths unique cost structure ( % of collections ) , innovative web-based architecture , and solid reputation in the market around revenue cycle as drivers for consideration . For eClinicalWorks , although fewer contracts were signed in 2015 , the hospitals that did so were more diverse in size , ranging from small to around 300 beds . Early insights from these customers noted that the total-cost-of-ownership comparisons , initial physician feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for being and innovator and developer were all in eClinicalWorks favor . Here at KLAS , we look forward to watching the activity surrounding these vendors in the acute care EMR market space and validating their performance as they continue to mature .

It was good advice . To remedy the situation , we could either up our game and get our new offering ( the steak ) to match the sizzle , or we could tone down our promotion ( the sizzle ) until the program was worthy of greater hype .

Tons of vendors join the alliance , but I do n't know what any of them are doing to promote interoperability . The CommonWell Health Alliance is still a question mark for me .

Sizzle creates anticipation and even a bit of mouth-watering , but you cant chew and swallow it . So , when the cooking is done and the steak is truly delivered , will the taste of the steak match the excitement of the sizzle ? For the sake of the committed vendors and excited providers , I certainly hope so , and KLAS looks forward to measuring actual satisfaction with the meal .

A similarly thrilling opportunity to watch great leaders in action just occurred as the result of vendor CEOs urging KLAS to carry a symbolic Swiss flag by helping speed up the development of real interoperability ( IO ) . Two major events opened the door to the opportunity to watch these most senior vendor executives in action : the 2015 KLAS Keystone Summit ( held October 12 at Zermatt Resort , Midway , Utah ) and the KLAS IO Study ( which became available October 17 in partnership with the CHIME Fall Forum ) .

We now face imminent legislationwith measurements , rewards , and punishmentsaimed at ensuring that the mega government investment in electronic records bears the promised IO fruit .

What motivated each executive to participate ? Was it a pure focus on knocking down IO barriers ? Did they show up to appear committed ? Did they think their KLAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to rub shoulders with their peers ? The real question is how they felt in their hearts .

Tag me as an idealist , but I still think we have hearts and can make miracles happen . <p> While the Summit timing was right , continuing courage , tenacity , and unity from CEOs will be the keys to moving the agreed-upon actions forward . My previous blog said the Summit was either a United Nations ( a Marc Probst analogy ) or a Continental Congress ( my visual ) . Getting 12 highly competitive super senior executives together to agree on anything would seem to require a miracle , yet the October Summit , orchestrated by providers , culminated with unanimity around a measurement tool and approach to really measure progress . <p> The story began in early 2015 , when key vendor CEOs and presidents committed to attend the Summit , including : <p> Each CEO/presidents commitment to attend was given and taken seriously .

The morning of the conference , 10 of the 12 committed vendor executives were there . One had a serious family emergency , understandably canceling at the last second . The other missing CEO decided a new business opportunity superseded the commitment . The 36 provider executives participated enthusiastically , cheering their vendors engagement or bemoaning their vendors lack of energy or attendance . These providers invested their time and energy , without compensation , to make a difference , and they counted on their vendor to do the same . The Summit concluded like a Continental Congress : highly motivated , competitive leaders came up with a unified solution . Let 's see what happens next .

JoAnn learned the hard way about her own breast density that had been limiting the effectiveness of her regular mammograms . She was surprised to learn of the term " dense breast " and was saddened that she had not heard this term before . As one could imagine , she began to research how various densities of breast tissue affect the results of mammograms . Frustration transformed into passion , and her efforts to make a change forced results . JoAnn decided it was time for a new path and cofounded the advocacy group DENSE ( Density Education National Survivors Effort ) . The primary focus of the organization is to cause awareness and notify and educate women about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with her team and supporting healthcare providers by creating a patient brochure , a risk checklist , and other education materials .

When I think of modern-day warriors , many come to mind . Many are needed . Warriors are needed to not only share the message but also provide quality healthcare , develop technology , and manufacture solid equipment . In addition , coming together will continue to help promote and provide quality healthcare for patients like JoAnn . Pick up a pink sword and join the crusade in your own way .

When I arrived at the doctors office 20 minutes late for my scheduled appointment and they still accepted me in , I was quite pleased . The fact that my doctors visit for a skin condition only took 15 minutes made me even more excited . That aura stayed with me for a little more than a month . Then I was impressed even further when the bill came in the mail and was for less than $50 . I can still remember that day last November when I told my wife we would probably have a little extra money for Christmas . Little did I know that I was wrong . A couple of weeks later , there came an unwelcome surprise , what I 'll call a mystery bill . Yes , another bill , unexpected and separate from the first one . It was for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $500 is n't toobad when it comes to healthcare , or at least , that 's what we 've been trained to think . That training , maybe better termed as history or expectation of how things supposedly work in healthcare , is not good . Ill even say that , from a consumer standpoint , it 's incorrect . Perhaps you or someone you know well can relate to the healthcare " mystery bill . " Its not fun . I do n't  know anybody who is a fan of a mystery bill . Fueled by a mission to create transparency and improve healthcare , we at KLAS have put research muscle and investment into the emerging market of price transparency solutions . The goal in this space is simple : vendor solutions should help empower the consumer to compare and shop for healthcare services , thus helping to facilitate an open and competitive pricing market . That competition and transparency should ( over time ) drive healthcare services to a pricing equilibrium , thus resulting in more knowledge , better options , and eventually better outcomes for consumers . Contrast that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for healthcare services are often foreign concepts . And though KLAS will soon have a published report about the effectiveness of vendor solutions in this spaceincluding those used by providers , payers , and consumersit all starts and ends with consumers . That means it starts with you and me . So next time you need to schedule an appointment or a service with a doctor , take the initiative to ask what the pricing will be . Be bold and ask about the quality of the service and other patient reviews . You might be taken aback by what you hear or even by what you do n't  hear . Either way , that 's how we start to carve the mystery out of that mystery bill .

Over the last few years , RFAsor requests for anythinghave become a reasonably common occurrence when healthcare organizations are looking for a healthcare IT vendor solution in the complex areas of population health and value-based care . <p> Healthcare organizations who have never tackled population health management before , and are therefore unsure as to what they might need in a new vendor platform , often incorporate any and all population health requirements they can think of into their RFA . <p> If I were in their shoes , jumping into population health and value-based care for the first time , I think I 'd do the same thing . <p> To some vendors , a population health RFA is exciting . They see it as an opportunity to provide everythingi.e. , sell more product . In the words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an opportunity to " sell new consulting services and make it up as you go . " To these vendors , RFAs look , smell , and feel like a potentially large sale . To other vendors , RFAs are alarming . They are a warning flag . A discouragement . These vendors know they wo n't be able to deliver the full solution being requested and are worried about the client 's success , not their own . <p> Cheers to the latter vendors . They are few and far between . <p> The RFA worries us at KLAS . The need for HIT platforms that deliver in the population health space is increasingly evident , and the search for them is very real . In new research KLAS is doing on healthcare IT vendor practices and approaches , one factor stands out more than any other in distinguishing high-performing vendors from the rest of the pack , and its not something we expected . <p> It 's a sales approach that is extremely disciplined and customer-success focused . Sounds simple , but it 's not . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big sales quota staring him or her in the face . <p> But our research tells us that the healthcare vendors who are the strongest performers and are viewed most favorably by their clients on a long-term basis are those who will not sell something unless they know for certain they will be able to fully deliver it . <p> Which brings us back to RFAs . <p> Over the last several years , the way some vendors have responded to RFAs has been a bit frightening and has led the population health IT market to its current state of largely unfulfilled needs and unmet expectations . This in turn has shifted population health toward becoming a replacement market . <p> In an upcoming population health report , KLAS will be reporting on these shifts and on how vendors are responding to them .

@@101582692 @5782692/ <h> Patient Portal Adoption : From 5% to 20% and Beyond <p> 12 May 15 by Colin Buckley 0 views <p> Patient access to clinical data is one of the most difficult-to-achieve aspects of meaningful use . Currently , only 5% of patients are required to be accessing data , but with meaningful use Stage 3 looming , the impending demands of payment reform , and the anticipated benefits of patient engagement in the value-based-care world , many providers are ramping up their patient portal efforts and are getting adoption rates well north of 20% . <p> Aside from helping to appease government regulators and maximize reimbursements , patient portals can have a very real effect on patient care . A recent New York Times article entitled " The Healing Power of Your Own Medical Records " cited the following about patients who were given access to physician notes : " In a yearlong evaluation project at medical groups in three states , more than two-thirds of the patients reported having a better understanding of their health and medical conditions , adopting healthier habits , and taking their medications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits patient portals can provide to both patients and healthcare organizations , KLAS recently published a report entitled " Patient Portals 2015 : Adoption beyond Meaningful Use . " For this report , we interviewed 186 healthcare providers to find out which vendors are best meeting current needs while also developing solutions for a more strategic tomorrow . <p> We asked providers what best practices for patient portal adoption they would pass along to other providers trying to improve their rates . The following are their suggestions : <p> 1 . Educate patients " What contributes to adoption is educating our patients about the portal , helping them sign up , and encouraging them to use it . But education is key . Patients have embraced the portal and use it for much of our communication , bill pay , results review , and more . " <p> 2 . Educate patientsagain and again " We ask patients on the phone whether they have signed up for the portal , and at their appointments we check to see whether they have filled things out on the portal . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have put their information on the portal . We promote the portal five or six times . On their way out , the doctors tell the patients that they are going to send their results to the portal . " <p> 3 . Educate staff members as if they were patients " The patients get inundated and get tired of hearing it , but it was the kickoff that got everybody in the practice used to pushing the portal . We also made everyone here register on the portal to see what the patients would go through and so we could make changes and adjustments to fit our needs . It is an ongoing process , and we try to do contests every quarter . That is what contributes to our success , and it is pretty impressive . " <p> 4 . Give patients a reason to use the portal " We are apparently doing something right in encouraging patients to come to our portal . They come to the portal to fill out the patient history and the medication list . I think that is because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they present the portal to the patients . They tell them that we can give them less waiting time when they come in if they get on the portal . We have an aggressive sign-up process . We give patients a Chromebook in the waiting room and help them sign up for the portal right away . We have a similar process in the ED and inpatient areas . We try to push as much content to the portal as possible . " <p> 5 . Talk to your vendor and physicians " We drove adoption from the top down . In our initial phase , the adoption did n't  go well because we thought we knew what we were doing and could do it ourselves . We went back and listened to Medfusion . We took the portal to the doctors who understand technology . They came back from a CMS meeting and said we had to do the portal . They said we might not like it , but we have to do it . " <p> 6 . Hold your vendor accountable " When we started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges and barriers with the physician group . The physicians really wanted to yank the product out ; they did n't  want anything to do with it . They were beyond frustrated . We worked with MEDSEEK and the physicians , and in the last year and a half , we went from having a handful of patients on the portal to having 65,000 . We were finally able to leverage the solution in the ambulatory space after we made changes to the product and the interface . There were deal breakers in how the product looked and felt from a patient perspective , and we worked through those .

" <p> I admit to using the term accountable care loosely , but the University of Utah is accomplishing accountable care end goals of lower cost and sustainability in a way that most health systems are not . Typically , providers top HIT priority for accountable care is population health management . The idea is that by keeping patients healthy and outside of the hospital , providers will lower the volume of demand for costly healthcare services . Providers will then receive a portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an ideal way to lower costs while improving patients health , but patients are difficult to engage , progress is difficult to track , and so far , success has eluded many . According to The Brookings Institute article , " Year One Results from Medicare Shared Savings Program : What It Means Going Forward , " results from the first group of Medicare ACOs shows that only 29 of 114 qualified for shared savings bonuses . <p> Contrast this with the less traveled path the University of Utah has taken to lower the cost of the supply of healthcare . They use data to manage costs at a detailed level and thus become more efficient . According to Kaiser Health News , " In the first year , the system shaved nearly $2.5 million from a $1 billion budget , and officials say they 're in a better position to negotiate with insurers because they know precisely how much it costs to perform a particular procedure . " <p> Its interesting how the University of Utah is reversing roles so the provider is the one offering shared savings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trod this same path ? Because its hard . Information systems for patient accounting , medical records , ERP , and so forth werent designed , implemented , or integrated with this in mind . Data warehouses and analytics tools can help bring it all together , but they are expensive and time consuming . Furthermore , some of the leading enterprise BI vendors are having trouble transitioning from being generic tool-set suppliers to being guiding partners in solving healthcare-specific problems . <p> On top of all that , the financial incentives that would make investment in data systems worthwhile are uncertain or lacking . In todays fee-for-service ( FFS ) world , much inefficiency can be made up for with increased patient volumes . In addition , most accountable care reimbursement schemes still have FFS at their core , and shared savings bonuses are based on the payers bottom line , not the providers . <p> In the meantime , we are fortunate that the analogy of Frosts poem does not apply in one sense : healthcare providers are not at a single either/or crossroads that will lock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both population health and cost analytics paths along with a growing network of other trails .

Having them agree on an interoperability measurement tool was a second miracle . And having them embrace an actual , transparent measurement of the current state and trajectory of interoperability in order to stave off unneeded and ill-advised government intervention , thereby allowing the private sector to self-manage , would be a third miracle . Will the new interoperability measurement be a dead end or a collaboration of powerful competitors that makes a big difference ? <p> Marc Probst , CIO at Intermountain Healthcare , referred to the Summit outcome as impressive , yet potentially similar to the United Nations . I agree with his assessment of this possible outcome , seeing the UN as an august body with great intentions that fails to achieve much of anything . The description and concern remind me of when in 1997 , as the first member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a letter from a good friend and former boss , Larry Grandia ( also an Intermountain Healthcare CIO ) , admiring my intention to do good while cautioning that KLAS would likely not succeed in measuring IT vendors .

I am confident there is room in this industry for vendors to collaborate and do good by thinking outside the box , working with each other , and truly breaking down the barriers to sharing patient records . I see the KLAS Keystone Summitled by Micky Tripathi , Stan Huff , MD , Daniel Nigrin , MD , and John Halamka , MD , and attended by 12 competitive vendors and 36 provider executivesas more like the Continental Congress , a conglomeration of mini-nations that did n't  like each other in many cases but were willing to collaborate in the interest of the whole .

The value of the Keystone Summit will be determined by how well the vendors put aside differences for the benefit of each one of us , as we saw them do on October 1 and 2. 
@@101582696 @5782696/ <h> Middle East Successes , Challenges and Trends <p> 14 Oct 15 by Jeremy Goff 0 views <p> Several months ago , KLAS visited the Middle East region . Over the course of five days , we were fortunate enough to have site visits across Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) with nine healthcare provider organizations using several different EMR solutions ( Cerner , Epic , InterSystems ) . Our provider friends not only were very welcoming hosts but also detailed many of their successes , challenges , and future trends regarding the delivery of healthcare in their organizations and the impact of their IT vendors and solutions . Here are just a few highlights from some of the conversations we had . <p> SUCCESSES <p> One provider organization reported a successful 911 month rollout of InterSystems TrakCare that included CPOE , LIS , OR , inpatient pharmacy , ADT , scheduling , and registration functionality . This same organization reported many measurable benefits they have already attained from the rollout , including a decreased length of stay because of automated reminders that remind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live on Cerner reported very high-level integration with the pharmacy and medication administration systems , including the integration of a large number of Alaris pumps with the system . With the help of Omnicell , this organization will also be able to define the cost of unit doses . That will be particularly helpful when the supply changes from order to order . <p> A provider organization that chose Epic mentioned the vendor was living up to one of the reasons they were chosen in the first placetheir proven implementation methodology . <p> CHALLENGES <p> More local support . Universally , almost all providers mentioned that they expect more local support from their EMR vendors . While some vendors , like Cerner , have made significant investments in the region , providers still feel the pinch of not having enough feet on the ground . This is amplified by feedback from providers in both countries ( Saudi Arabia and the UAE ) that finding their own internal qualified resources is also a major issue . <p> Globalization of software . Providers would like vendors to pay more attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices . This not only helps make the software more usable but also proves the vendors dedication to the region . While several InterSystems and Cerner clients did mention some country-specific functionality , they still want to see more . <p> Infrastructure . Most providers mention that lagging infrastructure has been a challenge for their new implementation and EMR upgrade pursuits . When underestimated , acquisition costs and supply chain constraints that affect how quickly the technology can be implemented become huge liabilities to the success of a project . <p> Interoperability . The struggle for interoperability is clearly a global problem . Providers in the Middle East report challenges accessing information from other organizations that are running different systems . Providers report difficulties exchanging information between different acute care facilities within the same organization , but they also have problems with ambulatory-to-acute care interoperability . <p> FUTURE TRENDS <p> Increased patient engagement . One IT leader said , " Patients expect high quality of care and feel it is an entitlement . " They are also asking for access . Most providers feel a sense of urgency to deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time that they roll out an EMR . It appears the acceleration of these technologies will be faster than it has been in the U.S. market . <p> Enterprise content management . Even the providers that have implemented electronic medical records still have many years of paper documents that need to be captured and utilized as part of the electronic record . <p> Business intelligence/analytics . Many of the providers we met with are only using very basic reporting that generally comes from the EMR vendor . Most , however , mentioned the need to leverage analytics as a critical " next step " in their organizations electronic journey .

After a year , have emotions died down enough to write a blog comparing EMRs to the troubled launch of healthcare.gov ? I hope so , but if your first reaction to the title above is " How are those two things different ? ! They 're both destroying America ! " then you might want to stop reading . The rest of this will be boring . Its about technology . <p> Amidst all the policy , politics , and controversy surrounding healthcare.gov , some observers noted that the decision to use a NoSQL database contributed to the websites difficulties . The first issue was scalability , but that was a relatively easy " throw-hardware-at-it " problem . A more interesting challenge was the lack of skilled workers with experience in NoSQL programming . <p> In a November 22 , 2013 , article , The New York Times noted , " Another sore point was the Medicare agencys decision to use database @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data differently from systems by companies like IBM , Microsoft and Oracle . CGI officials argued that it would slow work because it was too unfamiliar . Government officials disagreed , and its configuration remains a serious problem " ( " Tension and Flaws before Health Website Crash , " November 22 , 2013 ) . <p> With KLAS having just published a special report on the impact of EMRs underlying technology , the word " unfamiliar " sounded awfully familiar to me . Consider this observation from an Epic customer : <p> The implications of Epic 's complicated system drive a lot of staffing decisions . There are several people who seemed okay with working on our previous system but that can not cut it with Epic . I want to replace a database administrator who does not have a great work ethic , but am hesitant to do so because it is so difficult to find a Cache database administrator . Epic teams need to be so big because it takes more people to run Epic than it does for another system , not because we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just harder to accomplish basic IT maintenance tasks in Epic . <p> Now compare that with this comment from an Allscripts customer : <p> " We hired a database specialist to develop advanced clinical functionality in Allscripts Sunrise Clinical Manager . He was n't familiar with Allscripts , but he is an SQL person , and once he got in here , he just ripped right through it . I thought it would take him a year to familiarize himself with the database , but he was in there within months . He got the hang of it , and he also saw some of the flaws in the logic we had written a long time ago for activations . " <p> There is a war of words going on between the major EMR vendors about the merits and disadvantages of their different technology platforms . To summarize the perceptions . . . <p> 1 . Epic and MEDITECH use databases that can trace their roots all the way back to MUMPS . They are seen as being fast and reliable but also complex and inflexible . <p> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more mainstream technologies ( e.g. , Oracle and Microsoft ) . They are familiar and configurable but slower and less dependable . <p> For many , these differences boil down to two issues : cost and extendibility . These people would say that Allscripts , Cerner , McKesson , and Siemens have the advantage . <p> But if its that simple , why is Epic winning the most market share these days ? And MEDITECH at least holding their own ? Among the other vendors , all but Cerner have been losing market share year after year . <p> The truth is , its not about the technology . Increasingly , providers tell KLAS they dontwant to customize their EMRs any more than they must . They just want their EMRs to work , and they want vendors that will reliably handle development for them . One provider likened EMRs to automobiles : <p> I do n't  think most people care if a car has fuel injection , runs on diesel , or is carbureted . People just want to turn the key on and have the car get them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be something that the geeks want to play with , but the end user does n't  care . That is not to say that technology is n't a factor , but that would be number 999 on a list of 1,000 . <p> To close , here 's an interesting bit of trivia : healthcare.govs ultra-modern NoSQL database has more in common with the decades-old MUMPS platform than a scarcity of experts looking for a job . If you are a geek , catch up on the technical similarities here : " MUMPS : The Universal NoSQL Database . "

It inspired me and reminded me of challenges facing the healthcare providers in the transition from fee-for-service to value-based care . And how on earth could a cool dance video do that , you ask ? Because it turned the seemingly impossible into something beautiful just like this transition will . <p> It also reminded me that sometimes learning new things is scary but passion and confidence will bridge the gaps and the results will be worth every effort . This is true of learning to dance or having a new way of thinking and behaving in healthcare . <p> During my research for the ACO Advisory Services , I 've found 4 common concerns the healthcare organization executives have voiced in our conversations . <p> 1 . Unknown Return on Investment <p> Providers understand valued-based care is the right direction , but the front-end investment can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be financially viable in the model . <p> " Even if I maximize the shared savings out of our CMS program , or our capitated program with this health plan and this SSP program with that one , etc. etc. it does n't  add up to enough money to cover the cost of all these big expensive projects that people want to sell us or the tools that we have to have and were just trying to explore some more cost effective ways of getting where we need to be . " <p> 2 . Living in both Volume and Value Worlds <p> Even though the portion of Fee-For-Service ( FFS ) as a reimbursement will continue to shrink , it is not going away in the short-term . Providers will learn how to better manage risks but , at the same time , run both of the care models . <p> " I would say managing while we have a foot in each camis very challenging for us , both operationally and from a clinical practice standpoint , to create it . Ideally , we like to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have that when only a portion of our patient population is at-risk and the majority of it is Fee-For-Service . So simultaneously managing those divergent incentives is difficult . " <p> 3 . The Need to Understand True Cost of Care <p> The true cost of patient care is very much needed yet a myth to many providers . Only when providers get a handle on understanding it , will they feel confident in taking on more risks . <p> " I know we do n't  have this figured out but what is going to be very , very important is to be able to pull data around the cost of care and comparing the actual care path against an ideal care path so we can identify the variations by physician , by type of patient . I think that is what is going to be very important . " <p> 4 . Commercial Technology Lags Behind Provider Needs <p> ACO and pop health management markets are still like the wild , wild west . The number of solutions that claim to help providers can be overwhelming but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no great solution out theretoday that I think is the end all , be all . You may come across organizations that have some solutions , proprietary or off the shelf , products that are great . I have seen some slick products out there but I have n't test-driven them . " <p> I believe that , like the girl learning to dance in this video , when we try , we can surprise ourselves . This transition might be something new to many organizations but , as this provider described her passion and responsibility , we can all adapt and become " pros " soon enough : <p> " I took this job because I really believe we can do better in healthcare , we can coordinate efforts and we can stop dropping balls and we can reduce waste and really get all these different specialists in a room that never have that opportunity to start talking about this stuff .

When referring to the sharing of patient clinical records , are we talking about EHR vendors , acute care provider organizations , family practice doctors , or HIEs ? It does n't  matter much if the patient dies as a result of not sharing records . In September of 2014 , many of the largest EMR vendors challenged KLAS to step up and be the Switzerland of interoperability to help speed up plug-and-play clinical exchange that effortlessly slides into the clinician workflow . Accepting the assignment with trepidation , KLAS will use key findings from over 240 recent healthcare provider interviews as a catalyst for actionable solutions at the KLAS Keystone Summit , Oct. 12 . <p> The presidents of key EHR software suppliers will convene at the summit to collaborate and then commit to a measurable action plan that will speed up interoperability .

Many have purchased computer-assisted coding solutions , but many of these providers still have unmet expectations . In order to hedge their bets , many organizations have contracted coders from multiple outsourced coding firms to supplement their in-house coders . The hope is that when they need even more coders , they will be able to leverage their existing vendor relationships to fill the gaps . <p> Unfortunately , quality coders are becoming a scarce resource . As an HIM manager in our recent HIM services report put it , " It is a challenge to find really good , experienced coders . They are very hard to find . There are n't  enough of them . " Outsourced coding firms continue to do their best to place coders in their clients organizations , but delays in staffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is challenged by ICD-10 . <p> A year from now , as we realize the full impact of ICD-10 , it will be interesting to see the roles computer-assisted coding and offshored coding play .

In KLAS latest HIM Purchasing Plans report , 69% of healthcare providers reported that they would not consider offshore coding . The cost savings of offshore coding are apparent to most , but taking jobs out of the country and coding-quality concerns cause major hesitation . However , as demand for coders increases , scarcity may act as a new driving force , causing more organizations to engage with offshore coders . KLAS will continue to watch this area and report . 
@@101582712 @5782712/ <p> On August 5 , Cerner surprised ( much of ) the HIT world by announcing they would acquire Siemens Health Services for $1.3 billion . Surprise or no , it represents a major shift in the hospital EMR market place . Siemens has experienced their share of ups and downs over the last 20 years , but there is no arguing that they have been a major market player . <p> Unfortunately , since unveiling their next-generation Soarian EMR in 2002 , Siemens has had a few more downs than ups . Most of these downs have been related to a single word : speed . Over the years , providers have indicated that Siemens is too slow to achieve reliable go lives at customer sites , too slow delivering code fixes and upgrades , and too slow evolving their portfoliomost notably in producing an integrated Soarian ambulatory EMR . Last October , one provider summed it up this way : <p> Siemens is behind the eight ball , and they need to be faster at providing improvement for Soarian Clinicals . We are running up against this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so forth . They are improving . They are coming out with new features and functions , but their competitors have had those things for at least a few years already . For example , we have n't implemented provider documentation yet .

They are clearly playing catch-up . <p> Speaking of Epic , 12 of the 16 hospitals that decided to leave Siemens last year contracted with Epic instead . According to Epic customers , the vendor has largely figured out the kind of challenges that plague Siemens . That reputation has shot Epic to the forefront of hospital EMR vendors : in 2013 they took the yellow jersey of market share leader from longtime front-runner MEDITECH . <p> During that same period of time , Siemens lost more hospitals than they gained .

For healthcare providers , regulatory changes , shifts in the insurance landscape with Obamacare , decreased reimbursements , and uncontrollable increases in operating costs combine to create an exceptionally challenging financial environment . <p> Hospitals are looking at their bank statements more closely than ever to determine how to reduce expenses , and it makes sense that they would tackle their top expenses first .

@@101582715 @5782715/ <h> What Makes Specialty Pharmacy Special <p> 11 Nov 14 by Adam Cherrington 0 views <p> I recently attended the National Association of Specialty Pharmacy ( NASP ) annual conference . I had to see for myself what is driving all the energy we are hearing about in the niche pharmacy segment known as specialty pharmacy . This market addresses the expensive and difficult-to-access medications that are prescribed for complex disease states like rheumatoid arthritis , hepatitis C , HIV , MS , and others . <p> In recent conversations with pharmacy leaders from around the country , KLAS has heard providers describe specialty pharmacy as " critically important " and " a huge focus . " But most are searching for solutions and want to understand the available technologies . As an example of the influence of specialty pharmacy , consider the recent release of the drug SOVALDI . <p> Patients suffering from hepatitis C now have a long-awaited viable cure available . But treatment costs can exceed $84,000 , making payers reluctant to authorize the drug . In just six months since its release , SOVALDI has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 2014 . Since the cost is unlikely to decrease in the foreseeable future , payers are seeking tighter control of the distribution of the drug . <p> With drugs like SOVALDI , patient medication adherence and pharmacist counseling become critical to ensuring successful treatment adoption . While the potential for high revenues will continue to attract provider organizations into the specialty pharmacy space , the identification and measurement of successful clinical outcomes is merely a wish and remains undefined at this point . <p> Specialty pharmacy IT vendors claim that the transfer of patient data from EMRs to pharmacy systems exists in limited deployment today but readily admit that the reverse flow of patient information is not yet happening . This data flow back to the EMR will be key for today 's health systems as they continue to move toward a patient-population focus and value-based care . Measurement of patient medication adherence ( through both provider and patient efforts ) should help determine specialty drug ROI and begin to more readily define the impact of specialty pharmacy meds . <p> Pharmacists seem poised to evolve into a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact on clinical outcomes . <p> In the coming weeks KLAS will be asking providers about their current capabilities and future plans regarding specialty pharmacy .

Tired as could be and knowing that early morning meetings would mean only four or five hours of sleep that night , I asked the hotel to give me an early morning wake-up call . <p> They agreed and then offered another follow-up call , even if I answered the first , to ensure I was awake .

@@101582717 @5782717/ <h> Is Our Healthcare Interoperability Ecosystem Growing ? <p> 30 Oct 14 by Coray Tate 0 views <p> In Utah , the aspen trees grow in clumps along the mountainsides and paint the landscape a beautiful golden yellow this time of year . The interesting thing about aspen groves is that they are actually one interconnected organism . All of the trees are connected by a network of roots that share resources where they are needed . <p> This seems to be what the ONC has envisioned for our healthcare systems interoperabilityto be one interconnected organism that shares data freely with each of its parts . From my conversations with hundreds of providers over the past several years , I would say that interconnectedness is the number one issue before us . <p> We ( KLAS ) just finished our first report on the state of interoperability . In the report we tried to go beyond industry generalization to compare EMR vendor performance in areas like interfacing , HIE , direct messaging , and cooperation with other vendors . The findings were really interesting and leave me both sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 . Interoperability roots are growing , but they are young , tender , and fighting through rocky soil . The government and vendors are working on standards and providing incentives . Providers are hacking away at interfaces and setting up HIEs , but by and large we are really just getting started . The biggest problem is that we still do not have incentives aligned , so competition ( which should make our healthcare system better ) actually makes interoperability progress slower . Once we get our incentives aligned , we can start competing on things that will make us great , like driving clinical outcomes . <p> 2 . There are some interoperability groves , but they come with caveats . Sharing data widely with disparate systems is happening , but it is rare and more often the result of determined providers than of technology or government interventions . In addition , there are groves of Epic hospitals and clinics that share freely with each other . This accomplishment should not be understated as no other EMR vendor has provided this capability widely to their customer base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and outside of the Epic-to-Epic sphere , data sharing is just like everywhere else harder and less robust . <p> 3 . Interoperability is not turning the healthcare landscape goldenyet . As we talked with providers , they were slow to say that any interoperability product or feature had positively impacted patient care . Twenty percent of providers did list HIEs as having an impact , making HIEs the most specified solution . However , more providers ( one-third ) said that nothing was impacting patient care yet . This reflects two thingsthat interoperability is really hard and that many providers initial attempts at interoperability have been more targeted at putting a check on the meaningful use Stage 2 list . Most have not yet taken the step of really trying to share and use data in a meaningful way
