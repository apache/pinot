Your annoying habit of constantly talking about yourself is just one thing that could make you look like one of those people who keep bragging about themselves . Know the typical signs and personality traits of a person who is a total show off . Do a little introspection to see if you are a show off too . <p> 1 ) You divert every conversation to yourself <p> Do you have the inherent tendency of diverting every conversation to yourself ? For example , if your friend tells you that he bought a new car , you are expected to listen as he talks about its features . You should n't be instantly turning the conversation around to your car and how you got a great deal for it . <p> Not every conversation is supposed to be about you and if you find yourself guilty of making it so , you may passively be a big show off . If you do n't listen to what other people say and are only interested in what you have to say in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people stay away from . <p> 2 ) You do things that you do n't like just because they are cool <p> Are you one of those people who will do things that they do n't like doing just because it is the cool thing to do ? <p> If you buy M.A.C 's latest shade of rouge even if you wear no makeup at all , if you buy a tablet PC just because everyone is carrying one or if you learn an exotic hobby even if you have absolutely no interest in it , chances are that you are strategically doing all these things to show off . <p> Stop doing things that you are not interested in . Just because everyone else is doing it does not mean that you will look cool doing it too . <p> 3 ) All you do on your social networking profiles is brag <p> It may become very easy for others to label you as a complete show off if all you do is brag , brag and brag on Facebook , Twitter and other social networks . Leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narcissist . <p> Social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter are meant to be places where people can meet and catch up with the latest happenings with friends . It is one thing to have an attractive profile but if your profile is jam packed with a list of your achievements , your talents and your model-like pictures , you may be pushing it a bit too far . <p> Did you just go shopping ? Bought new clothes ? Or a new gadget maybe ? That 's great . But you do n't need to brag about it to online or to anyone and everyone you meet . <p> 4 ) You constantly brag about your latest purchases <p> It may be exciting to share your new purchases with friends and family or talk about it on Facebook and Twitter as you are walking home from the shops . But doing this for every single thing you buy may make you look like a total show off . <p> Other people may not want to know about everything you have been buying . Your annoying Facebook updates could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that you may own . So whether it is a new camera , a new pair of jeans , a set of sophisticated wine glasses or a new makeup kit , bragging about every single thing as soon as you buy it may clearly make you come across as a show off . <p> 5 ) You constantly fish for compliments <p> A person who drives a conversation in a way that forces someone else to give a compliment unwillingly is likely to be a show off . Braggarts are known to enjoy being the center of attention all the time and they like their egos puffing up with praise and compliments . <p> Stop asking your friends questions which force them to respond with a compliment . Everyone feels good when they are appreciated but it can be very annoying to others if you dig down deep for compliments all the time . <p> 6 ) You look down on people who do n't have something that you have <p> Do you passively look down upon people who do n't have the things that you have ? Introspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same laptop as you technologically backward or does not wear the same brand of jeans as you wear cheap and frugal . <p> Pointing out to someone at every occasion that what you have is better than what they have is very insulting . Learn to respect everyone and everything that other people do in their own right . <p> Do other people need to stop you from talking constantly ? <p> 7 ) You keep talking until someone stops you <p> People who like to brag about themselves tend to love the sound of their own voice to the extent that they may completely lose focus of what is happening around them . They may not even bother if they are being heard or not . <p> Sharing an interesting thing you recently did , praising your own hairstyle or your latest achievement at work may be fun for others to listen to . But if you keep talking about it until someone actually has to stop you , a show off is what you are likely to be branded as . <p> 8 ) You flaunt insignificant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iPhone . So you have a sheer designer outfit like Kristen Stewart . So you have court side tickets to the Friday night game . So what ? If you keep telling flaunting insignificant things in front of friends and family , you could be on your way to being branded as a total show off . <p> People who like to brag are known to love talking about every single detail of their lives . It is one thing to flaunt a new Ferrari and another thing to flaunt a new accessory for your laptop . <p> 9 ) You show off your girlfriend or boyfriend <p> No matter how good looking your girlfriend or boyfriend is , he or she is not a trophy that you should be parading around . There may be close friends or family you would want your partner to meet , but that does not mean you parade them around town with a haughty smile on your face . <p> If you sing praises of your girlfriend or boyfriend at untimely occasions , if you take him or her uninvited to a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could come across as an insecure , shallow show off . <p> 10 ) You feel humiliated when other people show off <p> What is the first thing you feel when a guy keeps bragging about his new laptop all day long or when a girl keep flaunting her new shoes for weeks together ? Would you make fun of them and ridicule them for being a complete show off ? Or would you feel humiliated because that guy or girl apparently has something that you do n't ? If you chose the latter , you are possibly a show off yourself . <p> People who keep bragging about themselves unnecessarily are generally mocked and ridiculed . Their show off behavior is not to be taken seriously nor is it meant to be embraced .

After a round of good lovemaking , or when your spouse treats you romantically , it softens your heart , induces benevolent feelings towards your spouse in you , which contributes to strengthen the marriage bond .

@@96276026 @476026/ <h> Lack of Love and Intimacy in Marriage : Causes and Solutions <h> What is Intimacy ? <p> Too many couples mistakenly define intimacy as just sex , but true intimacy goes beyond intercourse . Some call it an invisible thread between two people , while others call it a union . Even when a couple disagrees , this bond remains . <p> Intimacy is more than sex , but it 's often expressed through intercourse and physical love . If a couple treats sex only as a way to make a baby , engaging in intercourse only once every three years or so , their lack of intimacy would be no surprise . A relationship requires attention and maintenance , and the intimate bond between a couple will fade if they stop caring for the physical side of their relationship . <h> How You Know Your Marriage is Losing Intimacy <p> It 's normal to go through periods when you or your partner feel reluctant to make love due to stress and other issues . But if it continues for too long it may be a problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing a bed with a stranger . <p> Conversation is limited to orders and instructions , not meaningful communication . <p> You convince yourself that you no longer desire or care about the sexual aspect of your relationship .

But before you can reclaim your relationship , you need to understand how you found yourself in this mess . Why do you feel cold about your partner ? How did the flame of love in your marriage diminish ? <h> Reasons for a Lack of Love and Intimacy in Your Marriage <p> You 're not attracted to each other anymore . This is the most common reason why married couples become less intimate . Women in particular worry about being seen as less attractive by their husbands as they age . Let me assure you that it is not the fading of your natural beauty that makes him lose interest , but lax maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father bought a Peugeot 406 which is still eye-catching today because he 's taken good care of it for all these years . Women spend huge amounts of money taking care of their bodies when single , but these activities cease after marriage . Ladies , keep your bodies alluring and you 'll keep your man . This standard is admittedly unfair . Men often treat a woman like their personal property and believe they can have her even when they themselves do n't shave for two weeks . <p> Unfaithfulness . If one member of a couple is seeing someone else , their primary relationship will fade . Why do men flirt and stray ? They may no longer be attracted to their wives anymore , or the couple may be growing apart . <p> Growing apart .

What happened ? She married her husband when she was a struggling student and her husband supported her .

Play game like you 're little kids . Rekindle that lost passion and excitement . <h> A Final Word on Intimacy <p> Men and women usually want sex for different reasons . Men want to have sex in order to feel emotionally close to their partners , while woman want to have sex because they already feel that closeness . Be sensitive to each other 's needs for emotional and physical intimacy . 
@@96276027 @476027/ <h> What Is the No Contact Rule ? <p> The No Contact Rule is simplicity itself : it merely means not having any communication with your former romantic partner , for a specified period of time . This includes : <p> No telephone calls <p> No text messages <p> No instant messaging or emails <p> No stalking <p> No contacting your ex 's friends or family <p> This method is particularly useful following a relationship breakup , especially if you were the one who was dumped or betrayed . It can also be used to detach yourself from a narcissistic or abusive partner . <p> Of course , if you and your ex-partner have children together , then you will inevitably need to discuss issues such as welfare and access . While this type of dialogue is unavoidable , you should do your very best to keep these interactions to a bare minimum . <p> Nonetheless , if you are prepared to implement no contact , then there are significant benefits to be gained . <h> Why Use No Contact ? <p> All relationships are not created equal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more emotionally invested in the partnership , than the other . When relationships end , one partner will typically harbour feelings for their ex and struggle to come to terms with the separation . <p> When this happens , the distraught party is more likely to want to maintain contact with their former lover . This is borne out by research undertaken by the University of South Florida , which also revealed that the seriousness of a relationship had little impact upon whether a couple wished to stay in touch post-breakup . <p> One of the main dangers with continuing to see your ex , is that this stops you from moving on with your life . Even when you find a new partner , research confirms that this relationship will feel less rewarding and you are more likely to feel less committed to your new partner . By continuing to see your ex , you are not only exposing yourself to extreme distress , but you are also hindering your emotional recovery and increasing your longing for a reconciliation . <p> Moreover , a study undertaken by Tara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a split , was to avoid any exposure to an ex-partner , whether that be via face-to-face communication or any form of online interaction . <h> Fundamental Ground Rules <p> There are some critics of no contact , who believe it to be nothing more than a manipulative mind game , played by scorned ex-lovers . In part , this is perfectly true . Many people embark upon no contact with false hope and expectations of a reconciliation . <p> Therefore , it is vital that you familiarise yourself with some basic ground rules . This will help you avoid becoming disenchanted with this strategy and hopefully , achieve many positive benefits . <p> To clarify , no contact is not : <p> A game <p> About punishment or revenge <p> About getting your former partner back <p> About making your ex jealous <h> Benefits of Using the No Contact Rule <h> 1 . You Can Wallow in Self-Pity <p> Have you ever watched the opening scene in the film , Bridget Jones ' Diary ? Still in her pyjamas , smoking a cigarette and drinking a glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' All By Myself . ' She then proceeds to check her answerphone , only for it to tell her , " You have no messages . " <p> Anyone who has ever suffered a breakup , will no doubt be able to empathise with Bridget 's character . Well , just like her , you have permission to throw your very own pity-party . Lock yourself away , wallow in self-pity , cry your heart out and totally indulge yourself . It is important that you take the time to get your ex out of your system . <p> Nevertheless , whilst we all deserve a little self-indulgence from time to time , there reaches a point when you really must get your act together . So , after a few days , you need to put on a brave face and get on with your life . Hence , if you have n't made it out of bed for several days , then make today the day when all that changes . <p> No matter how you feel : Get up , dress up , show up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grieving Process <p> The grieving process can be broken down into a number of different stages . However , the following are three of the main phases , that you will experience . <h> Stage 1 : Shock , Denial and Numbness <p> This is when you will be at your most vulnerable . You will tend to let your heart rule your head and hold on to false hopes of a reconciliation . <h> Stage 2 : Fear , Anger and Depression <p> After a period of time , you will eventually come to realise that your relationship is over . For several different reasons , this can also be a rather destructive phase . You tend to want revenge on your ex . You may also have a tendency to over-divulge information about your relationship , in an attempt to portray your ex in a bad light . Believe me , you will come to regret this at a later date . Moreover , you may wish harm to befall your ex . <h> Stage 3 : Understanding , Acceptance and Moving On <p> Eventually , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms with your loss . Whilst you may still feel sad about what has happened , you are more likely to have come to accept , what you can not change . <h> 2 . Gives You Time to Grieve <p> When a relationship ends , the heartache can be so traumatic , that it often mirrors the grief you experience following the death of a loved one . The raw emotions are particularly similar . In both instances , you have suffered the loss of someone whom you loved dearly although , the circumstances are extremely different : your ex is still very much alive . <p> Unfortunately , coping with a breakup can be excruciatingly painful and harrowing . Betrayal , humiliation , bitterness , bewilderment , anger , depression , anxiety and panic are all perfectly normal emotions to experience . Even the most rationally minded individuals can be pushed to breaking point . <p> Grieving takes time and the process can not be fast-tracked . If you suffered a serious injury in a motor vehicle accident , you could not reasonably expect to be fully recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency medical care , you may well be expected to undergo a period of rehabilitation . There may well be emotional trauma to contend with . The same is true for mending a broken heart . Emotional healing can take just as long , if not longer than it does for some physical injuries to repair themselves . You will not feel better overnight and must allow your body time to rest and recuperate . <p> There are several phases to the grieving process and you need time to allow nature to take its course , and work through these stages in turn . <p> One of the hardest things you will ever have to do , is to grieve the loss of someone , who is still alive . <p> Anon <h> 3 . Prevents You From Demeaning Yourself <p> Rejection and desperation can make you do silly things such as : calling , texting and begging your ex to take you back . You begin obsessively checking your messages to see if he or she has been in touch . When they have n't , it makes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdrive and you begin to imagine them out partying , whilst you are confined to your bedroom , heartbroken . Worse still , they may even have moved on with their life and found themselves a new partner . Contemplating these thoughts makes you sink into an even deeper state of despair . <p> This is why you must give yourself some space . When you are in such an irrational state of mind , you become inclined to do things that ordinarily , would not enter your head . Taking time-out can help prevent you from partaking in foolish activities such as : drunk-dialling or texting , repeatedly driving past their home or place of work and , worse still , stalking them . <p> In the long-term , maintaining a dignified silence will save you from a considerable amount of embarrassment . <h> 4 . Puts Life into Perspective <p> Following a breakup , it is perfectly natural to be in such mental turmoil , that you do not know which way to turn . Creating space between you and your ex can help improve your mental clarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Writing down your thoughts in a journal , will also help you to put recent events into perspective . Do n't worry about what you write , just get all of your thoughts out of your mind . Transferring your feelings and problems to paper helps free the mental clutter in your head and leaves you with a greater capacity to think clearly . <p> Without any external influence , you can begin to reassess your life by asking yourself questions such as : <p> Who is the most important person in your life ? <p> Who are the people who are always there for you ? <p> What irritating habits did your ex have ? <p> What did your relationship prevent you from doing with your life ? <p> What new opportunities does your breakup give you ? <p> What five things are you most thankful for today ? <p> What five things are you going to achieve today ? <p> As time goes by , you will develop your own set of questions , that will be specific to your personal set of circumstances . Gradually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to you . Often , we tend to forget about our family and close friends , whose loyalty and support we tend to take for granted . People suffering from a serious illness may simply be grateful to wake up in the morning . So , start appreciating your life and be truly thankful for all that you have . <p> Use your newfound freedom to reconnect with old friends . Source <h> 5 . Let 's You Reconnect with Your Old Life <p> Let 's be perfectly honest : we are all more than capable of getting into a rut with our relationships . We tend to give up hobbies , that we once so enjoyed , in order to spend time with our partner . Friends , that we were once so close to , have long since disappeared off the radar . <p> Well now , you have time to do whatever you want . Ring up those old friends and reconnect with them . By all means , let them know that you are going through a breakup , but do n't solely use them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin doing those hobbies that you once so enjoyed . <h> 6 . Allows You to Set Healthy Boundaries <p> Whilst it is important to set healthy boundaries in all aspects of your life , these often become blurred within relationships , especially when you are feeling vulnerable . When your confidence and self-esteem is low , you are more likely to let your boundaries slip . This is often due to fear of rejection or abandonment . However , it is important to remember that healthy boundaries exist in order to protect you , both on a physical and emotional level . <p> Boundaries are all about being treated with respect and letting others know what you are , and what you are not , prepared to tolerate . From time-to-time , your ex-partner may test these boundaries . For example , if your ex sends you a drunken text at 2 o'clock in the morning , asking you to pop over to see him , is that treating you with respect ? Do you honestly believe that he is desperate to have a deep and meaningful conversation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not let your relief at hearing from him , cloud your judgement . <p> Use the period of no contact to draw up a list of relationship boundaries . When enforcing these boundaries , be assertive but remain calm . You do not need to apologise or justify your reasoning to anyone . <p> No Contact gives you the opportunity to reinvent yourself . Source <h> 7 . Gives You Time to Reinvent Yourself <p> One positive aspect about being single , is that you do n't have to please anyone . You can dress how you like and look how you like . So , take some time to start improving your life . I 'm not talking drastic steps here , such as cosmetic surgery , although if you find Botox and fillers appealing , then go ahead . It is important to begin taking baby steps . Possibly a new hairstyle , new makeup and a wardrobe overhaul . If you are unsure of how to go about this , then simply book a consultation with a relevant specialist . <p> Also , take a good look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If your ex has any belongings hanging around , make sure you box them up and put them out of sight . Why not examine your finances ? What steps can you take to improve these , so that you can feel more secure with your life and your future . <p> Finally , there is nothing to stop you embarking upon new activities and hobbies , no matter how outrageous they may seem . I know of a woman in her seventies who , following the death of her husband , took up belly dancing . Try to step outside of your comfort zone a little . Trying something that you think you can not do , will give you a great sense of achievement . Also , the harder you have to concentrate on achieving this task , the less time you will have to think about your ex . <p> Whatever happens following your breakup , you need to ensure that time does not stand still for you .

Piss off ! <p> Author <p> C L Grant 4 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> Hi Paul ... sorry to hear about your experience with your ex . <p> One of the most common misconceptions of the No Contact Rule is that couples live happily every after , if and when , they reconcile . <p> Sadly , this is not true . Whatever problems caused the breakup need to be addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My advice would be to view the No Contact Rule as a survival mechanism . It is all about maintaining your self respect and coping with the breakup as painlessly as possible . <p> I note that your ex clicked her fingers after only 2 weeks and you went running . ( Sorry to be blunt ! ) As a minimum , you should enter into No Contact for 30 days . <p> On the face of it , your ex does n't sound ready for a long term relationship . As for you Paul , you deserve much better than being stood up on Valentine 's Day . <p> Restart the No Contact Rule and this time , stick it out for 60 days ... yes , 60 ! <p> Also , please remember my earlier point . You are not going into no contact in order to win your ex back . You are doing it to move forward with your life and come out the other end a better and stronger person . <p> Best of luck with this . <p> tattuwurn 4 years ago <p> Wow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a break up with my first boyfriend , I was in so much pain that I decided not to contact him ( no texts , no calls , no emails ; I also removed him from my buddy list ) . Unlike your suggestion for the first break-up , my rule went on for two years ( but then you said we are all different , hehehehe ) . Of course , since it was from my first relationship , I really had a hard time coping , and felt it was all hell for me -- though I still loved him , I had to move on with my life and kept myself busy . I did get into depression for a while especially the first days and weeks after the breakup , that I neglected my appearance and my health , but I had the willpower to bounce back . Two years later , I befriended someone on a social networking site -- and eventually I found out that it was my ex , only under a different username . <p> I was angry at him cos I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just shy in making contact me again in his real identity . He made the decision to contact me because just like myself , he had also been feeling really bad since we parted ways -- but he admitted to me that he did n't know how to start it that it took him two years to gather his courage to contact me . I accepted his apology . I admitted I had forgotten him for long within those two years of my self-recovery , but when I saw him again I realized I suddenly missed him . <p> Luckily for ourselves , our love for each other prevailed . We were set to working out differences and repair the wounds from our breakup . Now we 're ok , and doing better than before . I guess my own rule worked . : ) <p> Jo2529 4 years ago <p> I followed the steps of this rule , it kindda worked ... he called me but he wants to be just friends.I want to be together as a couple ... what should I do next ? Today we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant 4 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> Oh no ... he 's playing the " friends " card ? How predictable ! <p> Firstly , you can not be friends with an ex when you still have romantic feelings for him . It is natural to clutch at straws and to be willing to accept any little crumbs that he has to offer you . But that is all they will be . Crumbs . <p> You also need to question his motives . Normally staying " friends " means that he does n't want to commit to a relationship with you but wants to keep his options open ... just in case nobody better comes along ! <p> Do you really want to be kept dangling on a piece of string ? Potentially relegated to nothing more than a booty call ? Believe me , it will stop you moving forward with your life . <p> What you should tell him is that regretably , you are unable to have him as a friend , at this moment in time . Tell him you are moving forward with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice really . How much do you value yourself Jo2529 ? <p> Jo2529 4 years ago <p> Thank you so much ! ! ! Unfortunately he did n't call yesterday to tell when and where to meet . Initially he asked me to go at his house but I refused and told him that we can meet but for a walk ... he accepted but it will be better later , I said : just tell where and when .... he did n't send me no other message ... sorry for my bad english . <p> Author <p> C L Grant 4 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> No problem . I understand what you mean Jo2529 . <p> Your ex is playing games already . <p> He asks to see you . You agree . He thinks he can still ' have ' you . So , he pushes his luck a little bit further . This time , he asks you to meet at his house . Thankfully , you say no ! <p> good stuff and i agree about a lot of what you say ... with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture or self-discovering journey launching out of a desire to be with someone else . i feel like the desire to be over someone should be out of bettering yourself , not to get them to run back to you . just a personal opinion though 64473 @qwx924473 <p> My boyfriend and I are going through a rough patch . We 've been together for 2 yra and have had a great honest relationship . For the past nearly 2 months we have started to fight a lot but over minor things , to me it 's just us getting more comfortable with each other and trying to figure out where we both stand within the relationship . However my boyfriend has just completely given up on us and said its to hard we 're always fighting what 's the point and has ended the relationship . After 2 days I went back and asked him to think about it , saying we could make it work we just need time and to openly communicate a bit more . He still does n't see the point but said he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him 9-12 days of space because I know he can be very stubborn once he makes up his mind and generally takes that long to be more open minded . I 'm a bit lost and do n't know what to really do , do I try to make him realise or do I just give up too ? <p> Author <p> C L Grant 4 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> Sorry to hear about the problems that you have been having in your relationship . However , the No Contact Rule can not fix the underlying problems that you have and your boyfriend have . You need to understand what is causing you to fight all the time . Staying in a relationship like that is not healthy and will undermine your self confidence . Some relationships are best left alone . <p> Maintaining no contact will provide you and your boyfriend with an opportunity to reflect upon your relationship . Both good and bad . <p> You 've already realised that you need to give him some space . My concern is that you are only allowing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially for men . They are generally less emotional than women and the loss of the relationship breakup will not even have scratched the surface by then . <p> Give him the 30 days and keep yourself occupied in the meantime . Think of it as going on a boyfriend detox ! Also , do n't let your health or appearance suffer . If anything , step it up a gear and make more of an effort to take care of yourself . <p> Best of luck with this . <p> Stronger 4 years ago <p> Hello , <p> We were together for almost 3 months . He broke up with me exactly 3 weeks ago . The day after , he texted me at night to check if everything was going well with my house moving . Acted weird when I took a while to respond saying that I was out . Two days later again , he texted me to check on my moving again . Since then , no more contacts . It 's been ALMOST 3 weeks now with no contact . It 's horrible thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about he texting me twice ? Just being nice ? He was a good guy . : ( No games at all <p> Author <p> C L Grant 4 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> I think that he wants reassurance that his ' Plan B ' i.e. YOU , is still available ! He has not moved on . He 's actually concerned that YOU may have moved on ! <p> You seem to be handling this really well in terms of no contact . Just carry on what you 're doing and do n't be too eager to text him back , especially if it 's at the weekend or late in the evening . Maintain an air of mystery . <p> By responding to his text messages , you 've probably satisfied his curiosity , for now at least , and he 's content in the knowledge that you 're still there for him . <p> My suggestion is to keep busy and do n't be too anxious to respond to his text messages next time around ... and believe me , if you maintain your silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even ignore a couple of his messages , assuming you have the willpower , next time he gets in touch . You do n't have to jump , just because he clicks his fingers ! You are far too busy living your own life . <p> If he truly wants a reconciliation , then he has to work for it . He initiated the breakup and so , he has to make amends . Just hold back and take things slowly . Give yourself time to decide if your ex is the person you really want to be with or if you 're simply experiencing feelings of rejection . <p> Best of luck with this ! <p> Stronger 4 years ago <p> Wow . Glad u responded . <p> Yeah , when he first txt me a day after the breakup , it took an hour to see it . With no response he text me AGAIN , saying maybe he should n't have done . Finally i did respond saying that I " just " saw the message for being in a loud place . He thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while again to respond , and he told me to enjoy my date . <p> I was NOT on a date . Funny the way he reacted right after dumping me . <p> I was reading also about " get ur ex back forever " by Mathew Houston . Have u read his advises ? <p> Author <p> C L Grant 4 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> I 've read far too many books on breaking up and getting your ex back ! I do n't recall his name to be honest . However , most of them boil down to maintaining no contact . Do n't be sucked in by the sales hype . <p> All I can say is , you seem to be doing just fine , on your own , and keep up the good work . <p> Stronger 4 years ago <p> Yes , I am doing fine after all the reading I have done in the past few days on this subject . They make me stronger . <p> Thank u so much for this article ! <p> Confused 4 years ago <p> Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say thank you for such a great article . It really helped me in a lot of ways . So here is my story .. will make it as short as possible . My ex boyfriend and I dated for 5 months . There were minor things in our relationship such as not introduced as his girlfriend in the beginning of the relationship , not being able to meet any of his friends .. etc anyway , I do n't know why or its just a bad habit I have .. I broke up with him more than 10 times after every argument we had through anger even though I do n't mean to at all . However this time , he said yeah we should not be together anymore . I ca n't take it anymore because I 'm afraid of the future . I saw You in my future but not anymore . I ca n't be that person for you anymore . It surprise me to hear this because he always fought to get back with me every time but this time he said he just ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this when he was around his friend ) After me crying and pleading for him to try one last time to see if we can make it work he said no . He cares enough to want us to remain in each other lives but we both need our space at the moment . After all the crying and pleading ( all done through phone and text ) I thought to see if I can see him in person because i thought it would be better then all this done over the phone . I was going to text and see if he can meet up 2 days after the breakup but then I was n't feeling well and had to go to the ER . I called and asked if he can come with me because I 'm scared to go alone . He refused to at first and said he 'll call someone else to go with me but then after 10 mins he finally said ok with frustration or something . When he met me up at the hospital , he teared up a bit and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his guard and started acting a bit distant and cold . He just said he cares about my well being that 's why he is here to make sure I 'm ok . However he needs to leave in an hour for a game with his friends . When the doctor came out , he suggested I stay to get some more X-ray and blood test to make sure I 'm ok to go home . However it will take 3-4 hours and I need to stay there for the results . Out of nowhere he blurted out and said I should and he will stay with me . I told him he can go but he said no do n't worry about it . After a little bit alone with him .. I noticed he started to soften up and let his guard down a bit . We were allowed to grab a quick bite and come back afterwards . When we stepped out for a moment , he was a bit stressed out I believe because I never saw him smoking 3 times in a row . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes looked back at me for a moment with some sadness across his face . I acted as if I did n't see anything . Then he asked me if I wanted to sit by the park for a bit before we head back to the hospital and I said yes . When we were there we started laughing so hard because we saw this guy dancing to a YouTube video . It then reminded me of these salsa dancing classes we wanted to try out . I told him I bought it several weeks ago and see if he would want to go sometime . He said at the moment we need our space . I said i did n't say like next week but it does expire in a month so would he want to go then .. he said yes . Anyway , after we went back to the hospital the doctor said I was ok and was released . Right before we left . The hospital , I said I know this happened and I will leave you alone . If you want to try in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paperwork was done , We both walked out to find our train station . When we were on the train , I stood next to him and hugged him till I reached my stop . Every time my head was moved back a bit he placed his hand behind my head and pushed it up against his chest so I can rest my face there . As soon as my stop came , i said just rememeber what we talked about . i love you and will miss you . we kissed each other on the cheek , teared up a bit and then I left . I did n't contact for a day but before I flew out for work .. I thought should I text or not because I said I 'll leave him alone for the time being .. but the I just went ahead and said .. I know you want me to leave you alone for now .. I just wanted to say before my flight is thank you for being there for me at the hospital . I really appreciate your support and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for now , take care and I ca n't wait to hearing from you soon . Then he responded right away and said no problem . I 'm glad you 're ok . : ) Have a safe flight and will speak soon . : ) after that , I kept my distance .. it 's been 12 days .. I feel a lot better than I did on the first day we broke up . I know since the breakup , he had several days with his friends but then has a couple days to himself this past week for work away from home .. do you think this time by himself without anybody around will help as long as I keep my distance for him to think things over ? I 'm so confused because at first he said he did n't see me in his future but when we were talking before leaving the hospital how I will respect his request for some space .. he said he does n't see me in the future but who really can predict the future . I 'm confused and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice or suggestion will hell me so much during this no contact period . Thank you <p> Author <p> C L Grant 4 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> Sorry to hear that you have gone through this Confused . <p> Firstly , if he 's not prepared to introduce you as his girlfriend , then you should not have behaved like a girlfriend . By that , I mean being intimate . Also , after dating for 5 months , it is perfectly normal to have been introduced to some of his friends . You are not in the wrong here . He is . His actions certainly contributed towards your feelings of insecurity which is why , I suspect , you ended the relationship so many times . <p> How you have behaved , after the breakup , is a fairly normal reaction . However , you now have to move on and genuinely respect his space and privacy . That means not contacting him and not tracking his movements . Please do n't start the habit of stalking him on social media sites or by speaking to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are looking up his profile everyday ! <p> I know that being 12 days without him , will have seemed like a lifetime to you . But it 's just a drop in the ocean . I know I 've said this so many times , but keep yourself busy and do things that make you feel and look better . A long walk with a friend usually lifts my mood . For you , it may be a yoga class and some meditation . Get a new hairstyle , watch your diet and eat plenty of fruit and veg . Dump the alcohol . If you drink , that will make you feel worse . Do some exercise , lose some weight ( if you need to ) or concentrate on toning up . Experiment with makeup . Also , as strange as it may seem , in this situation , helping others can be extremely rewarding and fulfilling . <p> Just remember that all of this is about YOU . You are not doing this pampering and preening in order to get him back . You are rebuilding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep going with the no contact for at least 30 days . If you keep busy and do it properly , by that I mean no stalking , you 'll wake up one morning and discover that you long stopped counting down the days ! <p> If he does get in touch , during the no contact period , just ignore his messages for now . I should stress that this is not about playing games . You need this time and space also to compose yourself and to begin thinking and behaving in a rational manner . <p> Best of luck with this . Keep smiling and do let me know how you get on ! ; ) <p> Confused 4 years ago <p> Thank you so much for responding to my message : ) I really appreciate you taking the time out of your busy schedule to message me back .. <p> May I say it is a bit challenging to sort of counting down the days but I have to admit its gotten a lot easier compared to day 1 . It makes it easier to not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch with my friends that have my personal email so that 's one less thing I would be concern about . However , the only reason why I knew his time apart from his friends this week and after the breakup because he sent me his work schedule for this month . I do n't contact his friends because we do n't have mutual friends nor do I want to know either because it will be a bit of challenge right now for me . <p> I am making an effort to keep myself busy though . My friends and I went out last night and that was really fun plus we all agreed on signing up for some dance classes which I 'm very excited ! <p> May I ask one question though ... based on your experience with many people in the past and based on my Story .. Do you think he would contact me in the future based on what he said on his last message of speaking to me soon ... wants to remain in my life .. agreed to the dance class ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have between him .. is it ok to send a simple text ? Ugh .. I just realized that was more than one question .. sorry : / thank you again and hope to hear from you soon ! <p> Author <p> C L Grant 4 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> Hi again Confused . <p> Sadly , I do n't have a crystal ball but , based on experience , yes , he will contact you . However , whether this is to facilitate a reconciliation or simply out of curiosity , I am unable to answer . <p> After 30 days , there 's nothing wrong with dropping him a simple text asking how he is doing , providing you feel emotionally strong enough . You need to consider how you will feel if he does n't reply . If it will upset you , and set back the progress that you have been making , then you 're not ready for it . Also , do n't send him a text asking him to meet up though . That request should ideally come from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respecting his space , you are not only showing him that you can live without him but you are also giving him an opportunity to miss you . Men are usually a bit slower than women to reach this point , so you need to bear that in mind also ! <p> Best wishes , as always . <p> Confused 4 years ago <p> Thank you once again and for sure : ) I will keep you updated ! <p> John 4 years ago <p> Hi ! Great article . <p> My girlfriend left me but we continued to talk and go out for a month . Now the situation become very difficult to me so I decide to close all . <p> After a day on friday night , she sent me a message to ask me " if I want to talk on the phone the next day " .. no reply from me . <p> Then she sent me 2 messages to me on sunday evening .. she said that she miss the sensation of be fundamental on the life of someone .. and then a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my worst part and made me think while others would surrender . Thanks I appreciate you " <p> Now on monday no message , today no message .. what should I do ? <p> Marco 4 years ago <p> I also did not answer to last two messages of sunday <p> Author <p> C L Grant 4 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> John/Marco <p> You should do absolutely nothing . Try the no contact rule and take a break for a month . That will give both of you some space to work out if you still want to be together . Although it seems the mature thing to do , in reality , it 's very difficult to remain friends with your ex partner . <p> If you want to get in touch with her at the end of the month , and feel emotionally strong enough to do so , then do . Simply apologise for not getting back to her sooner but explain that you have been extremely busy . <p> However , I should stress that whatever problems existed previously in your relationship , will still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these if your relationship is to be successful . <p> Best of luck ! <p> someone575 4 years ago <p> I am on day 2 of NC . He broke up with me 3 days ago so I 'm proud of myself . I 've written him long letters but did n't mail them , text messages , but did n't send them . ( This was before I deleted him from my phone ) . The weekend is coming up and we usually did an activity together on those days &amp; now I 'm wondering if he 's thinking of me . We broke up because we have different views on things like politics , religion , social issues , things that neither of us will change our views on . We both knew we had differences when we started dating , but I thought he liked that about us . I know I did . <p> Stronger 4 years ago <p> Hello again . I posted 10 days ago as " stronger " . Today it 's been 30 days from the breakup and 28 days from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing him yesterday and today . I am dying to txt him . <p> I have the feeling he knows exactly what I am doing as far as nc . <p> Any tips on how should I txt him , instead a " hi how are u " ? <p> I would like to be more spontanous with something cool , something that used to make us laugh together in the past , instead so formal . What do u think ? <p> Thanks <p> Author <p> C L Grant 4 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> Hello again Stronger , nice to hear from you again . <p> I know it 's called the 30 day no contact rule , but have you considered how it will make you feel , if he does n't respond to your text message ? <p> Also , what is the true purpose of your proposed text message ? Is it because you still want to get back with him ? ( Please do n't think I 'm being stupid here , I just want you to be true to yourself ! ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think you 're ready to contact him . <p> Also , do n't you think that you deserve more from him ? If he truly cares for you , he WILL contact you . If he truly wants you , he WILL contact you ! <p> You want to be Number 1 in his life . Not an afterthought or Plan B. <p> Most reconciliations occur within 12 weeks of a breakup . If HE has n't contacted YOU in that time , more than likely , he 's really not that in to you ... sorry ! <p> My advice ? <p> Stay strong , stay silent ! <p> Best wishes as always and keep me posted ! <p> Stronger 4 years ago <p> Thank you again . No , you are not stupid .... ; ) I feel the one stupid here actually ! <p> Yes , I have considered the rejection and the silence from him , but the mature man he was , I do n't see him doing that . <p> Yes , I feel like having him back . I miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . HE needs to contact me , BUT I get this " stupid feeling " that he is looking at it as an immature behavior from my me , since we never had a fight and he ended good terms . <p> Sorry for taking your time with this , but it feels good to let it out , cause it is all so confusing . I do agree with the no contact for a while , but for some reason this thing telling me he sees me as immature behavior for this " mind games . " <p> I have been reading a lot about the NO CONTACT , and recently I found the point of view from a man blog who does n't really agree with NC in all situations . There is this part which makes a little sense , and respond to my " stupid feeling " with my particular ex being mature the way I " believe " he was . It says : <p> " Thinking that your ex will miss you because you 're no longer contacting them is admirable confidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and spending much of their time thinking of us . That would really be nice ! <p> But mind games are not appealing to everyone , and your ex may either be turned off or play along to teach you a lesson . " <p> See , this last sentence is what I could n't put into words . That is exactly my " stupid feeling " into words . Afraid of turn him off completely for acting like this . WHAT DO YOU THINK LOOKING AT IT THAT WAY ? <p> Once again , I just wanted to let it out what my fear is . <p> I will try to follow your advice thou ! ; ) <p> Have a great day ! ! ! <p> LaRishaSun 4 years ago <p> Dear reader , <p> I truly believe one can find peace of mind through " the no contact rule " . When decided upon by both parties , it is the ultimate form of respect for you , the other , and the relationship that got broken . It is acknowledging that whatever comes soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not wish to extend your relationship on grounds other than love . Whatever comes after is most of the times not worth the attention , because it is a manifestation of mixed emotions and thoughts , or the lack of both . Like that , both parties use their right to calm down , to focus merely on themselves by applying their energy wisely in gaining new perspectives on ... well , everything actually , including your own self and the ways in which you and others around you can " relate " . It is an empowering feeling as you work towards new ways of independency . It could be a necessary eye-opener , even if you do n't  want it to be so . There 's enough time for everything , and there 's no need to rush into things . <p> For me , the " no contact rule " is all about learning how to get rid of the addiction to share love in the most intimate and intense way , and to give it all to yourself instead . That 's the tricky part for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel whole when sharing with someone you think deserves to feel the greatness you feel when being around them . <p> I instinctively chose not to have any contact whatsoever when the 6.5 years relationship ended in a somewhat open stance ( with him getting lost in existential worries , losing grip on reality and falling into a dark zone of negativity , mainly about himself but also consequently about his feelings towards the relationship ) . I stood by him for a while , offering the patient support I thought he needed , but without any result . I could not make any difference in this personal battle of his . The sudden silence between us , when still together , burned up the oxygen between us , and I chose not to get seduced by this dominant darkness . Because I dare to care too much , I pulled myself away on time . Were almost 4 months later , and yes , it has been tough . <p> We walked into one another on " month 3 " and chose silence as a way of saying everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sense and you trust your gut ( not the mind , not the heart ) . Although he wrote me that same night , I felt the time was still not right to reconsider the " us part " . Mainly because his writing reflected the fact that , as of yet , his mind and heart are in conflict . He feels strongly for me , but negative thoughts dominate . Like that , the last line says " I will re-disappear from your life , convinced that it is the better way for you to be fine . " It all sounds heroic and cowardly at the same time , does n't  it ? I wrote him back using a poem of Pablo Neruda , which also ends with an open stance , and treats silence and distance as new founded ways of love and communication between the two of us . For me it was a way of showing I appreciate his decision for being honest and reaching out , even if only for a moment . Although I have the will and the power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the us " in the air . I say this without wanting to sound too high-fly . Fact remains I feel as if were not yet done . Although I chose not to wait , and I am living my own life , this opening makes it rather unnatural for me to be doing so . I believe he should reach out once more , but I also at times feel perhaps I should make a step towards him . Some advice is more than welcome <p> Stronger 4 years ago <p> OMG ... dear friend ! <p> I know I should not be any happy about this , but TODAY he contacted my friend who introduced us ! He never does that . Never ! <p> My friend will talk to me later tonight of what he said . Briefly , she said he is NOT with anybody right now . He said good things about me , and that he is not ready yet for a commitment . <p> Well , I will let you know better once I find out . <p> 30 days TODAY the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago <p> Hello there , my names Liza , I 'm 20 years old and recently left my boyfriend . We were very happy and very much in love , were both 20 years old however I 'm slightly morrow mature . He recently went to Germany on a course with his friends and was very selfish whilst he was a way and came back a different person , someone who had very little time for me and just wants to go out . I think personally its just a phase , however shortly after this i found out i was expecting a baby . Since he 's known he 's fluttered between how much he loves me to saying he ca n't do this , he 's confused not only about the baby but about us . After trying pleading and begging i could n't take anymore rejection i do n't want him to be with me out of sympaathy which he is basically trying to communicate . However before me expecting we were planning to get a house together for the 2nd time . I 'm hoping this is just fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no contact and have heard from once only to say my dad has tried to get through to me . Your advice would be greatly appreciated . <p> Confused 4 years ago <p> Hello .. I have a few updates and any advice or suggestions is appreciated .. <p> After hanging out with some friends ... I gave in and contacted my ex after 2 weeks of NC ... : / <p> I texted him a funny video I ran into and thought he might like it . He replied right away and laughed and said he seen that before then he asked ... how are you ? : ) we then texted back and forth a bit ... then built up some courage and said if he 's not busy we should catch up for coffee . He said sounds good . : ) Will let you know when I 'm free . Talk to you soon . : ) <p> Then when I texted him a few days later .. he texted me back .. <p> Sorry i just heard my phone ring . I have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for coffee yet . I still feel strange thinking of you as a friend , I hope you understand . Do n't worry I 'm sure I will come around . I just need more time . I hope that 's not selfish of me . I was thinking about it last night and was n't sure how I was feeling . : ) I 'm sorry if this is disappointing . : ( I 'm being a big sensitive woossy lol <p> I replied and said no worries ! He then said lol thanks for understanding : ) <p> Then after rereading his text again .. made me wonder what he really meant behind this message .. <p> I just need more time . I hope that 's not selfish of me . I was thinking about it last night and was n't sure how I was feeling . : ) I 'm sorry if this is disappointing . : ( so I texted him AGAIN after a couple hours .. <p> he replied and said just meant I was n't ready to meet up yet . Lol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't respond back to his text . Then 5 days later to my surprise , he texted and said <p> Hey there , just want to say I hope everything goes well these next couple days if you still have to go to court . : ) hope you 're well : ) <p> I texted him 2 days later - thanks : ) <p> Now he kept quiet again .. should I remain silent until he reaches out again ? I feel like I reached out and he rejected my offer . I 'm so lost right now because I 'm not sure what he is thinking ... <p> HE contacted my friend ( which is not usual ) , the girl who introduced us to each other . He was asking about ME : <p> - he wanted to know if I was going to be at the event last weekend , which is about 30 miles away . He usually does not go to these events , but he did when we were together , cause it was part of what I was doing . Competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competing any time again ; <p> - he said he feels bad for what happened . He wish I would not be said ; <p> - He asked about my new house , if she has seen it yet . ( he broke up a day before my moving ) <p> - He wanted to go to that event last weekend , but did not want to make me feel uncomfortable . He did n't want or was afraid of ME to break down ; <p> Looks like he is thinking I will put up a show asking to come back . I believe he is afraid to contact me . Afraid of drama . ( I will never do that ) <p> And the bad or good part is that he mentioned : " I wish we could be at least friend so he could be around . " That just killed my expectations for having him back as boyfriend . The " friend " word . <p> BTW , I did NOT see him at the event , but he mentioned to my friend at the phone that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would go to another one in a few days closer to our location . ( so it means he has been CHECKING THE CALENDAR for these events , where he knows I will probably be ) . <p> Well , hope to hear your thoughts . <p> Thanks , <p> jennismit 4 years ago <p> Hi , my ex broke up with me 1 week ago . I contacted my ex the day after we broke up and begged him to take me back , but he said no . I know I should not have done that . So I started with the no contact rule . The 1st day of NC , I did not contact him , however he contacted me ! And we did talk . Not anything serious though . The 2nd time , day 5 , it had been 26 hrs since we talked , and he contacted me wanting to talk , again with nothing serious . But he did say that he still loved me , and wanted to hear from me , and that he wants to be friends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule towards him , because I do not want to appear desperate . But what does it mean when the ex keeps contacting you ? We have been talking , and I finally asked him if he thought we could ever have another chance . he told me yes , but only if it felt right ... I am really confused . Your advice is greatly appreciated Thanks ! <p> Author <p> C L Grant 4 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> Hi Jennismit , sorry to hear about your breakup . <p> The truth of the matter is that people treat us how we allow them to treat us . You really need to establish some boundaries . Your ex is simply keeping his options open . Do n't you deserve more than just being ' friends ? ' I know this will hurt , but he probably wants to ' hang out ' because he has n't replaced you yet . Do you really think he 's going to want to do that when he has a new girlfriend ? Remember , you want to be the leading lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to step back from it all and do n't have any contact with him . It 's not about punishing him , it 's about giving you both the space to evaluate your relationship and establish what it is you really want . As you seem to be on talking terms , you can even let him know what you 're doing , if you want . The No Contact Rule is not intended to be divisive . Just explain that you 're feeling a little confused about your feelings for him and would like to have some time to yourself , to think things through . <p> Use the 30 days wisely and keep busy . Make sure you take good care of yourself and throw in some beauty treatments . Spend time with your friends and do things that will make you laugh ... laughter is an amazing cure for a broken heart ! <p> Take care and let me know how you get on . <p> dam I 'm hurt 3 years ago <p> I 'm 28 and I dated my girl for 5 years . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has a problem with me doing bad things and not being there for her cause I live 6 hours away and she juss graduted from school n now working . I feel that even tho I do bad things just to make a living ( hustle ) I am not a bad person . And when she met me I was doing it to put her thru school . Now that she found her career she wants to be a different person . Which led to her mom not accepting me . Which led me to talk shit.bOut her mom . I made a mistake from wat I said and crossed the line . She was mad at me for 3 weeks den she gave me an altimatum . Either we break up or u move here with me . I said I ca n't juss move there and have no sour e of income . So it was like wateva . Then we agreed to see each other and I bout her a plane ticket o c me . The day bfore her flight we got into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ur moms a golddigger and such such . She was pissed said she wants to date other people n do n't c her marrying me . I 'm hurt ryte now and do n't kno wat to do . But I kno one thing I want her back but how and wen . Please help me . And juss bcuz a person do bad things does it mean he 's a bad person ? <p> dam I 'm hurt 3 years ago <p> O ye I forgot . Her bday is n 5 weeks . Should I wait till den to contact her . While I work on myself to b a better person ? <p> Author <p> C L Grant 3 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> @ Dam I 'm Hurt , <p> I think you already have the answer to be honest . You have 5 weeks to sort yourself out , if you want her back . I tend to agree with your girlfriend that you ca n't maintain a relationship indefinitely , when you are 6 hours apart . Lasting 5 years is incredible to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the sacrifice . <p> Even if you are not a bad person , you are doing bad things and your girlfriend feels uncomfortable and possibly embarrassed by this . Sometimes , people do bad things out of sheer desperation . However , for you , it is a way of life and all seems perfectly normal . I can only guess at what you do but ultimately , you could end up getting hurt or even sent to prison . <p> Well , the time has come to make some changes ! You need to decide how important your girlfriend is to you . Are you prepared to re-locate ? Are you prepared to find a steady job ? Also , how important are YOU to you ? ! Is this really what you want with you life ? Is this all that you think you are worth ? Do n't you deserve better ? <p> Realistically , these changes are not going to happen in 5 weeks . You need to think about what it is you would like to do and how you can achieve that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be working for you at the moment , but it is not a long term career option . Your girlfriend is looking ahead and probably thinking about creating a stable family environment . She ca n't envisage that with you 6 hours away and with no steady job . <p> Give your girlfriend some space and do n't hassle her for the next 5 weeks . It sounds as if her mother is constantly on her case about you and she is stuck in the middle . So , let her breathe . <p> Meanwhile , start making plans . What job opportunities are there . What training is available and what are the future prospects . Alternatively , if you want to remain where you are and continue hustling then that is your choice . However , your girlfriend is setting boundaries of her own ( quite correctly in my opinion ) and is letting you know what it is she expects . <p> Finally , never ever criticize her mother , even if you think she is in the wrong ... rookie mistake ! <p> Best of luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dam I 'm hurt 3 years ago <p> Thank u for replying . U r the professional I 'm new to this stuff . But ryte I feel like pissed and wanting to go c her n give her beat down . Dats how I feel . Not gon na do it . The week bfore the breakup I asked her n a text do u love me . She texted yes and I care . On the day of the breakup I asked he r again . This tyme she said no . Then the next day sje goes on facebook and n a pic with her girlfrind . Says single ladies . After 1 day . I do n't have facebook so I got to hear from my friend which was embarrasing . I 'm pisssed . Is she serious ? How can u love 1 week and the next be a cold hearted bitch like that . Give me your opinion on wat she is tryn to do . I kno that sjes educated and all . But she treatn me like I 'm a nobody <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long one but a lot of important details <p> My girlfriend and I were together originally for 15 months . We knew each other for years and were good friends before we decided to start dating . We were even talking marriage and our future . We broke up for two months because we needed to hash out some issues and I guess we kind of did , but it was hard because during those two months we still always saw each other and hung out ( my girl roommate is a good friend of hers and therefore was always around ) . When we got back together , I had the mentality that I was going to do all I could to make sure she was always happy and never wanted to leave me . So , a month into being back together we found out her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer ( this was Jan. 2013 ) . She is an only child with a single mother who dad left her when she was really young . I was there for her support emotionally and mentally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did everything I could . I stayed around the weekend of the surgery . I even , went as far as to clean my exs room , shovel snow when it came , and any other chores they had me do . I did everything for her during these months . <p> She told me she felt like this was Gods way of telling her that " we were meant to be together " , and I felt the same way . We even went looking for rings , discussing a marriage budget and looking at potential houses to buy . After , the surgery her mom went through about 16 weeks of chemo treatments . My ex also worked full time at a daycare and took some online graduate classes . During these 16 weeks , I was there for her and offered support in everything , did everything with her and her family and even made sure she could have a good time . Through this time period , there were times were she would get really drunk and yell at me for literally no reason and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the rug until the next morning . Even smacked me in the face when I decided to finally stand up for myself and tell her she was being ridiculous . I know she was taking out her anger with her mom on me . The sex also withdrew because I know how stressed she was and I wanted it to be on her terms rather than mine . But she was never in the mood and tired ( understandably ) and only wanted to when she could , so therefore I felt a lot of pressure and never was really good ( at one point it was AMAZING ) . Anyway , I looked for an escape in sports gambling and therefore paid a lot of attention to my phone then her . She brought this up and I made conscious efforts to change and not be on it when she was around . Otherwise , I was always around and helpful for her . <p> So , come June 1 at our two year anniversary of all days , she decided it was n't working out anymore and broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week before her moms last chemo treatment , so I could n't even see her get better ! She said she did n't  having feelings for me anymore and did n't  think we were compatible . I was in shock . After all I did for her , she was going to dump me like this ? I ended up buying an engagement and even told her I was going to propose to her . She broke down cryingso for the next month she kept initiating texting me off and on seeing how I was and just wishing me a " good day " and finally about a month after the break up we met up for some drinks and I told her how I was feeling i.e. " emotionally abused and used for the last 5 months during everything that was going on " and she said she was " the happiest she has been since an adult " and wanted to " continue to find her happiness on her own " since she has been in and out of relationships for years . She and her friends know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and treated her better than anyone EVER will ( she has a lot of baggage and was very promiscuous before we were together , which I knew and accepted her and forgot her past ) . After a little fighting during the convo , I accepted the decision and hoped one day we would be together in the end . So , after this encounter I have decided to go NC and it has been about 3 weeks . I am still deeply in love with her in spite of everything . I understand the break up was needed as we both lost each of our identities and needed to take care of our selves and figure out our happiness . I became insecure , dependent ( obviously due to how close we were with her mom ) and lost some self confidence as I always felt I was walking on eggshells when I was around her . I have been working on myself and my confidence is higher than it has ever been . But I still absolutely unconditionally love her . <p> Does this sound like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually realize what she is missing and come back to me ? <p> I was so loyal and loving to her at her worst and during the hardest time in her life and do n't  get why she would give up that easily on us <p> jnick91776 3 years ago <p> ex is going to las vegas with his family next weekend . I want to break the 30 day rule to say " win the big bucks " which I did every time he went there . It will only be day ten , , , , is this ok ? <p> thanks <p> Author <p> C L Grant 3 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> No , because you will be sending out the message that everything is normal . The NC clock will be set to zero and you will have to begin all over again . <p> The No Contact Rule is not about doing what you 've always done . If you do that , expect to be treated as you always have been . <p> Best wishes . <p> jnick91776 3 years ago <p> thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read that people use the no contact because they believe that absence makes the heart grow fonder . If you are still together or are a couple that is fond of each other it makes sense that a little distance from each other will make the heart grow fonder . They say the key word is fond ... like in warm , caring , etc . <p> When you are broken up , absence does n't necessarily translate into fondness because many if not most break ups happen because one person or both , is no longer fond of the other or has n't been fond for a long time . Absence only makes the heart that is already fond grow fonder . If there is no fondness in the heart no amount of it will make the heart fonder . Because occasionally there 's a chance that no contact will make your ex miss you . But missing you is not the same as becoming fonder , especially if they are dating someone else . That 's why I 'm so confused , I see the point from both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust the No Contact Rule , it really works . The longer you manage to maintain it , the better ! <p> Heart Broken 3 years ago <p> Hi <p> I read your article , and it has really helped me a lot ! I was together with my ex for 5 short months , but I felt like we got really close , and I fell really hard for her . <p> She broke up with me 1+ week ago on the phone , but she started to push me away even before that . Already at the end of december I could feel something had changed . She told me it was because I had stronger feelings for her , than she had for me ... She did n't think that her feelings would change the same way mine did , and therefore could n't see a future together . I think I might have come on to her too strongly and shown too much affection , which could have scared her ... She was crying while talking to me on the phone , and I almost broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I went into NC to try and clear my mind . I have thought a lot about it and I still want her back . I think I can suppress my feelings towards her and slowly show more affection at the same rate she opens up for me . If given a second chance ... <p> A little extra info before I get to the problem . She texted me this saturday to ask , if I was at the asian new years party , where she was performing a dance . I did not answer as I was at a birthday party and did n't have my phone on me . I did n't want to write her the day after and explain either because that would go against my wishes for the NC rule ( I have n't told her about it ... ) <p> Anyway , the problem I am now facing is that , the night we broke up , she texted me saying that she would like to see me to talk things through sometime in the future . That sometime in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so it would be possible to find a day where we could meet up . I answered her shortly and politely ... <p> Was this a mistake ? Should I have kept the NC rule even then ? Or did I do the right thing , since we did agree to meet sometime . How should text with her to find a date ? Just keep it politely ? Act a little cold ? <p> Another question would then be . How should I act when meeting with her . Should I avoid talking about the break up , even when the subject of our meeting is the break up ? Should I stick to all the ground " rules " about meeting the ex ? <p> Extra info . I am the first guy she ever kissed or dated , which was also one of the reason my affection for her was so high . It made me feel special , but I forgot , that she does not have any experience ... <p> Thank you for taking the time and reading this . If there are any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The heart broken <p> Author <p> C L Grant 3 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> You only did NC for a week or so . That really is n't long enough and is partly why you are uncertain how you should act . <p> Being apart gives you time to reflect , gather your thoughts and get your feelings under control . <p> Your ex is clearly having second thoughts . However , if you go running to her , whenever she wants , then it is highly unlikely that she will respect you , or your relationship . <p> She ended the relationship , so she needs to make the effort to repair the damage that she caused . <p> My advice would be to keep busy and not to contact her again , at least for another 2 weeks or so . If she contacts you after that time then you can arrange to meet her for a coffee . Keep the meeting short , say 30 minutes , and just behave casually . <p> Your ex has to realise that she can not just walk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she needs to respect them . <p> Good luck and take care . <p> katie 3 years ago <p> I have n't been with my boyfriend for over 6 months , but for 4 months after the break up we still met up , we just were n't officially together , a few months ago we decided it was a bad idea to keep meeting up as my heart was getting even more broken ! I find it hard to stop texting him but recently I have made myself more distant and not text him first . <p> He text me a few nights ago , but he had been drinking . <p> I do n't think he even has any feeling for me anymore , he just texts me when he 's bored and there 's no one else to talk to . <p> I feel that I should n't reply but I find it really difficult . <p> I really want him back , it 's been so hard without him but I 'm not sure if it 's been too long to use the no cantact rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk shall I reply ? ? <p> Author <p> C L Grant 3 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> Hi Katie . <p> It 's never too late to start the no contact rule . You openly acknowledge that your ex only contacts you when he is bored or has been drinking . Do n't you think that you deserve to be treated far better than just a ' booty ' call ? <p> Even if you are n't in the throes of no contact , it is never a good idea to answer a meaningless text or one that arrives late at night . <p> No contact is n't easy . It is simply a way to get over your ex with your dignity in tact . <p> Start the no contact rule from today . It may be a good idea to change his contact name , on your phone , to ' lying **** ' ' or ' cheating ***** ' or something else which sums up his bad behaviour . That way , you will always be reminded of what he is , when he texts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assign a ' silent ' tone to his calls and messages so that they do not disturb you whilst you are moving on and enjoying your life . <p> Remember , never look back because you are not traveling that way ! <p> Best of luck with this , and stay strong . <p> dayita 3 years ago <p> HEllo ! I wanted to tell you that I really liked your article as you stayed always hopeful and positive but still honest . So my boyfriend of 2 1/2 years broke up about 34 days ago . Well I had asked him where the relationship was going and even though he has talked about kids in the past he seemed that it was something he did n't want to do just yet . I 'm not from this country and I only have so much time here on a student visa . Long story short we had a very good relationship and I honestly know he loves me but the fact that he ca n't make a decision drove me up a wall and I gave him time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him that I needed to know where we were headed . He said that it was n't fair that I had to keep waiting so he had to let me go . I said fine and gave him his keys and took my keys back from apartment and left him in tears while I did n't even look back . I was very hurt but could n't let him see me cry . I told him not to ever contact me again and that I could never be friends with him . His mom has contacted me and his parents and family adore me and even though she has told me that he is hurting I just find it hard to believe since he has n't reached out to me . On the 30 th day I contacted him via text because there was a horrible storm and since he works outside I was genuinely concern so he told me that he had been thinking about me non stop and that if I needed anything he could bring it to my place after work . Then I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care . He just said it was good to hear from me and to also take care . This is killing me inside but he is the one with doubts and sometimes I feel like too much time has gone by and he is not ever going to contact me . I 'm keeping busy working out and meditating . There are good days and bad days . I 'm also not dating other people , I just ca n't see myself with anyone else : ( . What 's your opinion ? Do you think he is going to contact me ? <p> Author <p> C L Grant 3 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> I honestly do n't know if he will contact you Dayita . <p> Saying that he was ' letting you go ' is something of a clichT . Similar to saying , ' it 's not you , it 's me . ' A coward 's way of ending a relationship . <p> Inside , you know that by not reaching out to you , something is wrong . If he truly wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing everything possible to win you back ... but he 's not . Sorry , I know that hurts , but reading your message , I think you are intelligent enough to realise that too . <p> Sometimes people do love each other , but want different things out of life . Sometimes people may want the same things out of life , but not at the same time . In short , you may both be reading the same book , but you are certainly not on the same page . <p> Please do n't rush to date someone else , especially when you feel like this . Keep working on building your inner strength and concentrate on your studies/work . You may not like this , but it is advisable to distance yourself from his family and friends , however close you were to them . Each time you hear from them , you are simply re-opening wounds that have started to heal . Returning home when your visa expires may also give you a fresh start , if that 's what you want . <p> Take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that your ex is unable , or unwilling , to commit to a future with you . Do n't accept second best . There are plenty of men out there who will fulfill your dreams . My very best wishes to you . <p> Heart Broken 3 years ago <p> Hi <p> I posted something 2 weeks ago , and you told me back then , that I should keep No Contact for another 2 weeks ( it was because I broke No Contact after only 1 week when she contacted me back then ) . <p> Those 2 weeks are now up , and she have n't tried to contact me since . Should I wait a little longer and see if she contacts me again ? Or should I initiate contact with her my self ? I know that she is very busy this month ( we are in the same dance group , so I kind of know her schedule ) . <p> Personally I do n't feel ready to face her yet ... I do n't feel that she misses me in any way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have time to miss me with her busy everyday life , and it hurts ... It hurts just as much now , as it did 2 weeks ago . <p> Hope you can give me some advice again . <p> Once again thanks in advance . <p> Brgds . <p> The Heart Broken <p> Author <p> C L Grant 3 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> Hi Heart Broken ... sorry to hear you 're still hurting . <p> The reason it is suggested that you maintain no contact for 30 days , is because that is how long it typically takes to break a habit . <p> When you break the cycle , the ' cravings ' return with a vengeance , and can often feel much worse than when you first started NC . <p> Due to all the hype on the web about NC , many begin it with the sole intention of winning their ex back . While that is a perfectly normally reaction , it is not a healthy way to view or start NC . <p> You have actually stated the solution to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex ' does n't have time to miss ' you with her ' busy everyday life . ' This is what you should be emulating . If you have too much time to brood then it is normal to keep thinking of your ex . You should n't be sitting at home , clock-watching , waiting for your ex to call . <p> Get your diary out and fill it up ! Arrange to meet friends , start new hobbies , go to the gym , stay on late at work , start that D.I.Y . project that you have been putting off , get your hair cut , etc etc . You need to concentrate on what 's next , rather than what has gone . <p> Hope this helps , but you have to take control of your life . NC is not about your ex , it is all about you ! <p> Take care . <p> featherhead 3 years ago <p> Hey ! <p> I found your article very insightful and helpful ! Hopefully , I 'll take your sound advice on board , but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mammoth task ! <p> Myself and my boyfriend had our first break up about a month ago as he really let me down . I suggested we call it quits in the hope that he would fight for us and prove to me that his actions could speak louder than his words . However , he agreed and said he needed to be on his own indefinitely . I was devastated and pushed him for a reason and he said he did n't love me anymore . Yet , the next day , he messaged me and said he 'd made a huge mistake and that he did love me and I was his best friend . I was delighted to hear this , but also so upset that he could lie about something so important . We struggled through for a couple of weeks , until I realised that things had n't really changed . The same problem was there ; he still was n't making enough of an effort . <p> So thinking I was making the right decision , I broke up with him again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I loved him too much for him to resent me for always nagging him to do better and for me to resent him for not making enough of an effort . <p> However , a couple of days later , I texted him , telling him I loved him and missed him so much it hurt and I was willing to fight for what we had , give him the time he needed to work through his anxiety issues and show me he loved me . But he said he needed to be his own and that it was n't right that I was willing to get back with him , when he had n't shown me that he deserved it . So I said I respected that and I 'd leave him be . <p> A few days later , I got in touch and asked could he pop out of work for a few mins for a chat . I just wanted to see him to give him a hug and wish him well as everything to do with the breakup had been done over the phone up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest , I was hoping once again that he 'd fight for me/us , but he did n't . He did n't say much at all . <p> Nearly a week later , I got in touch again and asked could we meet up to talk as I felt I could n't move on/start the no contact rule till we thrashed things out . He agreed . However , it was awful . He was incredibly cold and hurtful towards me . So out of character for him ! When I said I 'd never had a bond with anyone like I had with him , he told me he 'd a similar bond with a n ex that he 'd never mentioned before till then . When I asked him , did he miss me , he told me he did n't . When I told him I loved him , he looked me in the eye and said he did n't . I was crushed and in order to make sense of what was happening , I lost control and got crazy ! <p> I insisted on leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ! Before he left , he said he needed to go to the toilet so I followed him there and went to the toilet myself . We both came out together and understandably , he was getting freaked out . I was about to leave with him , when I realised I 'd left my hat where we 'd been seating . When I went to get it , I realised I was being CRAZY and to that I need to respect his wishes ans leave him be . <p> I am so mortified and ashamed that I behaved with such little dignity ! I cringe every time I think about it . And feel I may have ruined our chance of ever getting back together ! Do you think I have ? The fact that he never initiated contact after the break up should have made it clear to me that he was done ! It kills me that he seems to have got over me so quickly and is so much better than I at the NC rule ! However , I feel that by behaving so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for now it is over and I do n't have the same urge to contact him as I did before . I have n't contacted him in over a week ( seems so much longer ! ) But it 's hard , so hard . <p> trying2bestrong 3 years agofrom Idaho Falls , Idaho <p> 3 years I was with my ex and best friend . We called it quits 1 year ago . He had a hard time with my teenage son . For good reason . My son dropped out of school and had legal problems . He strained our relationship . We continued to see each other and talk regularly . My new found freedom got the best of me and before I knew it I was in a new relationship with a much younger man then myself . My ex found out and went off the deep end . I felt horrible . We still continued to talk and go to lunch on Fridays . I would lie and say I was n't in a serious relationship . I truly did n't even want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my and my family . Then things took a turn for the worse . New boyfriend kept catching me talking to my ex and now the trust is gone . I 've tried to breakup with him and even going into violent rages to get him to leave . He wo n't . <p> Not wanting to lose contact with my ex we continue to talk and laugh as usual but do n't see each other . I recently found out he has a new girlfriend . I text him and said , good for you . I hope you are happy . He calls me crying to the point he ca n't breath and tells me he misses me . I asked where his girlfriend was ? He said , right here , want talk to her ? She is fine with it . I was shocked and hung up . I called him the next day and he was fine . I told him we ca n't talk anymore , I think its best to move on . He asked me to please not shut him out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hard for me to see him with another girl . We did n't speak for a week and then I started freaking out cause I wanted him back . <p> I ran into them at a local bar ( him with hid new lady ) my friends made me stay and pretend I was fine with it . It was awful . My ex paid no attention yo his lady and played pool right in front of me instead of with his woman . She was mad ! I left and we did n't speak again for anothet week . I text him and said , it was good to say goodbye to you in person . He responded and said , yea I suppose it was good . I panicked and asked him to tell me that we have no chance of getting back together . It was hard for him to say it but he did . Another week goes by and nothing from him . I got drunk last week and called him crying and he listen to me and was crying too . I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bsck together ( among other things ) he said , let 's just take it one day at a time . He said he would call me the next day to check on me cause he was worried . Snd of course we would tslk again soon " silly head " He never did . It will be one week tomorrow that we spoke . <p> trying2bestrong 3 years agofrom Idaho Falls , Idaho <p> I moved out of my ex boyfriends house of 3 years a year ago the end of March last year . We decided to call it quits after numerous arguments about MY teenage son 's attitude . He had dropped out of school and was in legal trouble . It put a lot strain on our relationship . <p> We continues to see each other and even be intimate at time . Until I started to take more advantage of my freedom and started ditching him . All of a sudden I found my self in a relationship with a younger man that I really did n't even want . I was till in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new man . Although he is really nice I just do n't love him like he loves me . My ex and I continues to speak and go to lunch on occasion . We spoke on the phone and laughed , caught up on our lives and spoke of the good times . At this point I knew I needed to breakup with my new boyfriend . BUT he is n't going without a fight . I would lie to my ex and say I was n't in a relationship but he differently of course . I just hated hurting his feelings . My ex would call me crying all the time and even when we met for lunch it was always a tearful goodbye for both of us . He spoke less and less , but I would always hear from him once per week . A text that said hello hope your day is good and I miss you . I MISSED HIM TOO ! I hated the situation I was in . <p> I wanted to be single and try and work things out with my ex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told everyone he could , even my Nephew that he has a new girlfriend but still loves me . I text him and I said , good for you , I hope you are happy . He then called me bawling so hard he could n't breath and said I miss you so much ! I asked , Where is your girlfriend ? He said , She is right here , want to talk to her ? I was floored ! WTF ? ! I called him the next day and he said his new girlfriend is fine with us talking . I said we need to call it quits on out friendship . He asked me to please not shut him out , he wants to be in my life . We did n't speak for a week . <p> I ran into him and his new girlfriend out at the bar . My friends convinced me to stay and pretend to fine with that fact he was there with his lady . He ended up NOT paying any attention to her and was in front of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so uncomfortable that I finally left . NO word from him for another week . I sent him a text . I said it was nice to see you and be able to say goodbye in person . His response was , yea I suppose it was good . Then I panicked ! I said I miss you and I will never get over you ! I know totally pathetic . The tables are turned now . He use to call me crying and now i 'm doing it to him ! SO after that we did n't speak for another week . I called him drunk and BAWLING , and he started crying also . I said I know we ca n't get back together again and he responded saying , let 's just take it one day at a time . He was so worried about me that he said I will call and check on you tomorrow . His last text after we hung up said , we will talk soon Silly head , You are an amazing woman . He never called or text me the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since we have spoke . We have never gone more then a week before he would text me . I know I ca n't be the reason if him and his lady breakup . I want them to play it out , in the mean time IM so depressed and literally sick . He has control right now , I lost it when I begged him back . The rejection is HORRIBLE ! I miss him and I know he cares about me . Do you think this NC will work for me ? <p> trying2bestrong 3 years agofrom Idaho Falls , Idaho <p> I double posted . sorry <p> Author <p> C L Grant 3 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> Hi Trying2bestrong . <p> In all honesty , it sounds as if neither you nor your ex know what you really want and both appear afraid to cut the apron strings for good . <p> You both need time and space , to clear your heads , in order to work out what it is you both really want and no contact is ideal for this . <p> Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that you can or should be with them . Some relationships are not healthy and can be toxic at times . They can also stop you from moving on with your life . <p> From what you 've written , it sounds as if you do n't actually want your ex , but you do n't want anyone else to have him either . I also think the same thing applies to your ex , as far as you are concerned . <p> So far , your ex has always come running whenever you 've clicked your fingers . This time he has n't and it 's your turn to feel the hurt that rejection brings . However , relationships are not about power and control . That is unhealthy . <p> In your case , I 'm not sure that 30 days of no contact would be sufficient , and you may need to extend this to 90 days or more . You both need to break the habit of using each other as a fall-back and take the time to work out , once and for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hope this helps and take care ! <p> Author <p> C L Grant 3 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> Hi Featherhead . <p> As you say , you have been acting crazy , which is perfectly normal and is often referred to as breakup distress . The effects of a breakup tend to be a lot slower to impact on men than on women . In 30 days , you may well be feeling a whole lot stronger than your ex . <p> You ca n't turn the clock back , so just ' own ' what you did and move on . He has n't been knocking on your door trying to woo you back and you deserve much better than that . <p> No contact is hard , but it is about building inner strength and valuing ourselves . <p> Take care and good luck with this ! <p> u8908 3 years ago <p> Hi , <p> Thank you so much for your article . It is very helpful to clear my head of negative thoughts since I have started a NC period with my ex for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of fights and we were n't on the same pace . He had lots of intense feelings for me which was why all of the fights between us hurt him very badly . At first he asked me for a space which I gave him a few days . Then we were back together for a day and we decided to call it off since he was still hurt and he said it prevented him from investing in me wholeheartedly . After that we were friends but the emotions has always been there , very deep and strong . We cared about each other deeply and were very sensitive and concerned about each other well-being . Hence why I was certain that we would be together again when he is ready/back on tracks . <p> But around a month after when we discussed our feelings due to me feeling sad and depressed that we were still not together , he said that he wanted us to be friends and he was still in the process of self-transformation and not ready to be in relationship . At first I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and completely ignored him when we had to met in common social circle . But I was aware of how bad it made he felt so I decided to talk to him again . And we were back to being close ( but not in a relationship ) . From then we were always by each other side , very closely connected . <p> However recently I had a gut instinct that he was n't telling me everything . So a week ago , I finally determined to get an answer from him . And he admitted to have gone on to a few " not so good " dates and he kept saying they were n't anything serious , and if they were he would have told me . I could n't bare it any more so I told him that he made these decisions of going on dates and not telling me based only on himself and did n't even take into accounts of how I feel , while I fully deserve to know what is going on . I did n't choose to date any one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least ( it really felt like it was , but it could just be me ) , and i was n't ready to see anyone else because I wanted to love him . I was largely disappointed . So I told him that I wished the best for him and being friends is not working for me . He kept saying sorry and said he felt like he was losing me now and he did n't know how to deal with it . To which I replied " it is actually a relief " , which is honest because I was emotionally exhausted by the whole thing . He did n't response . And we have n't said a word to each other than . I did see him once since we have classes together , but i was a few minute late that day and so i just walked in locked eyes with him once and completely ignored him for the rest of time . I will still have to see him twice a week and I do n't really know how to act . Do you have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship . Also I do n't know if ages matter but I 'm a mature 22 but with few relationship experiences . He is 28 with lots of relationship experiences but lots of which did n't work out . I 'm a very first person he has a very intense emotional connection to just as or even more than with his serious ex of 5 years ago <p> Looking forward to hearing from you ! <p> u8908 3 years ago <p> I forgot to add that our relationship was officially 10 months but the whole things dragged till now which is 1 year and 2 months . based on the way he looked at me and cared for me I know he still loves me but I do n't know how to push him toward pursuing it . <p> In our last conversation , I told him that I had so much more hopes for our relationship than this ( our current situation ) and i thought it could have been way better than they way it is now . I do n't know if it counted as an disadvantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much again for the article ! <p> Impatient3 3 years ago <p> Hey there , <p> Great article ! I 've been following everything you have suggested . I was with someone for about 5 months . Everything was great when we were together , we got along so well , had a lot of fun together , and never fought . Ever . He was so sweet to me , as I was to him . In the beginning he would say stuff like I 'm one of the nicest girls he 's ever met , never met a girl that can cook , etc . Etc . As time went on , he stopped saying stuff like that . Anyway ... <p> We had the relationship talk , and eventually made it official . It never felt official though because he was always busy with traveling , his job , sports , his friends etc . I always felt second place . Eventually he started acting distant , and said he was n't ready for a relationship . So we went back to dating . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had time for me . I also know that about 2 months before he met me he just got out of a 2 year relationship . Apparently she lost interest and was n't too nice to him <p> So time went on , and I decided I was n't going to be his " casual girl " . I 'm 27 , I do n't have time to wait around for someone to want a relationship with me . So I had a talk with him , mature and calmly of course , no tears ( ones that he saw at least haha ) . I asked him if we were ever going to be in a relationship and that I needed to know where it was going . He said at this point in his life , he 's not ready for a relationship and does n't know when he will be . He said it could be a week , a month , or 6 months . So I told him that I could n't wait around and I could n't be his friend or talk to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he understood . He said as I was leaving that if he changes his mind or figures things out and wants a relationship , that he 'll give me a call . <p> It 's been a little over 3 weeks and I have n't heard anything : ( I have n't called , text , or emailed him . I got rid of stuff that reminds me of him , and I avoid anything that reminds me of him . I even temporarily deleted my Facebook so I do n't see anything that has to do with him . I 've been keeping myself busy with work , playing the guitar , dieting , exercising , hanging out with friends , etc . I still miss him and I 'm wondering if he just completely forgot about me : ( .... what do I do ? <p> Help me please 3 years ago <p> Me and my ex dated for a month in feb . Starting on valentines then broke up because we were n't ever able to see each other . This time we dated in April starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both times he was really cold , but last time we started talking again a day later and normal again 3 weeks later but this time he is a lot colder , more distant , and even told me to forget about him . That he wo n't hate me , he still cares , but we are n't going anywhere . I 've contacted him everyday for 2 days after the break up and finally told him I 'll talk to him after a while passes , but I 've told him that on the day of the break up as well . Right now . I do n't know if he still loves me . Because 4 days before the break up he said that I was his everything and he loves me but on break up he said that he does n't even have time for himself work full time and college and that we were n't going anywhere . What do I do ? He 's my first boyfriend and I really love him . He has always been so kind and loving but so cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break up he was nice the same him about it , but this time he is so cold . <p> Author <p> C L Grant 3 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> Hi there . <p> I 'm sorry to hear of the problems that you have been experiencing but it does n't sound as if your ex really knows what he wants . <p> Maybe he is under a lot of pressure between work and college , that is understandable , but if he really wanted to see you , then he would make time for you . If he 's not prepared to make that commitment , then he 's not worth your time and love . <p> Also , do n't just let him walk in and out of your life , as and when it suits him , and whatever you do , do n't become his booty call ! <p> You have n't been dating for very long and it 's far too early to be talking about loving each other . The feelings you have are most likely to be infatuation , and not love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is to just leave him alone and get on with your life . That 's essentially what no contact is all about . Keep busy , do n't stalk his every move and do n't contact him . Concentrate on yourself and your own life . <p> Take care and good luck ! <p> StayingStong 3 years ago <p> I met this handsome guy about 7 months ago , It was an instant physical attraction . I met him at my job and he immediately caught my eye . After he visited my job for a few days , the last time he was up there he told me I was a very beautiful women . I said Thank you and we went on . Anyhow we started dating , talking on the phone , texting back and forth and then we ended up having a sexual relationship . I was falling for him and was falling hard . We would see each other every weekend and then all of a sudden he said one day , I think we are getting too used to each other and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why he felt that way and he told me that he was scared and that he did n't want any commitments . I told him that I was n't looking for a commitment myself , that I liked hanging out with him and that we could just take things day to day . Anyhow it went on like that but i eventually started to notice him getting distant . Phone calls stopped , text messages stopped and we stopped hanging out on weekends . It got to the point where he would only come over if I asked him to or late at night . Or to watch a game or to drink , we stopped having sex and said that we were going to be just friends , but every now and then he would hold me or kiss me but that was it . Anyhow recently , he came over to my house and we were cool you know , he left and said he would be coming back later that night and never showed up . The next day I called him and was pretty upset and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me know he was n't showing up . Anyhow he stood me up twice . So i decided that I was done with him . No more phone calls or texts on my part . The following day he sent an early text message asking if I was at work , and I did not reply , then he called two hours later and I did not answer , I went to lunch and while i was at lunch he showed up to my job and left me a card . Then later called again and I did not answer again so he then sent a text saying that he was sorry for everything and that he would not bother me ever again . I did not reply and that a few hours later he sent another text message . I am very thankful to have met you and thank you for everything . I again did not reply and he called again later that night . I did not answer . Question is , do you think he will call me again ? ? And is it really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I ever talk to him again . At this point i 'm so lost and so confused . I have started the NC rule . <p> Hi , I was friend with my boyfriend more than 4 years . I had faith in him and believed that we get married . During those years we were happy with each other and did n't have real problem . 4 month ago he said he wants to get married with me , and he said before marriage let 's talk about our future life , and things that you expect from me . I really did n't say anything bad to him , whatever we said , we had talked about it before . There was just a social-religious related problem , that I thought he can accept it . But after 3 months talking he said I can not marry you because we have differences . I was shocked and told him I did n't know you have problem with this matter ! OK ! I accept the way you want me to be , I do whatever in this matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are more differences that we have and will caused us to take divorce after marriage . He told me I am not in his heart anymore ! he said I talked badly with him , an he did n't expect it from me . <p> His family also I know have sth. to do with our marriage ! And now they also disagree with our marriage . I think they have some bad influence on him , and take me out of his heart after 4years being together . There is only one thing from the first that was hurting me. that he did n't want non of his friends know about me ! He was telling me because we are not sure that we get married , I do n't want my friends know about my relationship now . <p> But after all of these things he was too kind to me until a weak ago that he told me let 's break up , your not good enough for me to be my wife and all of these happened because of your mistakes . <p> Now please tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love him . I believed him and made all my futures and dreams with him . He is my first love and I want him to be my last and forever love . <p> please advise me : ( <p> Shanmoo 3 years ago <p> Hi there , <p> Me and my ex broke up 2 months ago , it was me who ended it initially , which was down to me being depressed and misunderstanding things and overreacting . However when I realised my mistake , he refused to work it out . <p> We work in the same place and we have been backwards and forwards in contact , but met a few times and had the " talk " about what happened and why . He has blown hot and cold though . He would be affectionate one minute , then next minute saying he wanted us to be friends . I tried , but it did n't work for me , I just ended up chasing after him feeding his ego and getting hurt . <p> Many of our friends who have been watching and listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't know what he wants . <p> You know we were together 9 months nearly and never fought until that day we broke up . He said the only thing that went wrong was when I got depressed , which was down to me not being well at that time . When I looked at our text messages from that time , it was just 3 weeks out of those nearly 9 months , when it was difficult . There was a reason for that , and that reason is now gone . <p> I decided to call off the friendship and told him it is n't working for me at this time , but that I will be civil if I see him ( highly likely as we work in the same office ! ) . I just want him back . I only just started no contact and already its so hard . Ive been putting positive pictures on my facebook , me out at social events etc . We are n't  friends anymore , but my profile is public and we have shared friends . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a week ago to say I could n't be friends with him . <p> I often wondered if he is holding some kind of resentment towards me and this is why he wo n't get back together . Will this now just get worse ? <p> Alex 3 years ago <p> Hi <p> I broke up with my boyfriend on 31/5 and the last contact I had with him was the 5/6 . We both said some really , really awful things to each other as we both knew the areas that would hurt the most and targetted them . We are both hot head passionate people and small things seem to grow in to large agruements . However when it 's good it 's near prefection and when we got back ( in a matter of days ) after a previous break up we both realised it . I do n't know if I have a strength for a relationship with him and I have blocked him from my phone etc and I have a feeling he has done the same . However I would like to friends because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps I actually miss more I do n't know ) . <p> I need to find an inner calm at present and lick my wounds sort of speak but its hard . Your thought would be welcome . Thanks <p> tori 2 years ago <p> I am recently broke up from my ex who I was actually engaged to . We would have hit our two year mark in october . We moved very fast from the start . He cheated on me in November of 2012 with the mother of his children only one short month after we first got together in which I did not find out until months later and then i forgave him . But that did not stop me from constantly nagging and accusing him of things . I caught him in many more lies that involved women none of which I believe he cheated on me with but it really gave me insecurity issues but I always chose to stay . Over time out connection got lost and we ended up going to couples counceling where I felt he just was not trying anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up leaving and it 's only been about a month but I have seen him every week and we have relapsed a little but it has always been on his terms . Every time I do not talk to him he says I must be out being a whore or he hates me or he calls me names but the minute I respond he just is really rude . I understand in a lot of ways I pushed him away in the end with my insecurities and accusations and I ca n't take that back and I am having a hard time thinking that had I trusted him again we would not be here <p> I know I made the conscious choice to leave but I 'm really reflecting on everything as a whole . He says that he wants to be friends first and to have patience because we never were friends before we became lovers . But i feel that is just a way for him to keep me around while he goes and has his freedom . I am seeking counseling as well for additional help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is when I have relapsed already and since he knows if he keeps bugging me i will cave in I 'm allowing him to have his cake and eat it too right ? What should I do ? How would you go about your next steps . It is hard because we are under a lease until October which I have moved out ... Also I am very close to his kids that we had won custody of and the mother of his children are no longer around . I took on the role of a mother to them and when I see them they do n't want me to go . This has been weighing very heavy on me because I thought this was the man I would marry and he is not fighting for me at all and I just do n't know how to go about the situation anymore .

' He will not respect or value you if you let him use you as nothing more than a ' booty call . ' <p> He cheated on you and it 's not your fault that you feel insecure about the relationship . He also has to accept responsibility for his behaviour . Infidelity is extremely difficult to forgive and forget . <p> The only complication , as I see it , are his children and any access that you may want to maintain with them . I do n't know the details of the custody agreement and whether or not any legal rights were granted to you , or just your ex . Is it possible not to see them for a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is there any way that you can see them without your ex having to be there ? <p> The children should n't be made to suffer but equally , you need to consider your position and what will happen if he eventually ends up with a new partner .

What can i do to get him back ? <p> Don'tknowif ... 2 years ago <p> I do n't know if my girlfriend and I have broken up . She says we are still together . She says she love me more than anything , but I must admit I have recently been allowing my insecurities to get the best of me , causing us to argue more and more and now she goes a day or two without talking to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a couple weeks since we are still in a relationship ? I just think we need some space so she will miss me . I do n't feel like she is chasing me anymore because I am always being insecure . <p> Author <p> C L Grant 2 years agofrom United Kingdom <p> Hi Don'tknowif ... <p> What you have identified is perfectly correct ... people always want what they ca n't have , which possibly , is why your girlfriend is n't chasing you anymore . However , healthy relationships are a balance of give and take . Your girlfriend should n't have to ' chase ' you for you to feel wanted . Also , I 'm sure she would appreciate it , if you did your fair share of the ' chasing , ' from time-to-time also . <p> Furthermore , I do sympathize with your girlfriend . If your insecurities are causing arguments , then I probably would not want to get in touch with you either . <p> You need to take control of your insecurities . If they are affecting this relationship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship you have , in the future . <p> No contact would be great to help you become more independent and begin to value yourself more . It should never be used to ' punish ' the other party . Therefore , in this case , if your girlfriend does contact you , then I would be inclined to let her know that you are taking some ' time out ' as you realize that your behavior is not having a positive effect on the relationship . <p> Once you begin to feel more independent , and confident about yourself , then you may be ready to get back in touch with your girlfriend . <p> Best of luck with this . <p> Poxy 2 years ago <p> Hello , <p> First of all i will tell you shortly my story , maybe you can understand better what happened because i do n't . <p> I was studying abroad for 1 year and before leaving i started looking for information about the city and a place to live etc .. so i realised i have someone on my friendlist that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk more often , nothing special just friends talk . When i moved there after some days he asked me if i do n't want to go to his city and meet him , but i did n't feel comfortable yet to go alone in a new country meeting someone i do n't know . Anyway after 2 months of living there we kept talking and he said he could come visit me if i want so i agreed , and we meet , it was kind of awkward but it felt nice , after couple of week he came again and so on , so i guess we started " dating " he told me i was the first woman he 's ever been with . We went on holidays together and keep seeing until i came back to my country , followed that it was couple of months of silence , he was n't fine with long distance relationship and i did n't felt like forcing him to continue with me if he did n't felt like . But one day we started talking again firstly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come see me on winter holidays , i was happy in a way because i care so much about him and the fact that he freely decided to continue really gave me a huge dose of optimism . We talked about future holidays , he even said he would take classes in a future to learn my launguage. 3 weeks before he was supposed to come his dad passed away and we did n't know if he was able to come but in the end he said he needs a distraction so he came . We had the most wonderful days , we did n't spend more than few minutes without holding hands , caressing or kissing or talking , everything went smoothly . The day he left i took him to the airport and then i went to a friend 's place because i did n't want to be alone . After he got home in the evening we did n't talk much i assumed he was tired he had to catch up with his family etc , but days were passing by and he was n't even saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was wrong , he said he has a lot of stress with classes his dad 's inheritage and he checked hs callendar and he wo n't be able to come visit me soon . So i told him i could visit him . But i was barely reciving any reply and one day i bursted out so he finally told me he does n't want to go on with this that he does n't feel like he can handle it or that ths does n't work put for him anymore . I do n't understand how in the afternoon we were together and in the evening for him it was already too much . It 's been almost a week since then , he is not a sentimental problem and he never liked to talk about feelings and these kinds of things so i did n't get any further information about what happened ... I feel so lost because i imagined we could have a future togeher , i 'm not a teenager anymore , we 're both around 30 . The thing that most kills me is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago <p> I need help . I dates this girl for two years . Just to put things in perspective . She is the type of person that needs her space . I always invaded her privacy and life . We would break up most of the time because i would overdo it without giving her space cuz i was scared to lose her . <p> Two weeks ago she started talking to a guy . She told me straight up . I cried and i begged her to not leave me . I would blow up her phone . I even blackmailed her with stuff she 's done in the past cuz i felt like i got screwed over cuz i got her the job and she fell in love with a co worker . <p> That being said . I still want her back not cuz of the reasons people think but because she 's actually a nice girl honestly and my best friend . I think shes just confuse . I think her whole family hates me and i think she does . <p> We hanged out one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life but that i would n't change and she wants to look forward . How do i apply my NC in this situation and would it still work no matter what situation ur in ? <p> Danielle 22 months ago <p> I asked my boyfriend if he loves he said he does n't know if he loves me ? i broke it off completely !

After he lost his job . A week later he stop texting and calling me . I would do all the texting and calling , and I would make the suggesting to meet up and hang out . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . he begin to get distant . I would give him space for two to three days . When I text him he would be happy to hear from me . He would even text me back .

He text me back asking if everything okay . but i did n't  text him back . the next day . i wanted to see him and spend sometime . but i text him and told him that i already had plans . because i did not want him to reject me or give me an excuse .

However I ca n't fool myself , personally my belief is eventually whatever happens happens . My ex is a great catch , she 's older than me . I am 23 . Our sex life was amazing . We broke up Oct. 3rd of last year . We last had sex this year late Feb . We both have seen or are seeing other people currently . She is adamant that we 'll never be together again . I believe she thinks she has summed me up . To a super clingy , irresponsible guy . I did n't have stable job in our relationship which I think was the root of our problems . I 'm looking forward to healing and time for myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head on until i 'll improve . I 'd be lying if said I said I do n't want to start fresh with her . I 'm not putting all my eggs in one basket . There is an old quote that says if the love is real set it free , if the love returns it was always yours . So I understand reconciled exes who end up making it are definite anomalies , even rare . I wholeheartedly rationally believe and feel my ex and I are the unique exception . Our compatibility was unusually intense , roughly for at least the first two months , our relationship was magic then . Basically what i want to know is how long should enter no contact for ? Having never done it before with this individual . I 'd like to ideally make a strong impression . So is a year is in the ballpark or when i feel i 'm 100% insight ? I 'd like appreciate your insight . Also if she initiates contact , then what ? Just completely undermine her ? <p> Maria 5 weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine voice mails so far Maybe three of them are concern that I may be sick or dead but not really because he can drive to my home in five minutes .

We met in 1990 and immediately hit it off . We were 2.5 hours apart . She moved to me in ' 92 for a year , did n't like my town and she moved back . We stayed together . I moved to her in ' 94 until ' 96 when we broke up.We both had young children , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and we both knew it .

We spent about 6 months together long distance as we had before . We kind of just stopped doing it . I do n't really remember why . I was disappointed , but not deeply hurt . It gets better . <p> Fast forward to 2015 . She contacted me again . We began spending serious time in 2016 . We discussed the future . Most of our logistic issues were behind us . Our kids are adults now . We talked about a future and planned how to best spend it . We agreed that her moving here was the best option . We laid out retirement plans since it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our " big " issue from 25 years ago . She said she 'd gotten over it and wanted to spend the rest of her life with me . We got engaged last Xmas eve . We have n't had much time together , VERY opposite schedules but constantly discussed it realizing that when she move here in fall ' 17 all would be resolved . We planned a vacation this summer and were making lists of what stuff we 'd be keeping from each of our households . All this until mid-May , last month . <p> In the space of a couple of days she stopped all communication . We had Memorial Day weekend plans . I did n't panic , but did send 2 texts asking if all was OK ? I called twice and it went to VM . I waited 10 days or so . She texted , " I 'm so very sorry , I just do n't want to do this " . I wrote her a letter describing what I could only guess the barriers were and told her though I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than happy with me . She texted she 'd call on approx. 5/23 , but never did . <p> I have n't attempted to reach her since . Anyone have insight ? I sure don't. 27 years off and on . Sort of a weird dance we 've had all this time . In our off times I have loved other women , so I know I can do that . Still , she 's my #1 and I miss her and our future tremendously . Help ! ! ! <p> Emma 3 weeks ago <p> I 'm so glad I came across your page today . I believe you given some really solid advice and I 'm definitely going through a difficult time . My ex and I have been broken up for 5 days after being together for 9 years . We lived together for 5 yrs until last September when he got a job promotion and took a job out of state .

We agreed I go and that we would make things work . 3 weeks after I left for school my ex was transferred back to our hometown and back in our house . We were fine the first three months with me doing all the traveling to see him . He made the excuse often that he does n't get two days off in a row to travel and I 'm 7 hours away . I felt him become distant in April but he also told me that he was ready for marriage . We agreed that It would be best that he move where I am at until I finish school and I thought we were all set . I went to visit him in May to find he now had a roommate and he had removed my photos from the living room . He brushed me off when I asked if he was seeing someone and had them at our home . While I was home I found out he has been hanging with a new female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had never mentioned her before and felt that our introduction while I was home was appropriate .

Although no contact is hard , it becomes less painful in the long run . The alternative is to keep hoping for a reconciliation and to jump every time your ex clicks his fingers . You must continue to respect yourself and establish boundaries . Better to find out now than later , when you are married and have a young family . <p> You have an exciting time ahead with med school . Focus on that and the opportunities that it will give you .

Being informed about what 's trending and what 's will help you avoid a faux pas when you find yourself staring ignorantly after someone cracks a joke about a silly trend like Owling or Horsemanning . <p> 2 ) Be culturally and ethnically open minded <p> Humor can be better understood by knowing the differences in various cultures , ethnicities or the lifestyles of people who are different from others .

Avoid too many Chaplinesque slapstick or cheesy romantic comedies . Instead focus on films and TV shows that play on intelligent , sarcastic , witty and subtle humor . <p> From Woody Allen films to Chris Rock characters , from Monty Python and the Holy Grail films to Little Miss Sunshine type alternative and witty cinema , try to soak in a wide range of humor . Well written iconic TV shows like The Big Bang Theory , Friends , South Park , Everybody Loves Raymond , Seinfeld and The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations can be infused with wit and humor . <p> 5 ) Watch live stand-up comedy shows <p> Watching stand-up comedy is an invaluable way to learn the about the body language associated with humor and satire . Witnessing humor live is all about sensing the reaction and pulse of an audience . By being a part of a live performance , it is easier to understand the finer nuances of what makes people smile , smirk , tickle or bend over with laughter . <p> If your city or town does not play host to stand-up comedy nights , the acts of international comedy maestros like Adam Hills , Bill Cosby , Kathy Griffin , Russell Peters , Dane Cook , Larry the Cable Guy or their likes can also be seen on YouTube or DVD . <p> 6 ) Learn to laugh at yourself <p> One of the prerequisites for having a great sense of humor is to be able to laugh at oneself . A certain amount of lightness in the heart and transparency in character makes it much easier to absorb humor . <p> Being too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular way or taking offense easily can become roadblocks in understanding humor . <p> Laughing at yourself will arm you with the ability to decipher between things that are funny and the things that are dull and boring . It will also help you draw the line between being sarcastically funny and sounding rude . <p> Creating original humor is more about picking up incidents from everyday life and giving them a comic twist . In mundane everyday situations , humor may not lie explicitly on the surface . But its true value is showcased when someone has the sense and understanding to point it out . <p> Observing everyday situations can be as simple as watching how passengers behave while commuting on a train , the expressions they make and the kind of banter they engage in . <p> Soon enough , you will get into the habit of effortlessly plucking out the comical and funny side of situations that may seem mundane on the surface . <p> 8 ) Get into the habit of manipulating conversations and awkward situations with humor <p> Sticky conversations and awkward situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be made easier with a dash of witty humor , which also serves as a good icebreaker .

Use them as a tool to steer and manipulate conversations your way . The art of getting out of awkward situations with funny lines is a part and parcel of having a good sense of humor . <h> How to Use Your Sense of Humor to Make People Laugh <p> 1 ) Be proficient in your language and develop a good vocabulary <p> Fumbling for the right words while trying to crack a joke can be embarrassing . It can ruin the funny side of a conversation . Whether it is English , Spanish , Greek or French , being in control of your language and picking the right words should come naturally . <p> Increase your vocabulary and have a strong grip over your play of words when you are trying to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the tender funny bone , whether it is to create ambiguity in meaning , a pun on words or a double entendre . <p> 2 ) Time your joke to perfection if you want to make others laugh <p> A good sense of humor and a strong command over language are of little value if the timing of a joke goes wrong . Knowing when to say something is as important as knowing what to say . It is highly situational so the best way to find out is to learn from experience . <p> Every time you say something funny in an attempt to make someone laugh , judge the reaction and think " Would it have been funnier if I 'd said it earlier/later ? " As you make attempts to equip yourself with the skills to be funnier , this deliberate introspection will help you time your humor to perfection . <p> 3 ) Control your expressions and allow others to laugh at your joke <p> One of the fine abilities of a stand-up comedian is to hold a poker face after saying something hilariously funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedy would cease to be funny if the comedian himself/herself started rolling with laughter . <p> Use similar logic in your personal life and try to keep a poker face after trying to be funny . Control your expressions and let the people be entertained with the tickling side of your conversation . <p> 4 ) Lose inhibitions of speaking to unknown people or a group of people <p> If your sense of humor is not getting due credit because you are shy of speaking out in front of a group of people , there is no way around it but to lose the inhibition . <p> Make deliberate efforts to speak out and better yet , plan for a moment when you are going to crack a joke in front of others . As time goes by , the need to plan will decrease , your confidence will increase , and your witty sense of humor will surface by itself . <p> 5 ) Display confidence when you crack a joke <p> When you crack a joke or are going to say something funny , say it loud without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language and make sure you get everyone 's attention . <p> Whether or not you can make someone laugh largely depends on whether you believe you can make them laugh or not . Like most other things in life , confidence plays a vital role in your attempt to bring a smile on someone else 's face . <p> 6 ) Do n't try too hard to be funny : Humor should come naturally <p> The ability to make people laugh is something that is cultivated over time and eventually , should come naturally . It is not something that can be picked up overnight . Like a true learner , try to soak up the above tips . Develop a witty sense of humor before you deliberately attempt to crack one joke after another . <p> Allow observation and experience to take its course and play along with life 's funny moments .

@@96276030 @476030/ <h> Feelings of Denial When a Relationship You 're In Ends <p> When a relationship ends , people go through the same stages of grief that they go through when they experience loss in other forms . The first stage of grief ( and one that you might experience again and again throughout the process of grieving ) is denial . A big part of healing when a relationship ends is working through the feelings of denial . <p> What is denial ? <p> Denial means very simply that you do n't want to believe or acknowledge that what is happening is really happening . <p> When it comes to the breakup of a relationship , denial can take many forms . Some of those forms include : <p> Denial that there is a problem . Before the relationship has come to its end , you may deal with the fears and feelings that are going on by denying that there is a problem at all . <p> Denial that the problem is serious . You may admit that there is a problem in the relationship but deny the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heading towards a breakup , you may deny that this is going to happen and assume that you 're just going through a tough time that will soon pass . <p> Denial that the relationship is really over . You may say the words and end the relationship but still deny that the relationship is really over . This can take the form of continuing to see each other ( and sleep together ) even though you'e broken up . It can also mean that you are n't talking anymore but you deny that the breakup is permanent and look forward to a time when you get back together . You may also deny that the relationship really needed to end and try to convince yourself that things were better than they were . <p> Denial about the intensity of the feelings that you have regarding the breakup . You may deny to yourself and others that you are as hurt by the breakup as you are . This is a defense mechanism that helps you get through the intense grief of the loss of a relationship . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is important to understand that going through denial is a natural part of the grieving process when a relationship ends . If it goes on for a prolonged period of time or results in serious delusions then it 's a problem but for most people it 's just a stage . In fact , it 's a very helpful and important stage for a number of reasons . Those reasons include : <p> Denial helps us get through the worst of the pain . If we had to feel all of our feelings of loss constantly while a relationship was ending then we would be overcome with sadness . Denial is a defense mechanism that helps us to process the loss slowly so that we can cope with it . <p> Denial gives us hope . We need to feel hope when it seems as though our world is crashing down around us . As a relationship comes to an end or as we deal with feelings of loneliness after the end of a relationship , the denial can give us positive feelings of hope . Ultimately this helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... which it will be even though the relationship itself may not survive . <p> Denial allows us to function . Instead of being crippled by our sadness , we are able to get up and keep going by denying that things are as bad as they seem . This can help us to maintain our normal routines which is ultimately good for us . <p> How to deal with your feelings of denial when a relationship ends <p> It is important to realize that denial is a natural part of the grieving process and to accept it for what it is . However , it 's also important to recognize when it 's gotten out of control . For example , if you 're hanging on to an old relationship for years because you 're in denial that it 's really over then you 're limiting your own life and the denial has become a serious problem . When dealing with your own denial over a relationship ending , keep the following in mind : <p> Denial is just a feeling and it has its benefits . Be gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope but also acknowledge that it may not be based in reality but instead in your own denial . Just be with the feelings without making too much out of them . <p> Listen to the other person . If you 're still talking with your ex or soon-to-be-ex then it 's important to listen to what they are telling you . This helps provide you with a reality check about whether they also have hope for the relationship or whether you 're just in denial about it . <p> Work with a journal to track your feelings . Make sure that you note for yourself what your feelings of denial/hope are about the relationship . Ask yourself what the evidence is for and against those feelings . This helps put things into a more realistic perspective . <p> Move forward with your life . You can not get through the stage of denial if you hang on to it forever . Take tentative steps to move forward as if the relationship really is over . If it turns out that it 's not , you can enjoy that fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a therapist . If you are having trouble with the end of a relationship , it can definitely help to speak with a counselor . This person can help you process your feelings of grief including the feelings of denial that you have about the relationship ending . <p> What about when the other person is the one in denial ? <p> Sometimes what happens is that we process the feelings of grief very quickly and the denial stage does n't last that long for us but the other person involved stays stuck in denial for much longer . This is often the case when you initiate the breakup ( although not always ) . It can be really tough when the other person is in denial about the relationship ending . You loved this person and it hurts to have to tell them over and over that the relationship really is over . If you 're in this situation , keep the following things in mind : <p> This is just a stage . The other person is dealing with a lot of feelings about the end of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind that they are going through the stages that they need to go through and that they wo n't always be this way . <p> Be kind but firm . If the relationship really is over , you need to reiterate that in no uncertain terms . If you see a future friendship one day , you can say that but you need to be very clear that the romantic connection is over for good . If you yourself are unsure , you need to say that you 're unsure but that at this time the relationship is over . <p> Do n't let your own feelings lead the other person on . Your feelings may go back and forth during this loss as well . There may be times when you miss the person and want to be with them again . However , if you are committed to the relationship being over then you need to work through these feelings on your own and not confuse the other person with them . <p> Working with a counselor can help you . You do need to process your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's denial of that . Working with a therapist can help you to do that properly . <p> Take action if the other person 's denial gets dangerous . In some rare cases the other person 's denial about the relationship ending can lead to stalking and other inappropriate behavior .

@@96276031 @476031/ <h> 5 Types of Friends That Might Not Be Worth It <p> Friends are important . You need to have them . They help you through the tough times and celebrate the good times with you . But the truth of the matter is that friendship is hard work , especially as you get older and need to divide your time between family , work and taking care of yourself . That 's why it 's important to learn to be discerning about who you choose to be friends with . Some types of friends are the type that are worth your time . Other friendships just are n't worth nurturing . <p> Here is a look at five common types of friends that you might be better off without : <p> The friend you always feel like you " should " call . This person is n't the person that you call because you genuinely want to know how he 's doing . You do n't call because you 've been thinking about him and miss talking to him . You do n't call because you 're having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say exactly the right thing . This is the friend that you call because you feel like you have to . Maybe you 've been friends for a really long time and you 've just outgrown each other but you ca n't let each other go . Maybe this friend really likes you and is always trying to make an effort to spend time with you and there 's no good reason not to like this person , you just do n't care that much about him either way . You should n't invest a lot of time in friendships that feel like obligations . You already have a family that you 're obligated to ; we get to choose our friends ! <p> Friendships of convenience . These are the friends that you have because it 's easy to have them . They 're the women who go to the same yoga class as you . They are the parents of your friends . They 're the owners of the dogs that play at the same dog park as your pooch . In some cases , these people actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the ones that you typically want to devote a lot of time to . Although it 's nice to have them as acquaintances to help with carpool and take your dog for a walk , these are n't folks that are going to be there for you when the going really gets tough . Of course , you 'll still enjoy spending time with these people since it 's convenient but do n't get so caught up in these easy connections that you nurture them when you should be nurturing your deeper connections . <p> The martyr . You know her . She 's always the one who is there to do something for you . She 's the one that you call at the last minute when your plane is late and there is no one else to pick you up . You do n't call her because you 've been friends for twenty years and that 's just what you do for each other ; you call her because you know that she can never say no to an opportunity to help . The problem is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you help her . She always has to one-up with you with how hard she works for you and everyone else around you . Admit it ; you 're hanging on to this friend because you know that she 'll do things for you even though you 're paying the price of feeling guilty about the friendship . True friends will do things for you when you need them and you 'll do things for them when they need it . It 's a fair exchange ; not a competition to see who is the best martyr . <p> The one who thinks she 's your mother . She always knows what is best for you . She does n't just listen when you have a problem ; she tells you how to solve it . She gets angry at other people on your behalf when you just needed to vent for a moment about how someone else upset you . It 's nice the way that she takes care of you . However , you 're an adult and you do n't need another mom . The way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your ability to take care of yourself . It 's not healthy . And unless you can find a way to create some better boundaries then this friend is probably not a friend that you really need to keep around . <p> The friend who is never there for you . It might be tough to be genuine friends with a martyr or a mother type but it 's even worse when the friend lies at the other end of the spectrum . This is the guy who always calls you at the last minute to do an errand for him and maybe even says " I 'd do it for you " but the truth of the matter is that he 's never there when you need him . He does n't answer your calls unless it 's convenient for him . He certainly is n't the kind of friend that you could expect to drop in on during an emergency . And yet he expects you to be there for every problem - and there are always lots of them . <p> These five friends might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be placed at the center of your friendship circle . As an adult , you really only have a limited amount of time and emotional energy to invest in your friendships . Those friendships should be sustaining , nurturing , caring , inspiring and loving . They should n't cause you guilt or stress on a regular basis . Think about who your real HubPages Network account . <p> Itisnotunhealthy 6 weeks ago <p> Actually , you 're wrong about the motherly friends . Some people do need a d want this , and it is healthy for some people .

Also , most of us do have these ' friendships of convenience ' - both parties see some good in such relationships and are being practical while setting out to accomplish certain tasks .

Maybe it is we who make them the martyrs and mothers that they have come to be seen as . We must also pull our weight and try to bring about the balance that the friendship needs . Chipping away at their martyrdom will perhaps lead to a gloriously equal friendship . <p> Great friends are often stumbled upon . When we always make choices , we may ignore the opportunities of making some wonderful friendships . <p> Thanks again . <p> Vaidy <p> imissukhan 7 years ago <p> I like this article .

There are many excuses guys and girls use to get out of a boring date . <p> Together with common ones like illness , phone calls and urgent text messages , this post discusses unique ways in which you can leave an awkward date halfway . From talking about your ex to behaving annoyingly to crying " find out how you can end a date without being rude or making your date feel bad . <p> 1 ) Start sobbing and excuse yourself without any reason : Just say it is personal <p> This excuse will make you look like someone who is emotionally scarred . But on the bright side , it will help you to leave a bad date halfway without insulting the guy or girl . <p> The trick to carry this off perfectly starts with acting slightly aloof . Take a bit longer to reply to questions and make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daze . Suddenly start sobbing and use anything you can get your hands on to wipe your eyes continuously . It will make it look as if you are fighting back tears . <p> When your concerned date asks you why you are crying , just say that you are sorry but you will have to leave . Tell your date that it is a personal issue and it is not because of him or her . <p> 2 ) Tell your date that he or she looks exactly like your ex and you ca n't handle it <p> A very genuine sounding excuse to get out of a date is to tell your date that he or she looks exactly like your ex . Say that the eerie similarity is making you feel uneasy and it is bringing back the frustrating memories of your breakup . <p> Your date will understand your situation and may even sympathize with you . As you excuse yourself you can conveniently tell your date that there is no point going out again because of the constant reminder of your ex . <p> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you need to be saved from the date <p> This is a handy trick especially if you are going on a blind date or when you have been set up by a friend with someone you have n't met before . Have one of your best friends lurk in the same area as you are . <p> Send your friend a text if you think that you need to be bailed out of your date . Your friend can suddenly show up at a moment 's notice . Out of courtesy , you can invite your friend and make your date a friendly affair . Or , your friend could use a fake excuse to take you out of there . <p> 4 ) Faking an allergy : Pretend that you got allergy to something <p> Allergies are not funny when they are real but fake ones can be very useful especially when you are looking for excuses to get out of an awkward social situation . Faking a sudden allergic reaction is probably one of the easiest ways to leave a date without being rude . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on some of the common symptoms of the allergy you decide to fake before you actually go on a date . Some of the common ones are <p> Allergy to pets and pet dander <p> Asthma <p> Allergic reactions to nuts in food <p> Allergy to milk products <p> Allergy to pollen <p> Faking stomach problems has been a favorite excuse for almost all types of awkward social situations . <p> 5 ) Excuse yourself to the restroom and pretend that you have a bad stomach <p> Faking a bad stomach is one of the most commonly used excuses to get out of dates and many other social situations . Ten minutes into the date and if you feel like making an exit , simply excuse yourself to the restrooms . <p> Stay in the toilet for about ten minutes and when you come out , you can quietly excuse yourself by telling your date that you have a bad stomach . You wo n't need to be rude and your date will understand your situation without feeling insulted . <p> 6 ) Excuse for girls : Tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use this , periods and cramps are a seemingly genuine excuse for women . Here is how you can pull this one off . <p> Interrupt your date when he is talking and excuse yourself to the restroom <p> Come out after a few minutes and appear uneasy as you start chatting again <p> Quietly tell your date that you need to leave because you have womanly problems <p> Tell him how sorry you are , although the guy will definitely understand because even he may not like to put up with a frustrated woman having her mood swings . <p> 7 ) Send yourself a text message to make it look like you received one <p> Use this trick to excuse yourself out of a date only when you have exhausted all possible options . Your date will probably figure out what you did , but even then it will be much smoother than having to be honest and telling your date upfront that you do n't like him or her . <p> Tap out a message on your iPhone and save it . If you think that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yourself . Act surprised when you cell phone beeps . Read the message and suddenly have a worried look on your face . Now you can use many excuses including <p> You got a text from your friend who needs your help urgently <p> The text was from your parents who want you to come home immediately <p> One of your friends is stranded somewhere and has sent you a text ask you to pick her up <p> 8 ) Behave in a way that makes your date leave first <p> If you do n't have the courage to tell your date that you want to leave , you can make your date leave by behaving obnoxiously . For example <p> A guy can annoy a girl by acting like a pervert <p> Drive your date insane by showing little regard for table manners , using your hands to eat and making a mess out of your food <p> Keep pestering your date to talk about his or her ex <p> A girl can drive a guy to his wit 's end by splurging on the most expensive stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of date until he or she feels like walking away <p> A guy can irritate his date by checking out other women while being with her <p> Set up a friend to call you when you are about fifteen minutes into your date . You can play out a situation depending on how your date is going . <p> 9 ) Get a friend to call you when you are about fifteen minutes into the date <p> This is possibly one of the oldest tricks in the book since the invention of cell phones . Before you even go on the date , tell your friend to call you at a fixed time which will probably be around ten to fifteen minutes into your date . <p> You can simply have a quick chat with your friend and hang up the phone if the date is going well . If you want to get out of the date , you can pretend that it was an urgent phone call and you need to leave . <p> 10 ) Start talking about your ex : Later use the excuse that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that will come out of your previous relationship is that you will be able to use it to bail yourself out of a date . Keep talking about your ex and act as if you are getting a bit too emotional . <p> Regardless of what your date wants to talk about , bring the conversation back to your ex and your previous relationship . Make it very apparent that you are clearly not over your ex . <p> Suddenly break into tears and excuse yourself by telling your date that it is not fair on your part to date again if you are still missing your ex . <p> 11 ) Spill a drink on yourself : Sacrificing your dress to get out of a date <p> Leave a date halfway without sounding rude by spilling a drink on yourself . Whether it is a glass of wine or a pitcher of soft drink , you will have to sacrifice your dress as you tumble and accidentally spill some over yourself . <p> Once you have visibly stained yourself with the drink , you can easily excuse yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted your crazy ex walking over and you do n't want to create a scene <p> Suddenly lower your head while you are on a date . Act as if you want to hide your face from someone who is walking towards you . Add a touch of drama by hiding behind a menu or using a purse to shield your face . <p> Pretend that you saw your crazy ex walk towards you . Excuse yourself by saying that if you do n't get out of the place right away , your crazy ex will create a big scene . <p> Deliberately ask your date his or her preferences in a prospective relationship partner . Then act disappointed and sadly tell your date that you are the exact opposite . <p> 13 ) Get to know your date 's preference in guys or girls : Quietly say that you are the exact opposite <p> This is a nice way to tell your date that you do n't think it is going to work out without sounding brutal about it . Get to know your date 's preference in guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . <p> Act as if you are sad and tell your date that your personality and interests are exactly opposite of what he or she would prefer to have in a potential relationship partner . Appear glum and excuse yourself by telling your date that you do n't think you are his or her type at all . <p> 14 ) Excuse for girls : " I hate sex " <p> Guys will generally become averse to women who are averse to all forms of physical intimacy including sex or even kissing . Stressing on the same thing again and again will probably make the guy leave the date halfway . <p> A girl can easily put off a guy on a date by saying that she hates sex . She can take the annoyance levels a bit higher by reaffirming that she does n't believe in hugging or even kissing before being at least a year into the relationship .

If a husband can have an affair and betray the woman he married , then he is capable of telling multiple lies , both to the wife and mistress . <p> ... in reality , mistresses are just ordinary women , not super hero villains intent on destroying the world and all the marriages in it . <h> 2 . She Probably Never Planned On Being A Mistress <p> Most little girls do not fantasize about becoming someone 's mistress when they grow up . Every adult is accountable for their actions - of that there is no doubt . Unfortunately , sometimes circumstances and poor decisions can lead to affairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any woman to get wrapped up in an affair with a married man and potentially lose her own career , credibility , friends , or even - in some extreme cases - her own life because of it . Not to mention , some women who have affairs are also married and have families of their own that they are jeopardizing by getting involved in an affair . <p> Many women end up being the other woman by having a " fling " with a man with whom they never intended on being with on a regular basis . They may or may not have known the man was married but they went ahead anyway , ending up infatuated or in love . <p> There are women out there that do n't have a problem dating married men and have little regret , but generally speaking , this is not usually the case . <p> Many times the husband will make promises that can string a mistress along until so much time passes that it becomes difficult for her to break it off . If she is in love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knows it 's wrong . <p> Source <h> 3 . She Gets Jealous <p> If a woman has become a mistress and if she knows that her lover is married , then most certainly she feels jealous . She feels jealousy every time he walks out the door , because she knows he is going home to another woman , and most likely a family . She knows her lover has another life at his home which she will never be a part of . <p> Unless she has a family of her own , a mistress 's life is usually pretty lonely , emphasized by the fact that her heart probably sinks just thinking of what her lover is doing at home with his wife and family . <p> A mistress definitely feels jealous of the time a husband spends with his wife and family . She feels jealous that he has children with his wife , and she feels jealous that he shares a bed with his wife . Some mistresses even have children with their married lovers . Imagine what a complicated web that must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her lover 's relationship with his wife is not a secret to the world like hers is . One thing that many mistresses crave more than anything is validation that her relationship with her lover is real . Sneaking around in secrecy is not the ideal for having a healthy , long-term relationship . <p> A mistress , like any other woman , wants her lover to be proud of her , to tell their friends about her , and for them to have the desire to tell the whole world how much they love her . <p> One thing that many mistresses crave more than anything is validation that her relationship with her lover is real . Sneaking around in secrecy is not the ideal for having a healthy , long-term relationship . <p> Jealousy is n't just for a wife Source <h> 4 . She Fell In Love With The Wrong Person <p> Well , this is a no-brainer , but unfortunately , love and lust are blind . A woman who ignores repeated red flags because of love or lust will eventually find out she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to this realization sooner or later . She may choose to stay in the affair long after she 's realized her mistake for any number of reasons including denial , fear , and , of course , love . <p> Falling for the wrong person happens to all of us . It happens to single women dating single men . It happens to women who fall in love with married men . It happens to the wife of a husband who is having an affair . <p> The point is , most likely the mistress already knows she has made a huge mistake and only stays in the affair because she thinks her lover wants to be with her and she loves him . Of course , some women may not be that emotionally attached to their lovers , but I would guess that most are - especially in long-term affairs that carry on for years . <p> Being a mistress is not glamorous Source <h> 5 . She May Believe There 's A Future <p> How many women fall for a man and believe most of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point or another . If a woman knows her lover is married or found out at some point after she already fell for him , then there is no doubt she has been sweet-talked and promised to hundreds of times . <p> It 's fairly common for a cheating husband to tell his mistress that he is miserable in his marriage and wants to get out . This may or may not be true , but whether or not he does get out of the marriage is another thing . If there are children involved or if the husband does truly want to be with his wife , then he wo n't make the steps to leave the marriage <p> A mistress has already placed herself in a vulnerable position , so if she is in love with the man she is having the affair with , she will make excuses for him , and probably suffers from deep denial . It may take months or even years for a mistress to realize that a man is not going to leave his wife for her . If he was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In an affair , no one wins Source <p> Hanging on to an affair in hopes that a man will leave his wife is something many mistresses do , and if there are years that pass by , she becomes more invested in the relationship , and also more comfortable within the lie . The affair becomes her normal . The secrecy becomes her normal , and in many cases , she will self-medicate or behave destructively to alleviate the guilt and shame . <p> Being the mistress is not glamorous . An affair may start out as a thrilling , romantic whirlwind , but it almost always ends up a depressing , disheartening situation . Mistresses are just like any other woman in the world . They do n't necessarily need to be vilified . At the end of the day , women who become mistresses are our daughters , sisters , aunts , mothers , wives and neighbors . <h> Comments 64479 @qwx924479 <p> sending <p> Cynthia 6 days agofrom Vancouver Island , Canada <p> A well-written and compassionate look at some mistresses ' journeys .

Thanks for commenting : ) <p> PanKaKe 4 months ago <p> It 's important to keep in mind that there are almost as many females who cheat as there are males . It 's mentioned in the article that some of the mistresses are married themselves . <p> To all the women , or men , out there whose partners have cheated or may cheat in the future , remember it is n't about you . You are not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to cheat and they never consulted you if it was ok to do so . <p> The fault is in the cheaters lack of learning and maturity on how to communicate in a relationship . They lack relationship skills because they did not see it from in their parents relationship , or relatives , and did not learn how to form relationships when it came their time . They drifted into relationships and hence they drifted out as well . Often sitting on the fence before they decided which way to jump . <p> If you look at your partners relationship history . You should have this discussion about yours and your partners relationship history from childhood to adulthood now before anything happens in your relationship . I have learnt how important this is as it something I did n't learn from my parents growing up . In a cheater you will find that they do not have the maturity to deal with issues in a relationship because of the lack of learning how to when growing up . There are many influence factors , when growing up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheater not knowing how to form and maintain close relationships . They learn to stick their heads in the sand , blame someone else , or hope it all goes away . They do not realize that if there is something they do not like , makes them unhappy , or that they are attracted to someone , that they should be discussing this in an safe and loving manner with their partner . <p> If all people in a relationship learn the art of loving , honest communication then the incident of affairs will reduce and stronger relationships will be formed . <p> Radtech109 4 months ago <p> This is total BS .

@@96276036 @476036/ <h> The Anatomy of a Woman 's Attraction <p> Although it has been known for women to be more verbal than men in communication , non-verbal signs still play a big part in successfully deciphering their thoughts . A glance or a stare can mean a thousand things . It can also mean she 's simply checking you out . <p> Instances of females saying too many words can lead one astray from the true meaning of her message . A good listener is capable of filtering what 's actually meant from what 's not . For instance , the reason why the question " Is she attracted to me ? " is often made a new thread in forums regarding relationships is because of the lack of understanding on how women act in dating . <p> The purpose of this article is to identify key points and cues on how women act , move and communicate their intentions through their body language .

This said , it 's often not enough to rely on how they gaze at you or how their tone of voice changes . <p> The following are the most prominent signals that can help in determining what she 's really thinking of . <p> By Veronidae ( Own work ) CC-BY-SA-3.0 , via Wikimedia Commons <p> 1 . Glances and Visual Fixation . In dating scenarios , eye contact is the first thing a man would usually check for to determine she 's into him or not . Glancing occasionally or even getting visually fixated at her date can be a positive sign . On a man 's perspective , this gaze can make him feel like he 's the only person in the room . <p> In a public setting , repeated glances can indicate that she 's inviting for an approach .

And yet it can also be defined by frequent glances indicating an invite or an acknowledgement . <p> 2 . Preening . The term preening was coined to describe the process of a woman " cleaning " herself when she 's close to someone she likes . <p> Preening includes but is not limited to the following : <p> She plays with her hair in a slow fashion or twirls it mindlessly . <p> She fidgets with her necklace or jewelries . <p> She puts on make-up or often vanishes to the ladies room to redo it to look her best . <p> She straightens her attire especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 .

A more obvious example is when she laughs at most of your comments that others do n't usually find funny . <p> 4 . Facial Movements . What does her face say ? <p> Dilated pupils are often observed from men and women who are attracted to their dates . It means that he or she is excited to have one another 's company . <p> On a more serious note , sexually attracted women will most likely have flared nostrils . It is a very common sign of arousal . <p> Lip biting can mean two things ; she 's very nervous and biting it stops her lower lip from trembling or she 's enticing you to notice her .

Well ... that woman , ended up telling me that she lost the twins in some kind of , " mountain climbing accident " . <p> I was not aware of this because my job kept me on the road often .

You should have asked to see an ultrasound . <p> The truth about habitual liars is that they prey on honest people . <p> This is why child predators prey on little kids because they are innocent . Habitual liars seek out adults who carry themselves in a childlike nature . <p> Hollywood makes appealing movies about liars comical at times , when in reality habitual liars can be dangerous . <p> Many movie fans enjoyed Jim Carrey 's Movie " Liar Liar " . <h> Liar Liar Official Trailer #1 - Jim Carrey Movie ( 1997 ) HD <h> How to Get a Habitual Liar out of Your Life for Good ! <p> Invite them to church , this is one way to get rid of some liars , but ... there are some churches that are filled with liars so that may not work . : ( <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " STERNLY " discontinue the relationship , for good . <p> Please feel free to share your liars anonymous stories . <p> Emunah <h> That Lying Dog ! <p> Can These Eyes Lie ? Photo of a dog . Source <h> We All Lie . But ... Wow ! Some People Lie Constantly ! <p> We all have told a little white lie . However , when fabrication goes too far it can hurt many people . <p> The Definition of a Habitual Liar : A compulsion to embroider the truth , engage in exaggeration , or tell lies . <p> Compulsive liar , perpetual liar , and Habitual liar , fall in the same category . <p> What causes someone to become a straight up liar ? Some adults are exposed to lying at an early age . Raised by parents who lie and who have taught their kids to follow suit . As adults get older they may lie for financial gain . <p> " Quite often the person who has been deceived knows that this type of liar has to a certain extent deluded him or herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group is those who lie a lot " and knowingly " for personal gain . These people may have a diagnosis called antisocial personality disorder , also known as being a sociopath , and often get into scrapes with the law . Lying often gets worse with the passage of time . When you get away with a lie it often impels you to continue your deceptions . Also , liars often find themselves perpetrating more untruths to cover themselves . <p> We hold different people to different standards when it comes to telling the truth . We expect , for example , less honesty from politicians than from scientists . We have a vision of purity about those who are doing research , while we imagine that politicians will at least shade the truth about themselves in order to get elected . <p> Why do we dislike liars , especially sociopaths , so much ? It 's a matter of trust . <p> How To Detect A Liar : <p> Avoidance of eye contact : Usually someone makes eye contact at least half the time they are talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking down during a specific part of a conversation , they may well be lying . <p> Change of voice : A variation in pitch of voice or rate of speech can be a sign of lying . So can lots of umms and ahhs . <p> Contradicting yourself : Making statements that just do n't hold together should make you suspicious . If you lie all the time , even about unimportant things , you are likely to have a problem that will eventually -- if it has n't already -- cause you real relationship , financial or legal troubles . Figuring out what is driving you to lie in the first place will help heal this self-destructive behavior . This may mean going into treatment with a therapist to discover why you feel the need to deceive . <p> " StatesDr .

@@96276039 @476039/ <h> 5 Signs Your Wife Is Tired of You <h> I Think My Wife Is Mad At Me <p> If you think your wife is mad at you , there is a good chance she is . Whether it 's your fault or hers or a combination of both is another matter entirely . <p> However , there are some telltale signs I 've noticed in my relationships over the years . I 'm not saying I 'm 100% correct here , but these sorts of things serve as a warning sign for me that the shit is going to hit the fan sooner than later . <p> Here are 5 the things to watch for . <p> Source <h> 1 . ) Her Behavior In Bed <p> Firstly , and probably the first thing that came to your mind , is sex . You and your wife are no longer having it . It 's been however long , you want her badly , and you do n't understand why she is n't sleeping with you anymore . This is the first and most obvious sign . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slither into the covers and sleep as far away from you on the bed as possible ? If so , there 's definitely something wrong . Whether you want to get to the bottom of it or delude yourself into thinking everything is okay is your prerogative . <p> What about when you try to snuggle up to her ? No reaction ? Not a good sign , dude . <p> Source <h> 2 . ) Her Facial Expressions <p> Facial expressions are a big give away . People actually communicate more with body language and facial expression than they do words . <p> First , the look of disinterest and boredom . If your wife looks disinterested or bored with you , she is . Either that , or she just does n't give a shit anymore . Either way , it 's a sign of things to come . <p> If your wife looks like she just smelled a fart every time you come home from work , there 's probably something you need to address . You definitely do n't want your wife looking at you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the front door . <p> I 've lived through this before . Not too much fun . <p> Jealous Face Source <h> 3 . ) My Wife Keeps Talking About Another Guy <p> Women are allowed to talk about other people . This includes other men . If you 're the jealous type , that 's too bad--it 's just something you 're going to have to live with , unless you want to give in to being a weakling and an emotional cripple . <p> However , if there is one specific gentleman your wife keeps talking about on a daily basis , hour after hour , that 's something that should concern you a little bit . Especially if it 's the first time it has ever happened . It 's not hard to tell when one person is infatuated with another . <p> Maybe you 're ignoring her , boring her , or not giving her the attention she needs . Maybe you 're in a bad relationship and your wife is just an ass . Still , this is something to look out for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keeps Starting Fights With Me <p> Couples are going to fight , there 's no doubt about that . Many times , it can be healthy for a relationship . Things get put onto the table , and problems are hashed out . <p> However , if the fighting is constant and over trivial things , there is probably something wrong with your relationship . <p> If your wife is shooting laser beams out of her eyes and breathing fire at you because you left the cap off of the toothpaste , then she 's probably not very happy with you all around . And if your whiskers being left on the bathroom sink is enough to send her flying into a murderous rage , something needs to change . <h> 5 . ) My Wife Criticizes Everything I Do <p> If your wife seems sarcastic or dismissive of almost everything you say and do , this is a sure sign she is bored , fed up , and sick of you . <p> I 'm not talking about joking around here , as many healthy couples can do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who sarcastically dismisses your hopes and dreams , cracks scathing jokes about your family , makes fun of your friends on a daily basis , and any other sort of thing along these lines . <p> I 've found for myself and many others that this is a sign that they want out and ca n't bear to be around you any longer . Again , whose fault that is I ca n't say , but no one should have to live in a situation like that , man or woman . It 's not good for either party . <h> So , What Do I Do Now ? <p> I 've not the slightest idea , dude . Sorry about that . I 'm just giving you things to look out for . Things you should n't ignore or brush off . <p> Maybe it 's time you have a conversation with her . Maybe it 's time for marriage counseling . Maybe it 's time that both of you move in a different direction . Something can and should be done , though .

@@96276041 @476041/ <h> Moving On After the Loss of Your Soul Mate ... <h> Moving on after the loss of your soul mate , is it even possible ? <p> How many of us have faced the reality of the death of a loved one in our lives ? Pretty much everyone , I would imagine . <p> Today , I 'm going to talk specifically about the death of a spouse and/or soul mate . <p> Physical death " although the doorway into another life for the person who has died " is still a doorway that we ca n't enter unless we ourselves die . Reading about near-death experiences or perhaps even experiencing it for ourselves does not mean we really know what life is like after our physical death . We simply ca n't . We were n't meant to know . <p> But one thing we 're always reminded of is the necessity to " carry on . " What does " carrying on " mean to the survivor who still has to cope with life here on earth without the presence of the person they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we supposed to do that ? <p> Accepting the Reality of Their Physical Death <p> Well , for starters , it means accepting the reality of your loved one 's physical death . His or her physical body died . Just because we continue to communicate with them in our hearts does n't mean that their physical body did n't die . It did . Their physical presence will never again be known to us . <p> We will never again be graced by their shadow , their embrace , their touch , their scent , their laughter , or the eyes that communicated directly into our souls when they looked at us . We will never again have that physical connection with them while we still remain here on earth . Their physical presence is gone , plain and simple . They are no longer able to be there for us in the way they once were . <p> This can make us feel incredibly lonely , sometimes to the point of feeling unsafe on all fronts . We can no longer share stuff with them . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we still feel very disconnected . Occasionally , we might ask God for a sign , any sign at all , that our loved one is okay and is hearing our never-ending dialogue with them ... but we never get definitive proof , at least not physically . <p> This is very hard , but we must accept that our loved one is not going to ever again materialize physically to us , no matter how much we pray . It is what it is . They transformed . We did n't . <p> Re-examining Your Own Faith <p> At this point , you must be wondering , " Okay , so what 's the point here ? My loved one died . I am lost without him or her . I still need that person so desperately . How could God be so cruel as to take that love away from me ? For that matter , how am I supposed to carry on ? " <p> Our loved ones have already learned all of the lessons they needed to learn while on this planet . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are meant to be ... they are surrounded by love and joy and do n't want us to hurt over the loss of them in our lives . Instead , they gently guide us each time we falter and keep reminding us , " It 's okay . I am surrounded by love , and you will also be surrounded by that same love some day . We are all connected . We are all one . " <p> Re-examining our faith in something greater than ourselves is n't all that difficult once we have lost someone dear to us from this physical world . In order to carry on despite sometimes miserable , lonely circumstances , all we need to ask is , " Did I love that person ? Did they touch my heart ? Did they make me feel loved ? " <p> If your answer to those questions is yes , then you already have your bigger answer . Once you connect with someone on this planet , you are connected forever . Love is more than an emotional response hardwired into our physical brains ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us through our incredible journeys ... with or without our loved ones . It is the essence of our lives . It is what makes us tick , and we would all die without it . <p> Living Day to Day " Putting an End to Our Pity Party <p> " Yeah , but how do I put one foot in front of the other on a day-to-day basis ? I mean , this is SO hard for me . How in heck am I supposed to ' carry on ' ? The love of my life is no longer with me ! Do n't you get that ? " <p> Yes , I truly do get that . What 's the point of going through the motions each and every day if our loved ones are no longer here to share it with us ? I mean , it 's a pretty empty life , right ? All we want to do is speed up our own demise so that we can be with them . Yes , let 's pull out that cask of wine or case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that we never had any control of to begin with . <p> That type of thinking is okay for a while , but only for a very little while . And I do believe that anyone who has lost someone dear to them is entitled to their meltdowns ... so long as those moments/hours/days of sheer agony and despair do n't transform into an entire lifetime of grief . <p> At the end of the day , after we have cried our eyes out and damned our wretched lives enough times , we have to start thinking about our own contribution to this planet and what that means to us . We have to come to grips with whether or not our day-to-day existence means anything to anybody . <p> Do you have a son or daughter you 've become estranged from ? When was the last time you called your elderly father or mother ? Did you make someone else smile because of your sense of humour ? Did you joke with a co-worker , friend , or a stranger on the subway ? What did you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are you aware that whatever small token of kindness ( without any hidden agenda ) you extend to another person is also helping to fortify their soul during their own tough journey through this sometimes brutal and perplexing life we all lead ? <p> Yes , your life has a day-to-day purpose ... even if you have lost the only person you thought could ever understand you or love you for exactly the person you are . You 'd be surprised by how many of the good things your loved one taught you can be easily extended to others . Pass on their gift . Share the joy . Make each day an opportunity to do at least one good thing for a fellow human being . That will make your departed loved one very , very happy indeed ... something you will be proud to tell them at the end of the day while you are talking to their photograph . <p> Finally , Give Yourself Permission to Love Again <p> " Love again ? I doubt it . There will never be another person on this planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one will ever replace your loved one in your heart , nor should they . But to forever close your heart to others would be a real shame . After all , every person on this planet needs love ... it 's so basic to our survival . And our hearts are capable of infinite love for as many people as we will let into our lives . Our hearts can never be too full of love . <p> If you allow your own soul to die inside , you are removing yourself from this existence and are living out the rest of your life almost like a prison sentence ... just crossing off the days on the calendar until you can be with that person again . In the meantime , all of the opportunities to connect with other souls on this earth are passing you by unnoticed . It 's no longer your loved one who has become a shadow ... it 's you ! <p> Would your loved one want you to suffer so ? Would they want you to waste the rest of the precious gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another person ? Would they want you to live in mortal fear of experiencing yet another loss of someone you dare to love ? Would they want you to feel guilty that you are somehow disrespecting their memory simply because you have found it in your heart to love someone again ? <p> We all know the answers to these questions . In every case , it 's an emphatic no . <p> I know an incredibly loving woman who has survived the death of two husbands , and yet still found it in her heart to love a third . Had she not done that , she would n't have had the experience of making someone else 's journey through this life as happy as it was . Her gift of love was blessed upon others three times ! Do those previous two husbands look down from heaven and say , " Gee , I 'm jealous that she 's with another man " ? No , they say , " Thank you for continuing to be the loving person that you are . That is why I fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> During the time she was alive , I saw such an incredible transformation in my friend , I ca n't even begin to tell you . His step was lighter , his eyes twinkled more , and his self-confidence soared . She truly was the " love of his life . " A love he never would have known had she shut off her heart to the world while she waited to join her deceased husband . She made an incredibly wonderful difference in the life of my dear friend ... and I thank her for that . <p> He says to me now , " When I die , I know that she will be there on one side and he will be there on the other . They will both be there to greet me when my time comes . " <p> At the end of the day , love always wins and living with a closed-off heart always loses . <p> This one 's for you , my beloved Shaun . Thank you for teaching me how to live with an open heart . I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 years agofrom Mississippi ( The Delta ) <p> This is such a beautiful post !

It 's all good and very much appreciated , for sure . <p> TruthSeaker 5 years ago <p> At first when I saw the title I was very doubting to how this will make peace with this dilemma that surfaces in everyone 's life .

Everything is just words and meaningless actions .... a temporary " fix " to get by for only moments . <p> On this earth , I lost the other part of myself . <p> And we can not be fully " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 years agofrom Nepal <p> Yes nothing in this world is impossible .. ! ! it is obviously hard to forget but again its not impossible either though its painful : ) if we follow your step then we will surely succeed .. ! ! very well written <p> Author <p> Marjatta 2 years ago <p> Hi RM , yes , I agree . There is nothing that can comfort one for very long after the loss of their soul mate . I am very sorry for your loss , as my beloved was also my fiancT . While the pain never ends and it always hurts beyond belief , it is possible to continue living out one 's own life mission with a sense of joy and purpose , and to discover what gifts of love you can bestow on the rest of the world ... even when you have this incredible sadness within . <p> Your beloved will always be with you . I 'm sure you must talk to him daily , as I still do with my angel , Shaun . He truly does guide my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could even get out of bed or face the rest of the world , I needed to accept that he was truly gone . Then I needed to put one foot in front of the other and share my sadness with family and friends . Finally , I had to make a very important choice : was I going to live out the rest of my days sheltered in my cocoon of misery or try to find some remaining happiness on this planet ? I chose the latter , and I 'm glad I did . <p> If I had died with him ( as I wanted to and begged God to let me ) , one of my very troubled children would not have had my support and guidance to get him back on the right path , a suicidal friend might have gone ahead and done the unthinkable without my friendship and love , and countless other people I have since touched in this world may have had very different outcomes if I were n't still here . <p> Those things give me joy , even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , companion , and soul mate . <p> May your soul find peace , knowing that you will be reunited with your other half when the Divine deems it so . In the meantime , you have a very important mission on this planet , even as stinging tears blur your eyes and you may not yet feel the energy to look around you to see where you are needed the most . Let your soul mate guide you in this . Allow yourself to feel little bits of joy here and there . Say , " Sweetheart , are n't you proud of me ? Look what I did today ! Look how I used what you taught me to be the guiding light in someone else 's life ! " He will be proud of you and you will feel his love envelope you with warmth , light , wisdom , and peace . <p> Kim 2 years ago <p> Thank you for posting this . I lost my husband , my soulmate , 5 months ago and I am struggling everyday . Everything you 've touched upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my everything ! He was the first guy I 'd ever been in a relationship with or even kissed . I met and married my true love . At only 30 years old , I am now a widow . I 'm just taking it one day at a time , sometimes minute by minute . He 's all I 've known the last 2 years especially . ( We were together 6 , but only married 2 ) I did n't think I 'd ever find anyone to love me for me and neither did he . Now I am completely lost . What do I do now ? Where do I go ? Having been so close-we loved each other deeply and completely , I feel like I have nothing left , no reason to go on or desire to . I 've begged God to just take me too . This pain is too much to bear . I do n't see a future anymore . All my hopes and dreams have been crushed and a big piece of my heart and soul are with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person I was . Reading your post gave me new perspective but I am still very much in the beginning stages of the grieving/healing process . I know he 's with me everyday because he 'd never leave me and always looked out for me . I talk to him everyday but not a second goes by that I do n't yearn for his touch . That is the hardest part for me . It is such a strong desire that I ca n't quench ! Just to be able to touch him or kiss him again . It 's so surreal ! I ca n't believe it 's true . It does n't feel real . This ca n't be my life . <p> Author <p> Marjatta 2 years ago <p> Dear Kim , <p> I am so very sorry for your loss . Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings so eloquently and honestly . Yes , the pain feels unbearable , especially when the shock wears off . Then you still have to put one foot in front of the other every day , even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to watch other people walking down the street and imagine that not one of them had a care in the world , and here I was silently screaming on the inside . It was all so unfair . <p> I watched our garden wither and die because I could n't bear to tend to the flowers we once enjoyed so much together . At five months , even the sunniest days seemed gray and gloomy . I could n't see much of anything outside of my sorrow . <p> I do n't remember the first day that I actually smiled at something , but it happened some time later . The clenched feeling in my stomach gradually started to ease for short periods and my urge to cry all the time also slowly abated . I started to realize that I still had a mission on this planet , for whatever reason , and it was my destiny to find out and embrace it . <p> I pray for your comfort and peace . You will never stop missing your beloved , and the sadness will always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be able to experience happiness side by side with that sadness when you are ready to do so .

I walked through the street without any direction , I almost got hit by a car . The pain is too much for me to bear . I was even asking God why would He gave me a perfect husband and my soulmate if He would just take him away . <p> Author <p> Marjatta 2 years ago <p> Dear Susie , I realize that there are n't any words to comfort the pain you 're in . It truly is a grief so deep that no one else can understand unless they have experienced it themselves . I remember doing the exact same thing as you ... walking around in a daze without any direction or focus . I did n't care about anything . My whole universe had fallen apart and nothing made sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow yourself to lean on others as much as you need to . Just take tiny baby steps , and anytime you have to pull the covers over your head and cry your eyes out , do it . Also remember that your beloved is still with you ... your closeness and love will never die . God bless . <p> Joe 2 years ago <p> I 'm sorry , but this is crap ! My soulmate died , and I tried dating again ! Problem is nobody is even half the person she was ! I accept the fact that the one person for me is dead , and there is nobody out there ! A am alone , and I accept it ! <p> Author <p> Marjatta 2 years ago <p> Hi Joe , thank you for sharing your thoughts . I am so sorry for the death of your soul mate . I know how it feels to have loved someone so deeply before they disappeared ahead their time . <p> Yes , dating after this kind of loss can be quite disheartening because no one will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , It 's often a struggle not to compare the new person with your deceased beloved - they will always fall short that way . <p> If your heart is bursting to share your love , there are many ways to volunteer your time and energy to a variety of very worthwhile causes . I recommend following your passion in this regard . <p> I do n't agree that there is nobody out there for you . Nor do I believe that any human being wants to be alone and/or simply accepts that state of affairs . <p> God put you here for a reason , and your mission is not complete yet .

Margaret did have two children of her own which she had re united with her daughter Tania after 20years and we had Christmas together on 2014-2015 . <p> It was mid Jan 2015 that we found out that Margaret had lung cancer from the X-Ray results . That changed everything for both of us. 10 days later she had a seizure at the shopping center and rushed her to Hospital to do a CT Scan of her head . The Doctor 's detected that there was a 2cm brain tumour in the front right hand side of her brain . The Doctor 's operate and was successful with the removal of the tumour . <p> When we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That destroyed her and I but she never showed it . Always positive and outgoing in her character . <p> Now and then , We spoke about if she ever passed away and I broke down many times in front of her as it was difficult to talk about it . Also many times not around her . She saw the impact it had on me and she never complained about one thing . <p> I looked after her even when it got really tough I never complained to her about NOTHING as I love her Unconditionally and It really did not matter . <p> I now feel that I 'm always falling and feel very lost with no direction at all . I feel that I do n't wont to be here not more . I sit back and look at the whole picture , Margaret did not have a true good life . She was married twice and they were abusive to her in different ways , Her life never turned out to be happy until we meet each other which was around July 2008 . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fairy penguin and my butterfly . <p> I am a passionate person in life in a general way and everything I do is with my heart and soul . I am not the same and there will always be now an empty part of me that would never be replaced or fixed . <p> I know that time heals but never for me as I have and I know that I have lost the greatest love of my life ............... There are no words to even come close to describe on how i feel or even how i am . <p> My frequency has been disrupted and my whole ora has been out of alignment ever since she has passed away . <p> May you find peace and love on your new journey and we will meet again as I have promised you my little mushie . <p> Margaret Eileen Staudacker 04-06-1959 - 07-08-2015 <p> LOVE YOU ALWAYS your honey bear ..

Being a Shadow . <p> Kay palmer 20 months ago <p> I after 3 years still cry over losing my husband , my true soul mate we were together 15 years . I had the heart rendering task of telling my little boy who was only 3 that the angels came and took his daddy.i do n't even want to go on without my true love . But I have to for the sake of our little boy . After he died I cut my wrist . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so angry and told me to look after our son and one day , when it was the right time we would meet again.since then I never think of ending my life but to carry on and give all the love I have to our son . But I am still so lonely . I sometimes wonder , who suffers the most . Just because I still live does n't mean I 'm the lucky one <p> Sabina 15 months ago <p> Thank you for your post . My soul mate was my only son . Reading your post felt like my son is answering my questions . The first time I saw him , when he was born , all I wanted to do was make him happy . I knew when he needed something before he could even talk . He died at the age of 22 , and for the last ten years of his life were the best time I ever had . I still remember that when he was 10 , he got scared because he thought I could read his mind . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can read another person 's mind . Also that we have been given a very rare opportunity that we know what the other one wants before they even say it . After that he started enjoying that connection because his favorite sentence was , " woman get out of my head " . We did not need words to talk instead we were able to read each other 's face . One day coming from work , I called him and told him to put hot dogs to boil . He told me to get out of his head because he had put hot dogs few minutes earlier . Another day I called his name because I wanted a cup of tea . Before I could even ask he came out of kitchen with a cup of tea . So many times something will tell me to get him a glass of milk and he would meet me on his way to get glass of milk . There are no words to explain how good it feels to have that type of connection or laughing so hard till your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing . After he passed away , my tenant told me that all they heard from our apt was continuous laughter . He was very kind , wise , and funny soul . <p> Because of all the reasons above , I kept asking how can I go on ? How do you survive if you are suddenly thrown out of heaven . Five months after his death I took in a total stranger , who has developmental delays . He is one month older than my son . His parents did n't know what to do with him . In the last four years , that young man has made major improvements . He will never completely recover , but I was able to get him diagnosed and treatment . I have been able to share my love , but I always cried that I 'll never receive/feel that love again . I can see that he loves me as his mother , but I ca n't feel it . I know my son is happy about it because he always said that I was the best mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not very confident about my English and writing skills , so I never took that seriously . Your answer to someone that " keep sharing your love even when there is a deep sadness " was very helpful . I know my son is around me because I was going to kill myself the day he died . He made the Teddy bear sing on its own . Everyone present was surprised because no one was touching it , but it kept singing from time to time . Then I heard his voice in my head saying , " momy if you kill yourself , you will never see me again " . That stopped me from that , but I was begging God to take me out . You are right my son 's work was done , but I still have lot of love to give . I know he guided me to your post today because I was crying and asking the questions that you have answered in your post . I know it is going to take long time for me to get over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also being my soul mate , he was my only child . Losing a child is a very deep pain because it is unnatural . I was supposed to go before him . <p> Also having him in my life opened my mind . I used to think soul mates are supposed to be lovers or spouse . I learned that they can be in any form , a friend , your child , your spouse etc . <p> CAIT 7 months ago <p> I just lost my fiance 2 weeks ago ... we had been together since high school when i was 15 . I am now 25 , alone , and trying not to break everytime i think of him . We have 2 little boys and its been hard to explain to our oldest he just turned 4 in july . As i was reading this i was somewhere between crying my eyes out and laughing because all of your intro quotes were literally what i was thinking . It has helped a tincy bit but i know it going to be a long time before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago <p> John is not my real name but that is not important . Its really hard when you lose your soul mate . I was married to her for 18 years and did the most stupid thing and cheated on her and wasted so many years of my life with the wrong women . She always stood by me no matter what and said I could come home anytime . A year ago she was diagnosed with Cancer and passed away recently . It has hit my like a mack truck and I am devestated and I hate myself for hurting the only person who will ever have loved me unconditionally . She was such a beautiful person , heart and soul . No matter what I did she stood by me and I never imagined I would miss her so much . <p> Not asking for forgiveness . I deserve none . Just sharing in the hope that someone will read this and not take their soul mate for granted until it is too late . <p> Krista 6 months ago <p> Sorry but sometimes the reality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there is no fix for that . It is just pain pain and more pain . The description of moving on and loving again is just so trite . Sometimes , one really does have a true soul mate . And when your soul mate dies , it is n't so easy to " move on " and find another to love . Sometimes , soulmate is n't some passing slogan - it is a real thing . It means that your soul found a match . And that really might only happen once in a lifetime - if you are lucky . Can you find other relationships after losing your soulmate ? Sure . But to pretend that it is in the same category , the same ballpark , as your true soulmate - that is just wrong . So judge me if you will but I am waiting for death to take me so that I can be with my soulmate . I do n't care at all about anything else . I am just waiting , hoping , for the Grim Reaper to show up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may apply to boyfriends and girlfriends and husbands and wives but not to SoulMates .

It will always be our own choice . <p> joanne 10 days ago <p> Awesome <p> Pam 37 hours agofrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The power of our spiritual " pure love " connection scared me . This was 1977-81 . We were broken apart . I literally have amnesia as to what happened . Soon I found out a jealous sister was involved in whatever happened . I blocked out the pain so deeply . Decades later , she mention that he had passed away . I had n't known at that time that I was walking around w/ a mental block 4 decades . I felt that she enjoyed giving me the news . That 's what triggered grief beyond words . Now , decades have passed &amp; I 'm grieving what happened . Because it was my sister whom I thought wanted the best 4 me &amp; because my soul/mind is acting like I have to NOW grieve what I had blocked for decades . I still do n't know how she manipulated this situation ? The bond we had made us as one person . We would get lost in each others eyes .. literally . We could kiss for HOURS . We would fall n2 a trance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of our soul love " trances ( ? ) . We did n't  realize the entire place was being closed &amp; we were the only ones left . We had to be " awoken " from trance .. LOL ! I do n't want to deal with whatever happened ? Is this normal ? Thank You

Source <p> Should I get my girlfriend 's name tattooed on my chest ? Is getting my boyfriend 's initials tattooed on my neck or wrist a bad idea ? Couples often get excited about getting each others ' names tattooed as a permanent symbol of love and commitment . Find out why getting such a tattoo is a dumb and stupid decision . Except in the rarest of cases , name tattoos are usually a one way street to regret and more money spent for their removal . <p> 1 ) Do n't mistake a tattoo as a real sign of commitment or true love <p> Many guys and girls make the mistake of looking at a tattoo as a sign of love . Do n't make the same mistake because a tattoo may be permanent , but it does not guarantee that a relationship will be permanent too . <p> If someone is forcing you to get his or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment as reasons , use these answers as rebuttals . <p> Tattoo is not a special sign of love , anyone can get it <p> Real commitment shows in everyday behavior , not in a small patch of ink <p> A tattoo may be permanent , but it is not a written contract binding you both in a relationship forever <p> 2 ) Your new girlfriend or boyfriend will never like a tattoo of your ex on your body <p> One of the biggest reasons why you should not get your girlfriend or boyfriend 's name tattooed on your body is that your new partner will hate it . The inking will be a nasty reminder to your new partner that you had committed your heart and body to someone else in the past . <p> Try to step into your new partner 's shoes and think about some of the questions below . <p> How painful would it be to rest your head on your new boyfriend 's shoulders , only to find that you are actually resting your head on his ex 's name <p> Would you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his heart <p> How would you feel if your girlfriend had her ex 's name tattooed on her bust <p> Would n't you hate it if your new girlfriend had her hunky ex 's initials tattooed on her bottom <p> 3 ) A name tattoo will stop you from moving on if you breakup with him or her <p> Without a doubt , having an ex 's name tattooed on your body will be a cruel reminder of your breakup . It will hold you back from moving on and every time you look in the mirror , you will feel the pain of heartbreak over and over again . <p> This sad reminder of a broken relationship will be worse if you have got your first love 's name or initials tattooed on your body . First loves are hard to forget and a tattoo will push you further into the darkest corners of your heart . <p> 4 ) Tattoo removal is expensive : Getting rid of your ex 's initials will cost you a lot of money <p> For all the intelligent people out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girlfriend or boyfriend 's name tattooed is that tattoo removal is expensive . <p> You may have saved hundreds or even a couple of thousand dollars for a beautiful tattoo design which has your girlfriend or boyfriend 's name in it . But remind yourself that you will have to spend the same amount of money if not more , to get it removed or covered up with another tattoo . <p> 5 ) Get a symbol of love as a tattoo instead : Something which does not have a name <p> If your girlfriend or boyfriend is annoyingly persistent about getting a tattoo , get a nice little design instead . Convince him or her by saying that the design can be your own personal symbol of love which defines your beautiful relationship . <p> Getting a design instead of a name is much better because if you break up , no one will know that it is a sign of your previous relationship except you . If chosen wisely , it can also be a tattoo which will look cool and you can flaunt it off . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not initials <p> Getting each other 's initials tattooed is a common mistake many guys and girls make in a relationship . If you must get something inked to symbolize your relationship , get matching tattoos done instead of initials . <p> Ask the tattoo artist to give you ideas for matching designs which will look cool even by themselves . This way , even your own design by itself can become a cool tattoo you can show off to your friends in the future . <p> 7 ) Name tattoos are tacky and dumb : Your friends will make fun of you when you get a tattoo <p> You must realize that getting a lover 's name tattooed on your body is a really dumb decision . Do n't be under the impression that it is a unique idea because it is actually one of the tackiest things a couple can do . <p> If you still decide to go ahead with getting initials tattooed , expect your friends to make fun of you . Do n't expect them to understand the deep meaning behind your new tattoo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are disrespecting you and your relationship . <p> 8 ) Your friends will make fun of you if you break up afterwards <p> You will become the laughingstock in your friend circle if you break up with your boyfriend or girlfriend whose name you got tattooed on yourself . Everyone who knows about the tattoo will mock you for making such a stupid decision . <p> The worst part about this is that you will virtually have no comeback to fight off silly jibes . You will have to succumb to their mocking taunts , which can be a cruel thing if one of your friends turns foe and decides to use it against you maliciously . <p> 9 ) You can buy a piece of name engraved jewelry instead <p> Intense feelings of love can drive people to do crazy things , including getting name tattoos . Do n't let it be yours . <p> If your partner is dying to give your relationship a symbolic form , go for name engraved jewelry instead . Suggest to him or her that you both can have your initials engraved on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bracelet or a neck-piece . <p> Engraved jewelry is a great idea not only because it will help you avoid getting a permanent tattoo , but also because it will look good as an accessory . For example , a black tungsten or titanium initials engraved ring will look good on men while a cute bracelet can become the perfect fashion accessory which a girl can pair with almost every dress . <p> 10 ) Some people believe that name tattoos jinx a relationship <p> Many people believe that name tattoos or ones with initials jinx a relationship . This is one more reason you should get such a tattoo even if you do n't believe in hearsay and you ridicule the very notion of being jinxed . <p> It is unlikely that anyone has ever come up with statistics and numbers to prove that tattoos jinx a relationship , but why take a chance . <h> Comments 64479 @qwx924479 <p> sending <p> khloekov 3 months ago <p> This is absolutely true .

She might be , subconsciously , trying to make you feel like she is really in awe of each and every word that you say . <h> 10 ) She Compliments You Way Too Often <p> Does she compliment you way more than what you deserve ? Her compliments are a way of flattering you to a point where you feel awesome when you are with her . <p> The next time she calls you handsome and hot , even when you know you are looking your worst , take it as a sign that she has a crush on you . <h> 11 ) She Deliberately Twirls Her Hair While Looking at You <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign that a girl is trying to get a guy 's attention .

Does she always excuse herself when she is hanging out with her friends so that she can talk to you in private ?

Although hard to describe , these raw vibes are a mix of nervous glances , edgy conversations , and uneasiness in overall body language . <p> You will literally be able to feel that there is a strong pull of attraction between the both of you . If these vibes are really strong , you will both feel yourselves gravitating towards each other . <h> 14 ) She Keeps Asking Why You Are Single <p> When a single girl keeps playfully asking you why you are still single , there may be more to her question than just curiosity . An easy way to find out if there is a deeper meaning behind her question is to avoid answering it and instead , ask the same question to her . <p> If she replies something along the lines of , " The right guys never ask me out " or " I really wish someone would , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is likely that she is trying to give you a hint . <h> 15 ) When a Girl Is Shy , She Seems Fidgety and Nervous Around You <p> A shy girl 's behavior might come as a curve ball that you can completely miss . She might not exhibit any of the common signs of attraction and instead , she could withdraw into the shell of her shyness . <p> This behavior is not unusual because if she really has a crush on you , her emotional state of mind will be a volatile mix of excitement and nervousness when she sees you . Watch out for fidgety hand movements and nervous expressions when you speak to her . 
@@96276052 @476052/ <h> Guilt Trip - A Form of Bullying <h> What Is a Guilt Trip ? <p> A Guilt trip is a form of psychological abuse . Some psychologists may call it emotional manipulation . I call it bullying . <p> There are those who are first rate experts at laying guilt trips and know exactly what technique to use to get their own way . And others do it on an unconscious level , due to feelings of hurt or anger . Whatever form you 're using , stop ! Take a look in the mirror , and ask yourself this question . Am I not worthy enough to receive the love and attention I deserve , without emotionally bullying others ? ' <p> If you need to lay guilt on your spouse , child , friend or sibling for any reason , think again . Do you really need to abuse and manipulate to get your way ? Do you need to drive your spouse into guilt in order for them to love you more ? Force your son/daughter to stress or consider suicide , so they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want them to follow in your career footsteps , because God forbid you wasted your life on the creation of this child so they can be different to you . And should your best friend feel like a traitor for spending more time with their new love interest than you ? <p> I myself have never been a fan of guilt trippers , will run a mile when I smell one , as they usually come across as needy , especially in relationships . Some of these people have been playing the guilt card all their lives . But beware , the person on the receiving end , could eventually turn their guilt into resentment . <h> Who Are Guilt Trippers ? And What Are Some of Their Traits ? <p> Guilt trippers will make you feel responsible for what they do , feel and have suffered . They dramatize situations and at time have a nagging nature . <p> The silent treatment or cold shoulder are another form of a silent guilt trip . Often the offending party expecting you to become paranoid to what you 've done or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some have had parents who have played the guilt game on them their whole lives . For not having been a good son/daughter , or good enough at school and comparing them to their friend 's children . And when they reach adult hood their parents may say things like Why do n't you ever help me ? Or You 'll be sorry when I 'm gone , ' Why do n't you visit , ' and the most famous of all lines , After all my sacrifices . ' <p> Some guilt trippers may be insecure and needy . They need to feel wanted , loved and appreciated , hence use this form of abuse to gain a sense of worth . <p> Some play martyr , always reminding you about everything they have done for you . They definitely know how to make you feel bad to get what they want . <h> Guilt Tripping Your Child <p> Now the worst thing one can do is lay a guilt trip on a child . Yelling and screaming about how disappointed you feel is darn right selfish and egotistical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mum ? Do you want your child to obey you because of fear ? Do you want to be another statistic who has lost their child to suicide , because you had such high expectations ? Or maybe you want to sit alone in a nursing home , wondering why your children do n't care . <h> Guilt Tripping Your Spouse <p> Constant guilt trips on a spouse are a sure way for a doomed relationship . Have you heard these familiar lines ? I do n't feel that you 're making time for me . ' You need to make a commitment and put a ring on it . ' or You never show me affection . ' Statements such as these are darn right na+ve , if not completely pointless , as they will only push your partner further away and close off emotionally . <p> If your spouse is n't making time for you , then make the time for yourself . If they 're not taking you out , go out with your friends . Take up a new hobby and keep busy . And Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip on you for not being available enough . If after five years of dating , they have n't made a commitment to marry you , they probably never will , maybe your constant nagging for marriage turned them off . Perhaps they do n't believe in a that piece of commitment A4 paper or simply because they 're not that in love with you . <h> Guil Tripping Your Friends <p> What about your friends ? Are you making them feel guilty because they have other friends ? Spend too much time with their boyfriend/girlfriend or simply do n't have the same social appetite as you do ? If so then stop . You 're only making this person resent you , spend time with you out of guilt and this friend will eventually pull away . And if you do n't feel like they have been a good friend , then maybe you should find some others who will be at your beck and social calls . <h> Do I Believe That Some People Deserve a Guilt Trip ? <p> Yes , Of course , these people : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> -+ cheats <p> -+ thieves <p> Yet some on this list may be sociopaths , and will never register this guilt . <h> Is Someone Constantly Laying a Guilt Trip on You ? <p> If you 're on the receiving end of a guilt trip and truly believe you have done no wrong , stand up to this bully . Their behavior may not seem that aggressive and could be deemed as harmless , but believe me IT 'S NOT . The emotional blackmail and manipulation of this person is a way of dominating you on either a conscience or unconscious level . <p> Finally we all have been victims or aggressors of guilt trips . You must remember that you alone are responsible for your own feelings , no one else . To depend on others to measure your level of happiness could only lead to disappointment . It 's also important to realize that using ' Guilt Trips ' is an unhealthy form of psychological abuse , may be self destructive and could eventually lead to a negative results . <h> Comments 64479 @qwx924479 <p> sending <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very informative hub you 've written .

Is there a specific way that I should deal with this ? I do n't  want to hurt her feelings bc I do love her and care for her ( which is probably why it works out so well for her ) but I 'd love it if I could get some advice on this . <p> Author <p> Cut The Bullshit 3 years agofrom All Over <p> Hi Chris , I 'm sorry that you and your siblings have had to experience this . We also must remember that people are not their behaviour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their upbringing and experiences . Your mother may also have a lot of deep issues perhaps from her past experiences which she could be manifesting towards her children . Anxiety , insecurity , fear of loss and abandonment play a big part of why a person may guilt trip . My advise to you is to come from a place of empathy and love , and perhaps try to communicate in a non aggressive way about how this has affected you and is affecting your siblings . But the most important thing to remember is , it is how we react to situations in life that matter . Why are you feeling guilty ? Is there something to feel guilty about ? A person can try and make you feel so many things , but it is your choice how you are going to choose to feel and react that truly matters . I 'm sure you care about your mother deeply ( I 'm not condoning her guilt trips ) but you must remember that your mother loves you unconditionally , you are her child after all and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hope this helps a little and good luck with it all . <p> lovedoctor926 3 years ago <p> Many parents do this to their kids .

A very good hub up and awesome . <p> savvydating 3 years ago <p> This is a common ploy among narcissists . In fact , you have pretty much described the disorder . Having said that , the difference between the guilt tripper and the narcissist , is that the narcissist has no empathy whatsoever , while the other might have a little , but not much . <p> Anyway , you are right , this form of manipulation is emotional abuse , plain and simple . <p> Basically , these people are experts at forcing others into a defensive position . If they are your parents , for example , it is hard not to engage because then comes the silent treatment . Thus , the recipients of this abuse are between a rock and a hard place , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This kind of abuse makes me angry , particularly when it is inflicted by parents ; this makes it particularly underhanded and revolting . With any other bully , one can stand up to them , as you mentioned , but with parents - it 's tricky , because they will retaliate in even more dreadful ways . <p> An informative hub . Hopefully , some of our less practiced guilt trippers will get the hint , and try to refrain from acting badly ! <p> Author <p> Cut The Bullshit 3 years agofrom All Over <p> Lovedoctor926 Yes parents are a classic example of laying guilt trips and sometimes do it unconsciously , maybe because they fear loss of control or could have had a guilt tripping parents themselves . Thanks for reading and your comment : ) <p> Savvvydating you make an excellent point about narcissists .

With exes , custody and getting over the past , a second marriage can seem so complicated . <p> In fact , over 25% of marriages do n't make it the second time around , and it 's easy to figure out why . First , there is the other spouse hanging around , even if it 's just in memory , and the knowledge that your husband or wife has already gone down this path with someone else . Second marriages often have children that are hurting from all the changes , as well as legal and financial complications . <h> 1 . Let Go of the Past <p> This applies to both of you . You have to let go of what happened in your first marriage or previous relationships . And you have to let go of worrying about what happened in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean talking about it . Maybe to your spouse , maybe just to a friend . But do n't talk about it , with the intent of just re-hashing and complaining . Talk about it , with the intention of letting it go . <p> You might want to write about it , in a journal , or in poetry . This is an excellent way to work through your feelings , and no one has to see it . If you 're worried about snoopy eyes , burn it . One thing that i used to do was write on the computer , but put a password on the document , so I was confident that no one would be able to read it . <p> One of the biggest keys to letting go is forgiveness . Forgive yourself . Forgive your spouse . Forgive your ex 's spouse . It is in the past , and any bitterness you still have will poison you in the present . Forgiveness does n't mean that you approve , simply that you refuse to be controlled by it anymore . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating better tomorrow . <h> 2 . Put Your Spouse First <p> Put your spouse before anyone else in your life , before any other people , including the children . If you are a believer , put God first , and your spouse second . <p> Some people may have trouble with this advice , thinking that it 's not right to put the second wife or husband before the children , but it is the best way to achieve long-term stability for both the marriage and the children . When they see the marriage working , they can rest easy knowing they do n't have to go through yet another divorce and upset of their world . They 've already had enough of that ! <p> How do you put your partner first ? By always asking them about plans that concern one of you . By making sure that you have time for them within your week .

" Being a " second wife , " should not mean being second in importance , and if that message is conveyed , it can lead to a multitude of negative emotions . <p> Putting a spouse first does not mean putting children last . The children 's needs are of utmost important , and everyone 's needs within a family need to be considered . But children should not be allowed to use the second marriage to demand things that are not appropriate for them as children , just because their natural parent feels guilty . <p> An excellent rule-of-thumb is to give children as much leeway as you would in a first marriage .

Be Patient <p> Remember that it wo n't be perfect overnight. - Statistics say that it takes seven years for a stepfamily to adjust fully . So , do n't expect it to all be blissful in month , or even in a year . <p> There are a multitude of issues to work out with any new marriage : finances , household chores , lovemaking , personal independence ... these are some of them . Second marriages also add ex-spouses , custody issues and hurt from a breakup to the mix .

Meet Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs , as much as you can . This is n't always easy , and not always possible , with all the commitments you probably are involved with ( kids , work , housework , family and anything else , ) but it needs to be a priority . <p> What are his or her needs ? You need to be able to figure that out , and make an effort at meeting those needs a good percentage of the time . There is some literature out there on this topic , if you want to study this in-depth . The book , " His Needs , Her Needs " is excellent at explaining these needs , and why it is important to meet them . Or you can simply ask him : what 's important to you ? What do you want me to do for you ? <p> Men tend to need respect and sex . Women tend to need love and affection . Other needs will vary according to each individual , but the important thing is to take the time to meet those needs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called on this earth to meet our spouse 's needs and no one else can do that ! <h> 5 . Grab a Few Minutes <p> With kids and stepkids and trying to adjust to a new life , it 's often hard to find time to just talk and spend time together , but you need to . My husband works shift work , and when I was teaching , it was very hard to find time together . Now , we just find it here and there . Sometimes , it 's an hour of coffee talk in the morning . Other times , it 's a few minutes right before we go to sleep . <p> Ideally , couples should go out on a date once a week , but sometimes you just can not do it . So , grab a few minutes together , during these busy times . This will help to strengthen your second marriage , and help you to stay together . <h> 6 . Let Go of the Ideal <p> This ai n't no Brady Bunch , and this ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to terms with , as a perpetual idealist . Being in a second marriage is not the ideal . Period . It will never ill be . <p> As little girls , none of us go to sleep dreaming about being someone 's second wife . No , it 's always us falling in love with a wonderful man , getting married , and having kids . A second wife , someone else 's kids , and a divorce settlement were never in our dreams . <p> This is not meant to be depressing , but real . It is not ideal , and that 's okay . It 's reality , and it can be good , as long we let go of that other ideal that we had . Sometimes dreams can be bondages , if they stop us from accepting reality . <p> We might have dreamt about something different , but God allowed this . And now we can take the broken pieces and see what can be woven out of it . You may have seen a mosaic art piece . It is created by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once whole . Now , if the artist was to keep yearning after the tiles , or vases that were once whole , he could never concentrate on the new mosaic art piece forming in front of him . So , it is with our lives in second marriages . We need to let go of the ideal , and embrace the real . <p> Rule for marriage : Say I Love You At Least Once A Day <h> 7 . Say " I Love You " at least once a day <p> Say " I love you " at least once a day . Preferably a lot more . There 's something about saying those words that reminds both of you that you love each other , in spite of the challenges and the complications . My husband say it to each other , whenever we leave the house , whenever we go to sleep , and many times in between . I think it has helped our marriage to get stronger because it is a constant reinforcement of our commitment to each other . It helps even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it . It helps bring us back to the love we have for each other . <h> 8 . Get a Pet ... or some other project you can do together <p> Having something you can do together makes it easier to be a couple . We have cats . For the first year and a half , my husband did n't care for the cats . He was finally won over , and now the cats are something that we love together , that we talk about together . You need to have things in your life that you share besides grocery shopping , bills and the bedroom . Maybe it might be a project that you take on together in the community , or a game that you play on the computer . As long as you have things that draw you together . <p> Second marriages have built-in separation ( kid that only belong to one of you , ex-partners , separate financial history and so on ) . Therefore , things that bring together are especially important ! <h> 9 . Get a Life ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to sound like the opposite of the last one , but it 's really not . It is both important to do things together , and have things you do on your own . <p> Why is it important to do things on your own ? It is because you will need an outlet for the inevitable conflicts and problems that come up . This is critical ! You need to have things in your life that are separate from being a wife , or a husband , and are just " you . " Whether it 's going jogging , separate friends , a computer game , or knitting , just keep your identity ! This is critical and part of any healthy relationship . <p> Being " you ' will help you navigate the difficult times , because you will know that you are a valuable person , regardless of what is happening in your marriage . They will remind you of your identity , before you became a wife , or a husband . And this is important in staying together in a second marriage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , friends who did n't know the exes , and do n't know you or your spouse before.Friends that will not compare this marriage to the first marriage , or act like they have secrets from you , regarding the first spouse . <p> You might make new friends by joining a new church , or a social group , or just by meeting people in your daily life , and reaching out . <p> I 'm not suggesting that you dump the old friends . Not at all . old friends help keep you focused , and keep your perspective , but old friends are always friends of one or the other of the spouses , and therefore it 's not equal . New friends have known both of you an equal amount of time , making for a more equitable friendship . <h> Our Second Marriage <p> My husband and I , at are our wedding , with my grandparents . Source <h> Our Story <p> These are some tips for staying together in a second marriage . I hope it helps . Second marriages are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like anything good , they require a lot of effort . <p> My husband and I have been married for two and a half years .

And thanks for the blessings ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ontario <p> Thank you for the article , it gave me hope that maybe something can be made from my relationship with a man i love . we are living together for almost 2 years , both separated , not divorced ... I love him and dreaming to be his wife ... working towards my divorce which is no going to be a problem , my ex was abusive , sociopath , we are separated with " help " of police and court order ... so ... just takes time and money to get Divorce Certificate . Him - he is separated with two kids , they are living with his ex-wife- he said that he is comfortable in his position , he loves me and it is more important for him than to get divorce which is going to be expensive ... he also said that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me ... these two years ... they are full of bitterness and pain , we are trying to adjust our past and our present to each other .. But the fact that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 4 years ) makes me so unhappy ... it is tearing me apart .. create nervousness , anxiety .. i do n't know what to do ... I love him like nobody else in my life but i do n't want to push him for divorce ... and obviously ... I wo n't be able to be with him without finalizing divorce ..

He only committed to me fully after we had broken up for six months , and basically put the stipulation on the relationship that there would have to be a commitment for me to go on in the relationship . <p> I do feel so much for your situation , and hope that you can find a solution that works better for you .

I was a better husband to her because I had overcome many immature habits I had that I had in my first marriage ( which was 20 years long ) . I never left the toilet seat up and other such young man things . The experience left me with some " second relationship training . " <p> But , there were times when I would expect her to react like my first wife in a particular situation and she knew to say , " It 's okay , I 'm not her .

@@96276055 @476055/ <h> The Lady-Like Elegance of Sitting Gracefully <p> A lady who moves with grace and elegance is a woman of poise and beauty . But such a woman is not too common these days , and lucky you are if you hold one of the most cherished graceful manners of traditional women - the graceful way they sit . <p> The Lady-Like Elegance Source <h> How to Sit Gracefully <p> Sitting gracefully is sitting with dignity . Some may find it too prim and proper that sounds a bit strange in today 's fast and forward world . But believe it or not , it brings back the softness and sweetness so captivating of a woman . <p> Step as close to the front of the chair as you can . Turn and prepare your body for the sitting posture . <p> As soon as your back leg touches the chair seat , slide one foot back then gracefully lower yourself into the seat , slightly sideways . Your weight should be carried by the thighs of your back leg , not with your knees . <p> Sit up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can sit with legs in front of you , angle your knees to either left or right side , or cross your ankles , but never sit with legs apart , it 's a mortal sin to poise . If you 're crossing your legs at the knees , there should be no space between the heel and the other ankle . <p> Place your hands together on your lap . <p> Lengthen your spine , free the neck , and balance the head above the shoulders . In short , sit tall . <h> When Is It Proper to Cross the Legs <p> If you 've been asking the same questions , How do you really sit like a lady ? Do I have to criss-cross my ankles each time ? When is it correct to cross my legs at my knee ? <p> The answer is " it all depends on the length of your skirt . If you 're wearing a longer dress or knee-length skirt , then it 's all right to cross your legs at the knee . If you 're wearing anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the ankle . <p> Ankles crossed , as a lady should sit Source <p> When sitting at a social setting , a lady of etiquette will not cross her legs at the knees when wearing a short skirt . She will not dare to bring one arm to rest at the back of the chair , and she will never throw herself completely dunked in a sofa , regardless . She will always care about how she presents herself respectably to any situation and company . She will always sit gracefully . <p> According to the Institute of Etiquette , <p> " When sitting , a woman should cross her legs at the ankles . For one reason , it is not considered lady-like to cross one 's legs at the knees , especially if one is wearing a short skirt . " <p> If you 're in a social situation and in doubt , always err on the side of conservative - cross your legs at the ankle . <h> Sitting Gracefully Is a Woman 's Charm <p> While it seems fine to go with anything you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poise comes from within and it 's not something that can be taught very well just through words . <p> The " rules " on how to sit gracefully are simply guidelines and need not be that ironclad to make it fun and rewarding . Some women have an innate grace that just works no matter what they do . Sitting gracefully is behaving with a touch of class and it 's the lady-like elegance that 's just being the best that you can be . <h> Comments 64479 @qwx924479 <p> sending <p> Drjacki 5 years agofrom North Carolina <p> I LOVE this hub ... grace , elegance and sophistication are seemingly lost arts ... thanks for bringing that back to our attention ! <p> Author <p> Tonette Fornillos 5 years agofrom The City of Generals <p> Wow ... thanks too Drjacki .

I mean , really , those tight skirts that ends just below my crotch ... <p> thank you <p> Author 64480 @qwx924480 <p> Hello Joy . Wearing an incredibly short skirt or tight mini skirt , like that one you described , creeps up when you sit down . Either way of crossing the legs still gives anyone a view of that you do n't  want them to see , and worst is , it can lead to some awkward social situations . So its only best to wear the right length of skirt . <p> But if you have to wear such a short skirt , try wearing opaque leggings underneath . This makes you sit with grace and style without leaving any wrong impression about you . Modesty still comes most charming . Thanks for visiting , it 's so nice having you around .

Blessings and keep up ! <p> Leia Amidala 4 years ago <p> I feel that this article only applies to those wearing skirts and dresses above the knee so that no one can see your personal areas . If the skirt is to the ankles or even mid calf one can sit in any manner for it covers all personal areas and nothing is showing . I personally prefer the look of long dresses and long skirts . <p> If you notice back then ( medieval , baroque , 1800s , early 1900s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most dresses were quite long and women could sit the same way they they do in pants as everything was covered and there was no risk of showing anything . <p> I believe the reason why this elegance is becoming rare is because short dresses and short skirts have become in fashion which is a big turnoff for those who do not want to sit with their legs squished together all the time and find it terribly uncomfortable ( which I feel most people do ) . <p> Worrying about where you place your legs or leg positions was never a concern long ago and some of those were the classiest centuries . This worry has only came about recently when shorter dresses came into vogue . At first people thought that shorter dresses would be liberating but I think they are more limiting and restricting . I believe what is most elegant when wearing skirts/dresses is to have them long and not worry about your legs for all is covered just as it was back then . Long skirts and long dresses are what is truly liberating and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello Leia : = ) ... Yes , truly the style that has maintained timeless elegance are skirts and dresses that cover the knees . Women of those classiest centuries I believed were products of classic grace and elegance both in character and manner of dressing- something that how we wish can be achieved by our young women . <p> Its a bit worrisome that today 's getting shorter and shorter skirts already poses tendency of " losing " appropriate dress and social mores , and wearing short skirt is difficult to sit comfy with legs crossed without showing undergarments . So does it mean this is task for us to help return with graceful ways many young women can try to be like ? If probably the most beautiful manners can make all things easy , count on me , all the time ... lol . <p> Thank you for visiting and reading Leia . Loved your thoughts - you 're such a classy lady . Your ways are a lot many women will feel impressed by and maybe even secretly admire you . Keep up beautiful lady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may we help bring back those quite lost arts of long ago : = ) -Tonette <p> Leia Amidala 4 years ago <p> Thank you for your reply and yes I try to set good examples for people being elegant and relaxed at the same time . The best way is to set examples and , of course , write articles . lol Maybe instead of telling women how to sit in a short dresses it would be better to tell them that wearing longer dresses is the most comfortable . In long dresses you can sit knees apart and even cross-legged with no worry and look more elegant than those who sit uncomfortably in short skirts with knees perpetually together . I think people are slowly realizing that short skirts and short dresses are one big mistake and ditching them for longer , more elegant , roomier , dresses/skirts . <p> Author 64480 @qwx924480 <p> Hi ! That is a good suggestion , Leia : = ) ... you gave me an idea . How wearing long dresses can be most comfortable is a very good topic , perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While sitting elegantly suggests on the lady-like manner women could sit with class , wearing long dresses still is the classiest and modest of dressing . <p> Me myself do n't go for dresses that 's so skimpy-feeling . I may wear something halter-top comfortably , but not a skirt that falls above the knee - no way . Not that it 's not impressive but it does n't offer that , like you said , a relax n acceptable feeling . It 's so nice meeting you . Have a relaxing and fun weekend .

I was actually searching the internet for this Q &amp; A ... and came across this site . " How to properly sit at a Counter or Bar height stool when wearing heels ? " There 's a News caster on TV right now that is Hooking the heel of her shoe on the cross bar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe on the bar of the stool . Not sure why this is bothering so , but it is . Can you enlighten me-plz ? Gracie <p> BTW-It seems I need to reload my profile photo . <p> Author 64480 @qwx924480 <p> Hi Gracie , how are you ? <p> Most bar or counter stools are designed with foot rings to provide a place as footrest and where you can hook the heels . A comfortable seat back makes sitting in this chair a pleasure . However , in a bar height setting , its a little difficult relying for safety and balance with only a heel hooked on the cross bar when legs are crossed at the knees ( especially on armless stools ) , its only best to rest the ball of the shoe on the bar of the stool . <p> If you have to hook at this point , it is a good idea that either side of your ankle is leaning on the left or right frame . This serves some sort of a " grip " that offers stronger stance while seated , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heel . <p> I think its still easiest to slightly lean your legs to one side then cross your ankles , with one foot ( heel ) rested or hooked on the cross bar and the other foot is just behind the other ankle . This would not be as hard for you to keep your legs closed in that regard .

@@96276056 @476056/ <h> Love Language Physical Touch - Intimacy and Affection <p> Physical Touch is one of the five love languages . Perhaps it is not surprising that many may automatically assume this love language ( LL ) is only about what happens behind closed doors in the bedroom , but this is not the case . <p> Whilst lack of intimate bodily contact can lead to problems in a relationship , the same can be true when there is a lack of affectionate bodily contact , which could consist of a gentle touch of hands , walking fingers along the back , shoulder or arm , a hug/kiss when departing/arriving or a cuddle when watching a movie . <h> Affectionate Physical Touch - Examples <p> If you are not naturally affectionate in your platonic relationships , you are probably not very affectionate with your spouse either . However , if your partner 's primary LL is physical touch of the affectionate kind , although being touchy/feely may be out of your comfort zone to begin with , with time you can become much more at ease with performing a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or she will certainly appreciate your sustained efforts . <p> tickles <p> cuddles <p> a light tap on the nose <p> a foot massage <p> hugs <p> a shoulder massage <p> gently stroking of the hair , eyelashes , face <p> a light kiss <p> holding your spouse , girlfriend or boyfriend in your arms <p> nuzzling <p> tender caressing of ear lobe <h> Speaking Your Partner 's Love Language means <p> ... relating and interacting with them in the manner which helps them to feel most loved , wanted and appreciated . Couples may have differing languages and can feel very dissatisfied or unloved when their preferred language is not used enough by their partner . <h> Physical Touch in the Form of Marital Intimacy <p> For those who have this love language in the form of marital intimacy , they will likely want their partner to frequently <p> touch them in a teasing or provocative way <p> initial sex <p> show tons of enthusiasm , inventiveness and/or energy . <p> Partners of those who have physical touch in the form of marital intimacy should note their partner may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a mismatch of libido/sex drive . In particlar , much frustration and resentment can ensue if one person almost always has to be the one to initiate copulation so making a conscious endeavour to do more of the above would no doubt be welcomed . <h> Sex-Starved and/or Affection-Starved ! <p> What type of Bodily Contact is Lacking in Your Relationship ? <h> Sex v Affection <p> It can happen that a couple who both have physical touch as one of their primary love languages can be at odds because one partner , often the male , wants touch in the form of marital intimacy whilst the other wants touch in the form of being touchy feely in a way that would not be inappropriate with a friend or relative . <p> Some may find that their partner , ( often the female partner ) may not be inclined to desire marital intimacy when there is a distinct lack of affectionate bodily contact other than when their partner wants copulation . They may feel ignored in a physical sense until their partner is ready to have sex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them when they want sex and as such they feel like an object rather than a valued spouse . <h> On Reflection <p> Sometimes a person who has affectionate touch as their primary love language will actually refrain from spontaneously hugging , holding hands with their partner if they believe their partner always takes their actions as a green light for sex . Moreover , by not initiating the affection they want , their partner may then perceive them as unaffectionate and/or assume they do n't want or enjoy affectionate touch ! <p> Conversely , a person who has intimate touch as their LL may hold back from initiating the sex they want because they fear rejection . <p> If your marriage has the makings for these types of dynamic , do take steps to communicate and turn things around because , if such negative and hurtful dynamics persist for a long time , it has the potential to severely impair the relationship . <p> It can be difficult for a person who wants touch in the form of marital intimacy to reign themselves in when they try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouse because once they touch their partner they do n't want to stop , wishing to take things further into the realms of intimacy . If affectionate touch always turns into marital physical touch , it is then that the partner who has affectionate touch as their love language begins to feel taken for granted , or that their partner only wants them for one thing . <p> Thus it 's worth both partners making the effort to be conscious of what their partner wants and to act accordingly . This applies to life in general with your spouse and is not limited to this LL . <h> Physical Touch - Scheduled or Spontaneous <p> Often couples with differing sex drives may designate a certain day(s) of the week for marital intimacy and , although some may feel that this lacks spontaneity , at least it means they can look forward to the event in between times rather than never knowing when the next session will be . <p> If your partner feels sex staved this is a possible way forward . Likewise if your partner feels affection staved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ample shows of physical affection which do not escalate to marital intimacy . <p> Whether it 's scheduled intimate touch or scheduled affectionate touch , what matters is that your partner is willing to enthusiastically make the effort to meet your needs . It matters that your partner is willing to go the extra mile to give you what you want or need to make you feel loved , valued , wanted . The thought of scheduling either form of physical touch may feel mechanical and strange but just ask yourself what have you got to lose if hitherto things have not been satisfactory . And as a consequence of such schedules , good , natural and instinctive habits may well develop and thrive over time . <p> Scheduled marital intimacy and scheduled affection does not preclude spontaneous sex or physical affection . Moreover , it 's imperative to note that your partner will enjoy feeling desired and surprised by you , so do make the first move and spontaneously give them the touch they desire , over and above what is scheduled . <h> An occasional grope is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language is physical touch of an affectionate nature . <h> Enjoy and Appreciate Each Other <p> Some who desire intimate touch over affectionate touch may well find that their partner develops an increase in desire for intimacy once they feel that their need for affectionate physical touch is satisfied and vice versa . In such cases , it 's most certainly a win-win scenario . <p> In general when one partner has the level of touch they desire , regardless of which type of bodily contact it is , they will likely feel more inclined to meet their partners needs and speak their love language , be it words of affirmation , gifts , acts of service , quality time or physical touch . It wo n't necessarily happen overnight but it can happen . <p> Gary Chapman 's book , the 5 Love Languages has lots more on how to fill the love tank of a partner whose primary LL is physical touch . From a brief look inside the book , the writer of this article was able to get a good feel for what the book was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later , having read the entire book , she was indeed able to gain a wealth of beneficial insight and inspiration on all five love languages . <p> As detailed below asking for , and openly communicating about , what we want can be difficult for a variety of reasons . <h> Physical Touch in Your Relationship <h> Which of the options below do you most relate to ? <p> I am female and I would like more intimate contact with my partner <p> I am female and I would like more affectionate contact with my partner <p> It pays to become more and more comfortable with uncomfortable conversations . <p> Ebonny <h> Communicating Desires in the Real World <p> Please remember your partner is not a mind-reader so you need to clearly and respectfully communicate what it is you would like more , or less , of . Also remember this is a two way street so do take the time to solicit and consider their feelings as well . And yes , it is frustrating if you have already told them what you would like and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody wants to feel like a nuisance ! <p> To complicate matters , you may believe that if you have to actually request affection or sex , then when it subsequently happens it just does n't count ! In an ideal world we would all just get precisely the amount and type of physical touch we desire without saying a single word . But please do n't hold your breath waiting for the ideal world to materialise ! Think about it - surely asking your partner for something and having your partner make effort to go out of their way to try to give you what you have requested has got to be better than asking for something and your partner not making any effort to accommodate you , or not asking and continuing to not get what you would like ( given your partner not being a mind reader ) ! <p> So here in the real world , to help make the desired shift in the physical touch aspects of your relationship , you can explain all the above to your spouse , or have your partner read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise to aim to have a continuing dialogue on this for the future , remembering that our wants and needs can change over time . <p> In this real world , what counts is continually trying to grow as a couple to accommodate both expressed and unspoken wants and needs as far possible . Each person has a responsibility and a right to ask for what they would like without feeling , or being made to feel , needy , demanding or a nuisance . Reminders and clarifications may indeed be necessary from time to time but , in relationships , what really counts is being able to have all those potentially uncomfortable , honest conversations on an ongoing basis without undue recrimination or crippling embarrassment . <p> So be bold with your soulmate . Keep speaking up and over time such conversations become less and less daunting . For both parties , honest , open communication , listening , and making due effort to improve things , are all preferable to simmering , unknown or silent resentments . <p> This also means that if you are asked to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to do , you have the right and a responsibility to let your partner know that you choose not to do as they requested - without recrimination or undue reproach . Respecting each other 's right to choose is important . With both parties knowing how far their partner is comfortable and prepared to accommodate expressed affectionate and/or intimate physical wants and needs , and with both parties knowing where they stand , confusion and resentment can be reduced or excluded . <p> If you wish to go further to explore and develop other areas of your relationship the 5 Love Languages by Gary Chapman can help you make a measurable difference overall . With a partner who was not at all inclined to sit and read a self-help book about relationships , the author of this article found the audio CD version of the book an ideal method to get Chapman 's message across to her partner , and it has lived up to its promise to help couples build and sustain the love in their relationship for the longer term . <p> With the audio CD she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in the car for example , to gain great insight on what could be practically done to help each other feel more appreciated and wanted . Of course her relationship is n't perfect , and probably never will be , but the insight given in the book regarding physical touch as well as several other key areas , proved a great way of bringing back much of that loved up feeling which often disappears when initial infatuation fades . <h> Touching Expectations <p> When you set about being more physical in a way that your partner will appreciate , do n't specifically go looking for something in return from your partner . If your partner feels uncomfortable in that they know you are only about getting something in return , it can all backfire somewhat and demanding or expecting an immediate and dramatic change in your partner can cause you to give up on your endeavours before it becomes a seamless habit . <p> It may be easier said than done , but do sustain your physical touch efforts in the knowledge that making your wife or husband happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the right reasons and you might be surprised at how much you enjoy it just for what it is and nothing more . Couples who learn how to better express themselves , and better respect and accommodate physical touch preferences , both affection and/or intimate , without taking each other for granted and without taking advantage of each other , are well on the road to contentment in terms of this LL . <h> About Refraining from Modelling What you Desire More of ? <p> Forget about tradition - for example if you are a woman who wants more sex , do n't behave in a way that will encourage your husband to accurately say " but I did n't believe you really wanted more sex because you NEVER initiate it " . <p> Likewise if you 're a man who wants more affection , do n't feel embarrassed to be the one to initiate it . As the saying goes , be the change you want to see . Aim to find a balance initiating what your partner wants , and what you want . <h> Comments 64479 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Caribbean <p> Thank you for expounding on this topic .

It can be categorized as a disorder which revolves around the excessive viewing of pornographic material or content such as porn movies , short films , and even certain images . Porn addiction has gained importance gradually with the increase in the number of those needing help . Below are a few main reasons why individuals may turn to such activities willingly . <h> Causes of Porn addiction <p> 1 . Constant Feelings of LonelinessPeople who feel loved and needed may feel as if they are at the top of the world . However , those who can not find such affection , for whatever reasons , may become victims of loneliness and depression .

They may also feel incapable of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to turn to porn to satisfy their sexual desires or to pretend to be happy . <p> 2 . Difficulty with SleepingA lot of people just watch porn because it helps them sleep better at night . Satisfying sexual needs can release a lot of pent up stress . This not only relaxes the body , but the mind as well . However , such habits can quickly turn into being classified as an addiction and become a necessary part of the individual 's daily life . <p> 3 . Bad CompanyTeenagers that get into the wrong company may be pushed towards such activities as they are usually considered to be thrilling and cool by youngsters . What starts off as an exciting secret may soon transform into full fledged addiction .

The Negative Effects on HealthAmong the many reasons to quit porn , negative health effects may be the most important one . Porn addicts are so deeply trapped within their condition that it becomes quite impossible for them to not think about pornography over a long period of time . They may have constant thoughts of such content whether at work or outside somewhere . If they are unable to get their hands on their porn material when their craving for it starts , they might start feeling anxious and restless . Such anxiety is not good for the mind as it causes unnecessary stress . It may also lead to headaches , high levels of irritability and feelings of helplessness . If such individuals are unable to deal with all the anxiety and stress , they may even fall victim to depression . <p> 2 . Losing the Sexual DriveIndividuals who become addicted to porn may initially feel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the level of addiction becomes more severe , they find it harder and harder to get turned on by such explicit content .

Such conditions are hard to cure and may require a lot of time and help . <p> 3 . Possibility of Getting Estranged From Family and FriendsSince porn addicts tend to spend a lot of time with their porn material , they find that they are incapable of maintaining healthy relationships with their friends and family . They keep cancelling their outing plans when they feel they can not be away from porn for too long . They also prefer being alone . This can break the bonds of friendships as friends may no longer understand this kind of addiction . Sometimes even families decide to cut contact with the addicts instead of helping them out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their sense of helplessness and loneliness and may take them deeper down into depression . <p> 4 . Possibility of Becoming UnemployedDue to the constant feelings of anxiety , addicts may find that they ca n't focus on their jobs . If they are incapable of finishing their work on time or maintaining the quality of work , then they might be at a risk of becoming unemployed . Also , some addicts may make the mistake of viewing porn at work when they think that no one is watching . However , it is easy as pie to get caught red handed . Such a situation will also bring about the wrath of these individuals ' bosses .

If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural community , you are likely to notice that local politics seem to exert an irresistible attraction to sociopaths . <p> Unfortunately , it seems like the only way to recognize a sociopath is to observe their response to opportunity for personal gain at the expense of others . <p> Author <p> ologsinquito 3 years agofrom USA <p> The world does seem to be filled with opportunistic individuals .

If you are married to one of these types , you need legal advice . If you have a child who is being bullied , threatened , sexually harassed , or slandered in school , it is notorious that school authorities are unhelpful--worthless is more like it . The only option in this case seems to be to remove the child from school . <p> In the workplace , start documenting issues as soon as you become aware of a problem . For example , If you are not being provided with what you need to do your job ( information , passwords , keys so you can open in the morning ) , make your requests for this stuff in writing--as in time-stamped emails . Follow up with more emails when your request is ingnored . Send emails documenting all issues . Keep private notes documenting any issues that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offender--who may be your boss . For example , you may not be comfortable emailing your boss that a co-worker brushes against you unnecessarily and stares at your ass . You may not be comfortable emailing your boss that you are not comfortable with private , closed-door meetings . ( This is a no-no in educational institutions , where with the same sex or the opposite sex . ) <p> When TSHTF , you will have everything documented for when you meet with the folks in HR . <p> I think most people get victiized because they have no one to advise them , and nowhere to turn for good advice . When one of my daughters ran into work difficulties like the ones I 've described , I did n't know what to tell her . So I called a friend of mine with long experience as an administrator/manager . <p> In all dealings with sociopaths , seek good advice .

Emails are a good way to leave a " paper trail , " which you need . It is also good to have legal advice as well . <p> However , in the office , a narcissist has already laid a lot of groundwork , smearing the target 's good name and turning people against the target . So , by the time the target realizes anything is wrong , they 've lost their support network . Unfortunately , it 's been documented that complaining to HR does little good , and only leads to a resolution in a tiny minority ( about 3 percent ) of the actual cases . Maybe having really good documentation , and approaching the situation in an unemotional manner , can help boost those odds .

In romantic entanglements with sociopaths , the " walk-away " solution works only if there are no kids , or if you are assured of getting custody . A woman who sees her children beeing damaged by their dad can usually improve the children 's life by leaving/divorcing . While she may struggle financially , at least the kids wo n't be subjected to an abusive psychotic . <p> A dad in this same situation is going to have a hard time rescuing the kids from an abusive/psychotic mom . You should probably seek legal advice . Maybe there is hope for you . Or maybe not , depending on the circumstances . Almost all attorneys offer a fre initial consultation . You should talk to several and make a LOT of inquiries among your friends about good attorneys . <p> If you go this route , there is one big caveat : There are a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your anger and try to get you so stirred up and angry that you will willingly go broke from an endless , and often fruitless , legal battle . A good attorney is a dry , unemotional type--preferably politically connected and older . RUN from the attorney who works on your emotions . ( You have met another sociopath , intent on preying on you . ) <p> It may be that there is not way out for you . One of my friends who had along relationship with an alcoholic was able to learn good strategies for dealing with co-dependency through AL-ANON . He has often said that AL-ANON changed his life .

She wants control for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little problem solving skills . I do live in a woman 's state . There is no legal help . If I leave I forfeit everything I have built . I just want what is best for my boys . They need their father . I just wonder what her overall goal is for being like this . She gains a fake reality only .

Thank you my fried <p> RedSolo <p> Sharon Vile 3 years agofrom Odessa , MO <p> asfarasyouknow--been there , my friend . Why does she do this ? There really is no answer . <p> Your boys especially need their father to counter their mother 's influence . They need you to defend them from psychological abuse and manipulation . The abuser is continually lying to the children ; you need to be there to tell them the truth . The abuser is continually belittling the children ; you need to be there to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; they need someone there to make sure their needs are met . <p> Unfortunately , my experience is that there is not a lot of support out there for victims of abuse that does n't proceed to physical violence . Many years ago , I attended a support group for victims of domestic violence . The ladies there ( who routinely had guns held to their heads ) did not " get " psychological abuse , and its destructiveness . AL-ANON does seem to have the best approach for regaining and retaining control in co-dependent relationships . Maybe some of their literature would help . <p> I have to commend you for making this kind of sacrifice . Someday--and it will seem like the blink of an eye--the kids will be grown . <p> Suzette Walker 3 years agofrom Taos , NM <p> Thank you so much for writing this hubs on narcisissim . They have been helpful to me . To know there is light at the end of the tunnel is so helpful . I 'm pretty battered right now and having a time recovering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , to read your hubs and recognized this behavior for what it is is quite an eye opener to me . There has been so much psychological abuse and manipulation in my life , it is amazing I am still standing . Thanks for sharing your knowledge with us . <p> Author <p> ologsinquito 3 years agofrom USA <p> Hi suzettenaples , I am so sorry to hear about what you 've been through , and I can only just begin to imagine how horrible it must have been . You will recover , with time . People who 've never been through something similar can not even begin to comprehend the twisted plots . Best wishes and I 'll keep you in my prayers . <p> Sharon Vile 3 years agofrom Odessa , MO <p> Now that I think about it , psychologically abusive and manipulative types DO have a reason for their behavior . They want total control . Mostly I think this is for the simple practical reason that it maximizes their ability to " use " you , although they do get their ego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their power over you is slipping will make them violently angry . <p> I think that this type of behavior is often a generational family culture--like regular domestic violence . It appears to me that there are certain cultures in which this kind of thing is the regular thing . ( I could name a couple , but I wo n't . ) So think there is also an issue of growing up in such a family culture and continuing the behaviors that were modeled for you . So you can be in one of those situations where you have to " break the cycle of violence , " so to speak . To know how , I think , is to adress simple " right and wrong " issues--and a person should be able to easily see that lies , threats , anger , violence , and lack of kindness , understanding , and respect for others is simply wrong . Many people do n't seem to understand that this also applies to children . Go figure . <p> ALL these child-rearing issues that people struggle with are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family culture demands that they act WRONGLY . So you get a lot of cognitive dissonance and inner turmoil , an awareness of failure and sadness , or often anger and defensiveness about traditional methods of discipline and child-rearing . Bible quoting comes in handy here , because , when you know you 're doing wrong , it is comforting to be able to quote some authority . The anger and defensiveness arises from the fact that people DO know right from wrong in their hearts , and the family or authoritarian demand that they behave in ways they KNOW are wrong tears them apart . <p> Author <p> ologsinquito 3 years agofrom USA <p> It does seem to spring from families , and , sometimes , if people come from a family where bad behavior is tolerated , they look for what is familiar , or they do n't have the same ability as others to recognize when something is off . <p> I 've also seen people misuse the Bible in order to control people . That is very sad , because God respects our free will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , this is very much learned behavior . One of my daughters once knew a girl in high school who was quite a diffcult kind of person . But when the girl 's mother showed up for a school function and talked to her daughter abusively , my own daughter 's eyes were opened about the way this girl came by her behavior . <p> Author <p> ologsinquito 3 years agofrom USA <p> Lack of love in trust in childhood may very well contribute to this behavior . But others who are abused as children turn into very empathetic adults . At some point , we 're responsible for our own behavior . <p> Sharon Vile 3 years agofrom Odessa , MO <p> Actually , when you have kids in school you often have a great oportunity to observe kids ' behavior in the context of their parents ' behavior--so you can see how much of it is modelled for them . <p> Author <p> ologsinquito 3 years agofrom USA <p> Is n't that the truth ! <p> perc westmore 3 years ago <p> i would like to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to find a good place .

That 's what the comment section is for . I 'm sorry to hear about this experience . Narcissistic emotional abuse is horrifying . But there is a lot of hope . Once you recover , you are happy again , and I dare say , more happy than before because you have a new appreciation for the good you see . <p> Lisa 2 years ago <p> Is there a forum I could join ?

He has told our 13 year old son that he was going to be going away . He did see a counselor one time and has n't been back since . I have people coming to me and telling me how uncomfortable they are around him and will not be around if I am not there . When i try to initiate something he pushes me away . He was physically abusive in the very beginning of our relationship but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have stayed all this time . I am seeing my son do the same things he is doing and I have to put a stop to the cycle . I spoke with a psychologist and she stated that he could have NPD . What are my options ? I am seeking advise and support . Is there an online support group that I am able to turn to ? Please help me find my way out of this nightmare . <p> Author <p> ologsinquito 2 years agofrom USA <p> Hi jenn , I am so sorry to hear of your struggles and I will pray for you , that things take a turn for the better . However , I have no experience in domestic violence or marital malignant narcissism , so I 'm not the best person to ask . My experience is with a female malignant narcissist . <p> If he is drinking , this could be fueling some of the bad behavior .

@@96276062 @476062/ <h> 17 Warning Signs of a ManipulatorNever Get Deceived Again <h> 17 Warning Signs of a Manipulator <p> Every one of us has come into contact with manipulators . Some have been abused for years without knowing . Spotting a manipulator is hard because they work at stealth frequencies . It 's a crime that leaves no fingerprints , but there is n't any type of human behavior that you can not understand or predict . <p> There are reasons we all do what we do , and those reasons are sometimes displayed . <p> Gavin de Becker <h> 1 . Charm and Niceness <p> A manipulator may use charm to get power or sex . Charm comes easily to manipulators because they are ruthless and have no qualms about hurting anyone . A reasonably conscientious person might not use the dirty tricks to seduce someone " that a manipulator will eagerly do . <p> Manipulators are ardent students of human behavior . After spending some time with a person they find out about their needs and desires . Once they find out what you need they provide you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If someone is being very charming and alluring to you , think about , what that person could possibly want . Narcissists and psychopaths- " the masters of manipulation " are very cruel once you fall in love with them . <p> Manipulators use charm to seduce and deceive . <h> 2 . Denial <p> Manipulators are experts at lying and denying . If someone hurts you and you bring attention to their bad behavior , but they deny it even though they clearly have behaved badly , then you should be on your guard.Do n't let their denial of bad behavior confuse you . <p> Psychologist George K.Simon , a manipulation expert and author of the book In Sheep 's Clothing , elucidates , ' This who.Me ? ' tactic is a way of playing innocent and invites the victim to feel unjustified in confronting the aggressor about the inappropriateness of their behavior . It 's also the way the aggressor gives himself/herself permission to keep right on doing what they want to do . ' ' <h> 3 . Lying <p> Lying is a manipulator 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't feel bad about lying . If there 's a chance to get what they want by lying , they most certainly will . <p> Manipulators usually lie in subtle , covert ways . Dr.Simon says that manipulators often lie by withholding a significant amount of information from you or by distorting the truth . <p> Effectively Catching a liar can be learned.So to detect early on , whether you are dealing with a manipulator or not , ask them direct questions about his or her employment , family , relatives , friends , place of residence , plans , and so forth . If they give vague , inconsistent or evasive replies to you , this should serve as a red flag . <p> Every type of con relies upon distracting us from the obvious . <p> Gavin de Becker <h> 4 . Generous with Favors and Gifts <p> In the beginning of a relationship , a manipulator may be very kind , sympathetic and generous towards you . He may shower you with expensive gifts and favors , which you might interpret as an expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using them as a form of bribery to get even bigger favors later on . <p> So when a person showers you with gifts and attention , pay critical attention to the character and intention of that person . <h> 5 . Excessive Compliments and Flattery <p> Psychologists Robert D.Hare and Paul Babaik in their book Snakes in Suits advise that ' Excessive or incongruous compliments should be a signal for you to pay critical attention to what 's coming next . Ask yourself , What does this person really want of me ? ' ' ' <h> 6 . Forced Teaming <p> It 's a strategy used by manipulators and con artists to create a sense of togetherness with their chosen victim , through the use of the word , " we . " <p> The manipulator tries to project a shared purpose or experience with you , where none exist . He might use phrases such as " we 're some team , " " how are we going to handle this ? " " both of us , " " now we 've done it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuinely trying to be helpful or they are just manipulating you ? Listen to your intuition . Do you feel uncomfortable while accepting help ? Do you want to refuse but you ca n't because this will make you appear rude ? If yes , then you are dealing with a manipulator . <p> Women should NOT accept any offer of help that makes them feel uncomfortable . <p> The best cons make the victim want to participate . <p> Gavin de Becker <h> 7 . Good First Impression <p> Skilled manipulators often make excellent impressions . They use captivating characteristics like impeccable manners , dazzling looks or a winning smile , etc. to distract people from their real intentions and message . We hardly buy a book after being impressed by its cover , but unfortunately , we take people at face value.With manipulators , you do n't get what you see . <p> A manipulator may give you a very good first impression , but the cracks in their mask will become apparent only after close observation or spending more time with them . <h> 8 . Pretending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a victim of circumstances or bad behavior of someone , as a result making you feel sympathy for him or her . <p> When a person tries to seek your sympathies , carefully observe that person to try to confirm that they are indeed a victim . <p> So how to tell a false victim from a real one . <p> A false victim talks about the events that were abusive to them in a calm , cool , and detached way . They appear to get over the emotions of the abusive experience rather quickly , and they do n't seem to dwell or obsess over the abusive experiences . <p> True victims need to reach out for support ; it 's important for their survival . They seek therapy , God or other saving methods to restore their mental and emotional health . While talking about the abusive experience , they appear confused , jumpy , nervous and afraid . They may cry hysterically " urgency and emotion are in their speech . They do not have the cold , cool demeanor of a lying manipulator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denial , and anger to finally the stage of acceptance . <p> But manipulators pretending to be victims do n't try to seek that kind of support . They do n't need it because they were not abused . Manipulators pretending to be victims are not seeking kindness and compassion , but they are after a goal , so coolly and in control , they tell you their story . <h> 9 . Silent Treatment <p> Getting ' ' Silent treatment ' ' is an early warning sign that you are dealing with a manipulator . It is a passive aggressive form of emotional abuse in which displeasure , disapproval , and contempt are exhibited through nonverbal gestures while maintaining silence . <p> Manipulators use silent treatment as a weapon to provoke you into doing something or make you feel less worthy by refusing to acknowledge even your presence . If an act of your behavior is not contributing towards the manipulator 's goal , they will use silent treatment as a punishment to communicate their displeasure . This is why Clinical psychologist Harriet Braiker identifies it as a form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulator , then they might use silent treatment just to torture you . <p> Examples of silent treatment might be : <p> A coworker openly talks to others but refuses to speak to you . <p> Your roommate is willing to talk to her friends on phone , or bring them in the room and talk to them for hours , but refuses to speak to you . <h> 10 . Appearing to be Selfless <p> Manipulators keep their intentions , ambitions , desire for power and domination well hidden , so in the first few meetings with a manipulator , you might find him/her to be a selfless and helpful person . <p> Dr. George K.simon explains , <p> ' Covert-aggressives use this tactic to cloak their self-serving agendas in the guise of service to a more noble cause . It 's a common tactic but difficult to recognize.By pretending to be working hard on someone else 's behalf , covert-aggressives conceal their ambition , desire for power , and a quest for a position of dominance over others . ' ' <h> 11 . Guilt Tripping <p> Pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel guilty . Chances are , that person is manipulating you . <p> Manipulators are aware that other people have a different conscience , so they exploit the good natureof their victims to keep them in self-doubting , guilt-ridden , anxious and submissive position . <h> 12 . Shaming <p> If you catch a person often saying insulting remarks or hurtful comments about your weight , family , appearance or employment , etc , then this should be taken as a warning sign " especially of a manipulative friend . Manipulators pay close attention to a person 's insecurities and weak points . If you are insecure about your weight or do n't like the shape of your nose , they are quick to notice . If you have repeatedly failed an exam , they will make fun of you for it . Our success or physical appearance is not very much in our control so making fun of someone 's difficult situation shows the mean and predatory nature of the individual . They often try to pass off their offensive remarks as jokes , but if you pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jokes are not funny and have unfriendly overtones . It 's their secret attempt to put you down . So , what they gain by doing that ? <p> Manipulators use shaming to make their victim feel inadequate or unworthy , and therefore , become submissive to them . It is a powerful tactic to create a continued sense of personal inadequacy in the victim , thus allowing the manipulator to maintain a position of dominance . <h> 13 . Intimidation <p> Manipulators usually use covert intimidation . Their threats are carefully veiled . If someone makes you feel uncomfortable or you suspect them of manipulation , pay close attention to their non-verbal gestures , expressions , glances , and stares , when they talk to you . <p> A manipulator may twist the reality to make you doubt your own perceptions . <h> 14 . Gas Lighting <p> Perhaps not an early warning sign , but it is a powerful tactic used by manipulators . The term owes its origin to the play Gas Light and its film adaptations , after which it was coined . Since then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It means twisting reality for a particular purpose . <p> A manipulator is a genius when it comes to twisting reality to serve their own purposes . It does n't matter what the truth is , they have a way of ultimately showing you that it really is your own fault and that you are n't seeing things clearly . By the time you accept their version of reality , you have become so mentally sick that you ca n't trust your own perceptions . <p> If someone questions your perceptions of reality , do not trust their opinion . <p> Always listen to your intuition . What it tells you about a person or a situation is right . <h> 15 . Rationalization <p> It is an excuse a manipulative person offers for engaging in hurtful or inappropriate behaviors . It can be an effective tactic especially when the explanation offered makes just enough sense that any reasonably conscientious person is likely to fall for it . <p> Rationalization serves three primary purposes : <p> It removes internal resistance the manipulator might have about their harmful action . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulator can convince you they are justified in doing what they have been doing , then they are free to pursue their goals . <p> I once had a friend who would sometimes behave very affectionately , but after a few hours or days would become very cold . I became sick of her hot and cold behavior . Whenever I would bring attention to her bad behavior , or I would avoid her , she would instantly sense that and would come to my room crying , telling me how busy and depressed she has been in the past few days . I would be moved by her tears and forgive her last week 's terrible behavior , but after a few days , she 'd repeat the exact bad behavior . <p> Manipulators are fine actors . They can pretend to be a victim ; they can cry a river whenever they want ; they can fake love ; they can fake joy or any other emotion . So carefully observe the actions of those who claim to love you , or who try to gain your sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind and gentle but select the receivers of your kindness VERY carefully . <h> 16 . Diversion <p> When you are trying to keep a discussion focused on a single issue or behavior ( that you consider bad or cruel ) , but someone changes the subject or dodges the issue , then this should alert you . You might ask yourself , " Why does n't this person want to discuss it ? " Dr.Simon points out that manipulators " use distraction and diversion techniques to keep the focus off of their behavior , move us off-track , and keep themselves free to promote their self-serving hidden agendas. " <h> 17 . Unsettling Stare <p> Many people believe that eyes are windows to the soul . Psychologist Robert D.Hare believes that eyes do provide some information about the person " particularly when the message they convey to others appears inconsistent with the individual 's facial expressions and verbal behavior . " In that case , a person should not ignore the information given by eyes . <p> Some people respond to the emotionless stare of a skilled manipulator with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The eyes of the master manipulator , Grigori Rasputin has been remarked on by many people . According to Paul Kurlov , he had ' piercing ' ' eyes ; to Tamara Karsavina his eyes looked like that of a maniac ; Elena Dzhanumova wrote in her diary : ' What eyes he has ! You can not endure his gaze for long . ' " <h> What do you think is the most effective tactic used by mean and manipultive persons , to decieve others ? <h> Comments 64479 @qwx924479 <p> sending <p> O 18 months agofrom New York <p> This is a great hub !

Those who use these tactics are often exceptionally good at it and they manipulate most people to support them and believe in what they say such that despite constantly changing reality others do n't see a problem . When they really go after someone these others will back them saying it is all the victims fault and even reverse the conditions such that the victim is blamed for what the manipulator is actually doing . It can have devastating effects when such a thing is done by a person who is supposed to protect the person such as a parent especially when it goes on for the persons entire lifetime .

You can still locate the records if you do some sleuthing . Try doing an Internet search for the name of at least one person in the marriage , or both names . If the last name is common , this will be more challenging than if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and search also for the year it may have been granted . If you are n't sure of the year , enter a series of years , one by one , to see if that narrows the search results . <p> Finally , if you know the state , but not the exact county , search for the county seat of the city where you lived at the time . If you do n't know the city , for some reason , but you do know the region of the state ( hey , time does things to our memories , right ? ) , you can locate nearby counties and contact all of them . <p> The reason for searching online is that many counties ( especially in large urban areas ) have loaded the basic information ( the names of the two parties , number of the case and the date ) onto the web , and that will give you the information you need to file a request . <p> Most counties now have electronic databases where old files are loaded - this is a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search . Try calling the county or counties where the divorce may have taken place , and ask if they have the records . <p> After you locate the courthouse where the records are kept , ask the clerk what you need to do in order to get one or more copies of the decree . <p> Usually , you will need to send a written request and a small fee for copying the paperwork . If you want an official copy ( one stamped by the court clerk , to show it 's official ) , you will probably have a fee for that as well . <p> While you 're at it , consider getting more than one copy - this could be helpful for the future , if you have children or others who need the records .

Here are just a few : <p> Child Support : If there were children in the marriage , child support can hinge on the age of the children and when they turn 18 . If someone is behind on child support , the other spouse will need the decree in order to request that it be brought up-to-date . It 's important to have the specifics of the decree in order to determine what the court ordered . There 's a difference , for example , in support paid ' twice a month , ' rather than ' every two weeks . ' In one case , there are 24 payments a year ; in the other case , there are 26 payments . <p> Child Custody &amp; Visitation : In any divorce where children are involved , the decree will lay out who the children live with and the time each parent is entitled to spend with them . This information needs to be examined when someone moves out of state , or when the visitation does n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sale or Disposition of Property : We live in harsh economic times , and some couples divorce but still retain joint ownership of property , in the hopes that the economy will improve . Your decree will define who is responsible for payments , taxes and upkeep . It will also define the percentage of ownership and the ratio of distribution of equity and appreciation in the event the property is sold . <p> Retirement Benefits : You may have been young when you divorced , but the decree might have specified a portion of the pension or retirement funds of your former spouse will go to you . You 'll need the court records in order to establish what was decreed . <p> Death of a Former Spouse : The decree will document the length and dates of the marriage , which is needed if the surviving former spouse wishes to receive Social Security based on the income of the deceased former spouse . Even if you are divorced , you can get Social Security benefits based on the income history of someone to whom you were married for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you what is applicable in your own situation . The decree is also useful if one partner is entitled to insurance benefits or survivor benefits from a pension fund . <p> Requests to Adjust Monetary Awards : It is not unusual for divorced couples to return to court to adjust child support , alimony or spousal support . A judge who hears this request will refer to the original decree to determine intent , original at this time . <p> Author 64477 @qwx924477 <p> Hi , alocsin - so glad you found the hub useful .

However , let 's face it . We 've had a horrible reputation of emasculating our men ; and allowing activist women groups dictate how we should manage ( or not manage ) our love relationships . <p> Stop believing the lies mainstream media and activists groups spew throughout the airwaves . We are just outright different . <h> Were Just Different <p> It 's a known fact that men and women are different psychologically , physically , and emotionally . You can deny it all you want ; but let 's stop lying to ourselves . Stop believing the lies mainstream media and activists groups spew throughout the airwaves . We are just outright different . <p> Our sexual desires are very different . So , let 's start with emotions and how men and women are different . Women , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some women who may not be able to connect emotionally when they have sex ; but that 's a rarity . We are nurturers .

We desire the manly-man who can be our superman at all times . We want to be Sleeping Beauty and have our Knight-In-Shining-Armour rescue us . <h> Men Are Emotional Beings , Too . <p> As for most men , we want to believe that men are n't emotionally connected when they have sex , but that 's another lie we 've been fed . Most men fall in love and connect with their women just as easily as we connect sexually .

So , stop denying your man the simple pleasures in life because you 're denying yourselves those same pleasures . Take care of him ; and he will surely take care of you . If your man is " creepin ' " , then start taking care of his needs and watch how your relationship flourishes . <h> Keeping It Real At Home <p> If your man is caring , loving and protective ( not obsessive ) of you , and you want to keep him home , you want him to desire you often , then keep yourself looking and smelling good .

I agree that sometimes women and men allow that impact to affect their relationship . But please stop telling women that if they give their men more sex this will cure infidelity . There is so much more to infidelity than sex . Furthermore , happiness comes within . I believe you should concentrate on finding inner beauty , inner happiness and inner love and then allow those qualities to extend to your relationships . And then you will attract a person who has the same qualities and together you can compromise and build a healthy relationship that lasts through the hard times . <p> anon 8 years ago <p> Very good article , first one that actually makes sense .

The article makes is very clear that we women are not to give up who we are ; but to share who we are . You and I will never be men ; but I am sure we want them to hang around . Of course there will be jerks out there ; but there are women jerks , too . Again , you are right on point . <p> fran001 7 years agofrom Toronto <p> I agree that women need to cater to their man to some degree . I would stop at trying to meet his every need and whim cause then you not only lose him , you lose his respect . He is not a child . He should also be responsive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed and can cook up a storm even better than me . However , I do n't relax and think I have it made . I make sure I do my part in keeping the home and being his support . A woman is invaluable to her man and showing your worth keeps you confident and him happy . <p> MsIndependence 7 years ago <p> It is refreshing to hear from other women who know that it takes more the bedding a man to keep him interested . My man tells me what makes him happy and satisfied ; and I do my best to meet his needs . He also asks me what makes me happy and satisfied . Believe me , he does a fantastic job . Just as you implied , it is a two-way street . <p> DeBorrah K Ogans 7 years ago <p> This is a very good hub !

Roof 7 years ago <p> There 's an author I like : David Deida , who talks about how surrendering and giving ones self-over to another , or opening in love are all thing that in one stage can be unhealthy , but in a developed stage there are necessary for deep intimacy .

I think what you 're talking about is that evolved openness with love and respect where you can feel your partners heart : and things that might seem " wrong " or abusive are required for deep intimacy <p> ***Anyway : Great Post ! ! <p> Michelle 7 years ago <p> Excellent post ! ! Women need to understand exactly what you have just posted . They need to grow up and quit being so prudish and selfish . I 'm sick of hearing feminists , that has turned me into an Anti- feminist . <p> @azlonely : Thank you for your support . I do believe some women are looking for the " fathers " in some men . However , feminists have pounded a lot of these ideas in the minds of women since they were little girls . At one point , I was fooled into believing that I had to be independent and be as " manly " as a man . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he married that I realized how foolish that " sick " advice has been . <p> My daughters and nieces are constantly bombarded by a media machine that tells our little girls to be strong and independent and to blame men if we do not get the best out of a relationship . Those same pundits do not tell those girls that we women need to acknowledge we are so different from men and that there is a flow of nature that can not be disturbed unless we want to continually have the types of sour relationships we see today . <p> So , WOMEN ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! It is okay to be a woman . It is okay to be feminine . It is okay to take care of your man as long as he takes care of you . Him taking care of your does not mean buying you everything . It means respect , caring , adoration , love , and honor . This is reciprocal . Give and you shall receive . <p> Author <p> Queen of the Pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your statement , " I think what you 're talking about is that evolved openness with love and respect where you can feel your partners heart ...

" Evolved openness " is the only way we will reach the pinnacle of a true , loving relationship . <p> Not-a-hater 7 years ago <p> Stand by your man , keep him happy in bed , be his " help meet " , be supportive , build him up , on and on . Been there done that . Got it back from him too - for awhile . Then he decided a wife with a business and a doctoral degree was too much competition ( for his ego ) . He split . Played it by your rules , my hearts , rules , &amp; churches rules . Never taught to be a man hater . Still did n't work . <p> Author <p> Queen of the Pen 7 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I , too , have been there . However , I did not do those things just to make him happy ; but it made me happy as well . Even though my ex left , it was not because I did not satisfy him . So , I will be the same woman to my current husband . He deserves the " whole " me . I do hope you do not place all men under the same umbrella as I know you would not like that placement . <p> Maryannee 6 years ago <p> presently i have a man in my life , but i do n't  understand the kind of feeling am having towards him , its so deep strange an confusing , pls i do n't want to have heartbreak , pls help . <p> Author <p> Queen of the Pen 6 years ago <p> @Maryannee : <p> When you say , " ... i do n't understand the kind of feeling am having towards him , its so deep strange an confusing , pls i do n't want to have heartbreak ...

My experience with women is that they either get with the total loser who treats them like dirt , or they are taught men are evil , to create a persona where they try to have uhm , cajones bigger than their man 's . <p> The bad person or people they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let themselves go to the man they should . <p> I personally believe and whole heartedly agree with the " surrendering and giving ones self-over to another " . When I am into someone , I have had to be careful as of late , but I do the same , Its not money , its not a job , its not a car , its not what are you willing to do for me ? It 's what I am willing to do for you in my power , to make you happy at home , and over all , I am willing to do it , if you are willing to just try and do the same .... <p> We all have our flaws , but communication and just doing your part , and picking up the parts for the other person if need be . Of course make sure the honor , respect , and reciprication is there . And accept it might not always be 50/50 ... That 's what a relationship is all about . <p> I also have to agree , the " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this . I wont do that " ' s , and all of the " My man did me wrong " songs , it 's getting old . <p> That statement applies to housework , sex , and anything in between . <p> If your man is complaining he ai n't getting enough , fake it , something , because after awhile of that cold no , not tonight , he will start having wondering eyes . Even the strongest of us non-cheaters even have a natural animal instinct to look for the next " mate " when the current one is n't doing it for us . <p> Otherwise , all the lovey dovey things are fine and nice , but we are men , we do n't carry that gene .. lol ... We can feel , we can be lovey dovey , but for the most part , we do n't want to be womanized , wearing a man bag , in an Ab and Finch outfit . <p> So , if you have a man who seems like he might be that 98% " dude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost him up to be the man he can/should/needs to be . Do n't just tear him down and threaten this and that . Cause once you break a man down , and he gets his confidence back even a little bit , he 'll be done . <p> I cook , I was Mr. Mom for 3 yrs , mainly because I did part time work , and she had a better earning potential at her work and it was full time , long story short , we grew distant , no communication , and after doing Mr Mom , I get no credit , treated like I am a 12 yr old , so my esteem was deflated to the point , I gave up on future endevours . <p> Got up with current , she is normally awesome , but some things keep happenening where we butt heads , and I am once again feeling something is missing , I know her in and out for what 10 months you can , and I feel she does n't know me at all . <p> OK , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bread winner , the more dominant , the smarter , or whatever , your man will be only as interested as you show .

Sometimes men and women do not understand their true roles in a relationship . Our individual role is to be the best person we can be in order to have the best person he or she can be to us . Our society sometimes plague relationships with false notions of selfishness , self gratification , and self indulgence . It 's time for us to do our parts to make our relationships successful . <p> , , , 5 years ago <p> rissa absolutly correct . i believe as a woman my role is to be a best friend , communicate , understand his needs as he understands mine , open minded , be and do interesting and new thing , accept each other for who they are and great intense love making is just the icing on the cake . that 's what men want . just have common sense , the abili ty to hold a conversation and not be a dud dipsy chick that cant talk about everyday , life , cars , science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical will be the bomb <p> pantaleona 5 years ago <p> Hi well i have to agree to every one maybe you should give in and have sex but still be beautiful you probably had kids like i did at first i gave up on sex and my beuty but then my husband told me what was wrong that i already look beautiful that even if i did have kids gained weight it dnt matter as long as i tried to lose it to look more sexy and to have sex but he also said what makes you happy with what you do will also make me happy that he will help me threw the way becuz our vows says threw good and bad times threw sickness and health so no matter what anyone else says it only matters if ur happy and that he knows ur happy because he will always be there to help so i am how i am as long as he s happy im happy sex is good so i dnt need anyone telling me that i 'm not happy or he s not happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for making me relizing this . <p> lola 5 years ago <p> this is a 9c write up , " if u love ur spouse satisfy him wt everytin " <p> Vjmiranda 5 years ago <p> AGREE 100% ! !

I am a 41 yr old mom and about 12lbs heavier than normal , but he makes me feel beautiful inside and out !

I commend you and wish the greatest success for you and your husband . <p> one o the guys 4 years ago <p> I noticed your article . It looked good to me as a man . Has anyone noticed that many American guys are with Asian women ? My wife is Japanese . She has the interesting quality that she is very comfortable being the woman in our relationship . She does n't feel that being the woman is lower status than being the man . Actually , she does n't even have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give me all of the sex that I want . She just takes care of me as well as she can . And she treats me with respect . I think that western women often do n't treat their men with respect . I see this on TV shows and movies and in everyday life . Mind you , you must find a man whom you respect . But that does n't mean he has to be perfect . My wife is very feminine and she is happy being in a supportive roll in our relationship . I adore her and admire her and respect her deeply because she understands how important her roll is in our relationship and in our society . Unfortunately , because our society as been patriarchal for so many years there has been a devaluation of women 's traditional roles in society . But women 's roles in society are crucial for a healthy and sane population . In regards to women 's relationships with men , many women want to assume the man 's role in the relationship i.e. the dominant role . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . They want to be with a woman . If the woman behaves like a man there will be a lot of friction and the woman wo n't respect her man because he is not masculine enough for her . She will feel that he is weak . I have noticed that when I tell other men that I am married to a Japanese woman they usually know immediately that Japanese women know how to take care of their men . They understand completely why I would make that choice . So I hope your blog is successful and I hope that women will understand why men are not comfortable with women who do n't respect them and try to take care of them . <p> Freja 3 years ago <p> Funny thing is ( no actually it 's not funny ) that men believe that their needs are the most important in the relationships . Men can become fat , ugly , whiny , boring , asexual but they still expect their goddamn woman to be the exact same playboy doll she was when she was 20 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like having sex because of a bad and stressy day should my man think that he should have the privelegies of having sex with me just because it 's a " natural need " . Come on people we are beings of logic not animals driven by instincts . Yeah of course a woman should take care of herself and not go a year without giving sex but a man should not fulfill the same fucking needs and a lot of them do n't . Trust me I 've seen more ugly men with hot ass women than the other way around and I feel sorry for the women . And also he should not expect a woman that just recently got a child to be up for sex and look her greatest and sexiest , maybe he could start helping out more and stop being a whiny , selfish bastard , fucking his receptionist at work while his woman is at home trying to survive .

If a man says that he needs sex in a relationship , he 's automatically labeled a " controlling pig " or something . Turn that around and a woman complains that her man is n't giving her the sex she craves ... everyone comes to console her , making HIM out to be the bad guy .

The person may have become so introverted that they stand out like a sore thumb , easy prey to the next person looking for a rubbing-rag . The fact that someone is different makes them an interesting target for a bully because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to poke and prod them verbally and see what makes them tick . They are a curiosity and a muse , the punch bag on which they vent all their own insecurities . <p> And that is the keyword ; insecurity . People often attack others verbally because there is something in their own life that is making them feel inadequate . They need to make someone feel bad so that they can feel better in return , it gives them a sense of worth . Like any addiction ( as that is what it is due to the short-lived euphoria ) , it needs to be fed and so the bully repeats the taunting over and over again to remain superior to their victim . <h> What about the victim(s) ? <p> Being a victim affects people mentally . Their self-esteem suffers because when someone attacks them verbally they are left feeling rubbish and emotionally bruised . For adults enduring verbal abuse , chances are there has been a chain of it running through their life . They have probably spent most of their life avoiding conflict , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to deal with it . <p> As a victim , the only way for them to stop it is to deal with it , or else it will follow them wherever they go . They may have already reached a point where they ca n't stand being around other people , and do n't know how to relate to them . They probably prefer to be left alone and opt out of any social situations . If that is how they really feel , then that is what will happen - they will become a loner , possibly a recluse . That does n't mean they will be lonely , there is a difference , if they have truly accepted that a solitary life is for them then they may well be very happy . <h> Have courage and set yourself free ! <p> Not everybody wants to be a loner though , many victims of verbal abuse are crying out for friendship , they really need a helping hand . The taunting they endure becomes a way of life , like a routine which plays itself out over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break the cycle and are so low in confidence that they can not see a way out . <p> They know it takes a lot of guts and courage to find the strength to break away from a seemingly impossible situation , yet feel so helpless that they do n't believe they are capable . Adults usually repeat their childhood way of coping with abuse by remaining silent and not wanting to trouble anyone else . Often something then happens that tips them over the edge , leaving them no choice but to deal with it . Their whole world collapses around them . <p> Out of chaos comes order , though not many people see a catastrophe as a way out . For victims of verbal abuse it can really set them free . It can mean a fresh start and give them a feeling of liberation as they dust themselves down and leave their previous life behind . They become empowered as transformation helps their confidence gradually return , and they realise that the world is not such a scary place . <p> Children encountering verbal abuse really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely they will continue to encounter it in other forms as they mature . Adults have more opportunity to deal with it but often hesitate because any decisions they make may have a ripple effect on others , particularly family members . The only way to be free from abuse is to nip it in the bud immediately as it arises - do n't suffer in silence . <p> Nobody has the right to make anyone feel worthless and control their life to the extent they feel trapped . If you are a victim reading this , take one small comfort in the knowledge that your pathetic abuser is probably feeling ten times worse and knows one day they will be held to account for what they have done . <h> Please leave a comment - Let me know if you found this helpful and informative 64479 @qwx924479 <p> sending <p> LensSeller 6 years ago <p> A very thought provoking lens , well done . <p> Author <p> Marcia 6 years agofrom England <p> Thankyou very much for your comment .

She 's really young and sexy , and she said she wanted to meet you . <p> How could he be a gigolo ? <p> How could she be so deceptive ? <p> While many couples meet , date and even marry through online sites , not all online encounters lead to wedded bliss , and some can lead to financial or emotional disaster . <p> Sadly , these con artists do n't wear signs telling you to beware and run the other direction . They are quite good at appearing honest and innocent , and extremely skilled in conning people out of their money , their virtue and their dignity . <p> Here are some common tricks used by professional scammers , and ways to avoid getting into their traps . <h> Online dating sites are prime hunting grounds for predators <p> Beware of con artists and scammers on dating sites . Source <h> How to spot predators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites have gotten much trickier to spot in the past several years . The poor writing and bad spelling so common a few years ago is less often as evident ; profiles can be expertly written these days . The best way to spot con artists through their profiles is to scrutinize the content . Here are some things to watch for : <p> Men targeting women : It 's not unusual for these men to claim to be widowed , and frequently they will claim to have one young child ( a son about eight years old seems to be common , for some reason , but it can be any age ) . They can also claim they 're caring for an elderly parent . <p> Often , either in the profile or in one of the first messages they 'll send , they 'll mention they are ' working ' in a foreign country . Be advised , the ' son ' or elderly parent does n't exist , and neither does Mr. Handsome Man . The con artist mentions the fake son or other relative to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More on that in a bit . <p> The rest of the profile can be written quite excellently - the reason is , they have cut and pasted paragraphs from real profiles and these are used to build the ' fake ' profiles . Some less polished con artists are still new at the game , and you may still see profiles in broken English and poorly written ( not just bad spelling by a real person ) , which can be a very strong indicator of a problem . <p> Does the profile specifically say they are an American Citizen ? This very likely means it 's a con artist . The reason is , real American Citizens do n't go around identifying themselves that way . That is an abnormal statement , and therefore , a red flag . <p> Sometimes con artists will mess up by listing hobbies ( if the online dating site has places to list them ) that are n't normal for men , such as knitting , crafts , etc . In recent years , the con artists have figured out this can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Women targeting men : Female con artists who target men can appear very enticing if they claim to be from another country - the more exotic , the better . <p> Unlike scammers who target women , these con artists will rarely claim to have children ; it is not as attractive to male victims as it might be with female victims to connect with someone who has children . However , they will often be living with an elderly parent or other fragile relative . Again , this sets up the scenario for needing money . <p> Often , the ' young woman ' will claim to be finishing her education , or to have a small business or otherwise sound industrious and somewhat educated . <p> As with the con artists targeting women , these scammers can frequently have well-written profiles rather than the broken language of a few years ago . But since they may already claim to live in another country , poor language is n't always a problem . <h> Many Internet scammers use fake profile photos and descriptions <p> Read online profiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a con artist or predator . Source <h> If it seems too good to be true , it probably is . <p> Online scam artists capitalize on tugging at your heart and appearing normal in every way . A few years ago , they used to be easy to spot , because there usually was n't a photo and the profile was often poorly written , in broken English . In recent years , this is no longer the case , which means potential victims are even more vulnerable than before . <p> The photo looks amazing : Many con artists who troll dating sites now use photos that are almost too good to be true , or look slightly ' off ' for some reason . <p> Men targeting women : Con artists targeting women will often post model-perfect photos on the profile page . The guy looks like he could be in magazine ads ; handsome , viral , posed just right - like a professional head shot for a portfolio , which it probably is , and the person in the photo likely does n't know he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are indeed some handsome men out there looking for dates , but if you get a flirtatious message from a guy whose profile photo is beyond cute , do n't rush in until you assess things a bit . <p> Another type of photo to beware of is one that just plain does n't look ' right ' for your culture . If you live in the United States and you get a message from some guy who just does n't dress like guys do here ( I saw one of a middle-aged man in white pedal pushers and a red-striped T-shirt , on a sailboat ) , check him out further before moving on . <p> Women targeting men : Often , the photos will be of incredibly sexy , young and beautiful . She thinks you 're the man of her dreams , even if you 're in your 50s , overweight and no longer Mr. Hunk material . The photos can be overly provocative ( the con artist wants to get your attention ) , or sometimes look less suggestive , but very exotic . <p> Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the goal is financial and whether conning could be the motive . Certainly , there are successful relationships with age differences in the couple , but the anonymity an online venue provides makes potential victims even less able to evaluate the situation than in person . And we all know that many people end up being conned in person , too . <h> Beware of invitations to communicate directly very early in the relationship <p> Online predators like to draw you away from web interaction and communicate through instant messages or the phone . Source <h> What about you ? <h> Do you think you can recognize an online con artist if you meet one ? <p> Yes - I 've seen them online and I 'm learning to spot them <p> Maybe - I thought I knew how to spot them , but I 've learned new things here <p> Probably not - I am very trusting , and I can see they 're sneaky and evil people <p> No - Someone needs to screen my dates and approve them for me ; I 'm too much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since you probably are not the one who initiated contact ( by clicking on the profile and sending a message ) , your first contact with them will likely be when the con artist send you a message wanting to meet you . Here are a few things to watch for : <p> They claim an instant attraction : If you get a message saying someone more or less fell for you the minute they read your profile , beware . They usually claim they read your great ( sweet , caring , whatever ) profile and that they saw how beautiful or cute you are look and they want to meet you , because you might be the one for them . Potential victims have been known to get messages saying they 're beautifuor handsome when they have n't even posted a photo , and comments about being sweet and terrific when the text in their profile is practically empty . <p> Immediately asking you to instant message or email : This is a huge , huge red flag . If you get a message from someone you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IM address , run fast . Anyone upstanding on a dating site will not push you into offline communication in their first message . Online scam artists almost always push for this right off the bat . The reasons are multiple : <p> Better control over the conversation , and over you ; they can instantly adapt to your responses and needs <p> They work in shifts - this allows someone in their little business to ' talk ' with you , 24/7 <p> They know they will get kicked off the site soon ; this gives them a short window of time to lure a victim into the direct communication crucial for their scams <p> Instant messages allow them to adapt their dialogue in ways that better entice the victim <p> The entire con job depends on being able to communicate with you directly , without going through the website . If you trade emails with them but you say you do n't do Instant Messaging , they may even go as far as creating an account for you and send you the username and password . <p> Instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can create an air of immediacy and urgency , and they can lure you back to the conversation quickly . Emails are a first step if you do n't go for the request to IM , but those are more difficult scams for the con artists to manage , because they know you may read them right away , or hours or days later . <p> Phone contact : The con artist may or may not ask you to talk by phone . Some are quite good at pulling off the con job with no contact other than IM or email . This is especially important if they have a distinct accent that would tip you off that they are n't who they 've represented themselves to be . <p> Laying the groundwork for the con : This will likely be a family emergency of some sort , such as the ' son ' or ' elderly parent ' needing surgery . It can also be an agreement to meet you in person , at your expense . These people have no conscience - this is their industry ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Often , the con artist is very skilled at getting you to offer whatever they want ; they do n't even need to ask for it , you volunteer it . <p> Family crisis scams : At some point , often fairly early , they will begin setting the stage for an emergency that only you ( and your money ) can solve . They generally do n't ask for money directly ( although they can ) . Instead , they lay out a scenario that appeals to your sympathy . The son or elderly parent suddenly gets sick , and they send you messages with regular updates , clearly showing their anxiety . But the illness or the surgery they need is n't covered by insurance . Or the only place that can perform the surgery is in another city , and they do n't have airfare to get there . <p> Note that these are quite often indirect strategies . They do not openly ask for money - they simply begin the sob story ( carefully and slowly ) to suck you in and get you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the specific request , in many cases . If you fail to offer the help , they may get brazen enough to ask for it . But since they are actively pursuing other victims at the same time they 're conning you , why waste time going that far ? <p> Travel cons : Another ploy is to woo and entice you to meet in person , but of course , you need to buy the tickets . They then cash in the tickets and take the money . Some victims have even been conned a second or their time by claims that the tickets were stolen or had to be cashed in for an emergency . The con artist will keep draining the victim as long as possible . The groundwork for travel cons involves you sending them money to buy tickets ( or sending the actual tickets ) with a plan to meet somewhere else . Obviously , the con wo n't work if you travel to where they live ( for one thing , they probably do n't really live there ) , because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket . There will be some reason they ca n't meet you on their turf ; they will agree to meet you somewhere else , but will not be able to afford the tickets for the trip . <p> Conning through business investments or purchases : Maybe their family business is in trouble - the elderly parent did n't pay taxes right before they died and your new love will lose the business . Or they 've got a great business that will take their entire family out of poverty , if only they have ( pick a dollar amount ) for licenses , government approval , plumbing in the building or some other expense . <p> Scamming money for debts or repairs : Con artists can introduce sad stories about debts they need to pay before they can marry someone , or car repairs they need in order to visit you or keep their job . They will claim they ca n't leave the country until the debt is paid , or that they ca n't leave their sickly relative without paying for health equipment they need . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Source <h> True stories of dating con artists and scammers <p> There are numerous real and fictitious examples of con artists at their best . Here are a few real-life and fiction examples that show how scammers do their work : <p> Faking a Terminal Illness : Jessica Vega has been indicted for fraud and grand larceny and is accused of faking leukemia in order to get others to pay for an expensive wedding and honeymoon . The case has n't been tried yet , but the type of behavior she is accused of is similar to cons used on Internet dating sites ( the fake illness ploy ) . <p> Other instances have been reported as well , too numerous to catalog here . Older persons hoping for a relationship can be targeted by con artists who are much younger , such when A 69-year-old woman from the USA allegedly gave a 24-year-old man $221,000 toward funding an expense for the Olympic Games in London . The man , nearly three times younger than she is , was arrested in an investigation of money laundering . <h> Dirty Rotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caine 's character has his victim begging him to let her give him money <h> Movies about romantic deception and con artists <p> Dirty Rotten Scoundrels : This classic movie , staring Steve Martin and Michael Caine , was later made into a successful Broadway musical . Although the movie is a comedy , the techniques used by the two lead characters are typical of the ' conning through persuasion ' strategies used by professional con artists . Both characters smoothly lie to their victims and set them up for their cons . <p> The clip here shows how Michael Caine 's character has wooed various women to con them out of money , then , through Steve Martin 's character pretending to be an out-of-control sibling , drives them away . This creates a situation where the victim ends the relationship because it can not be sustained , which means the con artist gets by with it . Please excuse the overdone character Steve Martin plays here ; no offense is intended by showing this clip . <p> Pillow Talk : This classic comedy features a handsome man ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in the name of romance . The movie was so popular that the two stars were paired in a subsequent film , Lover Come Back , with a new spin on the same basic theme . Films of this type suggest to audiences that con artists can redeem themselves and be worthy mates . <p> HouseSitter : In the name of gender equality , we need to mention at least one female con-artist in the film industry . Goldie Hawn portrays a deceiving and manipulating con-artist throughout the entire movie . Typical of comedies , though . the audience loves her , as does the lead actor , Steve Martin . And , of course , they live happily ( if dishonestly ) ever after . <h> Watch for indications they want you to sell something of value in order to provide them with money <p> Source <h> What to do if you meet a con artist <p> If you 're on a dating site and you meet someone you believe might be a con artist , the following steps will help protect you as well as others on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her profile to the site administrators . Part of their job is to protect you and other potential victims . Often , site administrators have ways to see if the individual is indeed a scammer and they will delete the person 's profile . <p> Do NOT give this individual your email address , IM information or any other details that can personally identify you , such as your real name or where you work . <p> Block the person from contacting you on the site <p> Cease contact immediately , do not engage in messaging with them , and do n't look back <p> If the person has already engaged in what could be criminal activity , gather all data on how to locate and identify them and report it to the proper authorities . Their Instant Message address , email account , phone number , skype address and other channels through which they 've contacted you can help the right authorities track them down . <p> Final words : If you 're on a dating site , go slowly . It probably took a lot of thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " so do n't rush into anything when you start meeting someone . It can make people giddy with excitement to think there are people all over the world , just waiting to meet them . <p> Take time to learn about the individual the same way you would in person . Watch for the warning signs as well as the good signs , and do n't be afraid to back away if red flags start appearing . <p> This is true , ScamPolice - and the same goes for male profiles . You 're right that some sites create fictitious profiles just to attract victims . They 'll use stock photos ( or photos of someone who does n't know their image is being used ) and then create artificial lives . It 's beyond evil for people to con their victims romantically as well as financially . <p> Thanks for reading the hub , and for your comment ! <p> ScamPolice 2 years agofrom Vermont <p> A large number of female profile on dating sites are fake .

Do an Internet search for information on the definition in your state or country . You can start making regular complaints ( with specific details ) , to develop the trail of evidence . You might also contact a center for abused women to see what channels they 're aware of .

It 's even more scary when you realize there are some entire cultures that have decided they 're good places to scam people . If you send money overseas , you will likely never get it back , even through legal channels , because there are few ways to track it after it 's left the USA .

Mixed feelings , I guess ? <p> @ Suzettenaples - As many others have said , there are some success stories on those sites . I think it 's like driving a car ; you have to know the road you 're on , and recognize the dark alleys if you see one . Hope this information is helpful , if you do try the sites ! <p> @ Purpose Embraced - Thanks so much for your comments , and for passing along the information ! Those who are in the dating mode do need to know what to avoid . <p> @ KoraleeP - Oh yes , I have started getting those odd FB messages , too ! I do n't know how they find us there . I do know that some people have fallen for people on the dating sites , and also on Facebook . How I wish there were a way to ban them from the entire Internet . Thanks for your comments ! <p> Person of Interest 3 years agofrom USA <p> Congrats on the Hub of the Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of problems . In fact , I 've even shared it . <p> Koralee Phillips 3 years agofrom Vernon British Columbia Canada <p> I recognize those messages you talked about at the beginning of your Hub . I 'm not on a dating site , but sometimes I get random messages like that on Facebook , in my " other messages " section . <p> Great tips and warnings for online dating sites and what to watch out for . <p> Yvette Stupart PhD 3 years agofrom Jamaica <p> This is a great hub . It is well written with a lot of relevant information . I am not in the dating game , but will surely pass it on to others who will find it useful . Thanks for sharing an excellent hub . <p> Suzette Walker 3 years agofrom Taos , NM <p> Marcy : Congratulations on HOTD . I enjoyed reading this and you give some excellent advice and tips for the lovelorn . I have been hesitant to use any of these dating web-sites . I know there have been some successes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effort . You have covered it all in the scam department . <p> Linda Bilyeu 3 years agofrom Orlando , FL <p> Excellent advice and tips Marcy ! I have a few friends who used online dating . Some are happily married , some have banned the sites from their lives . I hope I never need to use them . Congrats on the HOTD ! <p> Author <p> Marcy Goodfleisch 3 years agofrom Planet Earth <p> Hi , Patrick - I 'm not sure if you mean you 're shocked at her knowing your name , or that there was a response that met your request . If the picture includes a woman , and if she 's part of a scamming operation , what probably happened was that whomever rubs the scam has women he can use for photo ops . If you had not revealed your name , that would indeed be creepy . It 's possible she ( or they ) could have gotten your name from a social site or picked it together somehow from other information . If you 're on IM , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hack into your computer that way . I 'm not sure that 's the case ( we would hear people screaming about it ) , but since hackers can even install webcam software and operate it remotely , just about anything can happen . <p> If you feel these are scammers , get as much of their information as possible and report them to every possible agency . <p> Patrick 3 years ago <p> I have a situation she is a beautiful woman from Ghana . I am sure she is scammer but was shocked today I asked to write my name on a large piece of paper and send me a picture and she did it . Any thoughts ? <p> Author <p> Marcy Goodfleisch 3 years agofrom Planet Earth <p> Well , it sure walks like a duck and quacks like a duck . I think you dodged a bullet , Roniti - glad you spotted his true colors . Yikes ! <p> Author <p> Marcy Goodfleisch 3 years agofrom Planet Earth <p> Thanks , Oldiesmusic - the con artists who do it regularly are pros at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone , so their energy is spent in perfecting their lies . I 'm glad you found useful information here , and I hope you never meet one of these creeps in person . <p> Ronit Zemach 3 years ago <p> I almost fell into the trap of honey by email .... amazing ... until he fell in love .. this by email <p> Hello Roniti .. <p> Thanks for answering my calls .. I missed you so much .. when we were talking .. mine colleague was with me .. I do n't  want them to listen to our little financial issue .. Roniti , why I called you I was having some little issue , Because my Business visa , has expired , that was the reason why I called you .. But it was n't something I needed to share with you .. Roniti , I need some few token of your helped .. Because I do n't  know who I can share my issue with .. Sorry about yesterday .. I did n't  gota the chance to write because of the issued that was tabled .. Kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have a Blessed evening .. Love always .. Moses------------ <p> Am I right . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? <p> oldiesmusic 3 years agofrom United States <p> Jesus Christ ! After I read this hub and the stories of the commentors ... it 's really unbelievable , they have the " face " to do that kind of scam . And some of them cite that they work and travel in Africa . Now I know their style . Thanks for your warnings . I sometimes chat with a lot of guys , flirt with them , but there 's nothing serious so far . Now I have to be cautious . Thanks ! Up and shared : ) <p> Author 64477 @qwx924477 <p> Thanks for those insights , Alexander ! I like your move of letting them know you 're onto the Ghana thing . I have also seen people who claim to not drink or smoke , and their pictures show otherwise . I guess the scammers do n't filter their material very well ? <p> Alexander Maximilian 4 years ago <p> One more funny thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never drink alcohol " and in a profile pic they have a glass of wine . Too funny , sometimes if I 'm bored I 'll thoroughly waste their time , and lead them on . Ha ha ha . <p> Alexander Maximilian 4 years ago <p> I have become quite adept at knowing who they are . I have actually put in my profile info " If you are from Ghana , I am not your fool ! Do not waste my time , nor yours . " And when I get IM 's they are not slow to state they 're in Ghana , and then I say " I know about Ghana , Goodbye " But I report the false profile before hand . <p> Author 64477 @qwx924477 <p> Oh , gosh - yes , that has all the earmarks of the scammers . They are always temporarily working in another country , and usually it 's Africa . The reason they reveal that right away is so it wo n't come as a surprise when there 's an ' emergency ' and they need money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( whatever ) needs an operation . Or when they claim they need money for a ticket to come and see you . <p> His claim of only recently moving to your area is so there wo n't be a way to check him out locally . These people are beyond dishonest - really awful . If there 's some way to get his IP info or whatever , you could perhaps report him to federal agencies . Be sure to report him to the dating site and get him banned . <p> Run like heck . And do not IM with anyone like that . I 've heard they can hack into computers from that , but I 'm not sure . As for the flowery poems , I 'm sure he 's sent those to many women . It 's sickening . <p> GMD 4 years ago <p> I think I am being scammed from someone who I met on a local dating site . Said he lived about 30 minutes away. , however he is in " AFRICA " for 1 month drilling wells . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for money yet . But he has started the flowery/romantic/poems . I almost want to toy with him but it would n't be fair to him . His answers are very vague and says he just recently moved to my area from Washington only 2 months before he left for AFRICA . So does't really answer questions I ask him about that area . Anyhow . Thought I would share . I will say he is charming BUT WILL NOT waste my time messaging him anymore . <p> Author 64477 @qwx924477 <p> Hi , Marion - I sure relate to what your mom is experiencing . There are some organized scam operations on most dating sites , and they 're getting better every year at sounding normal and honest . I 'll send up some prayers for your mother to spot the bad apples and to find the jewels who are out there . Thanks for your comments ! <p> marion langley 4 years agofrom The Study <p> I love how you approached this from both sides to equip and protect as many people as possible . Vote up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorced from her 25 year marriage and she 's been complaining a lot about scams she 's running into . From what she hears from friends , who were scammed with rebound marriages , she 's also going to insist on a prenup if she marries again . Scary online dating world out there . Hope I can keep my marriage together so I do n't find myself in it . thanks for writing . <p> Author 64477 @qwx924477 <p> Holy Cow ! Tattuwrun - you came so close to getting scammed ! Thank you , so much , for posting this first-person account of how these guys operate . This is exactly the type of con artist this article discusses , and having a ' real life ' example is so helpful . I 'm so , so glad you recognized what was going on before it hurt you - either financially or emotionally . Good for you ! ! ! <p> tattuwurn 4 years ago <p> I remember having " dated " someone I never even met yet -- and gladly I did n't . While managing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private message from a guy and introduced himself . <p> I looked at his profile pic -- the guy looked ruggedly handsome , at least on that photo . <p> He was seeking friendship with me , and I started corresponding with him . <p> And after that he would send me more PM 's , and his words were becoming more romantic , flowery and passionate . He said he would satisfy my needs sexually , emotionally and financially -- and that he 's living a comfortable life , does travelling as a hobby . He even recounted his past " tragedies " ( such as how his parents died in an accident that left him as an orphan , you know , those kind of sob stories ) . He would call me up almost every morning . <p> I was n't quite falling for him yet but I found him charming . He said he would be ready to fly very soon to my country and visit me . He even said he was going to marry me , and buy a ring for me . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though I was starting to like him very much ... I just had to see how it would go . <p> Until one time he PM 'd me . He said he was in " Africa " for a " stopover " , but he added that he was detained because he lacked certain documents in order for to get himself bailed . And you know what ? He said the authorities also needed money , and he said he did n't have anymore to pay them . So he was asking me for money , I said I did n't have much of that to save him . He insisted that I ask my friends and officemates for money -- even a check or a voucher , etc. or else he would n't be able to get out of " Africa " and make his " marriage proposal " . <p> He was more persistent in sending me mails about the " bail money " . All the romantic talk faded . <p> At first I was genuinely worried about his so-called suffering . Until ... Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to con me . So I replied to his offline messages and started taunting at him for days . Boooo ! ! ! He did n't reply to my messages and never bothered me again . <p> I was almost a victim .. I 'm glad I had the mind not to fall into this trap . <p> I 'm also glad you publish this hub , so that people will never be victims of this scam . Voted up and useful . : ) <p> Author 64477 @qwx924477 <p> Hi , AmandaJon - it 's great to hear a success story ! Naturally , many of us know of happy couples who met online and later married . It 's the con artists who make things difficult for people , though , which is what is being addressed here . Thanks for dropping by and commenting ! <p> Amanda Jones 4 years ago <p> Great hub , very useful tips ! This is so sad that people manipulate other people 's emotions to get money from them , this is outrageous ! <p> One should olways be aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have met my husband online 5 years ago , we still together and very happy . So for joining a dating site was one othe the best decisions in my life . <p> Do n't let those con artist stop you from finding a date online , be careful and keep looking , Good luck ! <p> Author 64477 @qwx924477 <p> Wow - thanks for sharing this real-life experience - and good job in spotting the signs before you got defrauded . How I wish these people would be caught and prosecuted . <p> SerenaRudd 4 years ago <p> I have just become a victim of this , however , i realise that things were n't right when he claimed his 6 year old son had been hit by a motorcycle and was in hospital with injuries he could n't pay for . I strung him along for the rest of the time . Even told him i was on the next flight with money to help . Eventually , i fronted him about it and first he denied it , then admitted it . I was actually trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posing as , who the pictures were of , have tried various sites to reverse search the pics myself and can not find him , only one site in oregon might have one pic . Lessons learnt , this site is very accurate . He was a man with a business working abroad , with a 6 year old son , claiming to live in London , when he was running everything from Nigeria . <p> Author 64477 @qwx924477 <p> Hi , Dancingpopes - thanks for your very informative comment here . I think many women ( and some men ) would like a place where they could ' blacklist ' the bad apples . It 's very true that being scammed out of your emotions is a painful experience - and it takes a long time to recover . If we could figure out what makes some people approach relationships with dishonestly , we would get rich ! <p> Dancingpopes 4 years ago <p> Hi Marcy , <p> Great site ! I wish a site could be created listing the names of men and women from these sites like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you how great you are , etc , but JUST want sex , or tell you how great you are , meet you , and pretend to like you because they think you have money , only to find out you do n't and suddenly they 're gone . <p> That would border on slander , I 'm sure , and some people would list names out of spite , but would n't it be great in a perfect world if there could be a list of these people to check . <p> Not a DEFINITELY SCAMMERS list , but just a BE VERY CAUTIOUS if you talk with these people list . <p> Sad , is n't it , how we women 40+ want to believe a guy . I 've never been scammed out of money , I 've been scammed of my feelings . <p> Really , if a guy just wants sex , why ca n't he just ASK for it so we know AHEAD of time that its just going to be physical adult fun . <p> Why must they go through the bulls--- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemistry you have , and what a great team you 'd make ? <p> Ah well . I 've got a few names I 'd love to start the list with . <p> These 2 I do n't believe are BAD men , but any woman that deals with them needs to use CAUTION so that they do n't get their feelings hurt--because that REALLY lowers a woman 's self esteem . <p> I wo n't name them , but ladies just BE CAUTIOUS of VERY good looking 40-42 year old men from Boston , Vermont , and Enfield , CT . <p> Author 64477 @qwx924477 <p> I 'm so sorry you went through that , Jan - I know of others who have been conned , and it hurts on so many levels . How I wish there were easier ways to spot these jerks . <p> Jan 4 years ago <p> Good information , I wish I had read this before I gave my money to a con artist . He had my heart now I 'm hurt and not trusting . He talked to me for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I no longer will use dating sites . <p> Author 64477 @qwx924477 <p> Hi , Graham - thanks for your kind words of support ! It 's very sad to see the increasing instances of dating scams every year . Many of them are cottage industries in Third-World countries where groups of people troll websites ( dating or otherwise ) and send enticing messages . I guess the odds work in their favor , when they generate thousands of contacts but finally get big money when they pull someone into their net . <p> Graham Lee 4 years agofrom Lancashire . England . <p> Hi Marcy . Congratulations on this wonderful hub . It is so informative and helpful .

I had an odd message early on from someone asking me for personal help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' stuff . I hope you reported this to the moderators ? The person probably contacted several Hubbers .

I felt like writing back and saying , this is n't a dating site , but I did n't want him to know my email . I would never trust these sites , I have heard to many horror stories . I have watched programs on tv about women who give out thousands of pounds so that the guy can come over to the uk , or meet them abroad , and they never find them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking them for their stupidity ! but then I feel sorry for them for their loneliness and desperation . <p> Excellent tips on online dating .

Thanks for your comments ! <p> Author 64478 @qwx924478 <p> Wow - what a story , Aviannovice ! You should write about that experience - I 'm so glad you gave that example here . The con artists are experts ; they know what will work ( how to get the money ) , and will quickly move on if they ca n't get cooperation . I met one woman who paid a guy 's way to the USA , with the plan they would marry . He did n't even had standing in the church .

Thanks for the ' Scoundrels ' clip - I had forgotten how funny that movie really was . <p> Deb Hirt 5 years agofrom Stillwater , OK <p> The profiles are good , because they belonged to someone else that got turned off by the dating site because there was a scammer . The scammer already had their info , so voila ! I ran into a couple of those losers . One dumb enough to send " form " letters with all the misspellings , and one that forgot who he was and sent the same letter under another name . They are generally tied to western Africa , like Ghana or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nigerian , living in CA . By the way , they did n't get a nickel from me , though the attempt was made . Claimed mom was in the hospital in Nigeria and the US check would n't be accepted as it had to clear . I knew what was going to happen and I offered my Visa , but the hospital had to contact me . I was flatly refused and told it had to be Western Union or nothing . So I said , okay , nothing it is . And that was the end of that . <p> Sandra Busby 5 years agofrom Tuscaloosa , Alabama , USA <p> Great hub .

Throw the rice , wish them luck and watch them ride off into the sunset . <p> This hub is excellent and it 's all valuable info for cyber-daters to be aware of . Some of the sad but true horror stories that have been the result of far too many of these " arrangements " should be warning enough for anyone . <p> But , as we humans continue to remain true to nature ... " This would NEVER happen to me .

@@96276069 @476069/ <h> 10 Signs Your Spouse Is Having an Affair <p> You think that your significant other might be cheating on you . You do n't want to sit idly by and let this happen but you do n't want to wreak havoc in the relationship by making accusations that do n't have any validity . The truth of the matter is that the best way to find out if a partner is cheating on you is just to ask - this keeps the lines of communication open and encourages trust in the relationship . However , that 's not always the right choice for some people to make - at least not until they have a good sense of what the answer to their question is going to be . <p> For those people who are trying to figure out if their partner is cheating on them , here are ten signs that an affair is likely to be taking place : <p> 1 . Your gut instinct says so . The most correct sign that your spouse or partner is cheating on you is that you feel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cheating then there 's a good chance that there 's a good reason that you have these suspicions . Of course , this is just one sign of a possible affair so you are going to want to look for more than this but it 's a really good indication that something is n't quite right in this relationship . <p> 2 . There are significant changes in your partner 's behavior towards you . These are n't necessarily negative changes either . If your spouse suddenly starts calling you just because when he never did that or buying you flowers for no reason then there might be some indication there that he is having an affair and is trying to make up for the guilt that it is causing him . Negative changes such as a lack of phone calls could also be a sign of this . <p> 3 . Your partner is spending more money than usual and you do n't know on what . Of course , this could be a sign of some other big secret as well - such as a gambling problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an affair is taking place . People spend money on their new lovers and spend money to be secretive about an affair ( hotel room rentals and such ) so if money is going out the window and you do n't know where it 's landing , an affair might be happening . <p> 4 . There is a break in communication . You ask your husband how work was and instead of telling you stories about the office , he just says " fine " . Things like this indicate that he may be hiding something and figures that just not saying anything about anything is a good way to keep this secret . <p> 5 . Mutual friends stop seeing you as often or start acting strange when talking to you . Unfortunately other people who know you are more likely to know about an affair before you find out . Many wo n't tell but they 'll distance themselves from you or otherwise try to make themselves less responsible for the problem . If your friends are acting strange , you might want to ask them if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is spending a lot of time with one specific person . Yes , people join gyms and make gym buddies or they start work projects and spend late nights at the office with their team . But if a slew of new phone calls and emails and appointments are directed towards one individual , you may be right in assuming that there 's more to the relationship that what meets the eye . <p> 7 . Your significant other is suddenly more interested in his own appearance than usual . People in long term relationships tend to slack off on certain things - grooming and hygiene habits , dressing up to go out , etc . If these things start becoming a priority again then it might because there is someone else out there in the world other than you that your partner wants to impress . <p> 8 . Your sex life is different . If things were going along normally and suddenly there is a change then it could be a sign of an affair . The specific change may vary . It may be an increased interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be that he 's suddenly interested in trying out new things that you 've never talked about before or had n't talking about it in a long time . Or it may be that he just feels like he 's not quite there in the same way during sex . Slight changes could mean nothing at all or they could be a symptom of an affair . <p> 9 . Travel or reasons to be out of the home increase . The most stereotypical sign that someone is having an affair is that they are suddenly taking a whole lot of business vacations or spending too many late nights at the office . These signs are commonly stereotyped signs because they often really are signs of an affair . If these are coming up in your relationship , you may want to start asking questions about why . <p> 10 . Your partner is avoiding you . You do n't see each other as much as you used to . You do n't have intense conversations anymore because he has to check his email or run errands every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves before you get up in the morning or comes home after you 're in bed . If your partner is avoiding you then there is probably a reason and the reason might be an affair . <p> The thing about all of these signs is that they may not be signs of an affair after all . Your gut instinct could be caused by nothing more than jealousy and fear . The constant workouts with the new gym buddy may be nothing more than a desire to do something different for awhile . In the end , you 're still going to have to ask your spouse for the truth if you want to know for sure whether or not he is cheating on you . But looking for these ten signs can help you decide whether or not HubPages Network account . <p> Connie Moribe 2 months ago <p> How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should catch that cheating spouse .. !

I never knew nothing of this spell up until my ex broke up with me leaving me frustrated with life , then a close friend gave me info about a spell lady who helped him to get back his job , he said many things about this spell lady and how powerful she is . I contacted this spell lady on her email priestessifaa@yahoo.com not having an idea of how things work , I chatted and talked over the phone just to be sure of what am about to do . But i was very confuse and skeptical though i was heart broken . <p> To cut the long story short , the spell lady did spell that worked for me in 2days .

One thing though is if you are facing life struggle and difficulties , you would do anything to get out of it just like i did . The only reason I genitally contacted this spell lady was because I liked what friend were saying about her . They were all right on with what I found out too .

ONLY I have to call . She never calls even if the last conv was a day back .... I feel like world has ended ... without her ... because she was my world .... I hate to be alive with such a relationship . <p> Romeo 5 years ago <p> You only live once <p> Keith 5 years ago <p> I 'm sorry but I must post ..... if someone cheats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT IS EVERYTHING BUT RIGHT . Never should cheating be an option . If you are unhappy , then leave . Cheating only opens the door for others to be hurt . It affects more than just you or your significant other . <p> And people , please ..... it 's not that men are necessarily stupid or less intelligent than our counterpart ; we just do n't care . If a man is wanting to cheat or delve into anything other than his other half , it 's because he just does n't care anymore . He does n't want to be caught , but has weighed this in his mind ..... " if I get caught , then what ? " The consequences to him will be the deciding factor . Rest assured that if someone really wants to keep something from you , whether they be male or female , then it will happen . <p> lovely 5 years ago <p> the only sign i 'm experiencing with my husband is the behavior change n gut instinct but tht can not count because i 'm very jealous and insecure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once before . we split up for 7 months while i was pregnant with his child .. he got distant and told me he was seeing someone else so did n't necessarily cheat ...... i 'm so damaged its hard to believe anything or anyone ........ he does n't have any major signs some of them are he s up and down one month he is distant and the next he is super nice and affectionate like a damn roller coaster with him ! one month he wont care about his apperance the next he really does ... what does this mean ? ? ? he always has a diff pattern ? ? ? ? ? sometimes he texts me everyday at break n sumtimes he juss do n't ? he does n't hide his phone or ever hardly get on computer we r always together except at work .... and i do n't always know when he actually gets off cuz its a trailor factory ? he tells me that a pretty girl juss started is he being honest w me cuz he loves me or is tht a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? wish he was juss the same person all the time and not so up and down hot and cold ? <p> Tank 5 years ago <p> What about women they cheat yes they are smart but what about the good men help us out <p> CJB 5 years ago <p> My wife ca n't seem to stop contacting ex boyfriends and sexting them . She does n't know that I know ... but it does n't take a genius to know something is going on . Like this article said , I first felt it in my gut that something was wrong , and I asked her about it ... she said nothing was wrong . So I let it go as if maybe I was just overreacting .... trust me ppl ... always trust your gut . I picked up her phone one morning and looked at who she had been talking to , because it had n't been me . What I found next gave me a feeling that some ppl would call rage ... only about 100 times worse . I wo n't go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picture that a man had sent my wife ... and it was n't a picture of his face . The texts that they were sending back and forth made my stomach turn . Again , my wife has no clue that I 've seen all this , or even knows about the sexting . As of right now , that 's all I know of that 's happened , I have no proof that they have actually met . Despite what ppl say ... if you have a reason to think that your wife , husband , boyfriend , girlfriend , whoever ... is cheating on you , physically or emotionally ... YOU DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO INVESTIGATE .... especially if there is a paper that says marriage license on it ! ! ! I have yet to bring this subject up to my wife ... because I plan to get as much proof as I can ... and just part of my heart is hoping that she will realize what 's she 's doing is wrong , and stop on her own . If she does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angel 5 years ago <p> I 'm offended on how this article refuted to men as cheating . They use words suck as " he " . <p> First of all , not all men cheats , I never did anything to hurt my girlfriend and never will I ever do anything to hurt her . <p> She is better then that to have that done to her . And my girlfriend cheated on me before and she did all of things . So next time write he/she . <p> And most of yous are saying " then why am I still with her " <p> because I love her with all my heart and she means the world to me and I forgave her . <p> Jennet 5 years ago <p> Oh my lordly MESSIAH , I GOT LASLEY BACK . I 'm so excited , It only took a 5 1/2 DAYS after the spell casting for him to come back home to me . Bless divinity and bless god . i must be dreaming as i never thoughts he would be back to me after all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am so much shock and just cant believe my eyes . thank you thank you MESSIAH **25;523;TOOLONG thank you from the bottom of my heart . Jennet . <p> Quite 5 years ago <p> my wife has been asking me have i cheated when i was about to leave her about six months ago when she came out and told me that she and another male frined of hers were actually sexually active , however prior to her admitting it to me she was adomate about her and this guy has never done anything and would cry cause i did n't believe her but she said it was before we meet and she did n't tell me cause it was not my business . Now she was telling me that she never done anything with him vigoursly for 10months and i would always tell her that they did but if so that was before my time so i did n't care so he would still come around and do stuff for us around the house but she never told me yet and in this time after being married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get with her but before i got married i told her if a person ever breaks my trust then their DONE cause i have trust issues and now she keeps asking me if i ever cheated , somebody tell me what you think ? I 'm very laid back and take you at your word but i ai n't  no fool <p> notrustonwomen 5 years ago <p> I DO N'T TRUST WOMEN anywhere on this planet . I am dating two women right now both of them are married . I believe women can always cheat on you if they have opportunity , regardless of the culture or religion . Very few do n't cheat because they madly love their guy . <p> DO N'T FUCKIN BLIND TRUST YOUR WIVES . <p> Justice 5 years ago <p> If you feel your partner is cheating you need to take a look at your past relationships . If you have always felt that way no matter who your relationship was with then you may be the problem and the affair you feel might be there is actually nonexistent . I know because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have never met your partners parents you should it may give you some insight about their weird behaviors . My spouses mother is a psycho she still to this day accuses her 65about year old husband of being unfaithful . She is mean and has been since she thought there may have been an affair . He never divorced her though and she is a miserable human being even towards her own children but worse towards her husband . So just think of the person you could become if you never overcome the feeling that one person gave to you the mistrust they created will damage every single relationship your ever in if and o ly if you let it . My father cheated on my mother every chance he got and it has ruined my relationships in life ..... the thing is my splice has learned to deal with accusations from watching his mother accuse his father and I have learned to deal with a cheater from watching my mother deal with my father ...... so does that make us the perfect cheaters or does it make us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain and we have learned we do n't want that in our lives ? People do things at specific times because they become selfish at that specific time ..... how selfish are you ? <p> Sexist 5 years ago <p> This article is extremely sexist . My mom has been cheating on my dad and had lied to me about it even when I broke down and cried in front of her . She swore on her own dead fathers body ( who was a priest btw ) and lied to my entire family when confronted about it . So drop <p> The sexism and get real . Woman cheat just as much as men , they 're just better liers . Especially when you trust them because they 're your own mother and you love them . <p> Worried 5 years ago <p> l had this gut feeling my partner was cheating on me , he seemed different , so l did something that l never done before , and l feel guilt about it , and that was go through his phone , and guess what l found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , but how do l approach him on it.l feel sick in the stomach ... and yet he say , s he loves me. , and lm the love of his life .. what am l to do , he is an interstate transport driver . <p> Truthbtold 5 years ago <p> I would like to say that this info is helpful .

Another clue to look for ! And also I must add that once someone has veen cheated on that " gut instinct " is always there , in my new marriage now I am always looking for signs because of my past relationship , and its not fair to my husband but I try to tell myself that my instincts do n't count on this one because I have already been damaged in the sense that I will never trust any man ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Survivor 5 years ago <p> Yes , all of these signs usually are there when someome is cheating , but there not always cheating when the signs are there .

However after 3 years of virtual , husband initiated , celibacy I was feeling so down and unloved that I tentatively joined extra-marital dating site Illicit Encounters earlier this year ( leaving hubbie and kids was not an option for me ) . Since then , I 've met my wonderful and sensitive lover on the site ( who was also trapped in an unhappy marriage ) and our fortnightly illicit liaisons have restored my self worth and I 'd venture to say have saved my marriage ! Statistics I 've read suggest that women are better at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband has n't got a whiff of mine . It does require an ability to compartmentalize your emotions , and women being more sophisticated emotionally may find this easier to do . Having an affair is a huge step , but not always wrong . <p> crissy111 6 years ago <p> What i they use there job as an excuse and yu do n't know if its a lie or the truth ? he s in the army and like most people know they CAN keep yu from things ... but the first week of him making excuses for not coming for lunch i 'm getting suspicious <p> James the Rocket 6 years ago <p> No , if I started buying my girl flowers or treating her better ( am single , am jumping ahead say 2 years into a r'ship ) in some ways , it might be cos I think SHE is having an affair , not that I would be . A lot of your hub makes sense , but this particular idea is wrong . I 'm not a cheater , but believe me , I and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' feel guilty ' if we were cheating . A woman may do this ? I do n't know .. I do know the hairstyle . clothing , gym thing/weight loss thing is a real sign , yes . Girls let themselves go once they snare you , then when things decline they smarten up when they seek passion elsewhere , then they just dump you . My fault for getting girls low on self esteem who are slightly over weight ( you cant get them to exercise , they simply wo n't , so do n't get a cute chubby girl and think you can mould them , cos you cant ) then lose it for the next guy . The phone thing is right on , and yes the work thing is a killer . I 've been emailing a girl in Africa who works ( she says ) in a customs clearing co and travels all the time for her work , she also has exactly 50 black male Facebook friends even though she says she only likes white guys sexually ( like me ) and she once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she was chatting to me ( I could see them chatting on my gmail , ' she says ' , ' sister says ' ) ... if she lies about nothing ... there , how 's that for signs of future cheating ! ? <p> alphonsians93 6 years agofrom Cebu Philippines <p> wow ! ! excellent , because that is very hard to find out ! Superb work of art ! ! ! This is a very interesting topic ! ! ! lots of learning and good insights ! ! ! ! Thankx for the insights <p> " If your spouse suddenly starts calling you just because when he never did that or buying you flowers for no reason then there might be some indication there that he is having an affair and is trying to make up for the guilt that it is causing him .

Want your wife and family and that 's just not good enough , aye ! ? Same goes for women of course . <p> If you want sex with lots of people ; just go do it - ALONE !

ALone . <p> Unless you are the type of sicko who gets off on hurting the ones you are supposed to love the most . Get off on Lieing and playing these demented games . <p> GROW UP !

Gut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouse or loved one to be having an affair , its something in their actions , unusal behaviour and yes ... the fact they are being unusually ' nice ' equate to suspicions that MAY well be true . <p> Please bear in mind that for one to be having an affair , you have to be in a relationship in the first instance ... please do not fool yourself into believing that the fact you have been out on a few dates dictates that you have a ' hold ' on that person . <p> Until you have had THE conversation that your are making the commitment to be monogamous , then you have a right to accuse someone of an affair . <p> Obviously in a marriage , seeing someone secretively even without any sexual relations is still an deemed an affair ! ! ! and those that may dispute this statement are likely to be the type that want their cake and eat everybody elses ! <p> I have been on both sides on the fence , been cheated on and been a mistress so for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective of whether its forgivable or not is not the point - the point is that the person making the choice to be unfaithful is not happy with the person they are with - FACT that 's why the affair had a chance . So what ever rubbish they come out with ... it was a mistake ... it did n't mean anything .. it was only once .. IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN CAUSE .... and here we go ... wait for it ... the biggie ... cause I LOVE YOU .... hahahaha if you fall for that corker ... then more fool you ... <p> If they loved you that much it would never have happened ... <p> and I know .... men fall over others to get to me .... but the good ones stay true ... even my magical mesmerising presence does not work to break their loyalty to their partner - and that I truly respect and because that is so rare to find , I do not put them in my radar - even to a point I may avoid having them as friends as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheat ' on you ' yes I concur always a cheat ' on you ' but they are not cheaters ... its just accept the fact -you two are not meant to be ... <p> and move on ... <p> If there is any hope - maybe time and space will bring you back together , but then you have to live with the knowledge of the past and that is a choice you have made but be honest with yourself .. <p> Is the choice to stay made because you fear being alone ? ? ? ? <p> MattUSAF2525 7 years ago <p> Really great hub .

@@96276070 @476070/ <h> How Can I Find Love When Im Scared to Approach Girls <p> I 'm a full-time blogger and ghostwriter . I enjoy writing about how to be happier in life and in love . <p> Scared to approach women ? <p> Are you scared to talk to girls ? Are you scared to even look at girls ? It does n't matter how extreme your fear is " if you are not comfortable talking to or approaching girls then you may be letting love pass you by ! <p> When you are scared to approach girls you : <p> 1 . Do n't talk to girls you know are a good match for you <p> This is something that will cost you finding the love of your life . If you know that Susan is the perfect girl for you probably see a lot of the same characteristics , interests , beliefs , and goals in her that you have in yourself . You would probably be a good match . <p> If you let these girls slip through your fingers because you are scared or you because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just be left wondering , for the rest of your life , whether or not that was the girl that would have really made you happy . Does n't that thought suck ? <p> If you see a girl that you know is a good match for you try picturing how it would feel years down the road living in regret . It may help you get the courage up to talk to her . It may even help you get the courage up to ask her out . You will never find love unless you try . <p> 2 . May Become Invisible To Some Girls <p> You may think that the girl of your dreams is going to approach you , but if you are scared and displaying low self-confidence then you may not even hit her radar . <p> I 've often talked about a guy that liked me and tried to get my attention ( he even talked to me ) but I did n't notice him because he was so unsure of himself . I actually did n't even know he existed . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " nothing . It was n't until he gained some self-confidence that I actually SAW him . <p> So if you think that you are going to find love by sitting back and waiting for it , think again . You may be waiting for a lot longer than you anticipated . <p> Every time you stop yourself from approaching a girl and say to yourself something like I probably would n't get her anywase , you are adding to your low self-confidence or fear . You are literally making it harder and harder for yourself to approach woman ! <p> In order to get over fear , any fear , you have to start talking to yourself differently and taking different actions . If you continuously avoid approaching women and talking to yourself in a negative tone then you may never get over your fear . In fact , you may be even more scared than you are right now ! <p> 4 . Could be facing a life of loneliness if you do n't change your beliefs about yourself <p> So if you avoid girls that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , and become less confident every time you tell yourself you can'tget a girl , then you may be facing a life of loneliness ! You may never get a girl in your life . <p> I 've seen many guys like this . Do n't think that it ca n't happen to you , because it can ! You may give up on the whole notion of finding love one day ! You may just say screw it ' and stop trying altogether . It may become more painful to think about trying to find love than it is to sit around and do something else . <p> Do n't become that guy ! <p> Work on improving your self-confidence and go out there and find a girl ! Find love ! Everyone deserves love and everyone has someone waiting out there for them to find . <h> Comments 64479 @qwx924479 <p> sending <p> Author <p> Kari 2 months agofrom Alberta , Canada <p> @Cameron - Either face your fears or live with regret .

" THAT , exacttly is how I feel . Or something like that . I ca n't talk to a girl in the middle of a group without thinking that people will see ( or even think I interested even if I 'm not ) and feeling bad ( or even the girl herself ) . I ca n't even look or hold eye contact with a girl on the train because of that , like people around me are judging me for doing that . And sometimes I think people just conclude that I do n't like girls at all or that I 'm arrogant for ignoring others .

I 'm 18 , never had a girlfriend and do n't really know how to approach girls at all . I do n't have problems talking to girls that i know , but I 'm worried about rejection a lot , and i definitely have self confidence issues . I do n't usually ask for help because I 'm stubborn and sometimes i find it easier said then do just to go up to a girl and say hi , because i immediately start to think about " what the hell am i gon na say next " . <p> The strange thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found myself really attracted to many girls because i do n't really rate them , barring a few who are totally out of my league .

If she thought of you as one of her friends or acquaintances , then you would n't notice any weird behavior from her . <p> Have you been flirting with her ? If not , then she may not understand if you are interested in her or just talking to her . Show your interest and see what happens . Ask her out on a date and see what happens .

For instance , learn how to approach women differently or stop judging women negatively and start seeing the positive aspect of every person you see . Essentially , try new things , learn new concepts , change your beliefs , take courses , read books , learn more , etc . <p> I 'm not judging the pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viable way to help you lose your fear and build your confidence . But , yeah , if you do it , do n't risk the infection thing . Make sure that you are guaranteed , in some way , that she is STD free . <p> Strong , better habits are learned from experience . Habits = talking to yourself more confidently , pushing past your fears ( check out this quick video on moving past fear : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=H5ySWB0UgE0 ) , going for what you want , speaking to women in a way that pleases them instead of turns them off . <p> Silver 2 years ago <p> @Relationshipc Thank you for the reply . What do you mean when you say that i need to do things a little different ? What things exactly are you talking about ? <p> I think paying for it would give me the experience of having intimate sexual contact and losing my virginity with a woman and also possibly some confidence in being able to touch women and get close to them without fear of punishment . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( UK ) and there 's also the risk of infection . <p> Yeah i do n't wan na give up just yet , but i think i need to ask more confidently and not come as being too keen or needy . What are the better , stronger habits around women that i need to build ? I 'm afraid of initiating physical contact with them first and even talking to them on Facebook is scary and intimidating . <p> It just feels weird being a virgin at 23 when everyone else already knows what to do when it comes to girls . <p> Author <p> Kari 2 years agofrom Alberta , Canada <p> @Vintersjel - Every sentence - actually every word you wrote tells me a lot . You are right , there is nothing I could say that would help you until you change the way you think and view yourself . <p> Vintersjel 2 years ago <p> I am that guy . I have social anxiety disorder and avoid all female interaction . I just ca n't bring myself to talk with females . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have social anxiety disorder . Until you have experienced social anxiety you have no idea what it 's like . Yes you can have plenty of friends who have SAD but they wo n't be able to relay to you what it is like . I 'm 44 and have n't had female companionship in 18+ years . I seriously doubt you can give me any advice that would help me that I have n't heard before <p> Author <p> Kari 2 years agofrom Alberta , Canada <p> @Silver - Sounds like you need to do things differently . Do you think that paying for it would give you more confidence with women or just an experience ? That decision is up to you , but you do n't want to regret it if you get nothing out of it and feel uncomfortable the whole time . It could even work against you and lower your confidence with women even more . I suppose , though , it could work for you if you think you would become more confident from it . <p> And , you said you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's not enough times to really understand what you are doing wrong and learn from it . If you were to give up on asking girls out , it would be like giving up on anything you 've only tried a few times ... which you would probably not do for most things , right ? <p> Do n't live in the past . So you missed out on some younger years to be awkward around women ( which almost all guys are at that age ) . You have a chance to be awkward around women right now ! Yay ! Being awkward is how you learn . Each time you get rejected , learn why and use that information in the future . The more rejected you get , the more you learn , the less you make the same mistakes , and the more confidence you gain . <p> In the end all you can really do is try to be yourself . As long as continuously learn as you go , and develop stronger , better habits around and with women , then you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable . It is outside your comfort zone ! But the more you do it , the bigger your comfort zone will get and the less panic will set it . <p> Also , do n't get caught up in the ' I 'm a virgin ' thing . So what . <p> Silver 2 years ago <p> As a person with mild social anxiety , this is really tough stuff . I can talk to women in a non-sexual context okay but when it comes to getting really deep and intimate or even playful with them , then in really struggle . <p> I used to have crazy bad social anxiety and i did n't leave my house for 14 months once and missed out on a LOT of socializing with women ( around age 18-19 ) <p> The friends i 'd hang around with in school would always make jokes that i 'd never get a girlfriend or be in a relationship and they were right . <p> They 'd always rub it in my face when they 'd easily get girls . I 'm still a virgin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex . Even the thought of asking a girl out who likes me is enough to give me a panic attack . I 've been seriously considering paying for it . <p> The few times I 've summoned up the courage to ask a girl out , they either flake out or do not respond to my messages . I get terrified at the sight of a woman in public and it shows in my body language and tone of voice . I also end up judging women and so they 're put off by me . <p> Do n't really know what to do with myself now . <p> Author <p> Kari 2 years agofrom Alberta , Canada <p> Justin , you are , hands down , the most articulate person that has ever left a comment on one of my articles .

But it is even more wonderful if the relationship becomes sweeter as the years go by . <p> How is the status of your marriage ? Is the fire still burning or the it is already frozen cold ? <h> Losing the Air of Romance <p> Sadly , there are those who are into very cold stage of marriage . After some years of saying " I do " , many married couples do n't even mind if their relationship turns too ordinary with no more sugar and spice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love and are set to separate but rather they have unwittingly gone to the point of losing excitement for each other . There is no third party here and the fact is they still do still love each other . However the air of romance just disappears and they seem to not even mind at all . <h> Busyness Kills The Sweetness of Marriage <p> Busyness is actually the chief culprit . Being so busy in performing their respective tasks as father and mother of the family is killing the romance . They could hardly feel that this busyness is putting off the fire in their relationship . <p> Take the case of the Santos couple . Mrs. Santos , a stay- home Mom serves her family diligently as ever . Mr. Santos on the other hand works just as hard for the finances of the family . They are both committed in performing their respective roles in the family . At a glance , their life seems smooth-sailing and working well . <p> But this couple has actually forgotten to keep the fire burning in their relationship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still busy with their own thing . The wife with preparing dinner while the husband with watching the evening news . So , when they are in bed they are already too tired and too sleepy to make love or even engage in sweet talk.To them , sex is just once in a while habit . It is done only when anyone of them feels the urge . <p> True enough , many couples are too busy to express love and thoughtfulness to each other . Even if the love is still there , they are too busy to even express this love to each other . It is as if their marriage is enough to keep them together and no need to keep the love growing and glowing . IN fact , a lot of married couples do n't even celebrate Valentine 's Day or even their own wedding anniversary for they find them not at all necessary . <p> Many couples look okay but a deeper look into their privacy would reveal one sad reality : Their love is almost dead . And sadder still is they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They seem to have forgotten that being married is not just being together in one roof , or sleeping in the same room and in one bed . It is giving each other some quality time to feel that the love and sweetness is still there . <h> Make the First Move To Ignite the Fire Anew <p> Many couples are into this kind of cold as dead relationship and yet they 've been contented with this set-up and a lot made this last till death in fact . But this is not an ideal relationship . Getting married does not mean turning off the fire of romance . It is sad when a couple has forgotten to get into passionate hugging and kissing or even just plain whispers of sweet nothing . <p> Wives , are you happy with cold marriage ? If no , then do the first move to start the fire burning again . Do something to bring back sweetness even if your husband does not seem to bother . Once you ignite the fire , it will surely contaminate him . Find time to restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it grows stronger day by day <p> You may not really lose him physically but if the air of love is no longer felt , then it is nothing different from losing him to another woman . Being a mother is not a reason to set aside your obligation to him Taking care of your kids is one huge task but that is no excuse . If you only try to find time for him then he will reciprocate for sure . <h> Steps to Bring Back the Sweetness <p> Bring back the sweetness and here is how : <p> Be the first to show sweetness . In the morning before going out of bed make it a daily habit to embrace your husband tightly . Make him feel you are thankful you have him . Kiss him and tell him how much you love him and how important he is to you . Give him tender strokes and caress and make him feel you are so in love with him.Also do n't forget to whisper the words " I love you " . <p> Be fresh , clean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come near your husband he will notice your freshness and he will be enticed to hold you . Most men are fascinated with fragrance . Make sure you are one fragrant thing your husband will ever smell . <p> Find a special time with himeach day . Men are usually preoccupied with their own thing but who can resist a fragrant a fresh smelling woman ? When your husband is watching TV , serve him with his favorite drink along with any finger food that he will enjoy . Sit beside him , hold his hand lovingly , enjoy the show with him and make him feel your sweet presence . <p> Give him sweet hugs and kisses when you are at home . Kissing and caressing his arms are sweet gestures and he will mostly likely return the sweetness too . You can also give him some gentle back massage at night while he is watching TV . This will make him feel pampered and soon you will find him doing the same to you . <p> Kiss him goodnight and find time to encourage intimate moment with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . Always make him feel you your warmth and your loving embrace .. <p> Treat him like a King . Your husband deserves to be the King of your household because you are the Queen . God designed the husband to be the head of the family so his authority has to be respected . If you do , he will love and honor you . <p> Be thoughtful . . During special occasions , buy him something that will make him feel special and well loved . If you do n't have the financial capacity , a handwritten love letter will always make a difference . <p> Do n't ever nag . Some women start the day nagging . It is a very bad . That is a habit most disliked by men so avoid that . Indeed there are problems at home that can ruin your day but nagging wo n't help at all . You can always solve the issue without making so much talking . <p> If you wives can do the above , then your husband will find you very attractive again . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be contented in living like a frozen piece of cake that remains untouched inside a fridge shelf . How can you expect anyone to pick up and eat such kind of cake ? <p> Wives , learn to add warmth and let your sweetness melt in your husband 's mouth anew . Light up your fire and let your husband go up in flames too . Keep the fire burning and see how the difference will delight your husband and you ! <h> Put God In the Center of Your Marriage <p> Before you ever think the above are enough there are two more things you have to do to make your marriage even more blissful : <p> First , pray for your husband . This is one thing most women forget . They are too busy and they could not even pray . Delight in the Lord and see how He will give you the desire of your heart . <p> Second , pray with your husband .. A praying couple makes a big difference ! Do the first move so that the two of you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you do , please examine yourself first whether you really are in the right faith . Have you already recognized that you are a sinner and have repented and asked God 's forgiveness for your sinful condition ? Have you already accepted Christ as your Lord and Savior and have since them find the fruit of the Holy Spirit in your life ? If not , then do it today . <p> A godly husband makes a big difference ! But make sure you are also a godly wife . Be a good example in everything so that you will become the living witness that will lead him to Christ . Let your good examples convince him that Christ is really alive in your life . <p> A godly wife is a precious possession your husband will ever have and a godly husband is the best thing your heart will ever see .

@@96276073 @476073/ <h> Are Friends a Toxin to Your Marriage ? <h> Husbands Choosing Their Friends over Their Wives and Visa Versa <p> When two individuals decide to get married , a change occurs in their lives " hopefully for the better . But if people are not willing to place their partner/family above others , it can lead to devastating consequences , regardless of how wonderful the union began . <p> Friends will always remain a vital part of life . Their advice and support will guide you through good times and bad , and you can count on them for their shared joy during moments of triumph and their empathy during moments of pain . However , friends are the people who have the greatest capability of destroying a relationship . Friends have a close bond , and sometimes it 's hard for them to let married friends spend most of their time with their spouses . The challenge comes when friendship interferes with marriage , and a choice must be made . <h> Can Too Much Time Be Spent with Friends ? <p> This poll presumes your spouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends . If your spouse works abroad , you do n't need to participate . However , should you decide to , answer as things are when he/she is home . <h> How much time do you spend with friends , on a weekly basis , without your spouse being present ? <p> Though it is n't true of all friends , there are some who manage to wreak havoc in the following ways : <h> 1 : Trying to Recreate " The Good Old Days " <p> Some guys expect a newly married friend to continue to be as committed to hanging out and doing things together as he or she had previously been . They feel let down when their friend declines to go out for whatever reason , and they may begin to resent him or her for getting married in the first place . Other times , the resentment is directed toward the spouse , who has " taken the friend away .

If the married person ca n't stand up to the friends , his or her marriage will suffer . Hopefully , if it comes down to a choice between friends and spouse , the newlywed will honor the latter commitment . <h> 2 : Hanging around and Demanding Attention <p> Some women and men are famous for dropping in on married couples sporadically throughout the day , demanding immediate attention or lingering with no obvious purpose for visiting . <p> When couples do n't get much time to themselves , it 's easy for outside influences to gradually pull them apart . A demand here , another there , then another one and , before realizing it , the couples ' time is all used up caring for the needs of their friends as opposed to tending to their own needs .

A seed has been planted that , if not cast aside , will be watered more and more until a joke has created a monstrous problem . Friends should always show respect to their friends ' spouses . If they ca n't , they should simply stay away and remain quiet . <h> 4 : Spreading Gossip <p> Gossip is deadly . <p> The last thing a couple needs is constant exposure to gossip , and friends are often the source . Even though people know that situations become exaggerated with every retelling , some still tend to believe every word of gossip that falls on their ears . <p> As if this is n't bad enough , such friends may start spreading stories about the couple , as well .

Steer clear of anyone who is constantly putting someone else down , for whatever reason . Gossip ultimately destroys peoples ' lives and marriages . Yours could be next . <h> Old Habits Die Hard <p> When people choose to get married , often there is a compromise in certain areas . For example , if a woman does n't want her husband drinking too often , or vice versa , she may ask him not to go out drinking with his friends every night . Likewise , if a man does n't want his wife going to clubs alone , or vice versa , she can always pour a drink at home and avoid possible temptation from outside . <p> That being said , when a guy comes banging on the door of a married couple 's home demanding the husband come out and have a few drinks , the husband may be tempted to give in unless he chooses to honor a promise he made to his wife about that very issue .

The three of us were in a car together and he yelled at someone so the next day I apologized to her on his behalf . She said , I never picked up on his rage , only your reaction to it . Really ?

Trust what your partner has to say and move on . Source <p> 1 ) Develop trust : Do n't let your fragile feelings turn into suspicion <p> Jealousy for your girlfriend 's or boyfriend 's ex can easily turn into suspicion and doubt if emotions are not kept in check . Asking too many questions will naturally irritate your ex , who will eventually stop feeling obliged to put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he or she is hiding something from you . <p> Dealing with the topic of exes is a sensitive issue .

It may also include joking at your expense , constant heckling or teasing in public to provoke anger , and tickling , touching , kissing , or other forms of physical acts that you have asked your partner to refrain from in public . It may also include any behavior designed to upset you in front of others . <p> Kate describes an evening with her partner as an exercise in personal misery . He delighted in telling cruel and humiliating stories concerning their sex life and her inadequate parenting skills . If that was not enough he regaled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink . The abuser sometimes ended his tirade with the words , " I was just kidding " or he elicited the sympathies and aid of the older women present . Kate now smirks that after her abuser spun his crazy tales the older women would seek a private audience with her to counsel her on " taking care of her husband 's needs . " She was told that she should allow him to rest in the evenings and spare him from doing her work . The older women meant well and how no idea how they were being used . <p> Char related her partner 's penchant for setting her up in public with women she dubbed " proxy abusers .

Gossiping , spreading rumors , and playing mind games are effective means of controlling others . <p> Maggie described her abuser 's brilliant tactics when it came to spreading gossip and embarrassing innuendos through their social circle . He was a master at tearing up and looking ever-so-sincere before disclosing embarrassing tidbits about her in the form of " sharing concerns " and " prayer requests . " By the time she finally left her abuser her church was concerned for her nonexistent diabetes , menopause , and numerous affairs . She did not bother defending herself . She knew it was time to make her life on her own terms and not waste time outwitting her abuser . <p> Socially abusive behavior is often difficult to detect .

When she finally leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends not under her abuser 's control . Only then can she be accepted for who she is and be free from the image her abuser created of her . <p> Social abuse is one of the most nebulous forms of abuse .

@@96276081 @476081/ <h> The World of Online Dating <p> Online dating has really gained acceptance in the modern world . Searching for love online just five or ten years ago was embarrassing and something you kept to yourself in fear of ridicule . It was thought to be a last resort for people who just could n't date like everyone else . Fast forward to now and online dating is something many people have tried , especially in the 18-24 and 25-34 age group . Online dating has also become easier to navigate through the use of dating apps that you can download on your smartphone . You can literally sit on your couch and search for your next love . Sounds pretty good right ? If only it were so simple .. <p> Just like regular dating , online dating has its rules . If you want to have any success there 's just some things that you should do and others you absolutely should not . First off , a lot of your success in online dating depends on what website you choose to use . Keep in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your preferred choice of method . I have found through personal experience that the paid websites tend to have a better quality of men ( or women ) to choose from . This is simply due to the fact that people tend to take online dating more seriously when they are paying for it . If a man or woman is investing their hard earned money in order to gain access to a dating website , you can bet that they 're not just looking to " netflix and chill " because they might just be into " hulu and commitment . " Many people on the free dating websites are what we call " trolls " in the world of internet lingo . Some of their profiles are n't even real and they 're just using someone else 's photos to mess with people . I would n't waste my time dealing with them . The only free online dating website that is decent is Okcupid . Otherwise go for the tried and true paid ones like Match.com , eHarmony , or Zoosk . <p> Once you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part begins : building your online profile . This is the important step in online dating because what you write or upload about yourself will literally decide what kind of people will contact you . You 're marketing yourself so you better do it right . This is make or break time because you have very little time to make a first impression . Probably even less than in person because people literally scroll through and if they do n't like what they see they will move right past your profile . The photos you use are the most significant thing about your profile . That 's what people will see first and that 's what will decide whether they talk to you or not . Online dating is very superficial in this way so you should use the best photos you have of yourself to make a good first impression . You should be happy and smiling in your photos because people want to get to know people who are happy and having a good time . Use photos no older than one year . It 's really disappointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer looks like the photos on their profile because they 're from eight years ago . Use photos that best describe the type of person you are . If you love swimming , use a photo taken at the beach . If you love to dress up and go out , use a photo when you 're out with friends . Make sure you do n't use too many photos of you holding a drink because people may get the wrong idea that you either love alcohol too much or you might be an alcoholic and no one wants to date those . Use color photos because while black and white ones may look cool , you need to stand out in the crowd . A photo is worth a thousand words and say more about you then anything you write so choose wisely . <p> Next , there 's usually a place on your dating profile page where you can fill out information about yourself like height , ethnicity , education , whether you have children or not , and the type of job you have . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adding a few inches to your height is no big deal but choosing body type as slim where you 're more curvy or big boned is just being plain dishonest . When it comes down to it , people should either like you as you are or they 're just not worth your time . You should n't have to talk anyone into choosing you . The majority of people wo n't even read your profile unless they like your photos anyways so if they 're already on your description then they must like what they see . If you really really do n't want to answer any part of your description , just leave it blank . For example , if you do n't want your profile to say whether you have children or not just leave it blank . If you start talking to someone who interests you and you get on the topic of children , then you can reveal if you have them or not . Just stick with the basics and try to be as truthful as you can without revealing any information that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you can write about yourself in your own words . This is usually a few short paragraphs or maybe just a couple of sentences . I would suggest maybe two paragraphs with three to five sentences each . I do n't want to read your whole life story and it 's probably not a good idea to share it with the internet either . Just write a general description about yourself such as hobbies , interests , and what you 're looking for in a potential partner . If you have a pet write about that . If you love your work , write why you do without going into too much detail . Just something fun and entertaining to let someone know who you are while keeping the mood light and upbeat . When I see a profile that interests me , the first thing I notice are the photos , next I look at the height and education stats , last I read the personal description the person has written . It 's a good sign if someone has gotten to your description because they obviously had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out more . This is your chance to further spark interest in a potential partner . <h> Have you tried online dating ? <p> Once you have your photos uploaded and a little description about yourself , you 're ready to go ! Things work really fast in the virtual world so expect to start talking to people as soon as your profile is finished . I have found most people wo n't even talk to you unless you have a photo so it 's very important to upload if you 're serious about finding a partner . It 's a very rare type of person in this superficial world who will start talking to a blank profile with no idea of what you look like . <p> Women in general receive a lot more messages than men when online dating . I have received hundreds in a day when guys I have talked to about this issue admitted to only getting maybe ten a week if they 're lucky.If you 're a woman and you 're online dating , you 're holding all the cards . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hands and can choose anyone you want to talk to so just sit back and watch as the messages fill your inbox . As a rule of thumb , it 's usually better to wait for the guy to message you first . Just like in real life , men like the hunt and chase and you do n't want to come off as too easy or they 'll lose interest quick . If you want a guy to know you 're interested just view his profile a couple of times . It 'll usually show up on his page that you viewed it and whether or not he writes you will determine if he 's interested or not . If you 're not getting the response you want from him after viewing his profile a couple of times , try sending him a wink or interested in icon if you can . If he does n't reciprocate and you still ca n't get him off your mind as a last resort you can send a casual message stating your name and asking him a question about something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , move on . You time is better spent on someone who is worthy of it . There 's plenty of fish in the sea and we 're just getting started ! <p> Most online dating websites give you the option to filter the types of guys you search for . It 's basically like " build a man " only better . So if you only like guys who are a certain height you can change that to say 5 ' 8 " to 6 ' 5 " ( my preferences ) and only guys who match that height criteria will appear in your search results . You can also do the same with age , ethnicity , education , and many other characteristics . You can filter your search results to only show guys in your city , or any other city or state by zip code . Just be careful not to limit your search to become so narrow that guys like that simply do n't exist . After all it can be very easy to go too far when building the perfect man . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important issue when it comes to online dating . You should never give out personal information to someone you have met on the internet no matter how cute they are . The most personal thing they should know about you is your phone number if you choose to give that out . Never give out your home phone number ( do people still have those ? ) and always just tell them your cell phone . It 's much easier for someone to find out where you live by your home phone number then your cell phone . I would suggest having at least one phone conversation with someone before meeting them in person . You can tell a lot about a person through a phone conversation as opposed to online messages or texting . If you do n't feel comfortable giving someone your cell phone number suggest Skyping or video chatting . This way you will know for sure you 're talking to who they say you 're talking to and not getting catfished . <p> Catfished is a term used to describe a person who pretends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's photos . Be careful about these because there 's plenty of them out there , especially in the world of online dating . Just to be on the safe side , check out someone 's online social media if you can just to make sure they actually exist and you 're not being made into a fool . And this probably goes without saying , but definitely do n't send money to someone you met on the internet . Apparently that 's a thing where people , especially women , are scammed into sending money to people over the internet who are actually scammers in other countries . As a general rule , if someone you meet on the internet is interested in anything more than your time and attention , run quickly in the other direction , or block them from contacting you . <p> When you have Skyped or chatted with someone and you make a date to meet in person , safety is even more of a concern . Just because the handsome stranger looks exactly like he says he does , does n't make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet in a public place with plenty of people . First dates should be casual , like lunch or coffee during the daytime . Tell a friend or family member where you 're going to be during your date so if you go missing they know where to start looking for your body . Never bring a stranger you met online to your home for a first date , that 's just not a good or safe idea . Show a close friend a photo of the person you 're meeting just in case something does happen so they know who to look for . You ca n't be too safe when it comes to meeting someone new because for all you know they are a complete stranger and you can expect anything from them especially if you 're a single woman in this world . <p> In my experience of online dating , I have met two guys in person . Because I am alive and able to write this , they did not turn out to be serial killers . They were the " white and nerdy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom one day . I guess I stayed on the safe side did n't I ? Trust your instincts when it comes to meeting someone in person from the world of online dating . If it just does n't feel right do n't do it . I 'd rather you hurt someone feelings then risk your life and well being . Some people just give off a bad vibe and it 's all right to not want anything to do with them . There 's plenty of others who are good and honest people looking for the real thing . <p> The greatest thing about online dating is that it enables you to meet someone that you otherwise never would . If your dating pool is shallow where you live , online dating might be a good chance to take . Even if you live in a huge city like Chicago or New York , you will never meet every single guy who lives there and online dating gives you better odds of finding a local who 's been close all along but you never even knew . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it 's not for you , then just pack up and delete your profile and say you give it the good old college try . Who knows , maybe your soulmate is out there searching for someone just like you right now , it 's better to know then to wonder what might have been . If there 's plenty of fish in the sea then there 's got to be someone for everyone right ? Happy fishing and I hope you reel in a good catch ! <h> Comments 64479 @qwx924479 <p> sending <p> dashingscorpio 6 months ago <p> Excellent advice ! <p> However I 'd have to say the following statement is a little dated : <p> " Just like in real life , men like the hunt and chase and you do n't want to come off as too easy or they 'll lose interest quick . " <p> I not sure if men ever " liked to hunt " they were just forced to ! <p> Trust me ask any man if he 'd be flattered to have a beautiful woman initiate a conversation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Dropping someone a casual line or noting something on their profile while wishing the best with their search is n't exactly " throwing yourself " at anyone . It should n't matter ( who ) initiated the conversation . <p> The important thing is a conversation took place ! <p> My guess is women are worried more about what ( other women ) would think of them if they knew they initiated contact with men . <p> Believe it or not women are harder on women then men are . <p> Women never feel equal to men until they stop worrying about what men think of them . Guys do n't care if women call them low life , dogs , or no good a-holes . <p> Another factor that keeps women from initiating contact is fear of rejection . In their mind the person sitting in the chair saying yes or no has the " power " . <p> However if you have to " wait " to be approached by someone you 're interested in you are " powerless " . This also explains why many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> It 's not about who is attracted to you as much as who ( you ) are attracted to ! <p> It 's important to remember online dating sites are nothing more than a ( tool ) for meeting new people . <p> You 're still responsible for having your own screening or mate selection process . Each of us ( chooses ) our own friends , lovers , and spouse . <p> Choose wisely ! <p> dashingscorpio 6 months ago <p> FYI- For any older male readers I 'm told the online dating responses tend to even out on sites geared towards those in their 40s , 50s , and beyond . <p> Apparently the older women become the more confident they are in initiating contact with men they are interested in or attracted to without fearing his thoughts that they may be somehow seen as desperate or " easy " . : )

Forget the intimacy , your shy girlfriend will probably feel very conscious about how she looks naked in the first place . <p> It is very important that you do n't get pushy . Slow down and cherish the togetherness of your relationship . Allow physical intimacy to build up gradually after you kiss her for the first time . The longer you wait , the lesser will be the awkwardness . <p> 9 ) Do n't tell a shy girl that she needs to change <p> Telling a girl that she needs to break out of her shell seems like a logical thing to do but it is n't , especially when she is your girlfriend . You will shatter her confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality . <p> If you make the mistake of labeling her shyness as something she needs to get rid of , she will feel devastated to know that her boyfriend does n't really like the person that she is . <p> Help her get over her shyness by complimenting her heavily when she wears something that really looks pretty . <p> 10 ) Do n't control her wardrobe do but tell her when something looks good on her <p> A girl whose personality is low on confidence and high on shyness will probably stay away from wearing clothes that bring out the oomph factor . <p> She will feel comfortable carrying off skinny jeans and a summery top . However , a cleavage baring v-neck top paired with skinny jeans and sky high stilettos will definitely be out of her comfort zone . But then again , you would n't expect a shy girl to dress like that in the first place . <p> Help your girlfriend bring out the inner beauty by complimenting her heavily when she wears something that looks nice . For example , suppose you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her eyes and tell her exactly why you find her pretty when she wears them . <p> Your compliments will gradually have an impact on her dressing style . She will feel less conscious wearing the clothes that she once did n't feel quite comfortable wearing . <p> 11 ) Take her out on a double date with your friends <p> Help your girlfriend slowly overcome her shyness by introducing her to new people . A nice way to do this is to go on a double date with a couple who are really close friends of yours . Make sure that your friends are n't brash extroverts who will rip into her shyness and make fun of her . <p> Conversations with someone outside her own friend circle will inadvertently force her to step out of her comfort zone . But since the couple are your friends , she will feel much more comfortable hanging out with them as opposed to being around complete strangers . <p> 12 ) Build her confidence by letting her take the lead when you are out on dates <p> Sometimes shyness has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usher your shy girlfriend into meeting new people and having new experiences is to let her take charge of your dates . <p> Right from picking you up to talking with the waiting staff at the restaurant , let her be in charge . Reflecting on her conversations and interactions will help her overcome the barriers of shyness . <p> Hold yourself back when you are having an argument with her . Harsh words can have a damaging effect to her fragile confidence . <p> 13 ) Watch what you say when you have an argument <p> Like all other couples , you and your girlfriend are bound to have your fair share of fights and arguments . But you will have to be extra cautious while handling petty little relationship arguments because your words could shatter your girlfriend 's already low confidence . <p> Stop short of using insults that are too harsh and if you think that an argument is going out of control , walk away . Her shyness and fragile confidence could worsen if you say something that is too demeaning . <p> 14 ) Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Regardless of whether he is single , committed or married , it might be impractical on many levels to ask a man to stop looking at other women . However you must remember to avoid letting your eyes wander at least when you are with your girlfriend . <p> She will probably not point it out to you directly . But she will definitely notice the fact that you stared at another girl . Being shy , this will cause a massive dent in her self-esteem . From traumatizing thoughts about feeling less beautiful to developing insecurities about her own appearance " your silly actions may worsen her shyness and lack of confidence . <p> 15 ) Do n't expect her to become an extrovert <p> It is unfair for you to expect your shy girlfriend to morph into an extrovert diva . That 's like expecting you to go from being just a normal guy to someone who looks , walks and talks like Bradley Cooper . <p> Everyone has a quirky side to their personalities and shyness may be hers . Accept it and move on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have gone beyond the first few dates . <p> Tell her how happy you feel being in a relationship with her . Make every moment a celebration . <p> 16 ) Tell her that being her boyfriend makes you feel happy <p> Nothing more will make your girlfriend feel happier than knowing that her boyfriend feels glad to be in a relationship with her . If you ca n't find the right words , here are a few examples : <p> I think we really make a nice couple <p> Ever since we began dating everything in my life seems right <p> I 'm really glad I asked you out and I feel lucky that you did n't say no for a date <p> Look into her eyes when you say stuff like this so she realizes that you really mean it . Hearing that she is an awesome girlfriend will make her feel more confident . <p> 17 ) Never compare her with another girl <p> Comparing any woman , let alone someone who is shy , to someone else will be the biggest blow to her confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you can ever imagine . <p> Even the most subtle hints of comparisons will make your girlfriend feel inferior to the other woman you are talking about . After all , how would a guy feel if his girlfriend compared his bedroom antics to one of her exes ? <h> Comments 64479 @qwx924479 <p> sending <p> Ed Palumbo 3 years agofrom Tualatin , OR <p> I 'm 67 , and my wife and I have been married for 31 years .

@@96276085 @476085/ <h> Scorpio and Taurus Compatibility : The Clash of Autumn vs . Spring <h> Scorpio + Taurus <p> This is a clash of the titans that can easily attract each other into a pretty blown out romance . Taurus is the center of spring and Scorpio is the center of fall . Automatically , they contradict each other ; however , as complete opposites they also have a lot in common . Both are stubborn , fixed , yin , sensual , proud , divisive , leaders , and magnetic . They both want sensuality , but approach it in completely different ways " sometimes in ways that irritate or negate how the other person perceives the world . Taurus is all about life , it is extremely proud to be the center of spring and allow others to have fruit , flowers , and green leaves . Weather is chaotic in spring , especially Aries , but Taurus also gets its fair share of tornadoes , thunderstorms , rain , wind , and hail . Scorpio , on the other hand , makes way for death . Scorpio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a reason . This is when we realize and accept certain things about the cycle of life . Scorpio is all about authenticity . We come to it wearing masks , and we are implored to show our real selves . This is partly why Scorpio is so sexual ( the most sexual , do n't kid yourself ) they want to really know the truth intimately about people and that comes with taking off the mask . Scorpio takes the mask off all the pretty flowers and pretty trees that spring decorates onto the world . <p> Scorpio looks to see what 's really there as opposed to what is only decor . This is partly why Scorpio and Taurus can be at odds with each other , except they both see themselves as gods . Not kidding . And due to that , they can actually attract to each other in extremes . Gods like being with gods , even if they in actuality are only humans . They are not the dead of winter or the dead of summer ; those are quite different . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know it 's cold in winter . You know it 's hot in summer -- this is common sense . Therefore , Scorpio and Taurus are different as fixed signs . They are slightly more unpredictable and less fixed . They are fixed in their variety . <p> If Taurus and Scorpio get angry with each other , it 'll be a showdown worth watching . The Taurus as the bull will immediately charge into battle , and Scorpio is known for stinging its prey and leaving them behind to deal with the poison that slowly but surely impacts the psyche . <h> Cheat Sheet <p> Scorpio <p> Taurus <p> 8th House <p> 2nd House <p> The scorpion <p> The bull <p> Sexual organs <p> The throat <p> Mid-Fall <p> Mid-Spring <p> Water <p> Earth <p> Emotions <p> Senses , the body <p> Yin <p> Yin <p> Fixed <p> Fixed <p> Reflective , sexual , psyche <p> Sensual , stubborn , strong leader <p> Misunderstood <p> Traditional <h> Understanding Your Personalities <p> This is definitely an opposites attract relationship . This is also an opposites repulse relationship . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You 'll love deeply , and be led to deeply sharpen the other with what you see they lack . You bring in a great deal of variety when you are so different . Again , you could be more different . You can relate to each other in being the centers ' of seasons . The contrasts are noticeable , but yet complimentary . You will struggle for power . You 're both introspective as yin signs . You 'll reflect a lot on what is happening , but your lenses that you use are fairly different . Taurus wants to maintain the garden , maintain sustenance , and also loves tradition and success at accomplishing traditions . Taurus loves the idea of family , a strong work ethic , paying bills on time , and taking charge . Scorpio loves a good mystery , it loves the unusual , aesthetics , an extreme love for success , and has an extreme need for determination . Scorpio wants a significant amount of intimacy , people often mistake and misunderstand the Scorpio for being a one track brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a Scorpio . What Scorpio ultimately wants is a relationship . They are relationship seekers , they also have a lot of lust to work through . So it can be difficult to maintain all that emotion , and in all honesty in this version of our civilization we have n't quite unlocked and unmasked all we need to with emotion . This is partly why Scorpios are so misunderstood and appear secretive . They do like their privacy , but they also like their intimacy . <p> Taurus will admire Scorpio for their sexual prowess . Taurus will be interested in that partly because it goes along with their goal of making sure life unfolds . Taurus again is prideful that it opens the door for the living to exist . Scorpio requires sacrifice . It is depicted as feminine , but I find the energy of Scorpio to often be more masculine because of its high , potent sexuality . But women often must sacrifice their bodies in order for new creatures to come into the world . This is partly how Scorpio wanders about the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give up of life itself in order to have a relationship before even having to sacrifice its body . So Taurus fosters life , Scorpio sacrifices so that life can come . They have incredibly different lenses . It can be like watching someone who is striving to take on the world who has second-child syndrome in the shadow of Aries ... and then watching someone a little after puberty getting oddly experimental . <p> Taurus needs to remember that Scorpio is complicated . Scorpio has more symbols than any of the other signs . Scorpio has the biggest range when it comes to emotions . It starts off as a sniveling , cold-hearted snake . It bites at the ankle , like the serpent in the Garden of Eden . It starts off in this low , despicable kind of state . Scorpio does n't deny any emotions , whether jealously , anger , self-righteousness -- if it denies these emotions and ca n't look itself in the mirror , then it wo n't progress to higher , more fluid emotions like love . But Scorpio is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Scorpio is the scorpion . The scorpion is a little bit more refined , scorpions can actually make love for hours on end , but then they may eat each other or attack each other . They are familial creatures , even though they may harm each other . But the real last stage of Scorpio is the real beast that 's hiding under the mask , whether Scorpio realizes this or not . This makes it difficult for Scorpio because this last stage is hard to harness , it is difficult to master and stay in it -- and that 's because it is the phoenix . The phoenix , as I was saying about sacrifice , lives to love and give entirely of itself to eventually burn out and fizzle and turn back into a snake . It will have to work its way back through lessons to get back to its real self again . It is terrifying for Scorpio to progress emotionally because of the cost and sacrifice this demands . But as a snake , without progressing , the Scorpio will only eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused . And only when the Scorpio is ready will it stop trying to eat itself . When Scorpio allows itself to be relieved of its emotional congestion , then and only then can it be its full self . Otherwise , Scorpio may have mental blocks that prevent it from having healthy relationships , really fully knowing their mind , and knowing one of the most important keys in life -- their potential . <h> In the Garden of Eden <p> Taurus is the gardner , like Adam , while Scorpio is the serpent . Taurus protects the garden , it orders the garden , nourishes it , and keeps it refined . Scorpio offers Taurus sexual initiation , it offers Taurus to eat forbidden fruit , which comes with consequences . You can see why these two would be at odds with each other . Taurus wants to be the good worker , but Scorpio says there is more to life . Scorpio may mislead Taurus , and Taurus may even see these requests as sin , which only offends Scorpio . It does n't mean that Scorpio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- they are just deeply trying to understand the world and find someone who deeply wants to understand it with them . They are need into BS . This kind of mentality can get the Scorpio in trouble . Taurus needs to help the Scorpio see boundaries . Water elements have a tendency to want to do two things : ( 1 ) completely merge with their partner , ( 2 ) flow and have no boundaries . The problem with these two innate qualities is that they can cause the partner to feel like they do n't see their own individual definition anymore . Sometimes when you do n't have boundaries , you stop having responsibilities , practical judgment , or even stop listening to the voice of your partner because you are so lost in the flow , that you ca n't see distinction . These are problems that often follow a Scorpio soul who can feel like their mind is really foggy or muddy . They would be right , because what they are needing from the world is some kind of filter to help them navigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a filter for them . Water running into earth does slow it down . The practicality that is given by Taurus will help a Scorpio to see more clearly in a sense -- though their water nature could just make things muddy . Taurus helps give boundaries and context where Scorpio needs it , and that 's if Scorpio accepts it . Scorpio could turn itself into tsunami or hurricane in order to strike against the earth . Water elements have a really strong desire to flow and go places even when they are told those places are forbidden . Keep in mind , water is the universal solvent . Without water , we would obviously be dead . We can thank our nature for allowing water to flow on this planet , even if sometimes water makes its way into places it does n't belong or need to be . There is a time for water and there is a time for red wine . <p> Taurus needs to take ownership of their own choices . Just like Adam blaming the serpent , yes the serpent tempted Adam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat of the forbidden fruit . He made an offer Adam could n't refuse , but Adam willfully did take of the forbidden fruit . He was n't threatened to do so , he was n't going to die nor any of his family for eating fruit . Taurus needs to be careful about how they blame others and to take responsibility for their own choices and the consequences that follow . Scorpio needs to also own up to when they flirt without considering what doors they are opening . Often Scorpio needs to work on being more picky , decisive , and empathetic and doing those three things altogether in balance . Scorpio can have a tough time balancing all those things . It can be stubborn , but then get a hardened heart because Scorpio feels so much . Then Scorpio can be too soft , and then not stubborn enough . The Scorpio needs to know what it really wants . Taurus is someone who generally knows exactly what they want , and will persevere after it relentlessly . This is why Taurus is the bull . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after its goals , and it can have difficulty realigning its thoughts because it is so focused that it gets tunnel vision . <p> Both of these are stubborn creatures that without 3 very important things could easily pull themselves apart simply because that becomes the easiest choice to make . What these two need to focus on in their relationship is : positivity , generosity , and kindness . With those three elements well disciplined , really at the core of the mind , and the center of the relationship -- those keys are what will make the relationship flourish . Without those ingredients , the two of you may turn into beasts ready to impale each other at a Colosseum . <p> All you need is : positivity , generosity , and kindness . <h> Tips for the Relationship <p> 1 . Scorpio and Taurus must keep in mind that they have different perspectives . Consider all the zodiacs in a circle -- if Taurus is looking to Aquarius , it looks to the right . When Scorpio looks to Aquarius , they look to the left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left . When Scorpio looks to Leo , it looks to the right . Do you see how they 're going to have different perspectives looking at the seasons , the natural things life has to offer ? This is important to keep in mind -- because for Taurus it sees Aquarius through Aries and Pisces ... Scorpio sees Aquarius through Sagittarius and Capricorn . <p> 2 . Spend time getting to know each other in a variety of ways . Do n't be too butthurt if your ego gets hurt . Both of you need to just breathe and be okay with what is happening . <p> 3 . Do n't give into impulsive temper tantrums . You do n't make your best decisions when you are in the heat of the battle . Try to find how you can be calm , cool , and collected . <p> 4 . Make sure to plant your feet on solid ground . You need a good foundation , do n't just make this a sexual or sensual relationship . This is elusive , connections do change -- so work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you relate . <p> 5 . Neither of you are fans of jealously . Do not make the Taurus jealous . Do not make the Scorpio jealous . Also , communicate and know that for your partner a friend is only a friend . Scorpio , do n't start hanging out with someone else and developing feelings when you need to focus on your partner and the present . So stay away from lingering exes , those tend to get you into trouble . <p> 6 . You are a couple that fights , so you need to learn how to fight fair . You should not be having yelling matches or hurting each other physically . Invest in a counselor who can give your relationships tools to better yourselves into the future . <p> 7 . Do not flaunt your ego and fish for compliments . You can do just fine by hanging out and getting to know each other in person and in proximity . <p> 8 . Yes , the both of you have strong egos . You also wo n't take compliments that are inauthentic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a genuine place . <p> 9 . Do n't act like your sexuality is a bigger deal than your partners . Do not demand sex just because you feel entitled to it . You need to get consent , be patient , and do n't go for revenge sex with an outside partner ... that last thing is more for Scorpio . <p> 10 . Hold hands , hug , kiss , and affirm each other . <h> The Queen Kidnapped by the King <p> Taurus and Scorpio are the life bearers . Without their very distinct roles in the cycle of life , we would dissipate into numbness , nihilism , and the nevermore . They are crucial points in the year where we all gain definition . Taurus is the time of year when the flowers are in full bloom after a long winter . Scorpio is when the leaves change , when life goes back to the planet to hibernate . When Hades took Persephone he hid her during the time of Scorpio till spring . Homer describes her as the formidable , venerable majestic princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men upon the souls of the dead . With her return , comes life , vegetation , and fertility . We have this cycle and dance with Persephone and Hades . <p> In the myth , Hades abducts Persephone to be his wife and the queen of his realm . In Roman , the counterpart of Hades , Pluto , the name Pluton meant a god of wealth , because mineral wealth was found underground , and because Pluto as a chthonic god ruled the deep earth that contained the seeds necessary for a bountiful harvest . The Greek version of the abduction myth is related to grain " important and rare in the Greek environment " and the return ( ascent ) of Persephone was celebrated at the autumn sowing . <p> Do you see how the relationship of Scorpio and Taurus can definitely be found in literature ? You have a relationship rich in the celebrations , festivals , and nuances of spring and autumn . If you landed yourself in this relationship , open yourself up to the full extent of how powerful , crazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both life and sacrifice . 
@@96276086 @476086/ <h> Different Forms of Adultery <h> Emotional Adultery and Its Consequences <p> At what point does a person commit adultery ? It is really easy to think of adultery in terms of black and white . If you are in a relationship and you kiss someone else , then it is adultery . Or is n't it ? Do you have to sleep with someone else for adultery to happen ? Can you have an adulterous relationship with someone , yet never sleep with them ? <p> Well many people believe that this is indeed the case . Although men and women can be friends and not be in a relationship that is in any way wrong , it can also happen that men and women can become emotionally dependent on each other , emotionally string and yet never actually go as far as even kissing . So they can protest to their loved ones , or their friends that they are n't doing anything wrong , because , after all , they are just friends with the person of the opposite sex . They are n't hurting anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship any hurt . No problem , right ? <p> Or can it be a problem ? Are you cheating on your lover without even realising that you are doing it ? Are you telling a 3rd party all your dreams , your fears , your thoughts and not trelling your partner or spouse ? If so then are n't you guilty of emotional adultery ? Are you not in severe danger of putting your relationship at risk ? <h> Are there Different Types of Betrayal ? <p> It is true that sometimes you can sleep with someone and go through the physical act of lovemaking , but have no emotional attachment to that person : but on the other hand you can just be friends with someone , without sleeping with them , but find that you are betraying your lover , through being emotionally attached to your friend . <p> So which is worse , emotional betrayal or physical betrayal ? Well , there is no hard and fast answer , since it depends on the individuals involved and the nature of all the different relationships . Ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then there is no reason to object to adulterous relationships , whether physically adulterous or simply emotionally too close for comfort . However , whichever is happening , the end result can be that people can get hurt and that is what makes them so difficult . But at times it can also be hard to move away from the emotional bond that you have formed with another person . If you do manage to form a bond with someone else then this can actually highlight inadequacies in your main relationships , which at times can be quite unsettling . <p> If you care about your relationship , then basically be very aware of just how close you get to someone else when you are in a relationship and do not feel as if you can get away with extremely close friendships so long as you do n't get physical : your betrayal may be as intense , even if you never even touched lips or hands . <h> What Happens When Good Intentions Fail ? <p> There are times when we can feel drawn to someone like a moth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have found someone to whom we are not attracted , who does n't light our fire of desire , but to whom we can just talk . So we like to have a cosy lunch , we like to share secrets , we talk about things that have gone right and perhaps share things that not many people know about us . <p> But what happens then when you have a bad day at the office . You come home and you tell your other half . They are pretty sympathetic and they can see why you are so upset . But that is n't enough for you any more . You need the other person , you need the person with whom you are in an emotionally adulterous relationship . So all you can think about is phoning them or talking to them . <p> And what happens ? Well your other half , your spouse or partner has to sit there listening to you confiding in someone else . So they are no longer all that you need , basically you have introduced another person into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional support that you need . so where there were two , now there are three ..... <h> Can An Emotional Menage a Trois Actually Work ? <p> Well despite all the negative arguments that can be put forward about how risky and how much of a betrayal emotional adultery can be , there are some positive aspects to it . For a start in can breathe new life into jaded relationships . Where you have felt slightly flat , slightly staid in terms of how much support you give each other and how you feel about each other , you may find that with an interest in someone else and someone else being interested in you , you have more emotional energy to devote to your relationship and so you become more relaxed about your emotional health . It is almost like having therapy . Indeed many people in therapy say that it does indeed feel as if they are often betraying their partners , because they are actually talking about their emotional secrets with someone else : so where is the difference if that person is a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a potential spouse or partner ) ? <p> Ultimately only you will know whether your relationship with someone else is verging on being adulterous , even if you never touch , never kiss and never even have the faintest notion of physical intimacy : but if you are concerned about the nature of a relationship , then do not ignore any warning signs . If it starts to feel like betrayal , then it probably is something of a betrayal and you need to be aware of the risks associated with this , even if it seems perfectly innocent and above board . So above all , to thine own self be very , very true ...... <p> People do view things very differently and what is perfectly acceptable to one person may seem like the ultimate betrayal to another . And let us not forget that many people may not actually be emotionally unfaithful to their partner or their spouse , but instead , they may choose to spend every night eating cream cakes , drinking far , far too much , or smoking themselves to death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another person that you can ' sound off to ' rather than spending the time clogging your arteries or making yourself i 'll through drinking . <p> Ultimately few relationships are actually perfect . None of us actually know what happens behind closed doors : relationships can seem perfect , but when you scratch beneath the surface , they all have the same cracks , tears and splits that the rest of relationships have , so do n't despair , just do whatever feels right for you , bearing in mind how your partner will view your friendship .... <h> Comments 64479 @qwx924479 <p> sending <p> trusouldj 6 years agofrom Indiana <p> It 's tough being in a relationship when you do n't feel appreciated , but otherwise I still agree with you . <p> ktdyd 5 years agofrom Upstate New York <p> There 's nothing wrong with having an emotional attachment to a friend of the opposite sex . If there is no physical or sexual contact , then it is not adulterous . We have different connections with different people , for different reasons . I have many friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confide in , but my husband is aware of them &amp; they are no threat to my relationship . The threat starts when the friendship becomes a higher priority than the relationship or you keep certain aspects of the friendship a secret from your partner . If you 're open and honest with your partner about the nature of the friendship , it is not betrayal . If you feel the need to hide parts of it , and keep secrets , then either it is a blatant betrayal or your partner is likely to view it as such , even if it 's harmless ... which would mean they are n't the person for you anyway . <p> If there is a romantic attachment to someone else , and you exercise self control and do not act on it , ... that is the epitome of faithful . We can not always control emotions , but we can control whether we act on them or not .

Halfhearted efforts are not allowed . <p> 11 ) Alpha males know how to say no : Do n't be too nice to every one <p> Why do people give in to do things that they hate doing ?

Nor are they likely to giggle like a child when they crack a joke . <p> Alpha males combine their sense of humor and their ability to deliver a punch when they talk to use humor in challenging situations . <p> Putting this into perspective , be confident as you attempt to say something funny . Do n't give away your intentions with a grin or a smile . Disconnect your body language from the joke while you utter it and do n't look at everyone expecting a comical reaction . Act nonchalant and continue doing whatever you are doing as you say it . <p> 18 ) Alpha males are strong : Exercise your way to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unhealthy nor do you expect him to be unfit . Not everyone can have a body like Brad Pitt in Troy but the key to pulling off the physical aspect of becoming an alpha male is to be fit . <p> Find the motivation to build your body by working out .

No matter what you do or the circumstances of your divorce does it feel like the word FAILURE is emblazoned in your mind like a tattoo ? And the crazy thing is - it seems everyone can see it ! You feel doomed to the fate of a woman whose life is ruined by a failed marriage . <p> Just like me , you 've probably walked into a room of women , who you thought were your friends , and suddenly that tattoo begins flashing like a neon sign . No one knows what to say , and everyone is so pathetic with their " well wishes . " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just wanted to run home and hide . I was so uncomfortable . <p> But the TRUTH is that I was uncomfortable because I FELT LIKE A FAILURE . And the feelings were so transparent that this belief created the " I 'm a failure " energy I carried around with me . Everyone I came into contact with felt it . I was a failure because I believed I was . <p> I created the failure tattoo and only I could remove it . <p> I made a choice to feel like a failure . What other options were available to me ? <p> I could choose to feel " free at last " ... I could choose to feel " excited about the possibility of a whole new life " ... I could choose to feel " sexy and lovable just the way I am " ... <p> Let 's be honest here : <p> Who you are and what you think about yourself are in your control . So if you refuse to allow the failure thought to show up - what other thoughts would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I know this might blow your excuse for hiding out and licking your wounds , but I 've known lots of women who have gone through a divorce and are now happier and healthier than they ever dreamed possible . <p> How long are you going to use the FAILURE excuse to stay miserable ? The FAILURE excuse is not serving you or helping you move on with your life . In fact , it 's the one thing that 's holding your back . <p> All you have to do is accept this simple fact : your MARRIAGE failed , not you . That 's it . That does not mean that YOU are a failure . ( You make that choice . ) <h> Mistake #2 : Not Feeling Your Feelings <p> I know , I know . You feel miserable . And who wants to feel like that all the time ? If you can buy some happy pills and feel better , then it 's worth it . <p> Or if you can just get through the day , then you can get home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... or more . <p> How can it be bad if it gets you through the day ... <p> I 'm being completely honest here , I could go through a WHOLE BOTTLE OF WINE EVERY NIGHT . And if I timed it just right , I could sleep until 5:30 or 6:30 a.m. without waking up . But after a few months of this I still felt miserable , and the only thing that really changed was that my wine got cheaper and left me with worse hangovers . <p> Whether you use an anti-depressant , sleeping pills , alcohol or wine , the end result is you numb out the one thing that can set you on the road to healing yourself . <p> You ca n't heal what you ca n't feel . Doubt me ? Just ask any happily divorced woman if her healing came as a result of drugs or alcohol ? <p> To go inside and be with your pain requires being with your " naked " self . The part of you that is not numb , the part of you that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were before you got married when you were full of hope and possibility and joy . <p> To get back to who you were , you have to release your desire to be numb . You must be willing to feel sad . Give your miserable self a chance to speak up . And listen to the wisdom of your miserable self . Your miserable self will become your inner teacher . <p> Your power to heal lies in your vulnerability and your willingness to be with the pain . <h> Mistake #3 : Seeking Revenge <p> Divorce is one life event where you may come face to face with your diabolical , evil self . Your fear and struggle are so big that you get stuck in your endless stream of self talk : <p> " How could he do what he did ? " <p> " Somehow , someway , I 'll get even . " <p> " How could I be so stupid ? " <p> " How can I make it on my own ?

From cleaning the toilet with his toothbrush to flicking ashes in his coffee , to using super glue to attach his " unfaithful organ " to his leg . ( This last one required surgery to fix ! ) <p> There is only one way out of this crazy mess : letting go . The sweetest revenge you will ever have is to get through the divorce quickly and move onto a happy life . It is impossible to move on if you stay stuck in blame and anger . <p> Blaming someone or something will hold you in the misery of a broken marriage forever . Let go of him and the life you once had . Whatever it takes . Your relationship with YOU holds the magic key to your new life . <h> Mistake #4 : Being Alone is Not Being Lonely <p> I 've talked to hundreds of divorced women and their biggest heartache is that feeling of emptiness . It 's more than being alone . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner , after years of marriage . <p> You feel totally and utterly alone . But you 're not . <p> You still are with yourself . And you are the only person who will be there for you no matter what . Before the marriage , during the marriage , and after the divorce . The quality of your life is completely dependent on the quality of your relationship with you . <p> Have you taken a look at yourself lately ? <p> I know that right after my divorce , I was completely avoiding myself . I had 20 extra pounds that I 'd carried around for the last 15 years . I hated my shape . The clothes I liked did n't fit anymore . I spent no time meditating or going inside just to be still and present to my highest self . <p> It never occurred to me that someone I once loved was right here inside of me . So I consciously made a dramatic change in being with myself . I got up early in the morning before everyone else and sat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 30 minutes I gave myself was an unbelievable gift . It gave me the space to turn off the noisy dialog in my head and just be present with me . <p> The practice of finding time to be with yourself is your spiritual wake-up call . You get an opportunity to rediscover who you are and create the life you want . <h> Mistake #5 : Toughing It Out <p> " You can get through this . If you can get through each day , then you 're bound to start feeling better . " Or at least that 's what you tell yourself . <p> If you are anything like me , you may be isolating yourself , reading or listening to personal growth books . I just kept hoping those positive feelings would stick , but they never did . By refusing to get some kind of help , you prolong your misery , and you do n't get the support you need . <p> I really needed to move on . I wanted to get out of the quicksand of misery and feel capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of help that I eventually found was a coach . I was done with therapists because I just did n't want to talk about it anymore . What I wanted were action steps and accountability . <p> Only you can decide what kind of help is best for you , but getting help is important . You need someone else to help wake you up . <p> Not only did I get a chance to wake up for 60 to 90 minutes a week , but I got to check in on the drama of my situation . I got to figure out the parts of my story that were fact and the parts that were fiction . <p> Thoughts can create so much doubt and worry that fiction becomes fact and we get trapped into believing stuff that 's not even true . <h> Mistake #6 : Dwelling on What You Should Have Done : <p> Have you noticed how often you think about your present circumstance ? How much time do you spend thinking about what you could , would , or should , have said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are anything like me . It 's the endless loop of fear , regret , and heartache . I was continually playing this bad movie over and over in my mind , rewriting the dialog slightly each time . <p> But playing the movie was nothing like the pity party I organized and attended day after day . This was a hard pill for me to swallow . <p> Yes . It 's hard to accept , but you have to . <p> Until you choose to accept your life exactly as it is , you are going to bake your misery recipe every day . If it 's revenge you want , then choose to become the happiest woman on the planet . Not only will you show him , but you 'll show you . Being happy is a lot sweeter than all those spiteful dialogs you run in your head . <p> Control what you say to yourself and you control your life . <h> Mistake #7 : Needing to Be Right <p> When you 're attached to being right , you are living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You get a psychic payoff by making him wrong . And you also get to relive some drama where you swore you would never be wrong again . If you remain unwilling to see your marriage differently , you give your power to him . Your rigid righteousness enables him to control your emotions and your joy . <p> Is that what you really want ? To be forever controlled by your ex-husband ? <p> That 's the bittersweet reality of righteousness in a relationship . As long as you hold on to being right , you will also limit your access to all of your positive emotions . <p> That was my giant ah-ha ! moment . <p> I was so frustrated because happy things would happen to me , but I would n't feel them like everyone else . It was shallow and temporary . Holding on to my righteousness just did n't allow happiness and joy to reach my soul . <p> When you are willing to own the part you played in your failed marriage , you take your power back . <h> Mistake #8 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you divide the spoils of your life together and move forward to your separate life , let go of as much stuff as you can . Especially the bed . <p> Stuff has energy and emotional connections to you and your heart . And it is liberating to release those connections as soon as you possibly can . <p> I know , I know . Some of the things you have acquired represent a significant investment , both financial and emotional . This process of releasing stuff is often the most difficult . <p> Start with the bed . <p> With feelings of anger , blame , resentment and failure entangled in a divorce , the bed becomes a symbol of your heartache that is easy to release . <p> If you are like me , I hold on to everything . Not only am I a pack rat , but I hold on to clothes , shoes , papers , dishes , with a stubbornness that is stronger than the muscle man grip on the Strongest Man in the World competition . <p> But , when it came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . I would have called Salvation Army to come pick it up , but my ex took it and I was free of that significant connection to him . <p> The bed was easy . <p> For months , I slept on a small trundle bed that I moved from the guest room before I moved forward on a bed of my own . But it was easy to let go and get it out of my life . <p> My letting-go stopped there for a long time . When I finally began to let go of more , I began with my closet . <p> I worked with a closet organizer . I would call her a closet therapist rather than an organizer and the process of cleaning and clearing my closet was so frightening . I was stressed out for days before she came . <p> I got rid of 70% of the clothes and shoes in my closet . 70% ! This was so incredibly liberating . And the momentum to get rid of stuff was initiated at last . <p> I suddenly had room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , you get in touch with who you are underneath all the stuff . And that woman is the woman who will help you move forward to a meaningful life . <h> Mistake #9 : Dating the Same Man Again <p> Yes . That 's what happens . <p> He has a different body and a different name . But if you spend any time with him , his " dating " mask will fall away , and you will discover you are in a relationship with the same man you just divorced ! <p> How does this happen ? It 's a phenomenon of human nature . <p> Until and unless you change , you will attract to you the same life lessons packaged up in new lovers , new friends or new business partners . <p> You have , no doubt , been cautioned about getting into a relationship on the rebound . The reason that advice is so profound is that you have not invested time in doing your spiritual work . You must face the lesson your marriage brought to you . <p> Until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man like your ex , you will continue to do so over and over . <p> It is our soul 's calling to evolve and come to the altar with ourselves . The relationship you create with yourself and your truth is what determines your magnetic attraction . <p> If you are anything like me , you are finished with guys like your ex ! I wanted something completely different this next time around . To do that , you must take the time you need to have a quality relationship with yourself first . <h> Mistake #10 : Making Choices So the Kids Like You <p> Kids go through periods where they dislike you . And divorce can be one of those times.Your children will learn to live and grow in a broken home . And it 's up to you to shape what that means for them . <p> If they look at their family life as ruined , chances are that 's how you look at it . Your fear and apprehension create the reality in your home . <p> Your children can live and grow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . When you live your life in accordance with your truth and when you speak your truth openly , that 's what your children learn . <p> They learn the value of integrity and acceptance , not the misery of blame and fear . <p> If they grow up in a family where the love between the parents is sketchy , resentful , or manipulative , they take that into their relationships . <p> Make it your first objective to speak YOUR truth to your children . Whether you are disciplining them or rewarding them . Stay true to yourself and you will have children who understand how to communicate and how to give voice to their feelings . <p> Almost one year after the day my ex- moved out , I made an accidental discovery that changed everything for me . <p> There were a lot of sleepless nights , numbed-out weekends , and trying all kinds of support and self-help programs , some that are even embarrassing to admit , but I finally figured it all out . I found a deep , spiritual process that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I could have ever imagined . I have more energy and enthusiasm for everything I do and everyone I meet . I have better health and physical fitness than when I was in my twenties . And my kids accept me for who I am because they see I am someone besides their Mom or a business woman . <p> I get comments all the time from people who ca n't believe my age . I really look ( and feel ) 10 years younger than my birth date would report . <p> It has been a rewarding experience . I no longer live with that sad , insecure , guilty feeling of being such a failure . I have the life and health that makes me feel good about myself . And there is no way that I will ever attract a man like my ex into my life again . <p> It is truly a blessing to share what I have learned with so many women who are treading water with no direction or land in sight . <p> Wow , I needed this today ! Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 years ago <p> empowering thx <p> guest 4 5 years ago <p> this was definitely nice to read ... Even though it has been 4 years , I do n't think I have healed . Still traumatized , with trust issues . I found mistake 4 most profound to me . Getting over the empty feeling and just being a happy person with the one who is always with me ... myself = ) <p> thank you for posting this . <p> melssy101 5 years ago <p> I have been married for almost 14 years and the last couple of years have been awful .... I have been with him since I was 16 and I will be 30 in a month . Also he is 11 years older then me so we just are at 2 different stages in our lives and we do n't  even interact as couple anymore .... The kids are miserable Im depressed all the time and he is always angry ! I stayed so long in this dysfunctional for my kids sake . For the past couple of days , especially today I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and that he will never love me the way he once did ... It literally breaks my heart that I have been with him so long , depended on him for everything , raised our 3 kids and know I 'm going to be alone ! ! ! I 'm so scared I do n't  know what to do with myself because I feel I have no energy to start a new life for myself ! But reading your story really inspired me and lit a fire under me letting me know there is hope : - ) I 'm now excited to actually focus on the inner me and move forward to be happy again ! I know its going to take time and I will take it one day at a time . I want to prove to myself that I am a survivor , wonderful , strong women and to my kids that they have a awesome mom ! Thanks again for your story it has truly mad my day ! <p> Jellybean 5 years ago <p> Everything you share about surviving divorce is so true . My ex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first grandchild was born . It 's over four yrs since he decided to start again . I 'm more <p> than four yrs happier and healthier . One more mistake that women make is to assume they have to hook up with someone ' special ' again at all . There 's a lot of social pressure about that that divorced women should resist . We do n't need to live with anyone to validate our existence . We existed when we were born , we were someone then , before we ' hooked ' with anyone else . Post-divorce we are still someone , we do n't have to get stuck with anyone in particular ever again . Relationships are over-rated , but friendships can truly heal us and help us become our authentic selves again . <p> Dora Isaac Weithers 5 years agofrom The Caribbean <p> Glad I found this article .

THANKS .. <p> jane 3 years ago <p> How i got my husband back ... <p> My name is Jane . I live in Canada , and i got married four months ago . My husband and I have been living a very happy and lovely life . So as time went on , I began to notice this strange attitude that my husband was possessing . He was now going out with other girls , to the extent that he was no longer picking up my calls , and he was not even sleeping in the house anymore . I became confused and did n't know what to do . So i became worried and stranded , that brought so many thoughts into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this before in my life . <p> So I decided to visit a spell caster , to see if he can help me out . So immediately I went to the internet , where I saw an amazing testimony of a spell caster who brought someone 's ex lover back , so I contacted him immediately and I explained to him all my problems and he told me that it will be very easy for him to solve , compare to the ones that he has done before . And he also gave me some proof to be really sure of his work , and he assured me that my husband will come back to me immediately he is through with the spell . And also he told me to put all my trust in him , and I really obeyed him . So it was 8:00 am on the next morning , when I was about going to work , when i received my husband 's call , and he told me that he was coming back home , and he apologized to me , and told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has cost me . And after some hours later , he really came back home , and that was how we continued our marriage with lots of love and happiness , and our love was now stronger than how it were before . <p> then , he also told me that once my heart desire has been granted unto me that i should go and testify of his work right here on the internet . Right now I am the happiest woman on earth today as I am writing this testimony , and I want to really thank DR AZIM for bringing back my husband , and for bringing joy and love to my family.He can also cast other spells like , <p> spells for money <p> spells for getting jobs <p> cure for HIV aids <p> and many other spells <p> CONTACT HIM NOW ON THIS EMAIL <p> **31;700;TOOLONG <p> mary 3 years ago <p> Hello , <p> I am mrs mary morgan from FINLAND , i want to share a testimony of my life to every one . i was married to my husband george morgan , i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years now with two kids . when he went for a vacation to france he meant a lady called clara , he told me that he is no longer interested in the marriage any more . i was so confuse and seeking for help , i do n't know what to do until I met my friend miss florida and told her about my problem . she told me not to worry about it that she had a similar problem before and introduce me to a man called dromoba who cast a spell on her ex and bring him back to her after 3days .

Divorce is nothing but a selfish act that destroys families . Blended families , single family homes do nothing but teach our youth the pain . Why is it now 8 out of 10 kids do n't live with both their natural parents ? ? ? Because people like you sit there and say divorce is good , go live you own life . Sorry but marriage is for life and going to " find yourself " leads to nothing but hurt for the kids . But according to you they will just need to learn to live with it . Good luck with that . Tired of people like you saying this stuff .

" and <p> that was correct tooo . <p> so i decided to give it a shot . he told me he could n't guarantee anything and that it would <p> take a while , but after everything he told me in the reading i felt , i just had to give it a shot . <p> he was so on point , so direct , he used phrases that my wife had used when we seperated , he <p> named her by name , he told me what was going on . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I felt a bit stupid , that i had paid tons of people who were not even half as good as hector to <p> help me. i felt like if only i had met him before ( i am glad he finally put up this site , because i <p> told him he was n't easy at all to find . i found him almost by accident ) <p> to make a long story short , that was almost 10 months ago when i had that first reading . <p> since then i have completed most of the process and during that process , at first i started to <p> feel better , then as time went on , my life started going back on track . things started to go my <p> way again . then after about my third step in the process , my wife called me sobbing . she had <p> broken up with the other man . little by little , with hectors help , we got closer and closer . we <p> were able to rebuild our friendship , a little step at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are taking it slow this time . not everything is great all the time <p> yet , but overall we are doing very good . we are already talking about me moving back in . <p> so if you are reading this , and you need help , and you are like me and you went everywhere <p> and do n't  know whether or not it is worth it , i 'm telling you it definitely is . DRORRIWO work is <p> really worth its weight in gold and DRORRIWO is an awesome man , a very gifted man and i <p> feel really blessed that he shares this gift with me and helps me and other people with it . he <p> made me a believer again , not only in magic , but in love and in people . i will always work <p> with DRORRIWO and only DRORRIWO as he is the only one i trust , because his work is <p> awesome and he does a great service to people with it . and his staff is a pleasure to work <p> with tooo . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your website to help other people <p> EMAIL ADRESS DRORRIWO@GMAIL.COM ....

It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unfaithful to me.I did n't know what was going on at first but as she got deep in the affair with her new lover , i felt that our marriage was on the rocks.I notice that she no longer light up <p> when i touch her or kiss her in her neck and her chest cos she really liked it when i did that , she also usually get naked in front of me but when she started seeing that guy she stopped it . I remember asking her if i have done anything that makes her feel irritated when i am around her then she gives silly excuses that she has been feeling stressed up and that she need space for <p> a while.I know when you are been asked for space its usually because there is something fishy is going on.I hired a private investigator to help find out what was going on . And in a week time he brought me prove that my wife that i have lived with for seven straight year is cheating on me with her high school lover . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and many other photo of them kissing in public like she will <p> never be caught by someone that knows she is my wife . I asked myself , even when we had a daughter together she could this to <p> me . That same night i showed her the pictures that i got from my private investigator . She did n't look at it before saying , that she is seeing someone and she know that i just found out about it . Then she said that she is in love with him .

He did n't ask me to pay for what he did for me all i was to do , was to provide the materials for the spell and believe that he had the power to help me . Like he said , he was going to do something that will make her reset her love and affection for me just as it has always been .

I use to read about people who calm to that he helped them make the man of their dreams fall in love with them and how a man who had no feelings for them now care about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimonies to actually contact the Mutton Osun for help and the stars being my witness everything i read about him was just and only true . I after came out of a bad relationship/marriage thank god , i told myself i was never going to let love take me all the way again i was only interested in the sex and fun of a relationship but love was what i never let happen . But this , what i was doing , it did not last because even if we tell ourselves no men in our lives one comes and break all our rules that we led down by ourselves . It 's in the DNA of a woman we must fall a that man or woman whether straight or gay . It happened to me i am writing from experience . I moved to a new neighborhood wanting to be away form the kind of i life i lived and the kind i was living . I wanted something new and exciting but never wanted love but then again it found me . I was attracted to neighbor just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started morning jogging just so he notice me . Firstly it was an attraction but then it grew even when i tried denying it , it grew . He was all i thought of in the shower , kitchen each time i see something or hear something romantic my first thought is him . My friend finally made me ask him out which was one of the stupidest thing i have ever done . It paid of though we talk laughed and that day i felt happy after a very long time because he understood me liked we where sync together . The thing is that as kind and sweet as he was to me he was the unfaithful type . I got him to date me and i was love with him as the day i first saw him but he was always in the company of another woman . An i was again facing a similar dilemma only this time their was not violence and all . I tried just like we women try to keep our man happy still he goes out and do things he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrated and at that time i decided to give spell cast a try work or not i was to loss nothing . I contact Mutton Osun with the email address i saw on the Internet . He gave me list of materials i was to prove for the process which i did i guess i was lucky because in some of the testimonies i read they were not able to find the materials he ask for . Note please Mutton Osun did not charge me for anything . I sent the materials to him via courier and just as he received it , after 48 hours he completed the spell and sent me a package via courier also that i paid for long side instruction on how to use the content . It being six months and my love leaves just for me now that his bad attitude are all gone . Its really had to explain what i experienced but Mutton Osun spell worked miracles for me you will under understand when he helps you .

I have to recommend a book I recently finished called , " The Accidental Divorcee " by Laura Scott ( http : **28;7886;TOOLONG ) . It is a highly personal and helpful read that covers every aspect of what you 're feeling , what to expect legally , emotionally , mentally , etc . She also shares relatable stories from other divorcees and how they healed . It is also a quick read so it does n't  feel like you 're reading a never ending text book ! Good luck to all who are going through this . It gets easier I promise . <p> Tommy 4 months ago <p> If women are so happy after divorcing their husband and they love themselves .

@@96276090 @476090/ <h> Why Sex Decreases After Marriage and How to Increase It <p> Not all couples experience an exponential drop in their sex lives post marriage- or so I hear . I 'm still waiting to meet the couples that continue vigorous and enjoyable sex lives consistently throughout their marriage- affairs do n't count ! <p> For the partner that feels betrayed and the one who feels underwhelmed about the loss of sexual encounters within their marriage , it really is normal , not great , but normal . Ups and downs are part of life , especially your sex life . Sex is a symptom , not the main issue- rarely do couples report all aspects of their marriage being great with the only exception being sex . <p> Women can be known to put sex on the back burner , but usually because we have all burners going at once , typically thinking about 20 things simultaneously and sex gets shuffled around in the mix . Kids get sick , work priorities come up again , an argument with your spouse and before you know it , sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe it leaped off the list altogether . Men can be guilty of pushing sex aside too . Some people even think marriage itself is the culprit for the lack of sex . If you are puzzled by what decreases the sex life between couples , here 's a few hints and a few helpful tips . <p> Keep in mind that a decent sex life takes work , there is no quick fix . Just like having good health and a good body takes effort in the way of proper diet and exercise . <h> Children- Duh ! Especially Babies <p> Children have a huge impact on a couple 's sex life . I remember a repetitive conversation/argument my husband and I had during the many ensuing months after our daughter was born . Our dialogue would go as follows : <p> Husband : " So am I going to get some ( sex ) tonight " ? <p> Wife/Me : " Well if that line alone does n't get me in the sack , what will ( heavy sarcasm ) ? Certainly not a massage , foot rub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep ... " <p> Husband : " OK , I get the point " . <p> Wife/Me : " I ca n't believe you have time to think about sex when all I can think about is the luxury of taking a shower or eating lunch one of these days . " <p> The wife is left feeling resentful and the man feels inadequate because he is n't getting a fair slice of the precious time his wife spends on the baby . Men and women change after having a baby , therefore the relationship changes , and all too often the man wants the woman to resume her pre-baby self far too soon.Realistically , and obviously , women take longer than men to resume their pre-baby self . The problem arises when the man expects too much too soon . The woman is taking care of a new being and someone ( husband/partner ) should be taking care of her or at least helping her take care of herself . <p> While men feel the pressure of fatherhood , a woman is going through much more , physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and men need to be patient because , believe it not , the woman usually puts herself and her needs further down on the list than the needs of her partner . So if you 're feeling neglected , think how she must feel . <p> Another secret I 'll let the men/fathers in on ; Make it easy for your wife to be with you . Do n't be another stressor or remind her how long it 's been since you 've had sex . Insist that your wife has time for herself sans baby or children . Take it upon yourself to schedule the babysitter . Women get consumed , even obsessive , with their role as a mother and if she does n't get to be by herself for decent periods of time , she will forget the ( pre-children ) woman inside her- leaving that identity for the role of supermom . Insist on her getting time for herself and time with you , without the kids . <p> Women have a bottomless reserve of giving , and giving , for their children- it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired and simply be done with his day . But a woman will keep on giving to her children , past the point of exhaustion . She may not have anything left , but somehow if her children need more or are sick , she digs deep down in her bottomless reserve and gives more . Problems can occur when the husband wonders why she ca n't find it within her to give more ( ie. sex ) to him- why will she not go above and beyond for his needs ? That 's not a fair question for men to ask . No competition- sorry guys . <p> If husbands are expecting their wives to easily shut off their mother role once the kids are asleep , he 'll be dissappointed . Give her time , on a weekend or during the day sometime , to shut off the mother role- when she is not exhausted already . And do n't expect to get sex the first week or so of giving her more outings by herself- be patient and show her this is genuinely time she deserves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sexual favors sometime down the road , you should still be sincere about helping her detach from the kids a little . <p> Encourage each other to have a life and hobbies outside of the kids . If the kids are your life , your sex life will suffer- of course when you 're done procreating/adding to your family , that is . <h> Where 's the Person I Married ? <p> Are n't we all guilty of accusing our spouses for changing after we marry them ? Sometimes it seems they change so much , we lose some of the initial attraction we felt for them . Or maybe we changed so much that our attractions varied as well . Somewhere during the dating process we were attracted to the other person and no matter what advice follows this , it really is necessary to date your spouse and have hobbies aside from each other to discuss when you 're out on a " date " . <p> The way a woman views her man is crucial to her sexual feelings toward him . A woman feels most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supportive man- even if a woman is strong and independent , she still wants to know her man represents a safe place to fall . <p> Women have an ideal in their head , from the time they were little girls , about the man they will marry . While it 's important for women to give up their man in the fairytale , it 's also important for men to know what makes their wife attracted to them most and up their game , so to speak , in that category . If she is attracted to your child-like boyishness , find places to go where you can play . <p> It 's complicated in the way that love is unconditional , but realistically , attraction is conditional . We ca n't give up or let ourselves go o sit around watching TV , and expect our spouses to be attracted to us . There is nothing in the marriage vows about being eternally attracted to your spouse- sad but true . The good news is your spouse was probably attracted to you for several reasons initially so maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your spouse dazzled by you . <p> Men seem to complain a lot about their wife 's body changing after marriage , usually gaining weight . If you pressure her or concentrate on this aspect too much , then she will withdraw further away from the bedroom , and consequently your chances of sex diminish . Women are very mental/psychological creatures , especially concerning sex . They realize when they 've gained weight and it effects them mentally . The best thing to do is be an example- stop eating junk around her or focusing activities around eating . Women want to feel close to their husbands so they will partake in activities or even bad habits , like late-night snacking- just to spend time with you . If she gets her connection by eating with you , then she wo n't need to engage in other connections , such as sex . <h> Competition of Needs <p> " Couples think , If I 'm not getting what what I want then you do n't matter " ... Tony Robbins , motivational speaker , stated this about his work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate for the other person 's sake and give up the competition , while working on becoming a team . <p> There may come a time when your partner says I want less sex or more sex . You would like to acknowledge your partner 's needs , but they are n't compatible with your needs or maybe you feel like you ca n't give more sex unless you get some of your other , non-sexual needs met . <p> Typically , one person in the relationship has emotional , spiritual , and psychological needs that must be met before they welcome the idea of sex . If those needs are not met , sex decreases or becomes dissatisfying for that person . But how does each partner get their needs met when one is not willing to give unless given to ? Does it become a stand-off ? <p> First , the needs should be communicated in the most respectful way with your partner- no attacking or blaming . Then , work on a give and take program- you ask for a date night or a massage ( whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner and you will give him a favor in return . I have to say this works to get things going again and proves to one another that giving and taking is possible . You may need to flip a coin to determine who starts the giving . Score-keeping like this is n't a long-term solution , but it works during the lulls and low points . <p> Sometimes we expect marriage and our spouse to fulfill all our needs , after all , they did in the beginning . A new relationship seems to fulfill everything on your list ; you do n't need to eat , sleep , or love anything else . You are perfectly full and complete . This is unrealistic in marriage though . We need to consistently evaluate who and what can fulfill our needs- it 's not all our spouse 's responsibility . Some of our needs can be met from our friends , relatives and ourselves . You may be focusing on having more sex in your relationship , but some of that need may be derived from a lack of self-worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lack of sex is a SYMPTOM- something else is going on and has been for a while . Since women are mental/emotional creatures , it 's usually a woman who holds resentment or anger about something in the past . This is a mental road block a woman must overcome to get physical again . As a man , you can either talk it out with her ( do n't have a " get over it " attitude ) or you can get help from a counselor together . <h> Effort ? Ugh ! <p> It 's obvious as a nation , we do n't like effort . We want to work less and have more , eat more and weigh more , etc . Add one more to that list ; It takes effort to have a sex life with your spouse , and even more effort to have a good one . I 'm not suggesting doing it begrudgingly , but making time for it to happen adding a little spice . Couples are surprised at the effort involved to just get away from their routine to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sex does n't just happen when married . There are several ways to satisfy a man and a woman , but it takes effort to discover these things- uprooting the usual routine to discover long-term bedroom bliss . <p> Men , if you put out effort , your wife may put out too . Do n't take anything for granted . Since spontaneity and lust are pre-marital luxuries , romance is the replacement now that you 're married . What is your wife 's definition of romance ? In addition , pour on the romance occasionally without even attempting to get her in bed . This will demonstrate you have no ulterior motives for being romantic- it 's a deed done for the favor bank . <p> Women 's effort should begin with herself- make the effort to feel good about yourself or attractive , whatever that takes for you . For me , that 's reading or watching a romantic or sexy book or movie . A little fantasizing does a woman 's brain wonders . Now that I am a stay-at-home mom I ca n't justify spending much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a new outfit or some item of clothing that makes me feel good , and wear it , maybe even on date night with my husband . Also , exercise gets your blood flowing to all you areas even if your goal is n't losing weight , it releases feel-good hormones , which help in other areas of you life ( ie. sex life ) . The practice of doing something for yourself makes you more willing to do something for someone else . Yes , I know it 's easier said than done and that 's why we call it effort . <h> Let 's Get Physical <p> There are biological reasons that lead to a diminishing sex life . Many occur after child birth and in the 50+ age group for men and women . For example , heart and cardiovascular problems can cause impotency in men . After child birth and during menopause , women 's hormones can fluctuate extensively , causing a physical and mental decreased appetite for sex . A doctor 's evaluation and blood tests can uncover the reason for a loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So what are some ways to get things going without focusing on the sex stats ? <p> Focus on making the relationship better in general ; communicate more , view each other as partners , share interests and activities together , go through hardships together . <p> Masturbate together <p> Read or watch something naughty . <p> Do n't overthink about sex . Let it happen if it happens ... it 's perfectly natural . <p> Take an adventure- do something completely out of your comfort zone together , This is the first thing Tony Robbins uses for couples he counsels . <p> For women who ca n't find the inspiration to have sex with their husbands , here is one incentive : after you have sex with him is when he is feeling closest to you and open to conversation about things you may want to discuss while he 's in a really good mood . If you have sex before bed , though , he will probably be fast asleep so pick a good time not right before bed . <p> Kiss more <p> See a romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite date places ( or activities ) before you got married <p> Talk dirty ( over the phone , text or email is good ) <p> Touch each other more <p> Try a new activity or challenge with your spouse- you may see them in a new light <p> make a short list together about the top things that turn you onto the other person and keep that list handy to refer to later <h> Suggested Reading <p> Work Relationships ; The Substitute/Work SpouseThese relationships seem innocent enough , but even the generic definition of a " work spouse " could have serious consequences .

I have been married for 13 years and I would say even with three children and a hectic schedule we still have a very healthy sex life . This is not to say that we have n't seen drops throughout the years but that is to be expected , especially a few years after my children were born . I think that drops also has to do with lack of communication and understanding of what each other is wanting , feeling or thinking . Sex is physical and emotional and if the physical and emotional connection is not there then that can have a huge impact on the relationship sexually and otherwise . Thank you ! ! <p> Author 64476 @qwx924476 <p> Thanks for the comments . It is an important and very subjective topic . There are so many reasons why sex can be less or different after marrigae . Great point triplet mom , about lack of communication- so true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important topic for me since I separated with my husband due to this very reason after a 12 years of a miserable marriage and 4 years of therapy . At the end of the day , lack of sex and gaining financial power drove my husband to become a bad man . Deceiving , cheating on me at least 10 times during a 6 year period , dishonest and mostly surprisingly left his beloved children behind with all the exposure a 4 and 9 year old should never have . He was NOT this monster of a person before , although he did come from a very dysfunctional ( sexually ) family and also struggled financially . His father was abusive to his sisters and his mother . <p> My husband is convinced that the reason for all his terrible behavior is due to my lack of love or sex with him . Can sexual frustration even under many years of therapy trying to explain that sex comes with lots of relational work , effort and communication from both parties-end up for him to become this monster liar ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied sexually ? Or is he just making excuses to that he can have it all . If I had a wife that did n't want me or brushed me off , I would just talk to her and tell her that if this relationship does n't change between us , I would leave her . Can we go get help ? I would say this many years ago before he started to cheat and be nasty with me and the kids . <p> He would prefer having sex everyday and he said that he needed to be wanted with a lot of passion . I understand this concept but this just does n't happen all by itself . He is a driven type of person that is craving for success and always wanting more and feels quite entitled to it all . Arogant would be a good way to describe him . Was I just with the wrong person with differences in values ? I just wanted to have a family man that was focused on us . Money , success , gadgets , cars can be an accessory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above makes much sense to me . Can you or anyone tell me what is right or wrong in this story of mine ? I want to have comments because I do n't want to get into another relationship ever again and make the same mistakes . What did I do and what am I responsible for ? <p> Author 64476 @qwx924476 <p> Maria- A few things I want to comment on ... 4 years of therapy ? You were either with the wrong therapist or the wrong spouse ( I 'm kinda voting on both ) . I do n't have couples therapy background , but I did do research psychology and working with people who were suicidal and depressed individuals . With that said , I will give you some advice based on my personal and professional experiences . I think everybody has a core personality or core being . Let me explain ... you say your husband was never a " monster of a person " before , but I 'm willing to believe he was , although that side of him was dormant/supressed for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , power , etc. only bring out the core of a person , who they really are . I 've seen someone who won the lottery more depressed than someone with terminal cancer . If your husband was happier and more tolerable before the money than he was proabably betting that money would make him happy and then when he got money and it did n't make him happier , he blamed lack of sex and you . Basically , anything but himslef and that is not a good person to the core . Do n't blame the money- many wealthy men are generous , kind and loving with their families . Your husband has the money , now he feels entitled to his other wants being gratified , for example , sex . Money just magnified the true person your husband is . <p> As for future relationships , and even your husband , look to their moral background . It 's not whether a person had a troubled childhood , but it 's how they dealt with it . Did your husband forgive his past or get angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes or does he do some of the same things they did ? He may be depressed and acting out right now by buying gadgets and cheating . He needs therapy by himself , not couple therapy . <p> Also , how do you or have you and your husband connected emotionally and physically besides sex ? How long has been a " monster " . Some men are awful at communicating and connecting emotionally and so they just want sex to fill that void . Sex is a way that men feel close to a woman . If he wants to have sex with you more , it means he wants to connect with you more- possibly . Be careful with this because it may be just a ploy for him to feel better about himself . He clearly does n't care about your needs or he would be getting sex . A woman usually has plenty of sex with their man if she is being fulfilled emotionally and psychologically . You guys are not connecting and it does n't sound like it 's just sexually . You need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else- that sounds like an important value for you so if you pick someone else see how his family relations are and how he has dealt with them . <p> If you are up in the air about your relationship , My strong reccommendation is a book called " Too Good To Leave , Too Bad To Stay " by Mira Kirshenbaum . I bet it will answer all your questions and it 's very to the point and really tells you whether to stay or go . <p> Author 64476 @qwx924476 <p> One more thing Maria THe book I reccommended has a great tip in it . It suggests writing down things that would make you leave your partner . So if chronic cheating is something you do n't want your husband to do anymore , tell him respectfully that it is something you will not put up with anymore and if he does it , then you will know he wants to end the relationship . Do not tell him if he does it one more time , you will leave . Verbalizing it the other way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and you will feel less guilty . <p> Nicole A. Winter 8 years agofrom Chicago , IL <p> It sounds to me , Maria , like your husband is a sex addict . In general , sex addicts are really difficult to live with . If he 's been inappropriate with the children there 's no question as to if you should stay or go . Go . Now . Before it gets any worse . izetti : What if it is the woman who wants more sex in the relationship ? Any advice for that ? <p> izettl 8 years ago <p> Maria I would love to tell you to leave him now , like Nicole says , but it has to be your choice- it makes me wonder why you have n't left him before now- so what 's really stopping you ? If you decide what is best for your kids , I bet you will decide to leave . You kids probably wo n't respect your husband for the way he is now so give them a good role model and someone to respect- you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected . Personally , my mom left my dad after 18 years of marriage the first time he cheated and I totally respect her for that . because of my mom , I tolerate no cheating- it 's a deal breaker for me . I 've left a cheater ( thank God I never married him ) , and my life was much better for leaving . You 're spending precious time wondering what you should do , but do you think your husband is wondering how to mend your relationship- sounds like he 's wondering how to ruin it . <p> Nicole Triplet mom said it well- sometimes sex lacks for either partner when there is a lack of communication . Also a lack of connection in other areas- emotionally , etc . I would tell a woman who wants more sex with her partner to ask them why they do n't want as much as you . Has it always been this way , therefore different sex drives are to blame and that takes a little more effort to change . For instance , I watched a show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us talking and being honest about what we want and why , things that have changed for us . Is it temporary ? maybe your partner has a lot of stress in their life right now . Communicate with your partner and bring it up gently of course . Find out why he does n't want as much sex as you and work from there . Maybe some spicing up is due . <p> Nicole A. Winter 8 years agofrom Chicago , IL <p> Oh , ah ... yes ... I was asking for a friend ! Yes , a friend . *smile* <p> izettl 8 years ago <p> I 've noticed in my marriage that there are times when I want it more and my husband wants it more . As a woman , sometimes it is devastating if he does n't want it , because I think we assume men are always ' on ' . Downtimes for many men I know is when they are stressed from work . The only time to worry is when all connections are fading or gone- like kissing or touching or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Maria 8 years ago <p> I just wanted to thank you for sharing your comments with me from the deepest part of my heart . Although this is somewhat a different topic , what a perfect day for thanks , after my brother-in-law makes the best deep fried turkey , a perfect feast for my entire family minus my husband . My Husband on the other hand was invited at a very chic friends house with about 25 work related acquaintances with a catered turkey feast in an architectural digest house , most of them not married or if married without children and valet park for your convenience even though it is a house not a restaurant . <p> Yes , my anger is coming out naturally since I so disaagree with his value and the environment he chooses to be in . I guess there is nothing wrong with the concept of wanting more for some , but as I go to a thanksgiving service today to be taught NOT to want more and just appreciate what we have and share what we have been given . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5000 that is spent for luxury very causally by so many people like this . I guess we are all guilty of it . <p> Anyway , as you said before , he never cared about my needs and it was clear at least for the last 8 years . I knew this but since I would get kicked out of this country without my children due to immigration reasons I had to make way more effort in my marriage than others would ever imagine and stay living together . <p> Need to look after my kids . Will write again . <p> Nicole A. Winter 8 years agofrom Chicago , IL <p> Aw , Maria , I 'm so sorry . I did n't even think of that , my apologies . My heart goes out to you and your family . Love eachother . <p> Author 64476 @qwx924476 <p> Maria I had a feeling that was the case or something similar- it is too common and unfortunate .

If you have to be with him , and I hate to say this , for the kids then put your effort into the kids and yourself . Keep your values intact .

Thank you for sharing your experience . <p> Your hub IS GREAT ! <p> Author 64476 @qwx924476 <p> Thanks for sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your points were true for me before I had children . For some couples , once you have children , it becomes a turn-on and a necessity for the man to grow up a bit for the sake of being an active partner in raising children together- which can be fun and can be stressfull responsibility too . I know the more my husband helps out , the more I can relax and take a few deep breaths , and think about our bond . <p> Fun and imagination work too ! <p> josephdiego 8 years agofrom Eastern Long Island , New York <p> This topic just jumped out at me , this has been one great big challenge in my 23 years of marriage . But it has only been in the past 5 years that I have been able to pin point the problem . And the problem is and always has been " My Wife " Yeah you heard My wife . I 'll tell you why . She is nutz out of her mind , for putting up with my selfish ass , ASS ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most of the time all I was worried about was me . What a big baby , I can be when I do n't  get what I want . Up until today , I still pout when I do n't  get what I want when I want it . I have always been very demanding , because of my own , lustful needs . So she is either nutz or a saint for putting up with it for so many years . <p> Most of our life together we have had a wonderful sex life . If it got bad , it was all my doing . You see understanding my wifes needs is n't just making her feel good in bed . But with all of that male pride and ego that was instilled in me by the men and male friends in my life . I have always had something to prove and I guess I had to prove it to myself . Here we go again , Me , Me , Me , Me , Me . <p> So when I got out of me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . I found out , it was n't about making her feel good in bed it was about making her feel good about herself . The little things like . That 's ok babe , we do n't  have to . Let 's save it for a night when you feel better or when you 're not so tired . I even tried a sexual fast , for 30 days . Only lasted 14 , but I tried . Plus she cheated , she looked at me . <p> Listen people I can go on forever about this topic . But I 'm going to cut it short . The bottom line is that when I let go of ego , pride and that macho , macho man . I was able to get honest . Honestly , there are two people in this relationship . When I focused more on what I can do to give her what she wants and what she needs , for some reason my needs just happened to be fulfilled .. <p> Now , that 's not it . I started to apply that unselfish attitude into everything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treating all of the people in my life in a very loving and giving way and now my whole life just seemed to be getting better . Do n't  get me wrong , this little " or better yet " Big cry baby still needs plenty of work . Its one challenge at a time , one day at a time . However my focus is a little more today , on what I can do for others , rather than what they can do for me <p> I am impressed with your self-awareness . I especially love " that 's ok babe , we do n't have to " line . It really is important for a woman to feel good outside of the bedroom so that they want to spend more time in the bedroom .

I do know that in our 38 years together we have had a great sex life until the last five or six years . It began going downhill then and is almost nonexistent now . I do n't know that it is either of our fault . We still enjoy it when it happens ; it just does n't happen often enough anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Johnny Yuma <p> Author 64476 @qwx924476 <p> Hi Johnny- Wow 38 years , you may have to share some of your secrets with the rest of us ! So if your sex life changed five or six years ago , was there something else that changed during that time within your relationship to cause this inadvertantly ? When sex decreases , there is usually another reason associated-physically or psychologically . Just get your partner to talk about it , if that 's possible and brainstorm why the sex decreased . Maybe it 's just a habit that formed and you need a jumpstart to get sex happening again . <p> I think it 's natural for there to be ups and downs in a couple 's sex life but you say it 's been several years since it decreased so it might be something worth figuring out . Are you spending more or less time with your spouse ? I have a friend who became a little turned off when her husband retired . I know this sounds strange but there were several reasons for her feelings and viewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer , but they worked through it together . I do n't know if this is your case , but it 's an example of something that can effect a long term marriage like yours . <p> Best of luck- wink wink ! <p> Laura <p> johnny yuma1 8 years ago <p> Hi izzetl , I am sure that something else must have happened , but it is n't something that I can put my finger one to say yes it was this . I did begin having heart problems , but it was latter not at that time , so I do n't think it was that plus the doctor says that I can do whatever I want to do . Whether or not he was talking about making love I do n't know you one only has to assume as I did n't ask . <p> Johnny <p> LondonGirl 8 years agofrom London <p> My other half and I have been living together for 11 years now , with two hectic careers , one hectic 3 year old , and a great sex life . <p> I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patches , then they just end by themselves and no-ne worries . <p> Author 64476 @qwx924476 <p> London Girl- If you have an overall fulfilling sex life , then the ' slow patches ' are n't as disturbing and hardly noticeable . An unfulfilling sex life is when one of the partners ( or both ) is not happy with the quality and/or quantity of sex . So if your partner says he 's fulfilled also , then chances are your physical needs match and there 's no issues . That 's good , but most relationships , one of the partners has a higher or lower sex drive or different needs than the other . <p> Johnny- As long as your wife is assured your heart problems will not be effected by sex , then that probably is n't the culprit . It could be something she is going through or her sex drive is n't what it used to be . Ask her what her if she is happy with your sex life together ( quality and quantity ) or what would make it better or more enticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband does not seem to want to have sex any more i put the qustion out there evey day 2 times a day with nothing it causes problems with us i just do n't get it he use to want it all the time and now nothing i have put the idea in his head that maybe he should talk to a doctor if things just are n't right with him and i would under stand that but not yet he is put off by the idea i do not feel it makes him less of a man but a better man to ask for help to keep his wife happy and i work all day i kep the job pay and worry about the bills and kids but i find a really good night with my husband help to relax me and put me to sleep to go anther day <p> Author 64476 @qwx924476 <p> More often than not the reason for men 's sex drive to drop is that something physical is going on ( depending on his age though ) , other reasons are stress . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel worthy and like " men " so if you have always been the working one then that would not be the culprit , but if this is more recent then that could be the reason . People need to feel like they 're contributing something in some way . He may not feel good about himself . <p> The best advice I can give- if he wo n't see a doctor or talk about his feelings , is to drop the subject of sex and work on increasing intimacy like snuggling at the end of your work day or giving each other a massage or kissing more in general and do n't force these activities to lead to sex . You do n't want to be like the skinny spouse asking and pressuring the overweight spouse to lose weight- we all know that does n't work . Just focus on the intimacy and no pressure . Do n't make him responsible for helping you relax at night- I understand that though , but snuggling and maybe even masturbating would help you release tension . <p> Five Elements 8 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all start paying less attention to our partner as time passes .

I try to cover the most common relationship errors that lead to less or no sex- and to convey that sex is n't a seperate category in a relationship , it is very much intertwined with all other areas too . All areas of the relationship need to be dealt with before sex improves . I 've seen couples who just tackle sex by itself and begin having more , but their results are very short-lived because there is another area of the relationship that is lacking . Basically , treating the symptom wo n't be as effective as treating the cause . <p> Thanks for your comments ! <p> James Brown 8 years agofrom United States of America <p> Your information is easier said than done - but very helpful , and accurate .

I am in my second marriage as my first husband turned out to be an aggressive and very possessive person . I was raped when I was 17 and had thought , after that , that there was no way I could ever have a relationship with a man . When I met Phillip , I was 22 and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was so different from the person that had sexually assaulted me and I thought I could spend the rest of my life with him . I lost a baby just before my 5th month and as I had ulcerative colitis at the time , I was very sick for some time . He used to just force himself on me whenever he felt like it , and eventually I was turned off sex , because all it did to me was be a very painful experience both times . I married Richard in March , 1990 , and we have had a very happy marriage . The only thing though , a lot of the time of my marriage to Richard has been spent in hospital . I even got a bowel obstruction on my wedding day which landed me in hospital for the first eight weeks of our marriage . In the early years , we did not have too many problems communicating sexually , but as I spent more and more time in and out of hospital , I began to feel very guilty that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a proper wife to him because I was recovering from surgery or a serious illness , such as when I almost died from bacterial meningitis , had a stroke and recently I was diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease which is incurable . I have felt him pulling away from me and I do n't know whether he is scared of hurting me because I have so many areas of my body that are affected by my disease , especially my bad neck , which I was told recently was that of an 80 year old , and it is not really what you want to hear when you are just 53yrs old . My psychiatrist that I see on a regular basis , has encouraged me to try and instigate something which I have tried to do on many occasions but it never seems to go very far . Even orgasm now is extremely hard . I have tried stimulating myself in the hope of getting just something stirring up in my genital region but with everything that is happening and all the medication I am on it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand relief so he must be missing the intimacy just as much as me , but he just wont talk about it with me or even with a therapist . I am starting to think that he has lost interst because of my disease and all the scars on my abdomen from all the bowel surgery are not helping either . I would really love to have an intimate relationship with him because I love him so very much and he has been with me through everything I have had to endure . In some ways , I feel that when I die , it will be good because he wo n't be trapped with a sick wife anymore , and who knows he may find someone else who can give him what he deserves as a husband , a proper sexual relationship as a wife , and not what he is getting , an empty relationship , at least from the intimate side of the relationship . I do n't want to make him do something if he is not comfortable with it , but I really ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tells me that everyday . I just feel very sad inside . If you have any advice on this subject I would love to hear it because I do n't know what else to do from now on . Help me please BB <p> BB <p> Author <p> Laura Irwin 7 years agofrom The Great Northwest <p> Thanks for your detailed comment- I really feel for you . Most recently I was diagnosed with Rhuematoid Arthritis- very painful . Long story short , my husband has been helpful just like yours , but I feel the guilt of not having a " normal " intimate relationship- and not feeling attractive . If you can imagine , I am 34 and most days I walk/limp along like I am 80 . Intimacy was strained between my husband and I at first , but when I communicated with him he confided he thought he would hurt me if we were intimate . That fear he had was turning him off to me . <p> Make sure you two openly coomunicate about your intimacy needs , then start slow- if you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he allows ) and snuggle next to him or help him please himself and do it for you too- masturbating together is very intimate . Take a shower together and lather soap on each other . Pillow talk is great for opening the communication- talk and snuggle at night . Do things that do n't make either of you feel sex is an obligation or expectation . On a couples retreat , one of the first things they assign couples to do is please each other without having sex- this is so important for times ahead when we get older or injured or i 'll . My husband gives me a massage on my legs and it is the best- each of us have intimate things we enjoy as much as sex and if they lead to sex , then all the merrier . Couples forget the grey area of intimacy- some think there is either sex or no sex , but there is a wide range of activities in between . Also , verbally give your husband plenty of compliments for helping you out and tell him it makes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has changed significantly with health issues and that will change other parts of your life too , including intimacy so you have to expect that and not be hard on yourself . If you would do the same for your husband ( if he had health problems ) then you should not feel guilty . Life is always changing and I believe couples get divorced because they did n't adjust their life to the changes . So do n't expect your sex life to go back to normal , maybe for the rest of your life . Accept this and it will put you at ease and give you confidence which is the biggest turn-on for guys . Just like couples who have a baby and expect the sex to return to normal- HA ! . Anybody who marries someone and expects them to be the same person for a lifetime is foolish . <p> kazeemjames01 7 years ago <p> Excellent Article . I will bookmark it . It needs to be read and visited often . <p> Cheers <p> Gr8legs 7 years ago <p> Well , Izetti , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your response to Maria . <p> Up until my diagnosis , we maintained a strong and regular sex-life - 2-3 times per week and sometimes up to 5 or 6 - with occasional dips lasting no more than a couple of months as we went through various gynae problems prior to the conception of our two boys , as well as the obvious dips immediately following their births . I was always totally faithful to my spouse throughout our marriage - as I believe she was to me - even though , following her diagnosis , we only actually made love once during the last eighteen months prior to my leaving the family home . <p> Throughout our marriage I would regularly buy her small loving gift without there being a special occasion , sent her loving SMS messages during the day , give her foot massages as we were watching TV , stop in the middle of whatever I was doing in the house/garden and walk up to her , give her a hug and a kiss and then return to whatever I 'd been doing . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little gestures of love that kindle the fires that will burn hot when you do both get it together to make love . Sex is - especially for women - the physical act that expresses the emotions housed and fostered in the mind . <p> My ( soon-to-be-former ) wife came from a dysfunctional family backgroung with an emotionally distant ( and occasionally abusive ) alcoholic mother and financially-driven and controlling father . Her siblings all had emotionally troubled relationships , but she appeared to have beaten the trap ; that is , until I was diagnosed with ADHD ten years into the marriage . That burst the bubble on the idealised fantasy she had projected onto our marriage . <p> She subsequently contracted a rare and potentially life-threatening disease a little over six months following my ADHD diagnosis - an auto-immune diseased that could possibly be a physical manifestation of her psyche a ( she is now in remission ) and 18 months after that she broke up our marriage . <p> She is now displaying all the same dysfunctional behaviour of the rest of her family . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , except that she now habitually contradicts her words in her actions . The saddest part of it all is that our two beautiful children are being harmed by her efforts to - as she sees it - protect them and she is so convincing in her rhetoric that , by using her charm and personality , she has convinced those within her social sphere that what she is doing is right . Thankfully , those in positions of authority i.e. the judiciary and education have seen right through her charade . <p> The strain of maintaining this pretense and denying herself the opportunity to move on and to heal is taking its toll on her physical being and she appears to have aged 5 years over the last six months . Despite professional advice , she refuses to take advantage of counselling and therapy . <p> Suppressed personalities are a lot more common than many would imagine , as the pressure of society to conform to a prescribed set of norms forces many to bury the hurt they carry from their past and their childhood in an attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from your past and live a lie for so long , until eventually life pulls the trigger and it all comes bubbling to the surface to everyone else 's shock and your own horror . <p> Tick , Tick , Tick , Tick , Tick , Tick , ...... BOOM ! ! ! ! ! <p> Author <p> Laura Irwin 7 years agofrom The Great Northwest <p> gr8legs very thoughtful comment . Too bad your emotional intelligence did n't rub off on your soon-to-be ex . I think birth of children or other major life changes -job loss or health diganosis- begin a downward spiral between couples . These issues effect people deeply and often we see the worse come out in ourselves and our partner during these times . I ca n't explain your ex 's change in her behavior , but it sounds like at least you have peace about doing what you could in the relationship- ongoing thoughtful gestures , etc . Children listen and look around them all the time , if you are setting a good adult example then they will likely do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them why their mom is being the way she is . Many women get a little nutty ( I might get in trouble for saying that ) during a separation/divorce , almost like a midlife crisis . I 've seen it happen all the time . MAybe it will be a phase- you can hope mostly for your kids sake and for hers and yours . <p> Gr8legs 7 years ago <p> Thanks for your words of encouragement , izetti . <p> Yes , I 'd agree that some women go emotionally off the rails around the time of a separation/divorce and I 'm desparately hoping my ex will pull through hers soon . Unfortunately she is being held back by well-meaning friends and family , who think that supporting her wholeheartedly in everything she is doing is helping her , when in fact it is holding her back from moving on . <p> I do n't know if you 're familiar with the five emotional stages of divorce , as described by Jeffery Kottler . In his book " Beyond Blame : A New Way of Resolving Conflicts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the 5 emotional stages of grief ( disbelief , anger etc ) and applies them to the breakdown of a realtionship . My ex is stuck in Stage 4 : Acting on the Decision , which is characterised by feelings of anger , fear , guilt &amp; blame . She is not being allowed to move onto the next stage of acceptance . <p> One of the things that most helped me to deal with this was as a result of my basic understanding of psychology combined with my university education . My first instinct was to research my situation , to read and learn and to arm myself with knowledge . Having done this , I was able to prepare a psychological analysis of our situation and thus rationalise the events surrounding the break-up of our relationship . This proved to be very helpful in dealing with the hurt and other emotions I was experiencing and to move on without the acrimonious feelings normally associated with these events . <p> I have undergone an intensive period of immense growth , emotionally . This has helped me to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that I do not get angry when I find myself on the receiving end of what I perceive to be an injustice . Do I get annoyed ? Yes . Do I feel hurt ? Certainly . But the most important thing is that I do n't get angry ( I have spent most of my life railing against some or other perceived injustice or slight ) and I do n't hold onto the negativity . In that respect , I actually have a lot to thank my ex for ; if it were not for her and this unfortunate turn of events , I would not have found this . I only wish I were able to help her find the same . Despite the hurt and her ongoing attempts to decry , defame and disparage me ( she has , in Jungian terms , projected her fear onto me , identifying me as the source of her fear and leading her to take out a restraining order against me , despite there being no history of abuse in the relationship ) , I only wish her well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inner peace for herself . <p> Anyway , thanks again for a very insightful &amp; thought-provoking hub , as well as for your words of encouragement . Keep up the good work . <p> Ingenira 6 years ago <p> your article has spurred so much discussion that I think you can extend the topic to another hub ! Great work ! : ) <p> Author <p> Laura Irwin 6 years agofrom The Great Northwest <p> Ingenira I could probably write a book on this topic , but there are so many books on it anyhow . I never paid much attention to this issue until I was married . Even then I thought only much older couples had this problem , but not so . Young ones do too . <p> Hopeful 6 years ago <p> Thanks for writing your article . It was interesting and in a way I wish I was the one with the problem to be able to do something about it . My husband and I both early thirties- had the perfect sex life for a 1.5 yrs until a month after we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had sex once a month . Its a hard thing to deal with especially when you are supposed to be on your honeymoon period ... if this is that I am very apprehensive of what our future holds . Its not just about lack of sex or intimacy or that he stopped caring if he was giving me enough affection or that he has some anger issues to deal with -lucky his anger is never physical towards me- or that due to that he developed depression . I am convinced that something inside him changed when being married finally kicked in but ca n't do much about it until he is fully assessed . We have seen several counsellors -due to my persistence of finding out what 's wrong cause if it was for him we would have never seek help- couples , one to one , depression and just now the last one after giving us a positive diagnose of depression suggested it might be a good idea to talk to a psychiatrist for some unfinished business he has -my husband 's father used to criticise him way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't forgive him or talk to him at all- . I have supported him all along and even though I have told him about my needs and he is sorry about it I do not see any effort from his side to easy this situation ... I ca n't recall the last time we behave as a couple anymore . We act like roommates and even though he says he loves me and helps me with the house chores and indulges me in certain aspects I ca n't stop feeling lost in our relationship . I feel like the constant cheerleader and deep down expect a few of my needs being met . I cant bring the subject anymore cause it makes me feel even worse to ask for things when he is so troubled and feels his desperation and frustration about it but that 's about it no change at all . I am lucky to get a kiss hello and good bye and when we finally get to have sex whenever he wants due to the countless times I have tried or asked for it and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid cause he now to become arouse wants to talk to me as if I was a whore and just get to the point and that 's it . I know its hard to understand why I am still around and the answer is simple I married him cause I love him and not just cause he is sick I should be quick to walk away . I guess with time and lots of support/dedication things will change or better to say I hope they will <p> Author <p> Laura Irwin 6 years agofrom The Great Northwest <p> as long as progress is being made , it will be easier to see a reason to stick around . Depression is huge . My husband has major depressive disorder and takes medication for it . THere were a rough couple of years before he started taking meds . He sought treatment after we had a child- not saying that always makes someone change or get better . If your husband seriously has depression then sometimes only medication and counseling will do the trick . You ca n't provide either of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need from a husband , tell him the bare minimum at first so it does n't seem overwhelming for him . Depressed people get overwhelmed easily.At one time things were normal for you two so I guess I do n't understand what changed suddenly . I do n't believe marriage ruins sex , although the only thing I see is marriage puts a given responsibility on a man so if his dad belittled him , all that may be resurfacing . In the mean time trying to find out what ' wrong with him , why is n't he on some kind of mild depression meds ? There really is n't anything you can do right now for him other than let him know if he needs someone to talk to or just cuddle you 'll be there . Ask him what he expects out of a wife to guage what he wants from your marriage . If he wants more then you guys are not in trouble , he just needs a boost to get there , but if you guys do n't have similar goals for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you may have to put some guidelines up for yourself about how long you will put up with not feeling loved . <p> Hopeful 6 years ago <p> Thanks for your advice . I will try to aproach the subject with him in a non threatening way and will see how we go . Sometimes it just helps to be able to vent and then get on with it . <p> He is taking depression meds and that has helping him a lot to not go down all that often . I can practically tell when he has n't had them -he sometimes refuses to take them- cause the change in him is really obvious . <p> I think it all comes back to the will of the person to do something about it and getting that is n't easy . He is slowly but surely putting more effort into it so in time things will change for the better and I really look fw to that ! <p> Thanks again : ) <p> Author <p> Laura Irwin 6 years agofrom The Great Northwest <p> Hopeful somebody asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a date and I said " Do n't . You ask him to go do something other than dinner or a movie and do n't call it or think of it as a date " . Well I think this is similar advice for you . How do you get more intimate with your husband ? Do n't but always leave it open for something . If he 's had a bad day simply as khim if you can massage his back or his hands and refer nothing to sex afterwards . If you want him to talk about deeper stuff going on with him , talk friendly and make sure to compliment or flatter him on something manly . I used to get disgusted seeing women gush over their men about strong or great he is , but when done mildly and genuinely this is very effective . A man always needs to know he is a man . Women have gained a lot of confidence in recent decades and men seem to need reassurance more than ever . Simply compliment him on how he fixed something or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this helped and yes , I agree venting holds a ton of merit . <p> movingfinger 6 years ago <p> First of all .. a great hub on an evergreen topic . I am sure this issue has been around since adam and eve ! ! ! : ) <p> We make life too complicated . We keep shifting priorities in life based on events like say childbirth , new job , new home etc . All these events are exciting and we as humans like change and excitement . But , this approach relegates other aspects of life in the background and sometimes subsumes them . We also postpone happiness for tomorrow like for e.g. If I get a promotion , I shall be happy , If we buy this house , just imagine how happy will we be and so on . By reacting to every situation , whether joy or sorrow , in the same manner , we can escape this trap.The other thing is conditioning . We have all been conditioned to behave in a certain manner at different stages in our lives and to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sex in a marriage . The first few months/years ( of marriage ) is generally a very sexually active period . Once the body and mind have been satiated ( maybe temporarily ) we start to focus on other things . Along the way , these things go up on our priority list thinking that we can always get back to it later . Atleast that 's how men think ... They can get in the mood with the flick of a switch . But women are more complicated . They carry the weight of the world along with them and somehow after marriage , the curtains , sofa covers , kitchen cleanliness , etc .. start assuming top priority ( maybe their desire to project the image of a perfect wife ---conditioning ) . The men cant understand this and the wives cant understand the men 's reaction to their priorities . I mean , given a choice between sex and laundry , 100 % men shall choose sex , but maybe only 50% women shall choose sex as she is already thinking about how many pairs of fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ( It may rain ) , the bed sheets need to be washed and so on . So , the men need to understand the way women think and for women to understand that given a choice between sex and any other thing , most men shall choose sex . <p> Many women do use sex as a bargaining tool because they realise its power . Most men resent that and then find it easy to justify their straying . Most women want sex on their terms and when the male is n't able to oblige , they can get nasty . Women sometimes forget that in most homes , the male is the bread earner and is stressed out most times . So when the home maker wants it , the husband is stressed and this may happen frequently enough for resentment to grow . Both partners working in a marriage is a realtively new phenomenon and evolution is still trying to cope with it . Men refusing sex to women affects women far more than women refusing sex to men . Men sort of expect it ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women think differently and are affected differently by events . Priorities of both men and women change after marriage as other mundane things like mortgage and loan payments start affecting them . The trick is ( and it always works ) is to play together ( even when your children come along ) . Play anything , board games , racquet games , walks , jogs etc ... just play like you used to as a child and suddenly you shall realise that the marriage is perfect .. sex is not an issue .. bringing up children is not an issue or stressful , and most of all ... life is more about play than surviving . A simplistic approach but very effective and has worked for me for the past 14 years ... <p> Sexual Problem Remedy 5 years ago <p> Thank you for this very informative , true and helpful info . The sexual aspects is a big part of keeping a happy marrige and this article has truly help understand how to keep it alive ! <p> Some guy 5 years ago <p> I think this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple minded ... Sex is very important to a man , just as security is to a woman ... what if a man said that he wanted to quit his job so he could see his children more , the woman would no longer feel secure and resent him/leave him for a man with a job who could provide ... why then is he not allowed to leave her because she has cut him off ? ? ? <p> Author <p> Laura Irwin 5 years agofrom The Great Northwest <p> Some guy why is an article written from a woman , sexist ? Obviously I ca n't account for everyone 's point of view- impossible . And I agree , why ca n't a man leave a woman if she cuts him off ? A man certainly can leave a woman for that just like a woman can get a job if her man does n't have a job so that she can feel secure- your assumption that the woman is looking for the man 's job to make her feel secure is extremely sexist . Most women work AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different things . Hopefully a man will not leave a woman if she stops having sex for a while or not as often . Hopefully a woman wo n't leave her man if he loses his job . My article simply suggests what you can do to remedy this problem in relationships and why it happens . It would be a little harsh to leave your woman if she has little sex with you , especially if it 's something you and her can work on . Thanks for your input though . <p> Katina Davenport 5 years ago <p> This hub is totally me . I just had a baby 3 months ago and I have the same conversation with my husband just about every night . I would rather have dinner , a bath , a nap , and a foot rub . Majority the time my body hurts from exercise and picking up my little one who weighs 25 pounds ( at birth he was almost 11 pounds ) . As soon as I get a nap and some help it 's on ! <p> Author <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say the first year after having a baby is tough on relationships .

This irritates my husband as he keeps telling me that sex is not dirty &amp; I should not think this way.Because of this issue we have sex once or twice in a month . I understand that for trying to have a baby we must have intercourse quite frequently &amp; if we start doing that I do n't  want to do the above usual stuff every alternate day.Also , I am under medication for regularizing my periods.Once they are normal can I conceive in 2 to 3 months time from now ? I am asking this because its not just our wish but there is immense family pressure on us , especially on me.We did n't  wanted to delay it for so long as in the last 2 yrs we had to face few setbacks in our life &amp; after going through &amp; coming out of it time just went by so quickly that its been this late . And after everything , it is this problem of mine that is further delaying things .

Certainly nobody can write anything about any topic if it is n't written from some point of view , excluding some cases and people and including some but not all or others . I took the subject " in general " it is the men who are puzzled why sex decreases . And in general women are relationship oriented whereas men do n't concern themslves as much about feelings , relationship isues , and complexity of relationships . <p> Your situation is exactly the same as my husband 's with his ex wife . He remembers how there were signs , issues he ignored , she also had a mental illness , etc so its really equal like you said- its both people . This article probably does n't apply to you- I , nor you , can expect it to and if it does n't then move on . <p> Laura Tykarski 5 years agofrom Pittsburgh PA <p> I think your hub here needs to be read immediately by my hubs !

We have three children a 10yr old girl a 5yr old boy ( who has autism ) and a 10month old . I have to say that just recently I have started feeling like myself again . My fiancT on the other hand I feel pressured me from about 4weeks post pregnancy to have sex and have a lot of it ... of course that is not what I wanted . I wanted to heal and care for our new arrival . Since our son iis now 10months he is not as needy but I am so busy and overwhelmed we do n't have sex often or at least he does n't think we do . My view is when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic wonderful and amazing ... even if it is 2 or 3 times a week . That is enough to me but now to him ... how can I find out what the true problem is ? ? ? Please help I do n't want him to venture out and have an affair . <p> Thank you for listening/reading <p> Author <p> Laura Irwin 5 years agofrom The Great Northwest <p> mommylandrykids are a huge drain .. in fact I 'm in the same boat as you . I have a 3 month old ( my second ) and I can tell you that I do not want to get back in the saddle ( so to speak ) . This time around my husband is less pressuring for sex ... and I think it 's because he is doing a lot more work this time than with our first so he 's just as tired as I am . If your husband wants a bunch of sex right now , he 's not tired enough and could be doing more to help you , the household , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men forget is that women have to heal physically and mentally before wanting sex and then when things get slightly more manageable as baby gets older , we would like some of that extra time to go to ourselves like some relaxation or exercise or something to feel better about ourselves . The way we feel sexy is feeling better about ourselves so an investment in yourself would in turn be an investment for your husband . A nurse in the hospital explained to my husband that women are the center of the household .. and you do n't want to exhaust them or everything else will collapse . Your relationship and household is only as good as how the woman is doing . <p> Men who reported cheating did not give the cause of not enough sex in their relationships so how often is n't much of a factor in cheating ... as odd as that may sound . Men cheat for many other reasons ... but try to have your husband read about what a woman goes through after giving birth or have him go to the Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and sex and how it is after childbirth . I found that I shared this info with my husband the second time having a child and he 's been much more sympathetic . Please each other in other ways ... my husband and I will do other things together besides actually having sex . Hope some of this helps . Sorry it took me so long to get back to you but new baby is time consuming ... you understand . <p> Jay 5 years ago <p> I do say I agree with the majority of this info some th hings seem a little off because of each persons diffren nt even the en in question cause sometimes like in my case you find yourself with a younger woman who 's extremely imature regaurdless of age , and find yourself turned off by the idea of being with her all together <p> Author <p> Laura Irwin 5 years agofrom The Great Northwest <p> Jay yes certainly not all this info is going to fit everyone and I 'm sorry to hear about your situation .

She has become the child in the relationship . <p> " yssubramanyam " great advice and many marriages do n't even get beyond a few years ... and sex can even dissipate sooner than that .

Anti-sexuals belive that sex is primitve , comparable too drugs , that too many evil things were done in the name of sex ( which is not entirely true they were actually done for wealth and power ) that it shortens the lifespan , that animals and possibly humans who engage in it are temporarily insane , that it 's stupid and disgusting , and stereotypes connected to it and that people have been thinking with their genitals . Some are even against the idea of romantic love considering it an addiction to a person ( which I do n't  think is possible ) , that it 's dangerous and has no right to exist , and that people are slaves to it they even offer tips to anti-sexual parents for their children who might feel deprived ( I do n't know if they are trying to force it on their children or not ) . They want to strip people of some of the most basic things that make us human .

" It 's complicated in the way that love is unconditional , but realistically , attraction is conditional .

In theory , it may work for some . I believe my dad is this way . He does n't go to the extreme of saying it 's disgusting- he just says he has no need for it anymore . <p> I think the extreme people who are anti-sexual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissonance . If you look up that term , it explains a lot of human behavior . People ca n't possibly do one thing and think another- it causes them too much mental stress so if they choose to not partake in sex , they may convince themselves it 's awful and be against it for other reasons besides simply not wanting to engage in sex . <p> samowhamo 4 years ago <p> Well yes it may work for some but not all and even if sex drive can be removed in the future by some medical means ( as some anti-sexuals claim ) that does not mean it should because then you are striping humans of a certain right and besides how can sex only be for animals when humans are animals and animals have sex for pleasure all the time its commonly believed that animals do not as a kind of rule have sex for pleasure but that is being disproven some animals even engage in homosexual activity . Well if you are not interested in sex that is your choice just do n't force it on other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura Irwin 4 years agofrom The Great Northwest <p> i agree Sam . that applies to anything and anybody . do what you like , just do n't  force it on others . sex is even a health benefit so perhaps with surival of the fittest theory , those that do not appreciate sex will die off ... we can always hope . <p> Joe Schmo 4 years ago <p> Why is it always about the woman ? <p> Charlie 4 years ago <p> An absolute load of crock .

@@96276093 @476093/ <h> Cheating From the Perspective of the " Other Woman " <h> The Cheating Husband 's " Other Woman " <p> One of the most interesting aspects of an illicit affair is the perspective of the " other woman . " Most of us have a hard time feeling pity for the woman who plays the role as the " other woman " in an affair . Many wives choose to blame her for the affair , rather than the unfaithful husband . <p> For example , in a recent interview Elizabeth Edwards spoke of the mistress of her husband , John Edwards , waiting in the wings to take what was hers . While it was obvious that Mrs. Edwards felt betrayed by her husband , she subtly attacked Ms. Hunter for being available . Of course , all of us as women want to put the blame on the other woman rather than the man we love , even if all trust has been broken and our hearts and lives have been betrayed . <p> What I have heard women say a few days after discovering that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who fight among themselves , but will defend one another against everyone else . <p> We seldom hear the story from the point of view of the " other woman . " Why did she become involved with a married man ? What did she expect ? What were the benefits of being his play partner ? <h> What Most Attracted the Other Woman ? <p> What attracts the other woman to a married man is as varied as the people who become involved in affairs . Some of the responses may surprise you . <p> He 's married --- no attachments . <p> He has money . <p> He has power . <p> I love older men ( even if they are married ? ) <p> He flirted with me and he 's hot . <p> I did not intend to get involved . It was supposed to be a one time thing . <p> I wanted to have sex with him . <p> For the hell of it . I do n't know his wife . <p> It was love at first sight . ( or so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including " I did n't know he was married . " But , even when the unknowing discovered that her new flame was married , most continued the affair . <h> What Was the Bait ? <p> According to most of the " other women " I have interviewed , the men treated- them " special . " One insisted that the married man treated her better than the average single man she would have dated . According to these women , a married man is more likely to treat- them " like a princess " . <p> In retrospect , many of the women- stated that the man would take her to better restaurants , buy her gifts --- often very expensive if the men were older or financially sound --- and almost always try to fulfill her wishes , regardless of what she asked. - During the courting stage , according to these " other women " life could not have been better . <p> Most married- men , by the time they- decide to engage in a relationship outside the marriage , - have become familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have seen their wives with and without makeup . They have seen the bad and the good . Yet , with the " other women " the man- has only seen- the good . He- has- not been around her long enough to see the down side . And , there is always a down side . <p> The men have a tendency to consider the " other woman " as his fantasy woman . One of the women reported that her " keeper " ( her word ) had insisted on breast enhancements and collagen for her lips. - He demanded that she wear 5 " heels with her jeans as well as her dresses. - And , she had to have her hair ( drapes and carpet ) dyed auburn. - <p> When they were going out , he would select what she would wear and occasionally suggest that she apply more makeup. - - If she protested about too much makeup he would remind her that her job was to- concentrate on making- him- happy . Of course , she had no distractions , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Her total effort was to keep him attracted to her- and to make him happy . <p> Of course , over time the glamour fades . To quote Shakespeare , " Familiarity breeds contempt . " <h> The Kiss is the Pitfall <p> Most prostitutes will tell you that they never kiss their " marks " or " johns " on the lips. - The kiss is the most intimate of emotional experiences. - <p> Prostitutes will engage in almost any sexual act with a man without any feeling of attachment. - However , a kiss is too personal and can lead to emotional attraction as well as physical attraction . <p> Unlike a prostitute who can keep the man at a distance by refusing to kiss him , the " other woman " is all to ready to share kisses. - This is the pitfall to the emotional detachment that most expect from a one night stand . <p> While most wives will ask their husbands , once the affair is discovered , about the sexual acts the husband and other woman shared , few will ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving force behind the emotional attachment the husband has formed with his new lover . <h> What Makes the " Other Woman " Tick ? <p> Of note , many of the women I interviewed had either been sexually abused as children or had low self-esteem for one reason or another . It must be noted that many girls who are sexually abused early in life become extremely promiscuous during their teenage years and as they mature . There is little value put on relationships with men and these women often show little respect for established family units . Sex is a tool of manipulation for these women to gain what they want or to fill a need that can not be filled . <p> Men on the prowl are prime targets for these women as the women do not go into the affair asking for or expecting ( in many cases ) an ongoing relationship . <h> The Life of the Mistress <p> I have been lucky enough to interview three women who were actually mistresses- or kept women for at least five years , some longer. - And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and question women who were involved- with married men for short , yet destructive affairs. - Of the three who were involved in- " kept " relationships with married men , - the men were all- rather wealthy and older . <p> Each of these women told stories that were very similar . The affair started as a dinner with an older man . Other dinners followed . The older man often took the younger woman to museums or to other places as a way of introducing her to culture . In this role , the man was a father figure and a teacher . <p> The man would purchase expensive gifts , eventually offering to " keep " the woman , renting an apartment or in one case buying a house for the woman . <p> The excitement of the forbidden fruit lasted between three and six months following setting up house . Sooner or later , the women were seen at less than their best . The men began to be too comfortable with the women , showing signs of taking them for granted . <p> One woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had sold herself into slavery . She was " on call " twenty-four hours a day . According to this particular woman , all her friendships and other relationships suffered once she became a kept woman . On more than one occasion when she would have a night planned with friends , " he would show up and what could I do ? He paid the bills . " <p> Holidays , particularly Christmases and birthdays , became almost unbearable according to two of the women . One would spend days and weeks decorating for Christmas , only to spend it alone . <p> The other said she would dress for dinner on her birthday , expecting and having been promised a big night out , only to spend the evening alone looking at the clock on the wall . " If he arrived at all , it would be close to midnight . I would want dinner . He would want sex . Since he was paying the bills , it was sex . " <p> After seeing and interviewing these women for almost a year each , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts , the flirtations , the trips and even the apartment or house --- lost their appeal within a year . These women were lonely , depressed , possessed no self-esteem , and as one stated , " I have no savings . He dies and what happens to me ? " <h> How Did It End for the " Other Woman " ? <p> Of all the " other women " I interviewed , only one had married the man she lured away from his wife . The marriage lasted less than two years . She caught him cheating on her and kicked him out . <p> Some of the others were still " waiting for him to leave his wife . " One was waiting for " his kids to graduate college . " Of course , she had waited for them to graduate high school . I bet she is hoping they do not go to graduate school ! <p> One " other woman " had been dumped by her lover after six years of being his mistress . He had forced her to move out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I first met her she was a recovering alcoholic . She said she never drank before they met . He introduced her to wine . On nights when he would not show up , she would drink the entire bottle by herself . Eventually she began drinking with breakfast . It became a problem the man could not handle in addition to lying to his wife and paying two mortgages . He ended the relationship and gave her enough money to return to her hometown . <p> Not one story had a happy ending . Some were not quite willing to throw in the towel and give up . And , a few stories had not only unhappy endings but tragic endings . The saddest part of all the stories is that all the women were intellectually smart and emotionally scarred . <p> When asked , " What would you tell someone thinking about going out with a married man ? " - each of the women I interviewed would tell any other woman to not take the first step , to never go out with a married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what we want to do. - We just do not realize the consequences for ourselves , the men , and the worst part is for their kids. - If I were his wife , I would have killed me .

To be bookmarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for such kind comments . I have to be honest , I am going through notes from the clinical days . I guess as I look back over some notes I made for myself I am reminded of why I decided there had to be another way to earn a living .

That said , it was not my intention to be condescending to " the other woman . " After all , she has made no commitment to the wife . The husband did that , and as such is the one who broke the vow and the commitment . <p> Do n't you think that " dumbass wives " know their husbands are at fault ? But , if you are married or if you have siblings you are well aware that you can knock them all you want , but even under the worst of circumstances you will defend them when they are attacked by another . Maybe those " dumbass wives " just hate to admit that they were betrayed by someone they trusted . I think they know the truth , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dumbass is n't the wife it 's the OW .. seems to me they to should take responsibility for the pain they go through , after all they know he 's married ... there was no commiment to you . And the wife does know that he is cheating , but they put those blinders on , for the kids , for the family and all she put into the marriage . The saddest thing is that the OW has no empathy ! <p> BeautySpeaks 7 years agofrom Prince Georges County , Maryland <p> well ... i 've been the other woman to a married man before . but it was n't anything like what you 're describing ( it seems you encountered more of the goldigging type ) . for me personally , it did n't have anything to do with financial stability or gifts or wining and dining . but simply the mental connection this man and i shared was more than what i was getting at home ( of course he was having problems with his wife , just like i was having problems with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking- the pain it could cause if ever found out , our reputations at work ( we were co-workers of course ) , etc .

Granted , we never slept together ( but sexual acts were done ) , but the want was there . Now after almost 2 years , he 's getting separated from his wife , while i 'm still with my boyfriend . I am slowly distancing myself from him because I want to give my relationship with my boyfriend a real chance . But like in the movie " I Think I Love My Wife , " when two people admit that they are attracted to each other , the relationship has to play out ... otherwise you 're stuck with the " what if 's " and you can become resentful . one just has to be prepared for the consequences . <p> i will say that i do agree with you for sure on one valid point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that person is the good . you do n't get the ugly ... and because of that fact alone , I want to try and work it out with my bf. he 's truly seen me at my worst ( just like i 've seen him at his- he 's no saint either ) and I think that says a lot . <p> Sidney 7 years ago <p> What you wrote is so clichF . Your article is so judgemental and you obviosly know nothing about the other woman perspective . You are entiteld to write whatever you want . Just try to be honest with yourself and state things for what they reaaly are , because what you wrote is only your perspective and nothing more . <p> Jetta 7 years ago <p> I agree that while this article was well written , it does seem to be based mainly on the gold digger types of other women . I too am seeing a married man and he is a broke a$$ , lol . There 's no fancy gifts , or expensive lunches or dinner let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our affair just started out as a sexual fling . I do not believe in traditional marriage and prefer open relationships . I know most men cheat given the right circumstances or opportunity and always did see wives more a less as half wits to actually believe just because them and their man spent a day together with family and loved ones an promised forever meant that he 'd never look at or touch another woman , surely they were fooling themselves . <p> None the less- the fact still remains- that the man did make a promise and that promise is HIS to uphold . Not mine . He is the one to be held accountable as well as the wife for either believing and trusting him , or to allow him to get away with it if she has a problem with him sewing his oats elsewhere . Afterall , if he was fully in love and satisfied at home he 'd have no reason to go looking elsewhere anyways . <p> I did n't expect to grow feelings for the mm I am dating now- and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still it happened . He is not in love with his wife and did n't even really want to marry her . He is a big softy and we might even call him spineless since the only reason ( he claims ) he went through with it was because he did n't want to hurt her feelings . <p> He is a very sexually open man and I will admit that is the main focal point in our relationship . We are both wild , enjoy multiple partners , orgies and he is also bi sexual little does his wife know or is willing to accept . <p> He says he is in love with me now- we get along well , read each others minds so often it 's actually a bit creepy at times , and I know all of his dirty little secrets and he knows mine as well ( I am also an escort ) I know we are both not on par with what society considers acceptable and for that maybe we do deserve each other . <p> That is this OW 's real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has scrounged up enough for a promise ring and is taking steps to leave his wife . <p> The wives out there- I understand the anger you must have for women like me . I truly do . But honestly- a man is a man is a man and they are going to cheat on you . Do n't be a fool to think other wise . Also- keep in mind that while few of the husbands do actually leave the wife for the other woman- the ones that do- you really should thank the OW for taking a man off of your hands that clearly never truly loved you in the first place . I understand there is more pain for those who have children involved , thankfully my mm has none of his own . But be honest with yourself- do you really think it 's better for the husband to stay with you for the sake of the kids when he does not love or respect you ? Do you really want to hold onto a marriage that is full of lies and deceit just to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another note , Children are more perceptive than most adults give them credit for and they will sense when mommy is sad night after night after night . Do you really want to subject your children to that just for the sake of not losing your lying cheating husband ? <p> I know there 's a chance my affair will end is disappointment . In fact there is an overwhelmingly high chance it will fizzle out , or die before he ever leaves his wife . <p> There 's also a chance he never will leave her and puss out in the end . <p> I 'm aware of that , just as well as I am aware that nothing really lasts forever . But to me , life and relationships is not about forevers ' , it 's about the bonds you build and enjoy along the way , the experiences we each have- good and bad and what we can learn about ourselves and our lives along the way . <p> I am not out to hurt anyone . I am a free spirit= though I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But while him having sex with others does not bother me- Lying does and if I do catch him in a lie ( which I 'm sure I eventually will ) I will be leaving him . <p> I do not wait on him to call or stop by- and if he starts to show me disrespect I do tell him where he can go ( back home to his wife ) and he straightens his act out right away . I am not the typical mistress that let 's the mm dictate her life and walk all over her . So I hope next time you write an article like this one dear author- you are sure to include various types of other women so that you are able to get a more well rounded scope into the various paths and experiences we each have . <p> It 's not always about financial security and bills paid . Sometimes it 's love and sometimes it 's lust and sometimes it 's a combination of two or more .

I am the wife of a cheating man who is currently going through a divorce . I have read every marriage and affair book out there and know that your research is in agreement with a lot of other research done by well-known psychologists . Very few relationships last that were begun by secrecy and cheating . I do n't think this is what the OW wants to hear , but if he 's lying to his wife to be with you he will do the same to you also . Betrayal is one of the most hurtful and traumatic things I have been through .... maybe someday the OW 's will understand this when it 's done to them and see how they have contributed in destroying marriages . Just my thoughts . It takes two to tango and yes the cheating spouse AND the OW is both at fault . They are both very selfish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discover the truth .

That means everything ... <p> Thank you for writing this hub . I think it 's making people really look inside themselves , and for some , they may not like what they see and the finger pointing begins . Everything is always someone else 's fault right ? <p> Absent Seraph 7 years ago <p> i just kind of skimmed through this after the first couple points , mainly for the reasons given by other readers , your unfair attitude towards " the other woman . " how come nobody looks at the wife ? i mean , i realize there are some men who wo n't be happy no matter how good he has it at home ; but we also need to realize that a lot of wives withhold , get comfortable just like their husbands , do n't take care like they used to . i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other woman ever gets introduced into things . neither is right . neither is wrong . it 's just broken . <p> Author <p> JennaJackson 7 years ago <p> I agree with most of you . This was written from the perspective of a gold-digging other woman . I certainly realize that not all relationships begin that way . Often , there is " chemisty " and I have seen relationships develop that probably would have worked out very well had there not been a wife . <p> However , the one point that is consistent is that most marriages to the other woman after a divorce end in divorce . Sooner or later the " other woman " turned " wife " begins to doubt the husband and in many cases begins to doubt herself . As much as we all hate to hear it , any relationship that is based on dishonesty to oneself or to one 's partner starts on a shaky foundation . There are exceptions , but they are so few and far between that the odds are against a lasting and trusting relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies and gents have made some valid points . <p> Jenna <p> Disturbia 7 years ago <p> This is an intresting hub on several levels . <p> As far as the gold diggers mentioned here , in the long run , there is really no benefit to any woman who is waiting around for her man to leave his wife . It 's an easy lie to tell , easier to say then to do , and most men do n't . Men who keep long term mistresses , keep them for a reason . <p> I do n't think that most " other women " are in long-term cheating relationships . My husband has cheated on every woman he 's ever been involved with . He even cheated on his ex-wife with me , and has since gone on to cheat on me . Love seems to have little if anything to do with it . I know he loves me , but when he cheats it 's usually a one night stand or a quick fling with someone who makes him feel good about himself . She does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet his needs at the time . <p> It is always the man 's fault . He is the one who knows he 's married and he is the one who took the vows to be faithful . He is also the guy who wants to have his cake and eat it too . Not that the other woman does n't have any responsibility , because she does , but she 's not the one breaking any vows , and even if she makes herself available , it 's up to the man to decide if he 's going to cross that line or not . <p> Author <p> JennaJackson 7 years ago <p> Disturbia , I realize it is my opinion --- and just that --- however , the person who made the commitment is responsible for keeping his or her word . The other woman ( or man ) , whether a gold digger or just a woman who caught his eye for a night , has no commitment to the relationship in which the man is involved . Good common sense and a personal sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong to date a married man . But , it is hard to place the burden of responsibility on her . She has no commitment to the wife . <p> Of course , we all know that not only in personal relationships , but at work and in many other situations , we look for someone else to blame . Let 's face it , whether the man cheats or not , his wife still loves him . It is n't as easy as " off " and " on . " When her friends begin to tell her what a dog he is , the wife feels hurt and in a small way as if her friends are not only attacking her husband 's behavior but questioning her judgment if she does n't leave him or kick him out . We have all heard women who say " I would kick him out " or " I would n't stay with him if he did that to me . " The truth is , none of us know exactly what we would do until it happens to us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but often our actions do n't match what we want to do or know we should do . <p> Katerina1982 7 years ago <p> Why blame the husband or the other woman ? Why ca n't the wife take a good cold hard look at herself for a change ? I have been with a married man . His ex wife was a good person , but did not take care of his needs as a man , plus she weighed about 300 lbs at about 5 feet tall and did n't even try to make herself look desirable . He is a healthy man . What did she expect ? People make mistakes . We are still human and mammals . We become attracted to and fall in love when we do not expect it . Maybe if some spouses keep up their part of the bargain , the other spouse will not feel neglected and not fall in love with someone else . You can not blame other people for your own misgivings . <p> Author <p> JennaJackson 7 years ago <p> Katerina 1982 , Your comment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about responsibility and honoring a commitment . If the husband was not happy with his wife , he could have had the courage and the respect for himself and his wife to ask for a divorce . <p> There is no doubt that some of us " let ourselves go " after marriage . But , that is a poor excuse for cheating and a very childish one . <p> It seems to me that the respectful thing to do would be to divorce before betraying a partner . And , heaven forbid , if the other woman were to put on a few pounds or have a headache , would he dump her too ? <p> Again , this is not about blame or finger pointing . It is about honesty and self-respect as well as respect for commitment . We have all heard those sad stories about " my wife does n't treat me right AND you do . " Oh , please ! Next it will be my mistress did n't treat me any better than my wife did and she put on ten pounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the comment . You are right about one thing for sure . People do make mistakes . In the case you mentioned , apparently more than one . <p> Samone123 7 years ago <p> There are so many stories and I have one of my own . First I would like to thank you for creating this blog , I believe it hits home to many of in challenging relationships . To make a three year long story short . I did not start out as the other woman , but I ended up being one . Now , I belong to a society that I am not too happy to be a part of . It was not my intention at all to be the OW . I always thought of the OW as being stupid and wasting her life on a man who would always be unavailable to her . I knew very well that it was and is a no where situation . <p> I am unhappily married . Three years ago I was on the verge of leaving my husband . I had just finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I was diagnosed . I was deeply depressed but was slowly and surely coming out of it . I met a single guy who rocked my world . We got along fantastically . After 2 months he wanted me to leave my husband . I wanted to leave but I needed time as well as his patience and understanding . I needed him to wait for me a little longer . Two or three months later he started seeing another woman who he met on a social web site . I stupidly stayed around because I did not think I had any right to tell him what not to do since he was single . He continued to prod me to leave my husband but it got to the point where he would not leave her and even if I left my husband I did not think he would leave her . We or I fell deeper in love with each other . This nonsense carried on until he planned an entire marriage without me knowing . During our affair he became unavailable just as if he were married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would also tell me how much he loved me and how much he truly saw himself with me . I thought that our love could not be surpassed . I was confident in our love . I trusted and believed him . I was stupid because his actions did not follow his words . We have never stopped seeing each other . It is completely crazy . Before he got married and after he got married we still continued to see each other . Of course my self esteem hit an all time low as well as I have been depressed . I still can not believe that he is carrying on this mascarade . You may be wondering about my marriage . My husband found out and I live with his distrust and resentment toward me . We have some good days but more bad days . I do n't know if you can actually understand how I became a part of an adulturous world simply by not saying enough is enough or by not having more pride and respect for myself but love will make you do crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occassions I tried to leave and told him that if he were happy to stay with his girlfriend now wife and not tell me that he misses me or that he loves me . I guess it is all a part of the game and I fed into it . I did not want to be the OW , I wanted to be with this man for the rest of my life and I was willing to leave my husband for him . To my detriment I stayed with him too long . I feel like I have been used . If he truly wanted me he could have had me . I feel foolish and betrayed . There will be no good end to our story . Recently he told me that I was the love of his life . I have maintain a small apartment because I am a landlord and he has the keys . He also has some of his things in my garage . When he got married in August 2009 , I was devastated . Now I see him less and less . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e-mail and told him never to contact me again . I told him that I am cutting off all communication with him . I did not know any other way to do it . His wife has no idea who he is . Can you imagine that he has never been faithful to her since he has met her ? Sometimes I am filled with revenge and want to tell her but I do n't think this would make me feel any better . This is the story of the OW who was not in it for the money but soley for the love that she believed she had finally found . I welcome all comments and opinions . At this time I need support and encouragement that the best thing for me to do is to keep it moving and not look back . <p> Thanks for listening <p> Author <p> JennaJackson 7 years ago <p> Samone123 , First of all , I am so sorry to hear of your cancer . That all by itself can put us beyond our normal logical way of thinking and behaving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not tell you how many times I have heard something similar . And , I know that logic will not overrule emotional feelings . <p> Whenever we enter a new relationship , especially a romantic one , we become greedy with the other person 's time . We do not necessarily mean to , but we want to spend more and more time with him . Maybe we become a little obsessive . Of course , the other person is probably experiencing the same feelings . <p> Imagine how devestated " he " was when you delayed leaving your husband . Like so many , you rationalized your way into staying with your spouse . The truth is probably that you were n't really that sure of the other man . Our intuition --- when we tune in and listen --- knows the difference between the high of a new romance and the security of the older relationship . Most of us are not willing to take the plunge . In other words , we may not be as enticed by the pound cake as we are by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always be there . Like many of us , you wanted to have your pound cake and indulge om the exciting Red Velvet , too . <p> From the other man 's perspective , can you imagine how he must have felt when you kept putting him off day after day ? Now , you are jealous of his relationship with his new wife . <p> Your situation is very complicated on many levels . You and the other man have drawn two innocent people into your affair , knowing that if you continue they will be hurt sooner or later --- and both of you will probably be hurt , too . <p> Samone123 you laid out your story very well . And , you know what you should do . Telling the other man that you are not going to continue communicating with him , etc. is baiting him to make a move , nothing more . You are playing a game with him and with yourself . <p> It is like quitting smoking . You know you should and some days it is easier than others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigarette . It is human nature . <p> Here 's the thing . Are you enjoying the melodrama and the rush that comes from the other man ? Sometimes we get so caught up in the anxiety and the excitement of living on the sly that it becomes the reward , not the other person . <p> Stop talking about wanting to end the relationship . Take action . Fill your life and your time with an activity that is fulfilling and meaningful . There are plenty of exciting activities we can all do that will give us the rush we are seeking . One of my clients took up skydiving , not that I would suggest that for everyone or anyone . She loves the feeling it replicates and the rush of excitement . <p> In other words , replace the other man and the other relationship with something positive that will give you the same excitement and the same pounding heartbeat . <p> Chances are that when you are with the other man , you are not concentrating on him but on his wife and the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many people tell me that they " love " the other man or other woman , but when they describe their time together it seems they always talk about the fights about the other spouses . The relationship is no longer about " love " but about winning the other man/woman away from his/her spouse and lots and lots of hurt feelings that come from losing the battles . <p> You are right about one thing . Get on with your life . It will not be easy and I wo n't say it will be . You have created a habit and a pattern that will be hard to break . Work on replacing that activity with another --- hopefully one that will be beneficial to you and others . <p> Take care , Samone . You will make it when you make up your mind . Stop feeding the bad habit . Too much cake is bad for anyone . <p> Veronica 7 years ago <p> I do n't  believe that the OW has any respect for any marriage or anyones feelings . The OW is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can never face the x-wife when they pass the road . Wonder what the OW will do when this happens to her . <p> My Sweet Anjolie 7 years ago <p> I really appreciate this hub . To see different perspectives , to stand in anothers shoes is so important . Right wrong it is still good to hear and understand all . Thanks <p> axia 7 years ago <p> I really find this discussion helpful . I 'm married but my husband and I separated for three years now.I have two wonderful kids . Last year I met a guy and fell in love with him , he is married . First few months were wonderful and I felt loved and wanted . He told me stories like how his wife treats him badly like any philandering husbands do.I listened . He had plans of getting a job away from his country so we can be together but now a days things changed . Tho ' he 's not telling but I can tell things with him and his wife are getting better . Whenever he is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached slowly he is becoming less available not like before . He claims that he loves me and frequently asks if I love him just the same . Sometimes I give answers just for the sake of answering . Till recently , I 've read his emails to his wife , how he is making ways to win her back , bought her a new house and what ticked me off badly was I new she bought her a skirt but when I almost found out about it , he made up a story that it was for me . Not that I am jealous he is buying him gift for I know that I do n't have the right . But OW like me are humans and it hurts . Last weekend we had a bad fight , was so hurt that I started crying but when he came over to comfort me , he called me by his wife 's name . I was taken aback and badly insulted . He said it 's another slipped of his tongue which he did twice already . The first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' my lady ' . I just kept quite . It made me quite . I asked him not to call me again . However , he started crying , telling me again that he loves me .. blah .. blah .. that only thing is that presently he is under constraint . <p> I know , at the back of my mind he is in love with his wife and I 'm just a filler whenever he is in my country and away from her . I told him that at the end of the day what matters is who you go home to . And I know he wo n't give his family and wife up for me . I wanted to stop but he keeps coming and it makes it more difficult for me . <p> hattie82 7 years agofrom anderson <p> I think it 's really a terrible thing to cheat on someone and it is even worse to be with a married man and know that he 's married , in the bible that is a sin . Being with a married man and knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman and let 's him and everybody else know that you do n't respect yourself or others , that 's why it 's not a large number of married men who leaves their wives for the other woman , do you think a man wants to have a family or a real relationship with someone he know he ca n't trust . And to say that it is the wives fault for not pleasing her husband is an understatement and also makes you sound ignorant and absent-minded . For the women who takes pride in making sure her man has everything her man wants and needs both in and out of bed and still get cheated on let 's other real women know what type of man he really is . Im engaged to be married and has been with this one man for seven yrs and has never cheated and never missed a step when it comes to taking care of my man , my home , and my children , but i just recently found out that he is n't marrige worthy and cheating and lying is something he ca n't help , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean that i was n't doing him right or that we had a rocky relationship it just means he is a typical man . And no one should ever blame the other woman unless it 's a fact she knew he was married and did n't care then it 's both his and her fault not just his , because a man will sleep with any woman if she 's willing . <p> Author <p> JennaJackson 7 years ago <p> axia , <p> Too many men , especially some who travel , will say they are " separated " and will then play the " poor me " game with a woman . <p> This is nothing new . I have interviewed too many of these " separated " men who are really trying to convince themselves that they are not lying . If the wife is n't in the same city , the same state , the same country , in his mind technically he is " separated " if not by emotional commitment , by miles . I guess when a man says he is " separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us have been in a similar situation . We believe in the " separation " and are taken in by the poor me role . Here is something to consider . If the man is a whiner and a victim --- is n't that in essence what the " poor me " is all about ? --- is he really the type of man most confident women are looking for ? <p> Maybe it 's some sort of the motherly instinct to try to take care of everyone and everything . Maybe it is our need to try to fix everyone and everything . Or , maybe it is our own lack of self-esteem , causing us to think that the only man we can grab is one that is down and out --- emotionally , if not otherwise . <p> You said you know in the back of your mind that he loves his wife . BAIL OUT NOW ! Of course , he loves his wife . After all , he is " separated " NOT divorced , and we do n't even know his definition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation for a minute . Think of yourself . Do n't you really deserve a man who does n't have to hide you from the world ? Do n't you really deserve a man who puts you first ? And , chances are if he is whining about how his wife treats him , you are working at making him feel better , trying to kiss away his tears . <p> He needs to get a dog . You need to find a man who can treat you like a lady , not a booty call . <p> Best of luck to you . You know what you need to do . Face it now and take action . You are wasting your time and time is all we really have in this life . There is a man out there who can show you respect and not ask for pity in return . Lose the phone number and change yours . Get on with your life --- not his . <p> Good luck , <p> Jenna <p> axi 7 years ago <p> Thanks Jenna . <p> Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind is willing but the heart gets in the way most of the time . Everyday is a struggle and every time I have reached to a level where I have finally come close to not minding him at all , comes his phone calls or emails . It 's like I 'm in a loop.He comes to my aid esp whenever I am in need financially and emotionally . That alone made it hard to forget him . <p> Author <p> JennaJackson 7 years ago <p> axi , <p> I do n't want to sound too harsh , but have the courage to face the truth . That 's the best place to start . You are right ! You are in a loop --- of emotional self-destruction . And , like most of us , you are attempting to make excuses for keeping this man in your life . <p> You can block his emails . You know when the call is from him --- almost every phone has caller I 'd now . Do n't answer his calls . <p> But , more importantly than blaming him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reacting and start acting . Your emotional needs would greatly diminish without him , so every time you let him back in you are only feeding one of the problems you mentioned . <p> As far as the financial support --- that really is a downside to the entire " relationship " . Create a life for yourself . You will feel much better about yourself and your life if you did not depend on him to bail you out . You do n't need him financially . You can make changes in your life that will give you control . As long as you depend on him --- and that is your choice --- you will never have control of your life . You are handing it over to him . Think about it for a minute . The financial aid puts you in a position to need emotional aid . <p> You can do it ! Change is hard . There is always that element of fear and worry when we step out of our comfort zone . Unfortunately , it sounds as if your comfort zone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships , it is easy to sink to the level where abuse is the norm . Breaking the cycle is hard to do --- and yes , sometimes we do take a step backwards --- but you can set yourself free when you decide to . It really is up to you . <p> Remember this : Excuses only satisfy those who make them . Stop making excuses for keeping this man in your life . He is n't worth it and you can take control of your life . Who knows ? You may be missing out on a really fulfilling relationship while you are hanging on to this negative . If you continue doing what you are doing today , where will this relationship be in 5 years or 10 years ? If you can deal with years of emotional and financial turmoil , you are in the right place . Otherwise , take control . Do something to create your life instead of handing it over to someone who is never going to commit to you . <p> Best of luck ! <p> Jenna <p> jasper420 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop blamming the other women its the cheating husband they should be upset with <p> Author <p> JennaJackson 7 years ago <p> Jasper420 , <p> You have a point . The cheating husband is the one who made the commitment to his wife . But , if a woman knows a man is married and decides to get involved , if she does n't care about his wife , she should care about herself . In most cases , the cheating husband is not going to leave wife and if he does --- well , he can not be trusted , and to be honest he will know that his new partner has no qualms about going out with a married man . This is definitely a lose-lose situation . <p> alphonsians93 6 years agofrom Cebu Philippines <p> This is very good , very helpful to many women who are being fooled by their men . You really shared a very wonderful article . Superb work of art ! ! ! This is a very interesting topic ! ! ! lots of learning and good insights ! ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other woman get hurt in the end . If you are going to be a homewrecker , you deserve to be mistreated as far as I am concerned . I will save my sympathy for the poor wife that had to suffer this . <p> Author <p> JennaJackson 6 years ago <p> lana , <p> I think as women and perhaps as wives , most of us must receive some satisfaction from seeing " the other woman " getting hurt . I have talked to many women who have said otherwise , but I am inclined to believe that deep down inside , whether we admit it or not , we must feel some satisfaction . <p> Interestingly , I noticed that you made no mention of the husband . While I agree that the other woman should have showed restraint when she knew the man was married , I must state emphatically that the husband is not an innocent bystander . He is the one who made the commitment to the wife , not the other woman . <p> Giving the husband a pass as a victim of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , most men will tell you that it is easier to get forgiveness than to get permission . <p> lynne 6 years ago <p> I was the mistress .. And it had nothing to do with gold digging .. Was a boy I fell in Love with in high School . whom I never dated .. We had n't seen each other in 25 years .. We started chatting and then texting . I knew he was married .. I had a boyfriend . I kept pushing him away .. And he would keep coming back .. He was willing to cheat on his wife with me . But I would n't .. This chatting and texting went on for 10 months . and we never even saw each other . I started having feelings for him and told him to stay away .. he kept coming back .. Said he had feelings for me . We exchanged several sexual texts .. Then he decided to actually call me . I did n't answer . I felt it wnt from fun to getting too serious .. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I was not a gold digging whore .. But , someone who had real feelings for someone from her past .. He was worth the Risk . To find out if he really was my soul mate . He chose to pursue me . As far as I am concerned he is the only one that has to answer to his wife .. <p> HOBO 6 years ago <p> I know a woman that has broken up 5 marriages and has targeted married men . She is a narcessist . She would be a great book for you or story . Everything she touches is messed up . tell her sad messed up story . the sad part is the other woman has kids and you did not even go into that part the wealth destruction and the family and the poisen legacy that comes with it . your story was weak at best . <p> Where to Begin/End ? 6 years ago <p> After 40 years of verbal and emotional abuse by an attorney/narcissist , I finally had the courage to divorce him . I knew there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal proof . My divorce attorney knew my ex was living with an OW and , not only did she not tell me , she did not use that fact in my divorce . He married that OW and she took my place as my grandchildren 's grandmother . He not only took my adult children and my grandchildren , he hid money we had earned together . After earning over $600,000-700,000 per year , he claimed he had no money . I now am on food stamps . He just bought a new Mercedes . My sons will not allow me to contact them . Do you really think the OW does not know this ? How can/could she go along with all this . Yes , my ex is an incredible liar but she must know what he has done to me and yet she goes along with it . Yes , I blame her almost as much as him . No I did not cheat on him . No I did not abuse my sons . I was a very supportive wife throughout his career . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the conscience of the OW ? <p> eventsyoudesign 6 years agofrom Nashville , Tennessee <p> This article spurs a lot of controversy and I like that . I believe if you do n't want to be with someone anymore you should be honest and get a divorce . I do not believe all men cheat and not all men who cheat are bad people . There is no blame when it comes to cheating , but I think a man needs to be responsible for his action first and foremost . <p> Good article . Thanks for sharing . <p> pissed mistress 6 years ago <p> Yall are all idiots . My married man came clean yesterday to his wife because his mom found out and told his wife and now 24 hrs later I am crying in bed because he does n't want to lose his family and is fighting for her . He has kids too . And his whole family hates me now but I do n't care . 2 days ago he was telling me how depressed he was and how he could n't wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who cares only about himself . Get out now or never get involved . They are ALL liars and you 'll never be happy . <p> C 5 years ago <p> Seriously ! ! ? ? ? Just once I would like an article about " the other woman " NOT to be about money , treated like a princess etc etc etc ... but a look at relationships that may be a little different from that .... nut hey ... i forgot , .. ive probably got self esteem issues ! ! ! ! <p> happyt 5 years ago <p> Wow ! I could take a thread from almost every post and say " Yup that 's me , that 's us " . I am in my mid 40 's divorced twice ( well actually not officially yet , 2 years separated to last husband ) Spent these last 2yrs trying to get a good job and financially stable , mission accomplished as of July . : ) <p> BUT , and here he comes . Last year while still in that process I got a message on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 years but seemed like a day . We started communicating and before you knew it we were in deep . I knew he was still in the same relationship he was in since/before we got together the first time ( yes it was an affair then too ) . I was one of his many flings back then , but at 25 he was the world to me . Here I am now 15 years later thinking I have " finally got my act together , am done wasting my time in bad relationships " and what do I do , fall all over ! <p> I was living in another state and was missing home terribly , he was still there , never left . <p> We started talking , chatting and getting very involved with each others lives . He was flattering and supportive . Well , 6 mos past and I vacillated and broke it off several times . Then the ultimate test , I got a job interview back home ( where he was ) , I went , saw him , got the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to motels , cheap quick sex in the car , talking , lying to friends , the whole ugly mess . He says he loves me and I 'm convinced I love him , we believe it 's " destinY ' but there are all the reasons why things ca n't change now . The worse part and why I am reading tonight is that this has started hurting not just me but my children . My preteen daughter figured out I had a " guy " before I even moved back here . I was n't secretive enough . When she confronted me recently and expressed her upset with me , she felt I was lying to her and not involving her with my life , I told her my business was my business until I felt she should be involved . Reality is I was just keeping it from her because it 's a stinkin AFFAIR ! Well now she 's approached me again and is very upset ! She says I lie to her and she ca n't trust me.It broke my heart and shook my conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being ! I have to stop this for all our sakes . I try and he just wont ' let go , her perseveres relentlessly with such honest and raw emotion . I keep thinking my case is different . I guess I should wake up and smell the coffee put on my girl panties and do the hard work , cold turkey . I do n't even trust myself to do it , let alone say I will , yet the image of my daughter crying and saying all those things , burns to my core . I have to end this .... I think I can , I think I can , I think I can .... I HAVE TO NOW ! <p> helgasusan 5 years ago <p> frankly I think you women should leave married men alone ... what gives you the right to break up a marriage ? If a married man makes advances to you , tell him no . If your making advances at a married man , your a sick person and do n't  deserve anyone ! Some of you break up families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids is unforgiveable and hopefully the same will happen to you one day and you can know what it feels like . Your nothing but SELFISH and only think of yourselves , that 's why you do it , you do n't  care about anyone elses feelings ! <p> suzanne 5 years ago <p> My advice - protect your heart . What you think could be a simple conversation with a married man could turn into love and longing like you 've never experienced . As soon as you develop feelings for this unavailable man , cut off the friendship , it takes nerves of steel , but do it . I wish I had protected my heart . I fell in love with a married man , ruined my own marriage ( instead of working to fix it , it was broken and I know it takes two , blah , blah , blah ) anyway the pain of not being with the one you want ( or think you want ) is awful and affects every part of your life , work , family , friendships . <p> Val @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the conversation and advice afterwards . I 'm the woman whose husband cheated and I confronted her as she was married as well . I asked her to look at the distruction this would cause . The affair ended and I stayed for 15 more years and ended the marriage after learning of another affair . She was young and wanted children , their affair did n't last long . I realized that it was n't about me or what I was n't doing or how I looked . I kept myself attractive and in shape . I was working full time and raising our two chidren and he felt neglected and looked elsewhere for comfort . I have two wonderful adult children and have gained the self confidence and strength to be alone if I choose . I was single for a long time and having been the wife of someone who cheated I would NEVER allow myself to stoop that low and be the OW . Where is the honor and respect for each others womanhood and marriage ? I am remarried to a wonderful man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from a married man 's advances and I agree . <p> Sighing 5 years ago <p> I guess my story is a bit different . I met my married man over 7 years ago . We were co-workers , there was an initial attraction until I saw his wedding band . I looked away . Then our job placed us in an environment that had us spending more time than normal together . Let 's call this place ... Iraq . There were sparks , mainly flirting ... a lot of curiosity on my part . I remember asking why me ... but what I meant to ask was why me to cheat with . Trust ... I do not carry myself as desparate , lonely , low self esteem . <p> Anyway , we ended what did n't really start as I distanced myself from the situation due to lack of interest in this type of relationship . <p> Fast forward years later or jobs brought us back together in the same environment . He initiated the contact again , this time , I am older ( 40 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be honest , I do n't  have the time to look for new relationships and I am bored ... and there he is . Unlike many of these women , I do n't  want him as a future spouse . I am intrigued by him . He is very interesting and I enjoy studying him as a person . No tears , no lasting desires ... <p> Not every OW is looking for a relationship ... just saying . Now , I was not raised to be like this ... just over time I have realized that life is too short to miss out on experiences . Have I had sex yet ? No , just sexual acts .. which I am fine if it stays that way . I do n't  want gifts from him as then it would be like ... a relationship . <p> Melissa 5 years ago <p> I think the other women on posting on this site are deluding themselves . First of all , the married man is at fault 100% . But the other woman is also at fault . Married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  care what the man says , or does , he is married . if they are going through a divorce , then wait till its final . If he is having marital issues then he needs to work those out . But as a woman if you get involved with a married man you deserve all the heartache you get ! ! You go into that with your eyes wide open . You know he has commitments . I was a wife , and yes on some level i knew what was going on , but did not want to believe it . When i found out i gave him the choice , leave and be with her . I would not keep his kids from him , and i would make it as easy as i could , after all , i was married at that point for over 20 years , and by keeping the kids away from him , or making it ugly i was not hurting anyone but the kids . If he was no longer in love with me , then why make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other woman could not accept that . and has chosen to try to make our lives miserable . But all she has done is strengthen my marriage , and made him see what kind of person she really is . So the man is at fault , and so is the other woman , the only person in that trinagle that is completely innocent , is the wife , she did not break her vows . He did , and he could not break his vows if there were not women out there to let them . So other women , respect yourself enough to know that 99% of the time , you are just a thing , a fling and it will end , and not well . they will either go back to their wives and fix what was broken or they will leave their wives , but not for you . My husband told the other woman it was over , and that even if the marriage was over he would not leave me for her . <p> Mishy 5 years ago <p> I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to me . What I love about this arrangement is the freedom I get , there 's no real commitment . I get only the best side of him . I do n't have to wash his clothes , feed him , hear him complain and etc .... I do n't nag him or act needy in anyway . I offer him the life he use to have with his wife . To be honest , it does n't bother me one bit that he 's married . In recent studies , more and more women have decided to be the other woman . After all most men cheat . I was cheated on 3 times during my last relationship with my kids father . I met my MB at my job , airline industry . He 's a frequent flyer . It 's been one year since we met . Our chemistry is amazing ! ! ! Our sexual connection is even more amazing ! ! ! I have no intentions of letting him go . I do n't want him to leave his wife . I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he is unable to get away from his wife , I do n't flip out or get emotionally f up . I simply rap it up , and go to plan B. A true mistress is independent and always knows her married boyfriend ca n't always fullfill his promises . Always remember , he has a mistress not only for emotionally or sexually purposes , but to get away from his so familiar stressful lifestyle . I 'm I doing something wrong by dating a married man ? Of course I am . There is no right about this , however , it 's a choice . I chose this lifestyle . I am content with it . I do n't want a live in boyfriend , been there done it ! Do n't want it ! My MB is the best thing that 's happened to me . I 've told him not to leave his wife or he will lose me . I know there will be alot if negative comments followed by this . However , before you judge , especially if you are the wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful tip to why your husband is cheating on you . <p> watergirl 5 years ago <p> I think most posters on here would be shocked at how many Ow are formally betrayed spouses . So the OW already knows what it is like . <p> The reasons men cheat are just as varied as the women they cheat with . <p> and yes , some do come from perfectly healthy marriages . It is n't about the marriage , it is about the man . <p> But I have also seen men stray because their wives gain 200 lbs and do n't have sex with them anymore , for years even . So basically the wife abandoned the marriage first . Funny how cheating seems to be the only sin in these situations . <p> When you are no longer talking and no longer having sex , then the marriage ends . it is then just a contract on paper . <p> One of the hardest things that betrayed spouses have to accept is their decline in the marriage . <p> Cheating is the symptom honies , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came along . <p> Mishy 5 years ago <p> Watergirl , well said ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Sooo true ! ! ! ! <p> ThinkingDN 5 years ago <p> I too am the other woman . I met my married man at a training program of our company . It was sexual from the very beginning . He was very overt . I was very lonely and responded . Though I am married &amp; in my forties with one marriage behind me , I can safely say that it was the first time that I experienced how it should be between a man &amp; a woman . Sex with this man , 6 years younger , was such that it connected me to him mind , body &amp; soul . He felt the same too . It was as if we were only meant to be with each other and life like a cruel joke let us meet only when it was too late . What started as a casual crush turned into an emotional bonding &amp; attachment deep enough to give us undescribable pain . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I to my husband and 2 kids . <p> I tried making a complete break several times but he would not let me , saying he needed me desperately . Since we are very long distance and there 's not much opportunity for meeting often , he wanted to keep it as a platonic friendship . We also fought too often because of the frustation due to the physical separation . But he wants me to be in his life in forever . For me its too painful to have him in any other way than as a lover because I feel he 's mine body &amp; soul . I love him madly . He 's my soul mate , my husband , and I wo n't except him in any other form . If I have to leave him as a lover , I have to make a clean break . <p> I have broken off with him as of now . I threatened to call his wife if he calls or texts one more time . If he really cares for his wife , he wo n't call again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes back to me ..... <p> tonya 5 years ago <p> The other woman knew just what she was getting into . She 's just a whore and deserves whatever comes her way ! <p> ThinkingDN 5 years ago <p> Hey ! Please do n't  be too judgemental.These are also human relationships . And that too of love ... not hate . Most of the times they are not stepped into intentionally or created . They happen . <p> And please pity the other woman .. Its usually she who loves the man who more often than not just uses her to add a spark to his pathetic life but does not have the guts to stand by his actions if the need arose . <p> Yes .. for her actions , she does get what she deserves does n't she ? She does get used . She does get dumped and she does get the much deserved hearbreak does n't she ? Whatever the personal situation in which she fell for the married man . <p> scrumptioussuze 5 years ago <p> I am just ending my relationship with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we first met , the chemistry attraction became too strong and he provided missing piece in my life . For the first time ever , I had someone help me financially and as a struggling lone parent with no family support it made a big difference to my life . <p> I am going to be strong and finish it , I am determined , have told him not to contact me as that 's the only way to stop contact . A lot of what i read on the posts is we are going to break up the marriage , that is not always the case , i have children myself and i have not in any way wanted him to break up . I think the men are in fault , they are seifish , they want their egos rubbed by having 2 woman . <p> Any way , we have argued and he is hot and then cold , i started thinking he was cheating on me as i became i 'll and definitely was not all glammed up when he saw me . He would forget to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold the next , we never went out as he said his business was n't doing to well . I could n't introduce him to my friends as i was too embarassed , i did n't want to be seen with him as he was n't my man . <p> Every ones ecperiences are different but I would say do n't  do it , you can not make plans , go on holidays , you get dropped whenever he has family ties . What is the point ? I will never get involved with a married man . I started to resent him having 2 women and he had the audacity to tell me I was n't allowed a partner when i 'm single . <p> At first , he treated me to jobs round my home , take outs , meals out . Now , i get nothing as he says he s struggling . Think , they are cheating on their wives to be with you , when they tire of you or you get demanding , what makes you think they wo n't cheat on you . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't let them . If they are serious about you they will do the right thing and divorce before any relationship with you . <p> A married man can never give you what you need , he is only half a man . Get some respect and build up your self esteem . It really hurts to have sex with a man and he leaves to go home to his wife . Do you want that ? <p> I have decided I am taking time out and am going to socialise with friends . I certainly will never date a married man , I deserve more . <p> Finally , some men lie and say they are single when they are married , so it is not ALWAYS the other woman 's fault ! <p> Done 5 years ago <p> My Name is Done.I never believed in Love Spells or Magics until I met this special spell caster once when i went to Africa to Execute some business .. He is really powerful.The woman i wanted to marry left me 2 weeks to our weeding ceremony and my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i really love her so much .. she left me for another man with no reason .. when i called her she never picked up my calls and she do n't  want to see me around herso , when i told the man what happened.he helped me to do some readings , and after the readings he made me to realize that the other man has done some spells over my wife and that is the reason why she left me .. he told me he will help me to cast a spell that bring her back.At first i was skeptical but i just gave it a tryIn 5 days , she called me herself and came to me apologizing .. I cant believe she can ever come back to me again but now i am happy shes back and we are married now with lovely kid and we live as a happy family .. Am posting this to the forum incise anyone needs the man.His email address is ayelalashrine@gmail.com <p> sarah willis 5 years ago <p> Thanks to everyone who has posted on here . I an an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . This was until I received an annoymous letter ( later it became known it was from the OW herself acting to be a concerned friend ) revealing the affair of six months . I am now at the point where I realise the OW did me a favor . If it was n't her , my husband would have found someone else to cheat with , and I may never have found out . Still the OW has to live with the fact she is the type of person that will sleep with a married man . And that 's not cool . And I have to say in this case she was a " dumbarse " too as he obviously fed her the line " my wife and i are n't happy , we are n't sleeping together etc " when in fact he was playing happy families and happy married man with me . Finally though , despite it all I do n't believe all men are cheaters , not all wifes are dumbarses and not all OW are cold hearted - just human . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it finally comes out that shows your true character . PEACE . <p> Jalina Passtora 5 years ago <p> I am the " other woman " to 2 men currently . One of the men I have no sexual relationship with . He wants his wife to ask him for the divorce AND he says he wants to leave with his head held high . He thinks he is not cheating ... I think he is . The second man I have great sex appeal with ... it is a guy I would n't imagine I would be with in a million years , but things happen , and we happened . I started going to counseling , because I do n't understand why I attract married men or why I am OK with it . I think I know the answer ... at least the answer for me . I was in a terrible marriage with an addict ... not only did he cheat on me with drugs/alcohol , but he then cheated on me with another woman . I was numb to the cheating as I knew inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emails , texts , hurts NO matter what . I am a single mom of 2 young kids . I seem to have it together and I seem to me a strong and independent young woman . I think with married men I have no commitment and I do n't have to introduce my kids to them and risk all the hurt again . I just do n't understand how someone ( me ) that was so adamently against cheating can do it so naturally and without a care in the world ... who am I ? What have I begun . Recently , one of the wives found out ( the one I am sexually involved with ) . I have now avoided all texts/calls from the married man as there is too much baggage now . Unlike some of the " other woman " I honestly want no relationship with either one of these men . I just want the emotional and sexual satisfaction that fits my lifestyle . It 's wrong , I know it ... but it works . Hopefully one day I will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... especially for the sake of my children . Let 's not forget although the other woman makes a critical choice ... she really is only thinking about her needs ( as is the attached man ) . Everyone needs to be happy but there is a right way about going about it .... I wish I could follow my own advice : ( <p> GypsyJ 5 years ago <p> The ' Other Woman " is not always as many wives imagine . I have been the other woman for over 31 years . Yes , over 31 years . <p> But , not everything in life is black and white . <p> I was married once , and my husband cheated . I NEVER , and would never have blamed another woman for a man 's behaviour . I think most wives would rather blame the other woman , because it is easier to do , than to have a real hard look at their marriage , on all levels . <p> Only as I have gotten older have I finally accepted that men are so different from women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage , how many of us think that because we have that ring , we " OWN " this man ! <p> There is the saying about men and women : <p> " When men marry , they think their wife will never change , and when women marry , they ca n't wait to start changing their man " . <p> Men think their wife will always be young , pretty , and desirable . Women think thet will be able to change a man to be their 's completely . Both men and women are wrong . Women lose their beauty , some faster than others . Men may change on the surface , at least for a while . But sooner or later , their old " self " reappears ! <p> We try to control him , we nag him , we embarrass him . Our children become our main focus . We neglect to at least try to stay pretty and attractive . After all , let 's not pretend ladies , men are visual creatures , whether we believe it or not , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard cold fact . That 's how they were created . How " God " made them . It is difficult to cope with as the years roll by , as we women get older , and we struggle to stay attractive to men . <p> Gypsyj 5 years ago <p> ( I accidentaly ended my previous comment , before completely finishing . I will now continue . ) <p> To continue , I was trying to say that we women have a hard time , after marriage , especially as men are so different . They " compartmentalize " many aspects of life , and it is not really their fault . How could it be ? Statistically , most men do . <p> They see the whole world as their love , while women see their man and family as their whole life . Very , very few people are lucky to find that special " Soulmate " we are all looking for . Some married couples can stay together , even in a sexless marriage , because they value other aspects of their relationship more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some men seek an emotional connection , when it is absent at home . <p> The sad truth is that when a man is no longer physically attracted to his wife , for whatever reason , and if there is no emotional connection , he can easily stray . <p> Women stay with their man , no matter if he has a pot belly , or is bald etc .. Mostly , anyway . <p> So , who is this " Other Woman " ? <p> I started by saying that I have been the other woman for 31 years . <p> We had been together for 2 years , when she met him at a function , which I had not attended . This was on an Island . We were both in the middle of our respective divorces , and living abroad , on this Island , working in the same Company . We were from different Continents . We were soon to be married , when our divorces were finalised . She came into his life , with her fame and fortune . A multi millionare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew I was very much in love with him . <p> His wife does not know about me . She was too wealthy and famous to know , or be interested if any other woman existed . <p> It is hard to believe we still stayed in a relationship all these years . We have now lived on different Continents all this time , but have met up very often , in different countries , all these years . <p> I found out soon after they met that something must have been missing in his new relationship . <p> He seemed to have found out soon after they met that she was not a " warm " person .. she was " cold " in bed . <p> She is a nice person , spends all her time doing Charity work , attending Galas etc .. I truly believes he loves her , but as a great friend or companion . I could tell , after all these years , when we are together , that he sometimes just wants to someone to hold close . Many times it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conclusion , our relationship is very much an emotional connection for him . <p> Why have I continued seeing him , all these years ? <p> Because I love him . I do n't know why . How do you explain it ? <p> Many marriages end , and many times it has nothing to do with " another woman " . <p> I am tired of all the " Cliches " : <p> " find yourself your own man " <p> " you are worth more that that " <p> " you should think of the wife " <p> " have you no decency " <p> " you have no morals " <p> and all the rest of all the moral , judgemental tirades . <p> I do not know how much longer we will continue seeing each other . <p> However , I guess I am trying to say that LIFE HAPPENS ! ! <p> It just does . Human behaviour is hard to explain . <p> Just think about it ... How difficult it is for us to control our own behaviour .. How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop procastinating , when to finish this or that project .. etc etc . <p> So , why do we think we can control , or judge others . <p> in the end , we ca n't . <p> Stop blaming the other woman . <p> catskillwoman 5 years ago <p> This article did not fairly describe the other woman 's point of view . I was an " other woman " and no gold-digger . We loved each other , and if his wife had been more mentally stable he would have left her . He got to the point of moving out and getting his own apartment , but felt so guilty he left me and went back to her . Is he happy now ? No , I made him a lot happier - but she needed him more than I did , so I 'm glad he went back to her . But please , let 's remember that marriage is a two-way street , and both sides must make compromises in order for it to work . Not every cheater is a scumbag ; some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband bears some of the responsibility . My guy married too young , realized his mistake soon , but by then she was pregnant with their first child . He stuck with her till the kids were grown and out of the house . She knew he was unhappy but ( aside from the mental instability that she could not help ) did not try to compromise . She hated sex but never went for therapy about it . My lover had an unusually strong sex drive and was very sensual - and therefore very frustrated , and had been for decades . We also connected on a mental and emotional level that he did not with his wife . We did leisure activities together ; they did not , because she did not want to . I know how supportive he was of her , but she did not give him equal support . Was he wrong to cheat ? Should he have left before finding another woman to be with ? Maybe . He was too scared of being alone to do so . Was I wrong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that she did n't even try to make compromises to make him a little happier , so I figure she gave up her right to him . Sometimes the cheated-upon husbands and wives need to look at themselves and ask , did I contribute to making this happen ? Sometimes the answer is yes . I know another situation where the wife did that , and realized that she had contributed by becoming brain-dead once her children were born . She remade herself , for her own sake . Her husband now blesses her for being kind enough to take him back , and she 's a lot happier with herself too . <p> Jalina Passtora 5 years ago <p> I completely agree with you catskillwoman . There is ALWAYS a reason people cheat ... when I was in my marriage I cheated for 3 years . My husband is now my ex-husband and to this day he has no idea . If I did n't cheat I would have been MISERABLE . On paper it looked so wrong to cheat , but my husband cheated on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inevitable ... after 6 months of flirtation I crossed over to the dark-side . The man I cheated with was also married . I never expected him to leave his wife for me and he never expected me to leave my husband for him . We had an understand and a respect for each other and it worked VERY well . I never felt guilt or shame ... I saw it as a necessary evil . Eventually my husband cheated on me . Our marriage was ending by that time and I actually understood why he cheated ... I did not give him what he needed in the marriage just as he had n't given me what I needed . To this day he thinks we are divorced because he cheated on me ... hahaha ... if he only knew ! <p> Honestly ... I know it seems awful , but if the cheater and " other woman " are on the same page and have an understanding ... no one will get hurt , because no one will find out . It is not the greatest way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . <p> Like I said in my last post ... I was the other woman for a man whose wife found out . I have had not had contact since then ... at this time it would not have the benefits that I looked for . He got caught , people got hurt , and that is n't my problem . <p> People cheat for a reason and typically the person that is being cheated on has a lot to do with it ... marriages do n't work if BOTH people do n't want to work on it ... eventually someone will cross over to the dark-side sometimes though it is just a matter of who does it first . <p> Not all guys cheat on their wife/girlfriend because they are having problems , but simply because they are f***ing stupid . <p> Simple , and yet , one of the most difficult subjects . In the end , the other woman are just rebound girls that get used . Rot . <p> Yasmina2012 5 years ago <p> It is always sad to see how so many women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I assume these are women who are so insecure with themselves , and afraid that their " man " is cheating , or has already cheated .. or will cheat .. that they will lash out hatefully at the " other woman " , as a way of dealing with their own fear and insecurity and lack of self-esteem . Where does it say , or written that the other woman is supposed to look out for you , or made promises to you ? It is always sad if a family is broken up , or hurt in any way , because of a man 's infildelity , especially if young children are in the picture . But , that does not mean that it is the other woman 's fault . Look , you insecure women , if it is not another woman , it can be pornography , strip clubs , prostitutes , etc etc . If a man wants to " cheat " , he WILL ! ! ! Whatever his reason is . <p> From the begining of time , this has been the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shock if they really knew what their man really does , or wants to do .. All women hope that their man will be faithful , but , the idea of monogamy is man-made .. and very difficult for men to abide by ... So , you women out there , who hate the " other woman " can only hope to find a man who can live by , and keep his vows to you ! ! Unlikely .. but .. keep hoping .. <p> Francie 5 years ago <p> I am the wife and to be honest I have no intentions of ever meeting the other woman . He lives with her now and I hold both accountable . Whether she knew it or not when they met she knew it eventually and still chose to have him stay in her home . I do n't wish her harm and I certainly would help her if she were on the side of the road but it ends at that . I am in a great deal of pain over this and one of the previous post is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are self centered , self oriented and selfish . They do not live in a glass bubble and other peoples feelings are involved . I loved my husband beyond measure and stood by him through more than I care to share and I look at her and think if this man can throw his marriage away like yesterdays garbage after his wife stood by his side through prison drugs and alcohol for 8 years then what will he do to her ? There is nothing I can do for her and she will reap what she sows but so will he . I love him but at what point do you just let go and hold your head up and keep moving forward . I never let myself go , always strive to grow and be a better person and I really was a good wife ( according to many around us so this is n't me patting myself on the back ) . All I know is we do n't control others and though I am heart broken now I trust God to be my defense and to heal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago <p> Women are always asking " Why do men cheat ? " . Or , Why did my man/husband/boyfriend .. cheat ? After all we had together/ after all I did for him/ after all I put up with etc ! My husband cheated with women from his office , women I knew and socialized with . I never let these women know I knew . I blamed only him , for putting me in that embarassing and humiliating position . For not loving and caring enough for me to have respect for me . He did what HE wanted to do . So , one day , I told him that I had had enough , and that I was leaving . And I left after 7 years of marriage . The fact that we did not have any children made it easier for me , than those women with kids , who have faced infidelity . <p> In the end , I have realised that this life is just a journey and we can only , at best , try to control our own behaviour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that any man " owes " us fidelity , till death do us part . That notion is just a fantasy which becomes a reality for very few people . <p> In the end , we just have to be realistic . Many many times , men show us exactly who they are . We just wish to believe otherwise , or think we can change them . <p> We have never been able to do that , and we never will . <p> Lilian 5 years ago <p> This is the best article I have read in a long while , I am a women living with the pain of my husbands infidelity which i discovered one month ago , it hurts badly and I feel like walking away but do n't have the resources to , ca n't stand looking at him , all I see is the betrayal , deceit and lies . I pray for the anger and hurt I feel to go away . <p> scoop61 5 years ago <p> Let 's remember ladies that while we are mad at the other woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the man who decided to make a choice and go outside the marriage . Regardless , so many people get hurt in these situations including , often time , the children . This is one of the saddest realities . Most women who are married to a man who is cheating often times suspect this , know this and may even confront him to no avail . Respect yourselves women , set your boundaries and do what you need to do to have a fulfilling life . YOu may think you ca n't leave a relationship that you had with someone so deceitful , but YOU can and you do n't have to have the resources ( i.e .. finances ) in order to do it . Have faith in yourself and in a greater being because I have done this and I am proof that there are brighter days to come ... <p> AnotherOtherWoman 5 years ago <p> I chose to start a relationship with a married man - for many of the reasons listed - it was love at first sight , etc . Ultimately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . He always said he would never leave her - I never even asked him to . But as I finally became able to read the handwriting on the wall , I decided that ending it was best for both of us . I sent her the infamous anonymous letter . And it felt SO . DAMNED . GOOD . <p> Juniper 5 years ago <p> My story is unusual . I 've been faithful to my husband of 11 years . I was a little flirty toward flirty people in my early 20 's , for a couple months . About that same time , I was raped by a guy w/ gf , and strung along once or twice ( long story ) til I had the guts to say no/stay away . I also gave a bj to a guy w/ gf once . And I fooled around w/ a married girlfriend ( lesbian sex ) once . Finally , my first encounter was fooling around ( no sex ) w/ a guy who was separated and they were both seeing others/lived apart ( I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by married and taken men quite a few times and I turned them all down . <p> I judge noone and love all . I completely understand how affairs can happen and I believe it 's part of being human . I do n't appreciate people who intentionally hurt others , though . I also do n't appreciate women who hate the OW and do n't seem intelligent/strong enough to look at the bigger picture nor are they willing to see how men AND women are only human and can be prone to powerful hormones and other forces/desires/etc . <p> I quickly got over my brief past ( I also dated quite a few single men before/during and after my brief learning experiences ) and developed rock solid boundaries . I also saved myself for my husband for 2 years prior to marriage . I 'm very committed to never cheating and never being involved with anyone taken , for multiple reasons . I 'm very proud of who I 've become and do n't hate myself one iota for my past . It made me the stronger person I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also have a problem with severe obsessive thinking . I tend to develop guilt complexes for no reason , all in the name of fearing rejection from others . I 've never been one to have many female friends . I am shy , sweet , open , honest , smart , and logical . I have a different mindset than most women I know . I 'm not a **41;7955;TOOLONG type at all . I have 2 kids . <p> When we moved to a new state 7 years ago ( AZ to OR ) , a catty neighbor rudely dug for dirt on me , i blushed and she spread false rumors . I tried to defend myself by explaining my small past but quickly learned that women are CRUEL . They are simply cruel . They will judge you and hate you over hearsay , over something small that 's none of their business ( something from 15 years ago ) . I do n't know if Oregon women are worse than others , but I do know that Oregon is a very moral place ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my goodness because all the other moms here have turned against me and act like I should be stoned to death for my small , unintentional past 15 years ago . <p> I never said i was perfect . I never expect anyone to be . The unwritten rules women set are unattainable for everyone . I consider myself to be a damn good moral person . That 's why I never was with a married man nor willingly had sex w/ a taken guy . But even if I had or was , I would NEVER consider myself less of a human being or eternally unforgiveable or worthy of eternal ostracization and cruelty . I really do n't like women . Are there any human , kind women in Oregon ? Or in the world for that matter ? <p> J 5 years ago <p> Would n't it just be amazing if all the woman of the world actually stopped being the OW and wives just left unfaithful husbands ? Men might take note ! <p> I can hope woman will realize that they deserve more . Hey we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pain and devastation for all involved is horrendous and as humans we should not knowingly hurt another . <p> James 5 years ago <p> Happy Relationships are NOT about compromise although much of what 's been mentioned is generally correct about the reasons for either men or women to cheat . Every body says compromise is what makes a relationship work and yet so many relationships fall apart anyhow and what do the angry individuals say when it falls apart ? " I sacrificed everything for you " blah blah , the compromise idea is what leads to the breakdown in a relationship , it 's philosophically flawed and I 'd go as far to say it 's a feature of the relationship cycle . Compromise is not the word u are looking for , I know many many people who get into relationships purely because of how hot the other person looks . after a long enough period of time one of the two ppl relises they either have nothing in common ( which is the start of where your compromise idea comes from ) . Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its just led to misery . shes tried doing things , going places with me that I 'm interested in that she clearly is n't and those days out sucked because deep down I knew she was n't into it and the same goes for when I tried pleasing her . The truth is , human beings are freaking control freaks end of story and it 's because we ca n't respect each others freedom to seek our own private personal happiness that love always dies eventually . u can snap back at me if u want but I 've lived selflessly for 12 years and the resentment and hatred I feel is killing my spirit , the right thing I suppose would to be for me to leave but then I would probably loose my daughter who I wanted to raise in a stable happy family . U want to know why men lie , cheat ? And continue to lie and cheat ? Yes some are purely whim worshippers who do n't even think but I tried to be the " ideal " boyfriend all through this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in frustration . I now have massive social anxiety because I ca n't be me . It 's funny that when I entered my 1st relationship I actually rationalized ( even in the early blissfull days ) that the chances of this relationship lasting were incredibly slim but I would respect my partners need to find what makes her happy . Her jelousy crippled me and yet when she attempted to make me jelous by falsely claiming she had slept with someone I actually did not display any feelings of jelousy or hate and that made her more angry , infact part of me was turned on even . I think it 's all one big cruel joke to be honest , I mean come on , did you know the number 1 fantasy for both men &amp; women is a threesome ? That 's right someone else outside the official partnership getting involved . the human race is an insecure , oppressive bunch of hypocrites who never can see beyond the fucking moment . do your research on the origins of marriage and you 'll discover it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights than women , including the right to have as many partners ( or a limited number of partners ) while they were demonized for doing the same . When marriage became strictly limited to the persons with in the official partnership the trick back fired on men who can not express or describe what they feel in their ball &amp; chain bondage because morality says if they desire anyone else they are guilty as charged . it 's not primarilly about sex either , people change .... Peoples interests etc , and human beings ' minds do not neccasarily develop together with the same interest . I 've been attracted to girls outside the official partnership who I 've shared mutual interests with ( not primarilly sexual ) and I 'm always made to feel guilty or anxiety later on because I 'm suppose to petend I only have eyes for one individual . U know what our idea of love is about ? It 's about giving another human being a monopoly ownership over your mind , emotions etc and like wise you have the same monopoly privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but sadly most ppl simply break up and repeat the cycle again with out thinking too much about it . Ask yourself , if you could be immortal , if you could never die , would u be able to stay sane , stuck with another soul for ever and ever , that you must feel nothing for anyone else ! ? Bullshit . I believe families are workable that even marriage can be workable but not by the oppressive conventional means that are ridiculous . Love is about self interest , not selflessness . " for better or worse till death do us part ? " that 's the code of an abused woman ( or man ) in a relationship who Dosnt have the strength to say no more . <p> I 've been both--ow and the wife . I was unaware I was the ow the first time . Did n't find out until I got knocked up . He did n't leave his wife for me . I thought this was my boyfriend . I was so caught up with this man I wanted God to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I realized later it would n't make my life better to want to marry a cheater . They divorced and now he 's alone . I ended up in a fwb relationship to find out this one was taken , too ! They were separated but got back together while I was still seeing him . After 2 1/2 years of emotional toture and embarassment on myself and for allowing myself to wreck a home , I called it off . We are friends since we worked together but has not had any sexual encounters since I got engaged with my husband . Now after one year of being married to my husband , we are separated . He been sexting with a coworker . Now I am getting back what I did to someone else 's wife . It happened so sudden I did n't see it coming . I cared that I was hurting someone marriage . I just let my feelings get in the way . Now I am crazy crying to God praying for the return of my husband whom I love dearly . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . <p> Poolgirl 5 years ago <p> The other woman is nothing but a whore or unpaid prostitute . <p> I also think you catskillwoman are delusional believing he is unhappy with his wife . He made the selfish step to cheat so do you think he is making an " unselfish " decision to stay with her . He probably came to the realization one day he is going to be old and the memories he wants are real ones family not sneaking around with a whore . <p> Because that is the whole relationship with the other woman ... hiding hoping no one sees . <p> And the comment about wife does n't like sex is hysterical . I 'm sure he is going back to his wife and a sexless marriage ! <p> Other women if you are so wonderful why are n't you his " wife " <p> Face reality other women you are nothing but a whore I feel very sorry for you <p> A woman 5 years ago <p> WOW ! How some women love to call the " other woman " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women must have been so hurt by a cheating husband . They need to lash out and they have to resort to name calling ! How sad ! <p> They should vent their anger at the MAN ! Not the other woman . They are so afraid of the truth , that they have a failed relationship . That their " man " did not love/respect/care for them enough to stay faithful . It is so easy to vent anger at the other woman ! These women somehow believe that all other women owe them something . Just SAD ! ! ! <p> Poolgirl 5 years ago <p> 1 . The man is at fault 100% he made a vow to his wife <p> 2 . The woman he is cheating with is never to be revealed that makes her a whore he has on the side ( just like any other bad action is hidden drugs etc ) <p> 3 . If a man does n't want to be married to his wife there is something called divorce so he is free to " date " anyone and leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man really loved this OW he would leave his wife no matter what A man or woman that cheats thinks only of them self therefore they would think nothing of leaving if they really wanted to leave <p> heather 5 years ago <p> My names is heather from Australia , the reason i am writing this testimony is because i made a promised that who so ever help me out of my shit and predicament deserves to be known by the world . Am 24 years of age my boyfriend left me some months ago that am a piece of old cargo that there is nothing on earth that can bring our paths together as long as he breaths . i felt really bad because i loved him so dearly ' one day i came across some testimonies of this priest called Lord kalifat so i decided to give him a chance . but when he told me things so personal which i knew was so secret that was only known to me then i gave him a chance out of my doubting spirit but to my greatest surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sorry for all the pains he has made me pass through . presently our love is more than that of romeo and Juliet lol. he takes good care of me now 100% than before . <p> thank you so much Lord kalifat , here is the email address that turn my pains , sadness and sorrow into joy : lordkalifat@gmail.com <p> from heather Australia <p> Levertis Steele 5 years agofrom Southern Clime <p> Sadly , experience sometimes is the only teacher when careless people insist on thinking with certain body parts . Once many years ago while I was yet single , an old married man asked me to be his girlfriend . He said that he loved and respected his wife who was bedridden , but he had lots of money and only wanted to see me twice a week . I told him that I could not stoop to the level of adultry and such a relationship , even if he were young . That was not good enough for me . I thanked God for helping me to listen to the echoes of my mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are submitting to a form of sex slavery . The money and other rewards blurr their vision and make them believe that they mean love . To begin with , if a married man truly loved the other woman , he would tearfully walk away the way the good men do in the decent romance books . Sometimes , true love means letting go when it is the best alternative . Holding on to fire has often resulted in tragedy for many cheating husbands , wives , and the other women . Many times men 's mistresses and wives ' boyfriends have killed their lovers ' spouses in order to pave a way to marriage to them . When it is discovered , it is too late for the cheaters to break off the affair . Even sadder , many cheaters are married to their chosen and may never know that the second spouse killed the first who was probably the cheater 's preferred . Cold cases are real . When we view a TV program titles , " I Married My Husband 's Killer , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some obsessed people do not have limits . <p> Levertis Steele 5 years agofrom Southern Clime <p> The other woman may not realize that the money and gifts she gets from the cheater is payment for her services . So , she is not only a sex slave , but also a private prostitute . She also does not know that she is a cheater , too . She cheats another woman just like the husband does . She cheats his children , if he has young ones , especially . What should be important to her is that she cheats herself drastically . She can be a better woman than that because she is worth more than the status of " the other woman " or " mistress " . No matter how the media glamorizes that status , it is shameful in the eyes of decency and righteousness . Once a woman gets the reputation of mistress , she receives a label and is distrusted by many single and married women , even her female relatives . Her upstanding girlfriends start drifting away , and she ends up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a wealthy cheating man as a candy man and often use him for that purpose . Most rich cheaters think that they are in the driver 's seat , but that is not always true with the cunning , experienced women of the world . When these men discover that they have been suckers , they often try to scandalize , beat , and in some cased , kill the women . Their egos get very bruised when they discover that they have been taken for a ride . Some relent , and just walk away without trying to get revenge . Still , some lick their wounds , stay in their cages for a while , and soon go back on the prowl . This type loves the hunt even if it means losing . Sadly to say , this is the prime target for a candy man . <p> If I were simple enough to cheat , and if the man was rich , I would not settle for less than riches for myself . I would also have as much fun as possible before my fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool . <p> J-2012 5 years ago <p> We women are so judgemental towards other women ! We think we know how they feel , and why they do what they do . We feel they should feel and see the world in exactly the way that we do . We think they should share our morals , religion and other values . We feel that it is their duty to know that our man is off limits , and under no circumstances should this " other " woman become involved with our man . After all , he is MINE ! ! How unrealistic ! <p> This is especially true in the way we see the " Other Woman " . <p> There are so many " types " ( for want of a better word ) of " other women " . <p> A woman can become " The Other Woman " for so many different reasons . Some are despicable , but others are just being human ! That 's right , Ladies . There are many decent , normal , loving women who are " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing all these women as whores , sluts , Jezebels etc . <p> They are not responsible for your man 's actions . And , no one ever died and left them responsible for your happiness . <p> Poolgirl 5 years ago <p> These posts are really sad <p> On one hand you have a woman who married the man she loved . They both made promises to each other No one held a gun to either ones head no matter what their age One day he breaks the promise and cheats . <p> There is no excuse for cheating . One should go to their spouse first to work things out or ask for a divorce . <p> On the other hand there is the Other woman who wants to find love and for whatever reason ( has to be somewhat desperate or low self esteem ) finds a married man attractive enough to carry out an affair For whatever reason she seems to think its ok. as some OW posted " she lost her right to him " <p> Or " she did n't like leisure activities " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work with the care of the children since hubby was busy having affair ) or " she did n't look good enough " hmm how many gorgeous women have been cheated on ? I especially like the post " she did n't like sex " . I have never met a woman who does n't like sex ! Whatever eases the conscience <p> The man has created a total mess for his family with all of his lies . He really is a scumbag not worthy of his wife 's love the truly injured party here is the wife <p> In the end if he goes to the OW all she gets is a man who cheats on his wife . If he stays with the wife all she gets is a man who cheated on her . <p> Both women have lost but the wife in my opinion did n't take part in any of it and she is forever punished <p> Very sad ! <p> OW back off ! <p> Men resect your vows or leave before you cheat <p> Jasmine 5 years ago <p> LIFE sucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There will always be pain , in some form or another . Life just happens <p> When a marriage is in trouble , yes , as in all marriages , when there are are problems , many suffer . But , is that any different than when children are part of a family that has other issues , as most do . I think not . <p> Men and women marry for so many different reasons . Young love is very romantic , full of unrealistic ideals . Life happens , CHANGE IS THE LAW OF LIFE ! People change . There will always be pain . Many women would rather stay with a cheating husband , than live alone . Many women , like the OW , would rather have a small part of a man , if she loves him , than nothing at all . <p> Live and let live . Look at yourself . Are you perfect ? No one is . Not everyone have the same values or religion . Everyone has to make the decision that is right for herself . Life is full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are all searching for happiness . <p> For those of you with high moral values , and religion , seek your comfort there . <p> catskillwoman 5 years ago <p> " One should go to their spouse first to work things out or ask for a divorce . " He tried both . She would not see a marriage counselor and she would not give him a divorce . <p> " the Other woman who wants to find love and for whatever reason ( has to be somewhat desperate or low self esteem ) finds a married man attractive enough to carry out an affair " Actually , I think I 'm pretty cool . I was attracted because I 'd never been nearly as compatible with any other man . <p> " she lost her right to him " Marriage is a partnership . When one member of a partnership defaults , that person loses their partnership rights . The other should be able to get out of it . He could n't . <p> For the first THIRTY-FIVE years of his marriage he did not cheat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sports teams , did most of the cooking and some of the housework . <p> " ' he did n't like sex ' . I have never met a woman who does n't like sex ! " OK , what would you call it when she refused to have intercourse more than once per week , always did it in the dark , with her eyes squeezed tight , and when they were done ran immediately to the bathroom to wash ? She never touched him below the neck , not with her mouth nor with her hands . The woman would have been happier as a nun , as she admitted , but once she was married , that was no longer possible . <p> Poolgirl 5 years ago <p> Poor Guy ! ! It must be tough no sex no touching no cooking and no divorce ! He certainly has portrayed his life as a victim of abuse ! <p> He can walk away unless she has him tied down <p> I think if I were you I would try to verify this terrible life he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most married men say they are not getting sex and that no one cares about them . They need to get your sympathy <p> If you are as cool as you say I would stay very far away from a man like this .

The plan was the after graduating we would get married and we were madly in love . <p> Anyhow , my now ex is indian and was taken abroad 18 months ago and whilst there forced into a marriage - his dad was dying and he was also beaten ( confirmed by our friends ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten married . He contacted me 6 months later saying he had been forced and I told him I forgave him etc. he said that he was getting divorced as he had n't gone near the wife and stayed true to me - I told him that if he felt she was someone he could like he should at least try , but if not then he needed to get out of there fast - he told me he HAD , and whether I would consider marrying him . <p> I agreed - I was so happy ! The plan then was to wait a few years till his divorce became old news in his community before reintroducing me and I understood this and the need for keeping it quiet . <p> A month ago , 5 days before our 10th anniversary I rang him only to have a girl answer with you b**** - confused , I asked who she was and why she was shouting at me - she was his wife who he had NOT divorced , who had a BABY with , and who was calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I deserve all the hate I can get . Can I just say though had I known for one second he had stayed married and was happy I 'd not have gone near him despite the fact that he was actually my partner first . <p> I do n't have any anger towards him or her - she did not know just like me , and she has a child as well . <p> I just wish I could die , because since the age of 14 I have been dreaming of forever with this man ..... I was the one he was with for 10 years . I ca n't believe I am an OW . <p> Our culture does a lot of arranged marriages . Some forced . I do not condone cheating , and if I had known for one minute he had not left his wife , I would never have taken him back . <p> I hate the fact I have been branded a whore by his wife . I kept quiet on the phone when she was calling me all sorts of names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he loves her etc . The more she talked the more I realised the extent of the lies . I knew then he was married and had a baby ... <p> I guess I could have told her the truth , that I 'd been in his life 8 years before she came in it , and I had been told he was divorced . I kept quiet because I did n't want to add any further pain or damage . I know my honour was taken from me , and this was the only way I could walk away with my head high . I apologised to her and put the phone down . <p> To all the ladies calling the OW whores , maybe its true . But some women really have no idea , and by the time they do , they have been so emotionally abused they do n't know what 's what anymore . Lucky I have so many amazing friends that have helped me get through this .... <p> margret 4 years ago <p> My ex-boyfriend dumped me 4 months ago after I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him <p> back in my life but he refuse to have any contact with me.I was so confuse and do n't know what to do , so I reach to the <p> internet for help and I saw a testimony of how a spell caster help them to get their ex back so I contact the spell caster <p> and explain my problem to him and he cast a spell for me and assure me of 3days that my ex will return to me and to <p> my greatest surprise the third day my ex came knocking on my door and beg for forgiveness.I am so happy that my <p> love is back again and not only that , we are about to get married.once again thank you Dr. opingo spell.you are truly <p> talented and gifted .

Not mine . " <p> She is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to promise a wife that you will not mate with her husband . There is no law against decency , morality . It is a law of life to do the right thing . Does a man have a right to rape your sister or child if he has not made a promise of decency to her or him ? According to your rationale , he does . <p> I had a co-worker who made the mistake of seeing a committed man . She was beautiful , had recently gotten a degree , about to begin the career of her dreams , had a son in college , and a whole promising life ahead of herself . She refused to let go of the husband and lost her life because of it . The wife was wrong to shoot her , but she is dead . The wife went to prison , but the girlfriend is dead . The husband SOON got another woman , but his wife is in PRISON , and his soon forgotten girlfriend is DEAD . This is about a selfish man and two women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My point to Jetta 's statement is that a person does not have to make a vow to anyone to be obligated to do the right thing . We all owe it to our fellows to not tresspass against them or covet their spouses . It is only decent and right . You did not promise the sheriff of Green county that you would obey speed laws , but , if you are a bad-butt , truck through Green County , Alabama playing the part of a speeding fool and see what happens . <p> Levertis Steele 3 years agofrom Southern Clime <p> J-2012 , <p> You are making excuses for the other woman 's offenses . Unless she is an idiot , she knows right from wrong . It is admirable to forgive the husband and the other woman , but who is going to relax and try to figure out if she is a good or bad adulterer ? If the OW does not know that the man is married , that is understandable , but most of them do know and many prefer a married man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agofrom Gulf Coast <p> Arrange your relationships so that you can not be cheated on and can not cheat . Agree that each of you are autonomous from the start . Do n't try to " own " the other . Stay together because you want to stay together , not because your ego or religious superstition ( usually both are one ) demand monogamy . If you ca n't be cheated on , you have one less thing in life to worry about and people like Levertis ' friend do n't need to be SHOT ! <p> Such are the stupid things we do to each other and ourselves ! <p> sophie 2 years ago <p> my case is rather complicated . Am 35 , divorced with 2kids and met this man 6 mths ago who 1st said he was separaated from his wife , on further enquiry he told me he had another lady who bore him 2 kids but married her according to traditional rites . apparently it was this that brought his real marriage to an end . we started dating and earlier on he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lady he married traditionally but wanted me to be his mistress . he lives alone after his separation from his wife and gave a house to the other lady so he visits occassionaly thereby giving me full access to his home . he does n't hide me from anyone , am known by his friends , family and associates . we live in different towns but he wants me to be in his house all the time without conssideration for my business . he also wants me to be exclusive with him even though he still goes to me the other lady and spends the night leaving me all alone in his house . I do nott feel any remorse for being with him and do not give any consideration to the lady that ruiined his marriage or even want to accept that she is his wife . what I feel for him also is not so much love like that but a way to get back to that lady that ruined his marriage and now wants to take the position of a wife . it hurts me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked very closely with the couple before resigning to start being the man 's mistress to the point of having children aand ruining a marriage of 20years with 3 children . <p> there is no doubt this man loves me , but I am not sure to what extent he can go with me , he keeps going baack and forth , speaks bad of the current wife today , behaves another way tomorrow , use her kids as excuse to keep going to meet her , he wants me to be his wife today , tomorrow marriage does not appeal to him bla bla blam he cant seem to make up his mind while ensuring am for him alone by checking me up every hour , wanting me to be with him 24 7 etc . <p> I do not know what to do , he has not made any moves to start divorce with his separated wife , d 2nd one that ruined his marriage is also hanging on to him , where does that leave me ? am thinking of making myself less available to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Levertis Steele 2 years agofrom Southern Clime <p> Some Johns decide to keep their prostitutes with the promise to pay and shower them with enough to keep them from seeking others for money .

Is n't a kept woman , or mistress , a full-time prostitute ? <p> Austin 18 months ago <p> name is Daxster i will like us to share tips on how to identify a <p> real <p> spell caster cos alot of people have fallen victim of scam as i <p> have come <p> across lots of comments lately ( i was a victim too ) and from <p> experience and <p> what i know i decide to open this thread , only fake spell casters <p> ask for <p> the followings : <p> COURIER CHARGES : no matter where you are in the world , no <p> matter the <p> distance and continent a real spell caster will cast a spell <p> effectively <p> without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to use it <p> so <p> long as he has the names or pix .. the spell will work itself .. <p> STRAIGHT : no excuses for failure , if money was needed in the <p> first place <p> for courier he should have say so , so one can know how <p> prepared he is .. i <p> did rather pay $2000 at once to get my result rather than paying <p> $200 for <p> excuses to get more money .. its not bad paying for items but the <p> end result <p> might be an excuse <p> THREAT : if you get fed up of sending money after money , they <p> begin to <p> threaten one with death and madness .. <p> NIGERIA ; about 80% of them are nigerians not saying they do n't  <p> have real <p> spell casters cos they are spiritually gifted in africa but the <p> impersonation is too much , the fake are more than the real .. <p> i fell a victim of scam twice to a certain dr wodu and dr isaka <p> they but <p> ripped me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> i came <p> across dr YASIN who told me how to know a fake spell caster , he <p> helped me <p> get my ex back without failure or excuse in 5 days .. we are back <p> and happy <p> now for about a month .. his e-mail is <p> **28;8192;TOOLONG .. <p> let 's beware of scammers and share experience , suggestion and <p> solutions .. thanks <p> Summer 3 months ago <p> I 'm married to the love of my life ..... He broke my heart and continues to d so . Yes it is hard sitting back and just letting it happen . For awhile I had no idea it was happening . Not until he got sloppy . There has been 3 women maybe more to have been at my door . For another woman to come to my home , it messed with my security and sense of peace . One woman had no idea my husband was married and the other 2 women was well aware he is married . Its sad , both women to this day do not care that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the camera this crazy woman was knocking at my door while I was at work . Yes I am torn , she obviously has had bad relationships , why make mine worse ? She told me she does n't care and she will continue to screw my husband . My husband has always denied it . I have found so much evidence .. and not because i looked ... its because he has gotten lazy and left things laying around .. and he comes home late nearly every day . On his days off he is never at home for the entire day . I guess I wanted to hold on to something that I need to let go . I am and will forever be a great catch . I ask for nothing and need nothing from him ... obviously they need him ... Both women ( the ones I know about ) have nothing , and both are barely making it .... He refuses to leave the home , knowing he is wrong and has done me wrong . We have a great life ! No bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go on trips without thinking about the cost . All I can say is I love him and I am getting stronger every day as I move through this drama . I am hurt beyond hurt . How can he ? How can they ? Why did he ? I was mad at the women because they knew about me and still did n't care about me . Why should they ? I always felt that people had a conscious about hurting others , but some do n't and I truly thought my husband wanted Me or just Us . Well he did this to our marriage , not those women . He could have walked away from them , but he chose not to . I am walking away , I have been walking away , slowly but surely trying to get my peace back .... I 'm walking away ..... I have to . If I do n't walk away he will forever have the power to hurt me . I have to love me more and respect Me more ... someone has to do the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love me first . I decided I am leaving and leaving for good . <p> Sarah 4 weeks ago <p> A. I never lured a man away from his wife . I did n't try to contact him at all when he was staying with her . He showed up on my doorstep after she kicked him out and said he was bothered I did n't try . I told him I have more self respect than that and do n't help men be cheaters <p> B. He never bought me expensive gifts or treated me like a princess . <p> C. He was n't older <p> D. I was n't his mistress , a fling , a friend 's with benefits or etc . I told him I did n't do stuff like that because it 's beneath me . <p> E. I did n't think I 'd win him at the end because I do n't compete in relationships .

I 'm talking about charitable acts of kindness with no thought of what you might receive in return . <p> Are you so caught up in the days activities and projects you rarely think about giving to others ? Let 's not get so caught up with the business of living that we forget about others who may be i 'll , depressed or lonely . <p> Maybe a neighbor could use a trip to the market or perhaps a shut-in would appreciate dinner brought in . It does n't take much to make an extra helping of homemade cookies , freeze them for a later time when you want to take someone a treat .. <p> I realize that your mornings fly by and before you know it , lunchtime has arrived . Not long after lunch it 's time to prepare dinner . And then bedtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . Or , maybe you 're one of the gazillion people who ca n't sleep . <p> Insomnia takes its toll after a time and can shorten your life span . And we know how stress can bring on a heart attack . But what if I told you that there is a way you can actually live longer and really enjoy a wonderful , full life ? <p> If we have no peace , it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other . <p> Mother Teresa <h> Give To Live <p> I coined the phrase ' Give to Live , ' after researching the mental and physical benefits of giving to others . I 've learned that those that give actually live up to 5 years longer than those who do not give to others . <p> And besides this benefit , just think about how you - yes , you , will leave this world a better place . You actually cause a change for the better each time you help someone else . All you have to do is alter your behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grew up with . It was n't anything special , it was a way of life . <p> We were taught at a very young age how to bring a smile to the faces of older folks who were tucked away in ' homes ' - alone and forgotten . My little brother , sister and I would spend an entire afternoon every single week singing to the elderly . I will never forget how over-joyed these older seniors were with a visit and a song . <p> Memories of my mother visiting the sick , sitting with them day in and day out , are still vivid in my mind . Rain or shine , tired or hungry , she could be depended upon to lift the burden and pain others carried . <p> It takes so little to make a difference in the life of those who are lonely and hunger for companionship . And actually , we are the ones who though know thought of a reward walk away feeling a sense of joy and blessed with energy to spare . <h> Share Your Dinner With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casserole double the recipe and offer to make dinner for someone . Source <h> 14 Ways to Give to Others <p> When you give to others , you experience true joy because you focus on someone else and not yourself . But I really began to understand how giving makes good things happen when I carefully read through the book " Why Good Things Happen To Good People . " <p> Of course we do n't go about the business of looking for a reward when we give . Still it 's mighty nice to know we are rewarded in a variety of ways we never suspect.Good things really do happen to good people . Being a good person means being aware , honing your skills in patience , unselfishness , perception and compassion . <p> Audrey Hunt <p> I came up with these 14 ways to give to others . Feel free to add your own thoughts to this list : <p> Give someone who needs a hug a nice warm hug and put some energy into it .. <p> Call an old friend that you have neglected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Share your dinner with someone who is i 'll or lives alone . <p> Make cookies for those who are sad . Leave these on the doorstep wrapped with love . <p> Mow the lawn for the elderly . My son did this regularly without payment . <p> Send a friendly card for any reason . A nice reminder which makes a soft connection . <p> Send a thank you letter to someone you appreciate . <p> Offer to babysit . Young couples really need some time to themselves . <p> Help someone pack for a move . Bring along a happy attitude . <p> Tell someone you love them . You do n't need a reason . Just do it ! <p> Give a person a ride to the doctor . The elderly often need transportation but rarely ask . <p> Give flowers . Nothing quite lights up someone 's day like a few lovely flowers . <p> Allow a car to go in front of you on the highway . What 's the big deal anyhow ? <p> Do n't forget about children , teens and young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid to reach out to other people . Sometimes they will let you know if help is needed .

Sometimes , just being a good listener is the best gift you can give . Good listeners are n't easy to come by . Sharpen up your listening skills and do your best to be there for someone who really needs you . <p> Giving does n't have to cost anything but a few minutes of your time . With 24 hours in each day , 7 days in every week , surely you can find some time to set aside and help at least one person or group every month . <p> Call your local rest homes for seniors and care facilities to schedule a visit .

You 'll feel good inside . <p> If you are at a loss for words when visiting a person for the first time here are a few suggestions : <p> Ask about their family . We all like to talk about family members . How many children and what are their names ? Where do they live ? Ask about the spouse even if they are gone . <p> Ask where they were born . How has the world advanced ? Allow them to talk about their childhood . <p> What is their favorite food ? Maybe you could get a delicious recipe from the individual . <p> Do they have a favorite song ? If you know the song sing it with them . <p> Offer to read them poetry or a story .

As we give to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The list that I 've provided for ways to give is by no means complete . I would n't want it to be . You are capable and creative enough to find your own unique ways of giving . And sometimes a giving opportunity will find you when you least expect it . Make kindness a daily mental state in all you do . Find it in every thought and in every action . Mother Teresa did . <p> If at times you find yourself feeling low in the self-esteem department I promise you if you 'll spend time giving to others your level of self-esteem will increase leaps and bounds . The act of giving releases endorphins , your body 's natural opiates , which causes you to feel good . <p> Now may be the perfect time to develop the habit of giving to others .

I have always been like that anyway , I know that doing for others is what God has called me to do . I tell you all this , because I can relate to Mother Teresa in her own personal quest .

@@96276098 @476098/ <h> How to Be His Dream Girl <h> Falling in Love - Why It 's So Difficult <p> Oh to be in love - it feels like we all have a love/hate relationship with love at some points in our lives but it only seems to get harder as we get older . When we are young , everyone is at our fingertips and everyone is anxious to find " the one " at a young age . However , know we all know that puppy love is not real love and we are all antsy to find the one who is able to make our hearts flutter and to make us feel at home . <p> The dating game is tough . Both men and women have a hard time connecting with people and even just maintaining basic conversation is becoming more and more difficult . We are in the age of social media and technology dominance . We ca n't even have face-to-face conversations anymore , so it is no wonder why we are nervous when we meet someone we like . We have no idea how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love is so difficult - we have an incredibly hard time connecting with someone on a deeper level to truly find out what they are all about . Not to mention , because of technology , we all have barriers and walls put up , so feelings of vulnerability are completely foreign to us . <p> When you do n't know how to act with someone , how are you expected to become everything they have ever wanted and more ? When you finally muster up the courage to talk to that cute guy , how are you supposed to lock him down and seal the deal ? <p> You can get the guy of your dreams and not only that , you can be his dream girl too . You just need a little advice and a little assistance ! <p> How to Understand Him <h> Understanding the Male Brain and How it Works <p> While men think that we are the difficult ones to read and to understand , it is actually them who are the most difficult gender to try to dissect . Why is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid to open up to people . Men are supposed to be the strong ones and the ones who are never effected by anything - even love . Men are supposed to spread their seed , have multiple partners , and just live life like it is a party every day . So how are you supposed to make him yours ? <p> You need to understand the male brain and how it works if you expect to lock him down and make him yours forever . When you are able to dissect his brain , that is when you can throw yourself into the mix and make him realize that you are the one and that he should n't let you go ! <p> The biggest thing to remember about the male brain is that men love competition , so if you want to be his dream girl , then you need to make him chase after you . <p> Men do n't want women who give it up too easily . The chase is half of the fun and half of the battle ! If you can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he will come after you and he will want to hang onto you . <p> You have to have an heir of mystery about you as well . Men love mystery . Make it hard for him to understand you , but not too difficult , because that is when it becomes a turn off . We all know that men are not good with reading people or subtly , so if you do want to become a seductive goddess , you have to give a little more and then take some back . <p> How to Be His Dream Girl <h> 5 Ways to Instantly Become His Dream Girl <p> Even though all men are different , all men are still the same and some things are universal between them . Whether he is rough and tumble or a soft sweetie at heart , these 5 tips can be used to become any man 's dream girl . <p> Instead of wishing that he would notice you and love you , it 's time that you made him . With these tips , he is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life ! <p> Play the game . As we touched upon briefly earlier , men love the chase , so you need to make him chase after you . Make sure that you are sexless until monogamy . You ca n't give it up right away , no matter how intense the attraction is . You ca n't give him what he wants until you get what you want . Play the game and make it hard for him to get to you . Make yourself available at one moment and then busy the next . That way , he knows that you still have things going on in your life , which will make him feel good that he is not the only thing you think about . Do n't be a stage 5 clinger ! <p> Be mysterious . Again , you want to create a sense of mystery about you and leave something to the imagination . As women , we know how much we fantasize throughout the day , and did you know that men do the same ? Create mystery around yourself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fantasize about . You want to be his dream girl but you also want to be in his dreams , so make sure you do this to achieve that ! <p> Be cool with his friends . As ridiculous as it may sound , some men put women through friend tests so see if they will get along well with their buds . Yes , it is childish and yes , it is juvenile , but male camaraderie is not going anywhere so we may as well get used to it ! Yes , his friends can be obnoxious , but if you can play along with it , take the teasing and dish it right back , you set yourself apart from the rest of the girls . Better yet , if you can chug beer along with the boys , you might even have the whole room salivating over you ! <p> Take interest in his interests . One of the biggest assets of a dream girl is someone who can be one of the boys , in regards to sports . If you can spew off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , you 'll easily become so attractive to him , you 'll make him forget to watch the game . Men love women who are into sports , so taking an interest in sports is one of the top attributes of a dream girl . Who knows ? You might actually start to like it ! <p> Be a girl . Yes , it 's fun to get down and dirty with the boys and to bro it out , but at the end of the day , he wants someone who can talk about football and still rock a pair of stilettos . Yes , sweatpants and a ponytail are cozy , but they are not sexy all of the time . Show him that you can rock a little black dress and bust out the big curls every once in a while . Remember that men are very visual , so give him something to drool over . <h> Make Him Love You Forever <p> At the end of the day , the real key to everlasting love is just to be yourself . He is attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Trying to be too showy or trying too hard to impress him , will just make you seem awkward . <p> Men love confidence but what men love more , are women who are confident with who they are and themselves . He wants to see you love yourself and to love him . He wants to see you let loose , try new things , sometimes make a fool of yourself but most of all , he wants to see you have fun . <p> Love is supposed to be fun and the ride of your life . Make him love you forever and to always be his dream girl by the best version of yourself that you can possibly be . 
@@96276099 @476099/ <h> Signs He Likes You Through Texting <p> SMS stands for Short Message Service . It was used for the first time on 3 December 1992 , when Neil Papworth , a 22-year-old test engineer for SEMA in the UK used a personal computer to send the message , " Merry Christmas . " Since then , texting has become an integral part of human life . <p> Our texts can give clues about the nature of friendships , our habits , our love interests , and the places we frequent . Relationships are not determined by texting , but text messages can still be indicators of the level of interest two people have in each other . <h> Texting and Relationships <p> Texting can be a great , low key way to engage with someone you 've got your eyes on . If you 're needing some clarity in what 's happening in a suspicious exchange of texts , look no further . This hub is here to help you sort out whether he leans more toward liking you .... or maybe something else . <p> Texting can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handy things to check in your text messages to garner a better idea of whether he just wants you for your body , if he genuinely likes you , or is just having some fun . <h> Have you ever felt like you could tell someone liked you through texting ? <h> Subject : What Does He Text ? <p> The first things you should ask when you get a text message : What is this guy saying ? Why is he saying it ? <h> Random Positive Messages <p> Lighthearted texts about anything and everything are always good , because they mean that this guy is looking for an excuse to get in touch . Here are some signs of positive , lighthearted messages you might receive from a guy who likes you . <p> The conversations do not focus on everyday matters , but instead on humorous things that are inside jokes . Is there a consistent thread that refers back to a significant moment ? <p> He uses a pet name or nickname for you . He uses the same one consistently . <p> Positivity is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an Excel sheet and decipher how many are positive to you vs. how many seem negative ... or neutral . <p> Notice if he always responds . Many people opt out of texting after awhile if it does n't seem pertinent anymore . Our busy lives tend to take precedent over texts . Bonus points : he politely says when he has to leave a conversation . <p> He sends you a text about a dream that he had ... about you . <p> He sends you random song lyrics . <p> He sends you a joke . <p> He comments on something extremely minuscule to see if you noticed too . <p> He does n't refer to your hot friends . If he is referring to a hot friend of yours a lot , he may want help getting connected with her . <p> His texts are not all business or school focused . <p> He may send you a message to let you know something has reminded him of you . <p> He sends you pictures to make you laugh -- like animals , things from movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy is talking to you about important or personal issues in his life , he clearly both values your opinion and trusts you enough that he can be honest and even emotional around you . Then again -- he could just be really weird . Take everything with a grain of salt . ; ) <p> If a guy you like wants to have a serious conversation , even over text , that 's a sign that he probably does like you or care about your opinions . <p> And if he is saying outright that he likes you or values your relationship , well , that 's even better . <p> Beware of sexting . It 's a better sign if , instead of sexting , he texts you as though he respects you . If he sexts you , he may easily be doing this with others . And he could be sharing information or pictures that you send with his friends , so take caution . My own rule of thumb is if you would n't your grandmother to see it , then you probably do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisely . <p> He uses positive affirmations rather than bringing you down . Does he compliment you for being punctual , friendly , patient , etc. ? This might not mean he is head over heels for you , but he at least has a soft spot for you . ( Aladdin complimented Jasmine on her punctuality . ) <p> He refers to something from a long time ago . Whatever it was ... it 's stuck with him . <p> If you need his assistance , he does n't delay to offer help . He may immediately come to your rescue . <p> He handles it well if you send him something completely strange . <p> He overall seems to enjoy hearing from you and may even in person say that he likes having conversations with you . Could there be a greater sign then that ? <p> He let 's you know of positive things that have happened in his life , whether over text or not , such as doing well on a test , a promotion , or having a new pet . <p> His texts usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details such as family , a job problem , etc . <h> Formatting and Length <p> After all , there 's more to texting than words . What about emoticons ? What about length ? This section will help you decipher your text message beyond the obvious ... <h> Questions <p> Questions in a text message are a good sign because that means he is trying to continue the conversation . You 've probably done this too : formatted a text in the form of a question , or adding a question at the end so that there 's more guarantee of a response . <p> If he sends you questions , that 's probably what he 's doing : he want to hear from you . Here are some possible questions you might receive in a text from a guy who likes you . <p> He asks you to hangout or do something . This could include : grabbing something to eat , going on a bike ride , going to the movies . <p> He says things along the lines of , " Let me know if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programmed to fix things ; it 's a delicate part of their DNA . If you can figure out what he can fix and have him do it , you 'll be able to create a connection . <p> He asks if he may have accidentally spotted you , just to start a conversation . I got a call once that asked if I had stepped into a gray van in another state . Obviously , we both knew that was unlikely . <p> He asks , " How are you ? " <p> He is concerned about your wellbeing and what you are doing with your life . <p> He may ask for your help on something that he is not particularly skilled at handling . This is a great sign because it means he respects and trusts you . <p> He might ask about some guy that he has seen you with ( whether directly or indirectly ) . <p> He does not refer to other girls . OR he asks your advice about them . <p> He asks for something back that you may have borrowed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excuse to chat about it with you . And to setup a time where he can see you . <p> Drunk texting means he probably likes you . <h> Formatting <p> Here are some clues that might not seem obvious to you at first . Punctuation , length , even grammar can all be clues as to what your guy is thinking and how he feels about you . <p> If he texts you back and engages in conversation this is positive , even if his messages are short with one or two words . <p> He uses " Hahahaha . " Or another text to indicate that he finds something funny . <p> Exclamation marks ! The more of them the higher likelihood he digs you . Also , guys do n't use exclamation marks as much as girls . So if he is using them -- he probably means them . <p> He contacts you in other forms whether phone calls , Facebook , in person , emails , letters , smoke signals , etc . My Facebook back-to-back feed with one guy in particular has YouTube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jokes here and there , and sometimes even conversations on other people 's profiles . This can be a pretty fun way to maintain contact , if done right . <p> He sends you texts frequently . Is he sending you texts everyday ? Once a week ? Once a year ? <p> He is n't playing mind games and has no problem sending two or more messages at once , rather than sending one at a time and waiting for your response . He 's eager to talk to you and wants to make certain that you are informed . <p> He uses proper grammar . <p> He sends you a picture that reminds him of you . <p> He refrains from using plain ole ' " k . " <p> He refrains from using " LOL . " It 's weak , sister . REAL WEAK . <p> He is comfortable with writing you a long text message that breaks into six sections . Not necessarily often , but he would do it . <p> He avoids curse words or foul language . OR ... he uses a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He texts you when he is clearly drunk . <p> He may send a text in all caps with just your name and exclamation marks . <h> Timing : When Does He Text ? <p> Sometimes the timing of a text contains more clues than a text itself . Here are some tips on deciphering the timing and frequency of messages . <p> Making arrangements to see you is always a good sign . <h> Timing <p> This is a classic way to tell if someone likes you . If a guy you like texts you all the time , even if the messages do n't seem to have much content , that 's a big deal . And if he texts you during important moments in his life , or when he needs help , that 's also a big deal . Here are some good signs related to timing . <p> After seeing you he sends you a message that he had a good time . This is a polite affirmation of the time you spent together . This actually makes my day when anyone does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( we all have busy lives ) but if he does seem to respond quickly , this is positive . If it takes him more than twenty four hours without reason , that is suspicious , but do n't jump to conclusions . If he never answers at all that 's almost always a bad sign . You could possibly have the wrong number or he changed his number . I will say though that one summer I texted a friend randomly when I thought of him and did n't know that he was on a giant road trip across the country without his phone . When he got back into town we met up later to discuss his whole trip . So at the end of the day ... if you feel like texting , just do it . <p> He texts you during the day rather than at night . 12:00AM-6:00AM is unusual , and more than likely a booty call . <p> The two of you text one another more than you text others . <p> He texts when you 've just gotten back from a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He attempts to get in touch between 9:00AM-5:00PM to make arrangements to see you . These are hours that show respect on his part . <p> He sends you a long text about how wonderful you are when he knows you 've had a terrible day . <p> The conversation can go back and forth for hours , regardless of how many texts . <p> He may consistently text you on a certain day of the week or hour as he may have figured out you were free at that time . <p> He respects your time and does n't eat it all up with texting . It 's the right amount of speed for you . <h> Comments 64479 @qwx924479 <p> sending <p> Della 3 years ago <p> thank you ... now I 'm sure of him . <p> Gabrielle 3 years ago <p> This was a big help .

And we use a ton of emojis and we text a lot of funny things . And every time he sends me a goodnight before he stops texting . But I 'm not sure . Because when he asked me if I like him I said maybe and he automatically changed the subject and asked me what I was doing even though he asked me that already . I really like him but I 'm not sure if he likes me . But this is helpful . <p> CD 2 years ago <p> What about if he does most of this , but keeps telling you that you guys are just friends . He is not looking for a commitment . What does that mean ? <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 2 years agofrom Chicago <p> Take him at his word for now . He probably is n't looking for anything serious , but may enjoy flirting or talking . <p> Anonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and hangout every now and then ... How do I make my move ? <p> lol 2 years ago <p> Probably a good point is whether he asks questions about you ... this guy I 'm texting has ME doing all the conversation starters ( what 's your favorite band etc etc ) ... obviously does n't like you if he does n't care to know more about you , which sucks for me <p> avianna.M 23 months ago <p> The ...... this was very a very good article ... it showed that the guy that i 'm with at this moment did n't really like me .. and that i should breakup with him before he breaks my heart .... so thank you ... now i 'm going to go cry so ..... <p> Yabs : * 20 months ago <p> We text each other every night after school but I do n't know if he likes me .

Which would n't matter i only concentrate on one guy and the way he texts me .

He has a girl now but we 've been texting through personal cells . Last i asked him if seeing each other would flame that old spark . He said maybe , , i 'd have to meet him between my city and his to find out . What do you think that says about him and our situation ? <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 17 months agofrom Chicago <p> @cherry <p> The odds are always against you when someone is already synched up with someone else . Do n't get your hopes up too high -- he may like you , but sometimes people continue to flirt outside of their relationships as a matter of flattery . I say cut him loose . If he pursues you , you 'll know it . If he misses you , he 'll do something about it . It 's shaky ground whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ok 17 months ago <p> This noy text me alot we meet in elemtaty school and he recently meet up with me for thr first time at my house we text everyday and he has a nickname for me ( fam ) we sebd eachother kissy face till i accidently called him family since then all the kissy emojis have stopped but we still talk everyday and he always ask what i 'm wearing how do i reply to that .. hw says he wants to comeover sometime but he is going pro in soccer and he stays busy ... i want to tell him i like him but i 'm not sure how to tell him without actually telling him .. he shares his problems with me and when he gets new shoes he askes me which ones he should choose and he has shared private stuff with me and we alwys send these emojis to eachother <p> Ok 17 months ago <p> I left this out but he talked about how he was gon na give me this amazing hug when he saw me and I 'm not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kind of like world up and he said he still hug me in this hug was amazing but his soccer is taking a lot over his our relationship as I do n't know what we are everyday after school we talk to each other and then he have to stop talking to me around 5 and then you start talking to me around 9 cuz he can get back from soccer and we talk and talk all night I just do n't know how to go about it does he like me does he not like me <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 17 months agofrom Chicago <p> @ok <p> You mentioned elementary school ... are you in elementary school ? <p> Vivian 17 months ago <p> This is kind of hard to decifer .

He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrea Lawrence 17 months agofrom Chicago <p> @Vivian <p> Texting with someone who 's first language is n't your language is a whole other ball game . Most likely if they 're taking the effort to talk to you when it 's that difficult , they like you ... and probably think you 're friendly enough to get along with . Could these language hang ups also hint at him being a jerk ? Possibly . There could be some cultural differences playing at hand here . I would use signals outside of texting at that point to judge his character . Character is different from whether they like you or not . <p> Jaquie 15 months ago <p> I have been seeing this guy for some time now , since 2013 . I have 2 children and he has none . We have been friends for years before I was married , he was the best man at my wedding . We went our separate ways and re connected in 2012 . We text everyday and when I am with the kids he wishes me a great weekend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one text and sometimes never stops . I like hearing from him . I know he has a very busy schedule , he has a lot of pride in his career and I respect that but lately the texting has changed . I hear all the time that men pull away and go to their man cave but I find it strange how lately he has been distance ( silent or MIA ) , and the texts too . I text anyways to say hi , , , etc , , , but should I just let him be and live my life without him . I rather him tell me that he is moving on then just avoiding the situation or me ... <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 15 months agofrom Chicago <p> @Jaquie <p> Give it a little bit of time . Sometimes people need breaks from texting for a week or two . You can ask him how busy he is . He may need to see you in person rather than so much texting . Texting can wear heavy on a person after awhile if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago <p> Thank you for your response ! <p> I asked him to get together before he goes on his business trip , so will see what his answer will be . <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 15 months agofrom Chicago <p> @Jaquie <p> Awesome ! Let me know how it goes . <p> Jaquie 15 months ago <p> So he responded 1 day later and from his response it sounded as if he is avoiding the situation . <p> I responded back and told him that people make time for what they want to make time for , not to worry your job will fall into place , have an awesome vacation and safe travels . <p> That 's as much as I can do . I have been through so much that I will not allow myself to be treated this way . It 's simple if he wants to continue or not just let me know ... <p> I feel I made the right choice. ? <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 15 months agofrom Chicago <p> @Jaquie <p> I would n't bother him too much at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone before they 're ready to commit to something , it can make them leave faster than just about anything . You might be putting too much pressure on it . <p> Jaquie 15 months ago <p> That 's the thing I do not pressure him , but I will leave this alone and he knows how to reach me if he would like to . My gut tells me it could be some time before I hear from him , or even if i ever do again ... <p> Thank you ! I will post any updates . <p> Jaquie 15 months ago <p> Hello , so I received a response from the last text I had sent him . <p> He basically said his week is rough and he is over whelmed with his up coming trip . He also asked how my week is going ? with a <p> Jaquie 15 months ago <p> It got cut off .. meant to say : <p> With a <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 15 months agofrom Chicago <p> @Jaquie <p> If he is asking about your week , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up with things and overwhelmed . The best route to take is to show that you 're a supportive person . If he is just a weasel , time will tell . <p> Brit 15 months ago <p> And if he tells you he is going to impress you , is this a sign also ? <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 15 months agofrom Chicago <p> @Brit <p> Depends . Need more context . <p> Jaquie 15 months ago <p> So it 's been 3 weeks since I last heard from him . As he usually gets in touch when he gets back from business or vacation . This time not a single word , so I guess like you say " he is just a weasel " . <p> If this is what he has chosen , He could of just spoke up . <p> If he is happy , I am happy for him . <p> Brit : Just tell him no need to impress , just to be himself . <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 15 months agofrom Chicago <p> @Jaquie <p> Sorry to hear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jaquie 15 months ago <p> I am sorry too , we have been friends for 30 years and together for the last 4 years . I really enjoyed our conversations and togetherness . I had better talks with him than I ever did with my ex husband . It hurts , I think I lost an old time friend . I have cut him off ... : ( <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 15 months agofrom Chicago <p> @Jaquie <p> I hope that things will get better . Sometimes they boomerang and come right back to you , so do n't be surprised if that happens . I 'd say go live your life to the fullest ... and inevitably you 'll find someone . <p> Jaquie 15 months ago <p> I will figure that out when the time happens . <p> Thank you much ! <p> Hii 15 months ago <p> So ... there 's this guy I message , we 've known each for a while now . We are in a relationship but .. he does n't seem to be messaging me back often .. we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different state so I do n't know what he 's doing . He does n't tell me why he does n't respond .. he 's also not on fb alot , maybe he 's busy with school ? But when he is on , he 's very sweet and tells me how much he loves me and all . But I do n't know if his words are true .. I know it 's bad to doubt , but I really want to know if they are true and what he is doing in his life that is so busy .. <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 15 months agofrom Chicago <p> @Hii <p> High school boys do n't usually talk a whole lot . Some people are not super interested in Facebook . <p> If he is being nice / sweet to you on Facebook , that is a good sign . Look for how he communicates in person and not just through messages . That will be key . <p> Hii 15 months ago <p> Well ... the problem is he lives in another state at the moment <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I would n't worry too much . High school relationships are very young ... and generally do n't pan out . Focus more on yourself at this point . <p> MonkeyGirl23 15 months ago <p> Long story short , I met this guy at a friend 's wedding and there was an after party . We talked the whole night , drank shots together and he has initiated the text the whole time with positive messages . The only thing is he lives in Chicago , since then we 've been texting . It 's only been a week but I think this guy likes me ? He keeps saying how he 'll cook home made tacos for me when I come to Chicago or taking me to a beautiful scenic route . <p> I mean .. if this guy was n't interested , he would of left straight to Chicago without texting me/asking for my number . <p> What are your thoughts ? <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 15 months agofrom Chicago <p> @MonkeyGirl23 <p> I think he is definitely interested . I would for sure keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago currently is too soon since you guys just met ... I do n't know what the distance is between you and him . I would keep texting , maybe also include Skype and Facetime . It sounds like you hit it off really well . <p> Keep chatting and get to know him before traveling to meet him , especially if it requires a plane ticket . I think continuing the conversation will help you to figure out whether you trust him or getting out of uncertainty . Or if it 's even something you really want . <p> Monkeygirl23 15 months ago <p> Sorry . I forgot to mention that I live in Houston and he lives in Chicago . Thank you so much for your advice and thoughts ! I will definitely keep that in mind . I 'm at the phase where I 'm getting to know him . We are actually meeting in gulf shore Alabama for a music festival in a couple of weeks so hopefully it works out . <p> Thanks again ! <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 15 months agofrom Chicago <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track ! I read recently that those first few dates are about having fun and figuring things out with our uncertainties . So I guess the most important thing right now is ... start a fun , positive connection and see where it goes . <p> MonkeyGirl23 14 months ago <p> Yeah definitely ! I have a question .. so we have n't skyped or talked on the phone yet . Do I let him initiate that ? It 's only been 2 weeks so far . I know it 's still early but my girl brain is like .. errrr just wait for him to say something about it ? We did ask each other if we like to talk to the phone , we were mutual and left it at that . Also , thank you so much your advice again . I hope it works out with this person and will see where it goes . <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 14 months agofrom Chicago <p> @MonkeyGirl23 <p> I think it 's okay to initiate Skype or Facetime at this point if you feel comfortable . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> First of all i am a guy .. Well after reading whole article .... i can conclude ... i am in love with a girl ...... i text her like ... most of free time ... sometimes in busy time too ... : P .... i have never text a girl except my own sister .. well .... i always check inbox ... if she replied ..... and i like when she laughs on pics i send her ... i do n't  know whether she love me or not .... but god knows my heart beat for her ... and my mom dad ... too . <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 11 months agofrom Chicago <p> Are you dating the girl yet ?

And her <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 10 months agofrom Chicago <p> If you do n't want that .... you should tell him . <p> Vee 8 months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . <p> We exchanged numbers for academic purpose , but now been constantly texting each other . He s in 2 of my classes , during which we exchange pleasant greetings . He notices when I walk in ( or maybe I look for him when I walk in ) . Past week he and his friends waited for me after class too , but I find it bit difficult to talk him face to face so I often say " I 'm gon na get going ' ' and go off on my own . Yes we text , mainly because that 's where I feel comfortable . I like him . He is a very jovial guy , friendly with everyone , which is why I ca n't understand his cues ( Is he like that with everyone ? ) . We once talked about the vibes we send off and I told he seems bit flirty , to which he felt offended I assume , he justified saying he is n't a flirt , he just like to make people smile and he s very loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the reserved and the " family type " . <p> I tried to take dig and asked " why are we talking so much " for it he s like " why are n't you having fun as well " . We been sharing our expectations of life partners , how we both wanted to get into a relationship . He even shared the name he wants to name his daughter lol . During our convo I said I enjoyed cooking and I wanted to feed my future husband well and he said " lucky guy , I hope I find a girl like that " . Do n't know what that meant . I been indirect with him saying he will meet " his girl soon " . I am trying to hold off bit , because I do n't want to get hurt ... Does he like me ? <p> Sorry for this long message , this comment could be confusing as my thoughts right now lol .... so any feedback will be appreciated . <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 8 months agofrom Chicago <p> It sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And would n't put too much pressure on it or overthink it . Try hanging out with him , and if it seems good to you , keep at it . I think you have your own uncertainties to deal with first . I ca n't tell at this point if he is interested in you more than a friend . <p> Akwasi Maru 7 months agofrom Macon , Georgia <p> I 've never seen a hub so detailed about texting .

The 14th day of every February month is when we turn to our loved ones and shower them with gifts and praises just to show how great full we are that they are in our lives . I have decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives and in my case its my MOTHER . I can not help but wonder how these beautiful beings hold it together . Every time i look back and think of what can go wrong when you are young , am amazed beyond word at how mothers end up making us who we are at the end . Imagine the most powerful man in the world , the president of the United States was also once a baby hey ! Am sure most of you and even himself can not bring himself to think that right now . He had a mother who tended to his every need . It is for this small but important reason my friends that i for one will dedicate this years Valentines Day to my unsung hero my mother . May you be rewarded for everything little thing that you did for me MOTHER . <p> Lynn 4 months ago <p> I recently started seeing someone from my past . We live in two different states . Had two dates and we slept together . He texts me and I know he cares about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . What 's up with that ? <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 4 months agofrom Chicago <p> Tell him you like phone calls . That 's the only way he 'll know you like phone calls . <p> Sammy 4 months ago <p> So , there is this guy I know . We did a class together and later on we became friends . Over the ending of our class , that 's when we really first started to talk to each , then over the ending of the summer we really connected and we 'd talk daily . But I still ca n't figure him out . We once went on a group hang out , just three of us . I thought he liked my other friend , but that day he was always next to me , always only really talking to me and stuff . Then for the rest of the summer and the months that followed , we would speak every day . Sometimes he 'd get strangely mean towards me . Then other times , he 'd either share things about his past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times he drunk texted me after being out with ' groupies ' lol . Fast forward to now , we still talk pretty much everyday , he 's never said to me verbatim that he 's interested , so it 's just sometimes what he does makes me wonder if he is , or not . I noticed he started saying good morning more often too and he says he really enjoys talking to me and our conversations are fun , he 's complimented me before saying I am talented and such , but what throws me for a loop is that he now as of late seeks my advice on girls he 's ' interested ' in , or just people he think it could possibly work with . And then he insists on sometimes telling me about his dating ventures . How , in a case like that would I narrow down if he 's interested in me or not ? Especially since he 's never said it . <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 4 months agofrom Chicago <p> He might not be reading that you 're interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly for friendship . I think you should be straight with him and ask him how he would feel if you took it romantic . That 'll stop your own anxiety , you 'll get an answer , and some direction here . If he is as good as a friend as you describe , he 'll still be in the picture . You 'll feel better if you stand up to your feelings . And having this conversation we only strengthen the two of you . <p> Jasmine 4 months ago <p> Okay , so . I 'm sure he likes me , but I wan na make sure . <p> So there 's this popular guy at my school , right ? Well , I got his number through prank calling . And my phone saved his number , so I left it at that , and did n't bother with it for a while . Until I was texting a friend named Hayden , about , well personal shit . I sent the message " Hey , dude , are thing better with your mom ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular kid . So he sent me the message " Lol , wrong number homie " and so I apologized multiple times , for being dumb and he just said " Its fine who are you btw " and I replied back with " I 'm Jasmine . " and he replied with " Ok " and I left it at that , cause it would be creepy to send him anything else . <p> Well a month later , I got a new message from him , ( I thought he deleted my number , but I guess not ) <p> He was like , " Are you friends with Alyssa ? " and after that we started talking from that , acting buddy on buddy , and let me say he was replying immediately , laughing at ever little story I told , and after a while , he said " pic ? " and I was like " I do n't feel comfortable .. my self esteem .. is not that high . " and he replied back with " Do n't worry , i 'll give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of himself , ( i could tell he was shirt less because all it showed his shoulders with no sleeves expect bare skin ) , and then I sent a picture of myself , and he just said " oh yeah , ive seen you at school " and I agreed , and ended the conversation there . And then suddenly out of nowhere , he sent a message saying wyd , and started it up again . I talked to him more after that , and then I told him I really wanted to meet him for being so chill and he was " Sure . Yeah ! Of course . " and he seemed really up to it , and after that we talked so naturally to each other . But i 'm not sure if he s being really nice or what ? <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 4 months agofrom Chicago <p> Sounds like he is interested and wants to see where it goes . He found the way you guys met intriguing , so he wants to see if that quirky connection would be like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed natural rather than forced . <p> Anonymous 111 4 months ago <p> So I met this guy at my cousins party , I did n't talk to him that day . But the next day since we had a little family get together again , basically an after party , I saw him again we did n't talk at all . <p> But then later about 2 hours before I left , I talked to him nervously , and he kind of talked with few words . <p> Then I asked him if he had Snapchat , he said no . Then I said if he had Instagram he said yeah so he gave it to me . But then he asked for my name on Facebook , I told him my name and everything , he added me and after I left I shakes his hand when I said goodbye . <p> Then in the car I texted him hey and he replied with a Hey ! <p> Since the we been talking , it 's been a week since we started talking . There 's been two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him he makes me smile .

Be confident . <p> Lisa 3 months ago <p> Thank you extremely helpful . <p> Newtothis 3 months ago <p> A couple of months ago a male friend and I started texting . Just random things at first , then more personal things about our lives . We are both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legally separated . We both considered it a friendship at first , but our texts became more personal and at times casually flirty . We have talked on the phone twice for hours , but never gotten together to do anything , even just as friends , though we talk about doing so . He is a really really great guy . But his ex wife damaged him emotionally very deeply , so he considers himself completely damaged goods . I have recently developed feelings for him stronger than that of friendship . And because of our ages , rather than just ignore them , I felt it was only fair to tell him how I was feeling , through text of course . I told him I understood if he hated me now and never wanted to hear from me again . He responded by saying first of all he could never hate me , and that he very much enjoyed talking to me , and asked me to give him some time to process and respond to my text . It 's been 2 days and no reaponse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've completely ruined what was a great friendship . Should I just leave him alone now ? Or go ahead and text him and ask what he 's thinking ? I 'm too old for a texting relationship ! <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 3 months agofrom Chicago <p> I think everything is going to be okay . Give a moment to breathe . With that much talking between the two of you , he probably deep down expected this . I doubt it is a complete surprise to him , but maybe if it has been a long time since he 's been single he somehow could be tone deaf here . <p> I do n't think you damaged the relationship at all . I doubt he would hate you , especially for sharing your feelings . I think it was a good thing that you put yourself out there , it is usually better to say those things in person or through a phone call rather than text . Then you can read facial cues or voice cues . <p> If his wife left him in a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relationship . He probably needs to build his self confidence up again , and get his feet wet . When you are emotionally low it can give you low faith in yourself and the world around you -- bad news is this lack of faith can lead to destructive behavior . <p> He may honestly not be ready for a serious relationship , and that 's not on you . You have n't done anything wrong . Leave him alone for about a week , then send him something that is friendly , warm , and possibly funny . Do that to break the ice a little and bring some positivity here . He might not give you a real response after that , but you 'll get the wheels turning again to at least be conversating comfortably . He may take some time to process this , and that 's okay . Some people know instantly what to do ... others take months . ( Most people are more sooner than later when it comes to this . ) So be patient , do n't worry that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texting . <p> So yes , give it a week . Then start friendly texting again . Do n't approach the elephant in the room . He is aware . That 's all you need to do at this point . ; ) Let him know the option is open , get it off your chest , and then let whatever happens ... happen . And you are in that last stage there . <p> I am pretty sure you guys will at the very least be friends here . That 's a good place to be . <p> Paula 2 months ago <p> I realy like a guy+I have a bff .

I hope you can help me to get oit of this mess . Please ......... ; ( <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 2 months agofrom Chicago <p> Do n't jump to conclusions . The two of them may just be friends .

This would conflict with their own goals if they had interest in the same person . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibe . Make sure you trust your friend . Try reaching out to this guy more .

Hope you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Anon female 2 months ago <p> So I need advise even if the truth hurts . A guy and I have been friends for 3 1/2 years and I texted him randomly this week . The texts from him had a lot of the things you posted ... but we were definitely flirting . Just as it was about to blow into more , he abruptly ( feels like it to me ) stopped texting me . After a week , he has n't texted me back at all . I do n't know what 's going on through his head and I 'm definitely not going to blow up his phone . A text with SOMETHING would 've been better than nothing . <p> bunny 2 months ago <p> I 'm a married woman . I know this guy who 's 9 years my jnr and we hang out with this group whom we call brothers and sisters . <p> Somehow we hit off very well and he texts me daily throughout the day with breaks on bet but for sure first thing in the morning before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can text all night . <p> He shows a lot of concern for me and will always want to sit beside me when we hang out with the group . <p> But he told me about a lady he liked and also that he got rejected . <p> We go out occasionally alone . Everytime we get much closer and more personal he 'll address as ' sister ' <p> What do you think <p> Author <p> Andrea Lawrence 8 weeks agofrom Chicago <p> A group you call brothers and sisters ? This sounds ... kind of weird , to be honest . Why use those words ? Since you are a married woman , you may want to address your marriage first before considering another option . He might be seeing you as more of a friend , considering he tells you about his rejection ... and that he calls you a sister . That 's not really a romantic word . <p> Anna Ralph 6 weeks ago <p> i love you Andrew <p> Joisam 6 weeks ago <p> Hello ! I 've been texting this guy for 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking questions about life , work etc ... Sometimes he 's response are long , sometimes short . But he immediately responds to my questions if he has time everyday . He told me that his sorry if he 's response to my questions are short coz his lazy to text long messages and he hopes that I understand . What does this means ? Does he see me only as a friend or his not interested at all ? <p> Another thing is because of language barrier . He lives in another continent . But he tries to respond to my questions in english . <p> Rose 6 weeks ago <p> I can not believe after reading this news ! .

What I mean is , when a man has a certain idea in his mind about you , you have a hidden advantage over him IF the idea he has in mind is a woman who is totally freaking control of her emotions . BUT ... <p> If you give a man the idea that you 're an unpredictable electical switch that will send high voltage currents of emotional drama up his spine , it is very , and I repeat , very hard to make him change his mind about you . <p> Tip#3 - You 've been wanting his commitment , but are you committed to you ? <p> Here 's the biggest secret of all ... it is the pursuit of ultimate and raging self love where he 'll feel so completely crazy because he 'll think you 're in love with another person all together . How does this have to do with seduction ? You ca n't seduce a man if you have n't seduced yourself . If you want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , you 've got to get him to SEE , learn , and KNOW that you 're a first class woman who wants your best interest first . <p> Tip#4 - As mentioned in number 1 . I know this is a far cry from those little tantalizing tid bits you read in those mags because they want to sugar-coat you with sneaky lies by taking the back route . You can sex a man for hours on end and he 'll just thank you for it but this wo n't bring his heart to escape with you IF you do n't know how to get inside his mind . <p> Tip#5 - Do n't be anything for a Man ! ! ! Do n't be his safe harbor , his love siren , his little red pill , his sex pillow ... NOTHING ! The less you are for a man , the more he 'll be for you . <p> Tip #6 - When you read advice that tempts you to BE something or DO something for a man to want you more , approve of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it does n't have anything to do with helping you create an inner shift within your soul . <p> Tip#7 - Your soul builds your relationships . Period . You can follow empty rules or you can go above the rules . If you do n't want to change , forget about seducing a man to change his behavior to suite you . <p> Tip#8- Know what seduction is ... and what it is n't . Getting all giddy and batting your eye just wo n't do it . You have to show up . You have to drop a bomb . In order to do this , you have to FEEL powerful . If you are acting like a little school girl high on sugar , well forget it . Do n't even bother trying to seduce a man or try to change your man IF you do n't feel powerful inside . No power = no results . <p> Tip#9 - Men respond to action , not words . All of the " communication skills " you 've been learning all of these years are a waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule about men . They do n't care how much you talk , they stand to attention when you take action . Become your own action hero and he 'll love you for you . <p> Tip#10 - You noticed that I spend most of the time telling you about how you need to BE ? This is because most of what you read tells you how you need to ACT . Being and Acting are two different things . Stop acting .

@@96276101 @476101/ <h> How to Start a New Life After Separation <p> Have you ever broken up with your long-term partner ? If you have , you may have experienced a variety of highly intense and stressful feelings . Most of these emotions are " normal " and occur in many people living separately . Also , you have to deal with your thoughts and the failure of your relationship for hours , weeks and months . At the same time , you are faced with many new requirements . <h> How to Deal With Your Emotions <p> A common dominant emotional state is deep depression , and depression over the whole range of short periods may extend to to one 's having suicidal tendencies . In particularly bad cases , you can visit a physician who may prescribe you antidepressants . Generally , you can expect an early improvement of this emotional state . Almost everybody suffers depression after a breakup , but it disappears after a period of mourning , and you move on . <p> If you see your separation as a sign of failure , inability or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality . In most cases , both partners are to be blamed for the failure of a marriage . If you feel helpless and like a victim , it 's because you are trapped in passivity , but you must be active , move on and feel better . The lost spouse and love are not a necessary condition for survival , and you can have a happy and fulfilling life without them , too ! When looking for new sources of emotional support and positive self-experience , you can find situations in which you are likely to experience fun and joy . And you should reward yourself when you do things you do not like ! <p> People often have feelings of anger or revenge after separations , especially if partners have suddenly pulled out or if they have been involved in extra-marital relationships . You feel abandoned , degraded and humiliated , and your sense of masculinity or femininity may be hurt . These negative emotions are normal - you should worry only if you are unable to displace such hostile feelings . These feelings and anger can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Questioning yourself about your spouse 's negative view of you leads to thinking that a person you once loved can not be such a bad person after all ! Anger releases large amounts of energy and this is the best way to face new challenges . You should never let yourself be carried away by revenge , as this will only lead to your humiliation . In addition , retaliation would only lead to reciprocal actions resulting in tension , perhaps additional legal fees , oe even jail ( following acts of violence or child abduction ) . Therefore , you only harm yourself and the situation does not change at all . The best revenge would be to start a happy life ... <p> You will often experience a surge of remorse and guilt , especially if you are the one who has initiated the separation . Your extra-marital relationship may be broken or your children may suffer greatly from the dissolution of their family . Think how you would feel as a child if you if you were surrounded by constant marital conflict and unhappy parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel no guilt after the separation whatsoever ! <p> It is normal to feel lonely after the separation , and less attractive , and that you are afraid of finding a new partner . First of all , try to accept the feeling of solitude ; learn to see the positive side of being alone and then go out and enjoy your social circles . Eventually , you may feel free to escape in new relationships in order to avoid loneliness , but it is better if you first see yourself as single and adopt the appropriate lifestyle . Only then ( and after your separation processes are over ) does it generally make sense to begin the search for partners . <p> For dealing with emotions of various kinds , you can take the following principles into consideration : <p> - Learn about the typical course of the divorce cycle . If you expect certain emotions or reactions , you will experience them , as they are rather normal and you should be prepared for them. - Read books on divorce , in which positive management options are presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to experience strong negative feelings over a lengthy time , and also that it may take several years before the separation process is final. - Keep a diary as this will help you get your feelings out and you can become aware of all the changes going on around you. - Try to see the positive side of the separation or divorce , embrace the thrill of the unknown , and realize your ability to develop as an individual . You have a new life ahead of you ! - Play the same roles as before . This way you feel that there is continuity and you feel more secure , despite the separation. - Be aware that you are responsible for your feelings and control them as much as you can . You also have your fate in your hands . The partner or the separation may not be responsible for your unsatisfactory situation ... <p> If you can not cope with your emotions , you should go to a counseling center or a private practice psychologist . You will find a lot of understanding there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also welcome there as long as they do not play the " strong man " and admit that they need help . Men also have feelings and these advisers can help them express them . <h> Realistic and Positive Thinking <p> You may tend to deny the reality of separation , especially if you were suddenly abandoned by your partner . You refuse to make the necessary changes in your life , and those of your children , and even hide at home sometimes . In this case , you have to face the reality ! In most cases , the separation can not be undone and you have no control over your estranged partner 's behavior . <p> Analyze all aspects of the new situation and all the tasks and challenges . The problem is when you see only the negative side , or imagine that certain events ( such as a smile from your ex-partner during a meeting ) have more significance than they really have . This can result in regular negative behavior . <p> If you even experience irrational attitudes and thoughts ( such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be happy with my partner " or " I 'm not lovable " ) , unrealistic expectations ( " My ex will come back on their knees " ) or divorce myths ( " Every separation is a big disaster for all concerned " ) , you should check with reality and use your logic . You will usually not find any evidence for them and you have to gain a more realistic view of your situation . <p> It is also important that you work through the separation experience , perhaps with the help of a consultant . Try to identify what " marriage " , " family " , " home " and their loss mean for you . Look outside of your marriage and the ideals once associated with it and replace them with other hopes and feelings of security . You will often have intense positive and negative ties with your spouse or partner , which can only be resolved slowly . <p> You will succeed in doing this if you do not think of the spouse so much , if you spend less time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reconciliation or revenge aside and you do not fantasize about your current life ( such as new partner relationships ) . Talk less about the separated spouse , do not call them under silly pretexts , stop your sexual relationships and do n't threaten legal disputes . It is often useful to clear away items that constantly remind you of your partner , to learn techniques of stopping your thoughts or to reward yourself when you do not think about them for more than an hour . <h> Meet Practical Requirements <p> It is understandable that you feel completely overwhelmed and stressed by the new situation after the separation , ignoring the necessary changes or running away from them . You often feel without energy , you are passive or even see the smallest problems as insoluble . The best thing to do is think that you do not bear all the difficulties in the world and that you can solve any problems you may have , but that it can usually take a considerable amount of time . <p> Arrange the tasks in terms of priority or difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks and these can be divided up again . If you meet them , you have initial feelings of success , you gain self-confidence and you are motivated to face even tougher challenges . You discover your own strengths , skills and resources . Also , you should consider that you do not have any tougher challenges to face because you have already been faced with some very serious problems . Therefore , you can overcome anything if you have succeeded in overcoming these . <p> Of course , relatives and friends are of great importance in such a situation . You can find emotional support from them , practical help and childcare opportunities ( short term ones ) . The development of your children is also improved if you integrate them in different social networks . Many relatives and friends take one party 's side , so that the network of friends as you know it may be divided into two camps . Then , it is important that you try to find new friends very quickly . <p> Very often , parents can not resolve their practical tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this is a problem which can usually be solved right away . As a separated woman , you need a lot of information about your financial rights ( right to maintenance , social assistance , housing allowance , educational support , etc. ) , especially if you are inactive . You should know that the Youth Office can make support payments under LAA and maintenance payments for younger children if the debtor does not pay . They may also represent the interests of the children with the other parent . <p> As a non-working woman , you may need information about any school or college degrees which you might want , and on funding opportunities ( spousal support , through the Employment Office , after EED ) . A vocational training company can also provide professional training aid . The resumption of employment , training and retraining can be supported under the Employment Promotion Act ( AFG ) and other legal documents , but this is the kind of information you get from the employment office . If you do not know how to apply , you can visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are working or you have to work again , but you have to leave your children alone , you need information about childcare . If there are not enough places in kindergartens or nurseries and daycare centers , you should not worry because you have an advantage as a single parent and you can be helped with the allocation of places . The Youth Office covers the costs of childcare , or at least part of them . Sometimes , there are all-day schools nearby . A permanent placement of children is possible in foster homes , boarding schools , students ' and apprentices ' residences , professionally supervised youth communities or homes . <p> Look for a council house and get further divorce help and recovery help from the housing office . You may have had nothing to do with financial management so far so you should definitely take steps to learn about it . You can go for Adult Education and Family Studies , or you can start attending cooking and baking classes or learn about nutrition and home economics at a counseling center . Do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get adequate sleep . <p> Finally , you should not hesitate to go to a support group . Here , you can meet people in the same situation as you and you can share your problems and get guidance . You will receive emotional support , useful information ( on financial commitments , public services , low-cost shopping , friendly contacts in government agencies , useful books , etc. ) and sometimes even practical help ( such as reciprocal child care ) . <h> Comments 64479 @qwx924479 <p> sending <p> Renee c 6 years ago <p> My husband and I have just relocated overseas for the next 3 years , yet can not workout how we feel for each other and may not stay married when we return .

@@96276102 @476102/ <h> Signs and Symptoms : Is She Flirting ? <h> A Better Understanding of Flirting <p> I feel that many people misunderstand what flirting really is . With these misunderstandings , flirting can be taken out of context very easily . In a relationship this could lead to issues of trust or doubt , while in other situations it might be taken as an over the top sexual gesture . <p> So the only way to get around these misunderstandings , is to understand the true nature of flirting . So we are going to do just that ! <p> What is Flirting ? <p> According to encarta , flirting is the art of acting alluringly . It is someone who is behaving in a playful way , and is even defined as when a person ' flicks ' another person . <p> In essence , flirting is the act of showing genuine interest in another in an inviting manner . Often it happens through charismatic behaviors and a sweet demeanor . <h> Reasons Why Women Flirt <p> I ca n't speak for every woman . Though through my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , there are some main reasons why woman will flirt . <p> To Achieve a Desired Outcome - A woman may be seeking to get that promotion , to sweet talk her way out of a ticket , to convince someone she is more innocent that she appears to be , or even to get a better price on that new car she wants to buy . The goal might be to get her mate to get something for her or to do something for her , or it might be to cheer someone up who has been in a rough patch . <p> Accidental Flirting - As much as some may refuse to admit it , flirting is natural and takes place much more often then you might think . This is because flirting is a natural resource and instinct that both men and women possess . When it pops up accidentally , it was usually in a moment of connection with another human being . It might have been that super nice waiter . It could have been that guy or gal who smiled at us when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons and often does . Even if you do n't consider yourself to be the flirtatious sort , or you are happily involved , you can look back and think about plenty of times you found yourself accidentally flirting with another person . <p> Human Connection - We all get lonely in life . Even when we have been in long term happy relationships , it 's still nice to have other connections in the world . So sometimes a woman will flirt when she is lonely , wants to feel special or just wants to make a connection with someone outside of her normal circle . <p> Sex &amp; Hormones - That 's right , the least common reason a woman will flirt is to get sex . Even when she is flirting to get sex , it 's often just because she ovulating and her hormones are telling her it 's time to attract a mate . If she already has a mate , she 'll often flirt with him , though sometimes those hormones can spill over into the rest of life as well . If she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's probably for sex . <h> Signs That She 's Flirting <p> Standing Close - When we want to get close to someone , we do just that ! We get closer to them physically . This usually starts out in small increments , so that we can gauge how close you 'll let us get ... <p> Smiling - This one is confusing , because a woman could just be smiling because she is happy or trying to hide that she is unhappy . Though if she is smiling AND showing other signs of flirting , then it 's definitely flirting . <p> Laughing - We could 've have genuinely found your joke to be funny , but in most cases , we just wanted you to think we think you 're funny because we 're flirting with you . <p> Direct Eye Contact - Most women use indirect eye contact for normal situations . And while there are some situations that call for direct eye contact that have nothing to do with flirting , in most cases , direct eye contact from a woman , means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Physical Contact - If we were able to get close enough to you during a conversation , then we will reach out and touch you . It might be a jovial little shove , a hand on the arm or a simple brush up against you . Even the subtlest touch is an indication that 's she 's flirting . <p> Playing With Her Hair - This is usually a sign of nervous energy when we are flirting , though there are plenty of woman who know how to use that hair ... <p> Mirroring - It 's natural for a human being to mirror the movements and speech patterns of a person they are interested in . Even if the interest is innocent , you can tell she 's flirting if she 's obviously mirroring the person she 's conversing with . <h> Do n't take it out of context <p> Remember , she might not be flirting with you for any particular reason . It could be accidental , and often is . So when she 's flirting with you , do n't automatically assume that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Remember also that if you are in a relationship with a woman and you see her flirting with another person , that does n't mean she is going to cheat on you . It could be that she does n't realize she was flirting , or that she has another motive in mind that has nothing to do with infidelity. 
@@96276105 @476105/ <h> Should You Keep Pictures of Your Ex ? <h> You are in a new relationship , but still have pictures of your ex . <p> Do you keep them , or not ? <p> A local radio station , here in Seattle , has Therapy Thursdays where they choose a listener 's problem/question for other listeners to call in and give their advice about . <p> A recent question was from a woman about to move in with her boyfriend . The boyfriend still had a picture of his ex-wife , with whom he has children , hanging in his home . The woman thinks he should take the picture down , but he does n't think he should . <p> The majority of the callers said he needs to get rid of the picture . <h> However , I ca n't agree that he should get rid of the picture . <p> Every relationship requires understanding , trust , and compromise . If you are ready to move in with somebody , you need to have all three of those things first . <p> In this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the mother of this man 's children . I can understand that it might be uncomfortable for the woman to be uncomfortable with a picture of her mate 's ex-wife hanging in her home . But , will she also be uncomfortable with the children coming around and talking about their mother ? The children are also constant reminders of a romantic relationship that no longer exists . <p> In my opinion , the best solution to this problem is a compromise : put the picture up in the children 's room . This way , it is still in the home , but not in the ordinary living areas . <h> When should you get rid of pictures ? <p> I do not advise every couple to keep pictures of their exes around after embarking in a new , serious relationship . So , when do you get rid of the pictures ? <p> If your new love interest is really threatened and insecure about you keeping pictures of your ex , it might be because you put a lot of importance on your past relationship . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship is , you can get rid of old pictures . <p> You can also compromise by putting the pictures away . Especially if the pictures are group shots , with other friends , they might be fun to look at in twenty years . If you and your new love are still together then , old picturesof an ex should n't be a big deal by then . <h> What I do n't recommend is point blank refusing to get rid of pictures . <p> The best way to dealing with this situations is talking about it--I do n't mean arguing or fighting , but actually talking about it . <p> A healthy relationship can only exist with a lot of open communication . If both of you can express your reasons for wanting to keep or get rid of the pictures , you will both learn a lot about your relationship . In fact , it might be the thing that keeps you from becoming exes . <h> What do you think ? Keep pictures or not ? 64479 @qwx924479 <p> sending <p> jtboswell 9 years ago <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex . Any and all pictures of just the ex and the other person together should be done away with . If there are children in the pictures with the ex and the other parent put it in the kids room .

Second , the picture of the boyfriend 's ex-wife should hang in the children 's bedrooms or a rec room , but not in the kitchen , the living room , or the master bedroom .

What if you are friendly with the ex too ? Are pictures from when they were a couple acceptable to keep or just friendly pics ? <p> LoVeLyMe = 9 years ago <p> well i still have pictures of my exs , but then again i 'm not married n have n't been either , but well its not exactly smart to let the other person or ur new fling see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them everyonce in a while .. <p> Jennlee3741 9 years ago <p> I only have pictures of one ex ... and that is only because they good pictures of my boys/birds . I do not keep them out in plain view . My most recent has kept pictures of me and us , and it is really weird because I 'm already on his new fiancees ' bad side because he wants to remain friends . Usually I am big on the destroying of all photographic evidence as part of the healing process ! <p> burn-calories 9 years ago <p> Vivid memories are better . <p> RFox 9 years ago <p> I definitely agree with the ' no ex pics hanging up rule ' . Who wants to see photos of their ex everyday anyway ! ( Just my opinion ) However , I was married once and the one thing I really did n't know what to do with were the wedding pics . Obviously I would never show them to a new beau even though I 'm honest about my divorced status . But I also do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple , so destroying them seems improper . Not to mention the photos have other family members in them etc . If anyone has advice on what you should do in this circumstance I would like to hear it . For now they remain in a box in my closet where they have been since the divorce . Great Hub ! <p> Hope Alexander 9 years ago <p> I think when you 're truly over your ex , you wo n't want to keep the pictures . Personally , I hold on to things that have sentimental value . Those things do not include pictures of my ex - well , except in storage , because I imagine one day , when I 'm old and grey , I 'll sit on the porch in my rocking chair and make voodoo collages out of the pictures from my i 'll spent youth . <p> Author <p> Stacie Naczelnik 9 years agofrom Seattle <p> I 've heard that a lot of divorced couples split the wedding pictures .

He had already kept friendships going with some ex girlfriends and he also had pictures of his 2 &amp;quot ; standouts&amp;quot ; the ones he was really in love with . We had arguments about them and he refused to get rid of them . THEN 8 days prior to our wedding he tells me he had sex with his female BF once or twice-which he said he did n't . It took us getting married , me getting pregnant and the flu before he got rid of them , then a few years later , I find out by looking in his trunk that he had actually kept some-still . My advice , pictures &amp;amp ; friendship with ex 's will RUIN your life and take away from the foundation of your marriage . <p> barnabybear 9 years agofrom Columbus , OH <p> I think that the more recent the pictures the harder it is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep hold of them I suggest putting them away . <p> newlymarried 9 years ago <p> Asking a spouse or boyfriend to take down picutures of their ex ( be she the mother of his children or not ) does not indicate that a person is &amp;quot ; threatened or insecure . &amp;quot ; It is a simple setting of boundaries in a relationship . If some guy I 'm dating has a picture of his ex-wife on the wall , I 'm thinking he has some seriously unresolved issues with her . It would be an indication to me , that he is not ready to be in a serious relationship with someone else . <p> karen 9 years ago <p> keeping pics will eventually cause problems now or later , if they are in storage someone will find them an a conflict will usually arise . <p> jennifer 9 years ago <p> Hell no ! ! !

Having a picture of an ex on a wall is a bit odd , in the living room , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from travelling we did . Those were great trips , and part of my history , part of what makes me who I am . They are in a cupboard - somewhere ! <p> Vicky/Phoenix 8 years ago <p> My bbf of 4 mos still has his ex wife on the living wall . He changed the frame lately and I thought that was weird . I did n't have a problem with her pic hanging up until he changed the frame . It was an upgraded nicer frame . Anyone think this a bitt off ? <p> sandy 8 years ago <p> mine keeps them and now he is an ex and guess what , i keep no pics of him either <p> XENA 8 years ago <p> Pics of the ex should be banned completely ! An Ex is a past memory and the woman in your life should be the apple of your eye . Esp if hanging them up upsets her you need to toss them away forever , or hide in a shoebox and let it stay there . <p> bruce1789 8 years agofrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the very least he should not have them so prominently displayed where its easily seen . <p> I can understand the girlfriend being uncomfortable about it as , who knows he might be hoping that they can somehow get back together ? There is such a thing as " Sex with your Ex " which in my opinion is a bad idea . <p> Brigitte 8 years ago <p> I think that an is the past and if you are starting a new relationship with someone else you should n't have pictures saved or displayed all over your computer or house . It only shows me that you have n't let go of the person and that there is unresolved issues between you and tht person . It is disrespectful to keep pictures and videos of your exs .. simple . If you are moving on with your life and have someone that is important to you , you should n't need reminders of what you had but start making reminders of what you " have " . <p> cindy 8 years ago <p> my fiancT keeps a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says it is uncomfortable to show them to me. so of course i went through all the pics , how could i not ! he does n't know that i looked through them . I find it very disturbing that he holds onto this past life of his , since we are engaged and says I 'm the love of his life . I have never told him to get rid of these pics , i would like for that to happen on it 's own . But I see that it wo n't . i have no pics of any ex's. they are out of my life and out of my mind and my focus is on the love i am with NOW . I would like to think that he thinks the same . Holding on to his past pics shows me he may still have feelings or cares for his ex 's , and ca n't bring himself to put them in the past . <p> Feerless 8 years ago <p> The guy I used to date and I had a fight over he still had the photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told me he went to get rid of them and I believed him . Sometimes later , I checked the draw accidently and found all the photos still there . He was just removed them from one draw to another and thought that I would not find out . I dumped all of them in the dumpster and felt really good after that . Of course how can I marry a LIAR so I broke up with him soon after that . <p> jj 8 years ago <p> How Pathetic , they are exes for a reason ! if someone has chose to be with you then why are you all worrying about a little photograph , photos represent the past and of course people have exes in the past , <p> IF someone wanted to be with there ex still they would be with them simple ! a photo is a photo it can not come alive ! ! so all get over yourselves , and to the girl who threw out the photo 's , that 's just spitefull and you have issues ! ! that 's throwing away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you one day ! <p> Vanessa 8 years ago <p> I am so glad I found this Hub ! <p> I am having this issue right now with my fiancT , his mother has kept a box with all his old school stuff . It has love letters , pictures , grades , the box is just full . So , I decided , with him sitting right here , I would go through it , as we went to Junior Kindergarten together when we were 5 . So , I began to go through it , and I found pictures of him with his ex 's , love notes , a love book , and other love notes from random ex 's as well . I have no idea how his mother go this stuff , but she did . <p> So , I do n't want the pictures or love notes/book in our house , and told him I was throwing it out . He started to freak out , and say it was from HIS mother , and this was HIS past .. and got really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that I was married before , and HAD to get rid of ALL my wedding photos and everything to do with him . <p> So , I have asked him why he did n't want me to throw this stuff out , and it I wanted to because it bothered me , he has a life with me and 2 children , why is he hooked on keeping these pictures ? <p> I already have trust issues , and he does not help by doing this . I need to be reassurred , and him keeping these pictures and he wo n't tell me why , makes me wonder . He gets so angry and defensive which is a HUGE red flag .. I just do n't know what else to do . <p> Lu 8 years ago <p> I have moved in with my boyfriend of three years , and he has finally agreed to take down his ex-wife 's pictures from our bedroom walls . However , he carries pictures of his ex-wife in his lunch box every day and shows them to fellow employees , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep ending up at the bottom of the stack . He did have his ex 's pictures displayed in the visor of his car , and I had to look at them whenever I rode in his car . I do n't mind his keeping pictures of his ex , but I do n't think it 's right for him to carry them with him at all times - he even carries more pictures of his ex than he does of me . I told him the pictures belong in a photo album - not in his lunch box , pockets , or visor . What do you think ? <p> brown 8 years ago <p> My husband of seventeen years has an ex wife who insist on taking pictures with just him and their children at family events . What do you think ? <p> Awesomeness 7 years ago <p> Before I discovered these photos , we 've been engaged for about a year . We stayed with his parents for 3 months , then one day he was at work , and I had this itch to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Hoping I would n't discover anything more than just an album of his high school gf 's , in a separate compartment there was a zipper bag of more photos . Nosy me , went through them all . For some odd reason , I felt betrayal . As if hoping that he would already ditch these things in the midst of being serious with me . I can see how it should n't bother me , but it did tremendously . At the time I was already 6 months pregnant . It was almost as if he was collecting pictures . They were pictures of them attempting to be cute , with messages on the back , each saying " I love you " etc . He was engaged a few years prior to us , and he kept his promise ring from her , along with her pictures and notes . I think I hurt so much because I did n't want to imagine any other woman in love with my fiancT . But that 's inevitable now a days . Also , considering the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke his heart , or used him for money , it is odd that he would keep their pictures . He says he has them kept away , and he does n't go back in the drawer . Personally , when I break up with someone I rid all their things , only to rid the memories I had with them . When I asked him why he kept his promise ring and pictures of his exes piled up like a collection , he said throw them away . Obviously I did . However , a huge part of me would rather have him throw them away . It 's apparent that if he wanted them discarded he would have done so himself . Also his parents keep his prom pictures up in the living room , where he 's holding hands with other woman . I do n't know if I should say something about that , I have n't yet , but it seriously bothers me every time I go over there . She has pictures of our son up , and her family . Is it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2 different woman all over him . <p> Rosie 7 years ago <p> God I am so proud of my boyfriend after reading all these stories <p> Jolie 7 years ago <p> I had similar issues with my partner . He had been split from this girl for three years when we met , and when we eventually got together he still had all her pictures/postcards etc . I did n't bother me for a good 8 months , until I thought about the fact that I 'd lost my virginity to him with her face tacked to the wall behind me . <p> Enough was enough , so I questioned why he kept them . His answer was that he could n't be bothered to throw them out - I mean c'm on . Blu-tacked to a wall ? All you 've got to do is pull it off ! Anyway , I explained that it was making me uncomfortable as we had been together for a while and they had been split for such a long time and he agreed to remove them with no problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of it , and that 's when I lost my cool . Deliberately deceiving your partner is n't really my idea of fun . <p> It 's been roughly two years since then and it still makes me angry sometimes to think of it . Personally , if my ex kept stuff from me I would be freaked out - in fact I 'd probably demand that he removed them . <p> I 'm the kind of person who does n't believe in clinging , which is what I think holding onto those kinds of items is . I do n't think it 's emotionally healthy , as well as a waste of time . It 's called the trash . <p> Ann 7 years ago <p> I am married for 2 years now , I started living with my Husband for a couple months now . I saw pics , accessories and video tape with my husband and his wife . I am very envious . I do n't want to see these things in my sight , If my husband loves me and wants to make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his pass , because I am his present . <p> peri 7 years ago <p> I found three framed photos of my husbands ex in a drawer in his desk at work . What does that mean . THey have been divorced for ten years . He says he hates her but I am feeling like he is still attached to her . By the way we have only been married two years and he will rarely have sex with me . They are not having an affair . <p> Michelle 7 years ago <p> Peri , there are lots of reasons people keep pictures of their exes . I have pictures of my exes in a box in the closet , because I keep lots of photos from my past . I do n't throw out pictures of dead relatives or pets , and exes are still a part of my past . I still cringe when I see them by accident , but maybe that 's a good thing . <p> Your sexless marriage probably has nothing to do with the photos you found . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to intimacy and communication . <p> Ann , how can you be married for two years but only living with your husband for a couple of months ? It sounds like you have a lot more to worry about than a few photos or videos ! <p> Jane 7 years ago <p> i 'm married for about 2 mths now , my husband used to be a very wild person , who have sex a lot with his " frens " . <p> i was a virgin and i gave it all to him on our wedding night . <p> we 've been quarelling a lot , cause i found out tht he cheated on me before our engagment when he promised he would n't . <p> then recently , i found out a folder , full of porn ( which he deleted in front of me ) and also sec videos of him and his girl frens . <p> what does it mean by tat ? why does he still keep all those videos ? now he do not allow me to touch his laptop anymore . so there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those pics and videos or not . <p> jane 7 years ago <p> sorry , i meant SEX VIDEOS OF HIS WILD TIME with his girl frens . <p> Marissa 7 years ago <p> My boyfriend was married for 22 years and had 3 kids , and his wife walked out on him . Initially she kicked him out of the house and he had to stay in a rented room for 6 weeks till he found her a house to stay in . So now after being separated for a year he met me , and 1.5 years on he asked me to move in with him , and before when I used to visit for short period of time , the way things were in the house bothered me but not as much as they do now I am living here with him . There is a birthday calendar in the toilet with her writing on it , and also just the general layout of the house is the exact same way that it was when he and his ex had a home together , the only difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no photos of her except in the kids bedrooms . I asked him today if I can make some changes to the house , put some new pictures of us up , also to make me feel more like I have a connection to the home.But he said no , and to wait till we have bought a new house together . <p> Because now I feel as if I am living in another womans shadow . I just feel really hurt and confused , because he is always willing to talk about the future and making a new life with me , but he wants to leave this house this way till he can sell it , as he has put it onto the market . But with the recession and the way things are , it will be another 2 years minimum till he sells this house . I do n't know what to think and do anymore , its also the same story with his divorce , he 's waiting for his wife to sign the papers , he gave her the papers a year ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> destiny 7 years ago <p> I got divoreced 4 years ago and made sure I had no remaining pictures of my ex . The pictures I have with my daughter I kept and gave him the pics of him and the ones of him and my daughter together . But my fiancTe now of 2 years still had pics of his ex who he has a child with and he has n't removed them . I saw some videos of him having sex with his ex and also cyber sex with some other girl . I then phoned him up to question these things and he explained it was before he met me. but still it bothers me why he still kept those tapes ! plus i 'm pregnant with this guy and I have kicked him out ! I do n't trust him anymore . <p> Sienna 7 years ago <p> I 've been dating someone for about 8 mths and he still has pictures of his ex displayed in his apartment . They broke up a month or so before we met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I felt I could n't say too much because not much time had passed since the final end of their relationship . Not to mention that to my knowledge he has been completely honest about the circumstances of their break-up , that they are still friends and do talk on occasion . So after we officially became a couple ( a few weeks ago ) I let him know that seeing the photos of her makes me feel uncomfortable and makes it difficult for me to feel like he is focused on us . He said he understood but when I went to his place a week later , the pictures are still there . By no means do I expect him to destroy any memories ... I guess it just makes me feel lousy when I tell him how it makes me feel and they are still there . <p> Susan 7 years ago <p> My husband has a large collection of DVDs ( maybe 100 or so ) and pictures ( 100s ) graphically depicting sex life with his former wives . He has viewed these on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years we have been together . Whenever I have expressed to him how hurtful this is to me he denies my feelings and says I am nuts . I have to agree , I am nuts that it took me ten years to call it quits . <p> Disturbia 7 years ago <p> I say toss it out . Why hang on to all that old stuff anyway ? After all , is n't the ex an ex for a reason ? <p> I put up with my husband 's collection of old " keepsakes " because he said he was the sentimental type and these were his memories of his life . <p> However , when I found a very provocative 20 year old love letter dated two months before his second daughter was born , I immediately threw it into the trash without even asking or telling him about it . <p> Sentimantal or not , I draw the line when it comes to him keeping mementoes of cheating on his then pregnant wife . <p> Adobe 7 years ago <p> Oh my life ..... This topic hurts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its not nice .. Belive me ! <p> A Male Perspective 7 years ago <p> In this instance , seeing that children are involved ; keeping photos of the mother is acceptable only if they are placed in the kid 's bedroom or another common area . <p> I think it is not a basis of jealousy , or insecurity but , more so common respect for your current mate . <p> It is uncomfortable for a current companion to see photos of someone you had an intimate relationship with in the past . It is simply human nature for such feelings to arise . <p> Having experience this first hand , a number of issues can result . I think as most have stated , the best solution is to simply get rid of any reminders . <p> Jenny 7 years ago <p> I say get ride of them , the past is the past . Photos of " old loves " are hurtful ... our memories we carry in our hearts and if you have old pics to look at ... old memories are going to invaid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ur live with " the ' ove od ur Live " what need is there for old pics ? I say most Men are LAZY when it comes to saying Goodbye to their EGO . <p> loppy 7 years ago <p> Help ! <p> Every man I 've had a serious relationship with has gone back to an ex .... EVERY MAN ... so I obviously have insecurity about the ex thing . <p> My current boyfriend is the type that keeps hold of pictures of his ex has them on his facebook account and most are in easy reach , sometimes he gets a phonecall or a text for him to go and help them with something . I am the type that removes them completely from my life , an ex for a reason indeed . In my opinion neither is right or wrong as people are different some people keep hold of things and some people do n't , some people keep in contact with ex 's and would never go back to them , some people do n't , what I think is important is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to me specifically ... I cant cope at all with him being within such easy reach ... I know logically it does n't make a difference , if he wanted to leave he would , if he wanted an ex he would go and get them if he was in contact at present or not , but at the moment I feel i 'll because of it . I 've told him how it makes me feel and the reasons why . He just says that he s different to me which I agree with and then he does nothing , which does n't help me feel like a couple , if there was a suggestion of compromise it would help but no nothing , he says that I should n't ask him to get rid of them , as he needs to keep hold of who he is . As if I am trying to control him ... which I 'm not ! I just feel sick about it all . <p> jenny 7 years ago <p> My husband was telling a friend about an old hat he used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture to show him because it needs to be seen to be appreciated . A few minutes later my husband goes to the closet , takes out the laptop case , and takes a picture of him and his ex-fiancee out of the front flap ? ? ? It was in there along with his airline tickets from a business trip he went on a few summers ago . He says he does n't know why it is in there , yet he knew it was there ... He says I 'm jealous and should be past this in our relationship and got really mad and went to bed . I just want to know how he knew it was in there if he claims to not know why it was in there . Am I wrong to wonder about this ? ? ? <p> rachael 7 years ago <p> I have been having issues about photos of ex- girlfriends . I accept that we all have a past . My husband of just under a year was my highschool sweetheart 20 years ago . When we got back together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boyfriend after him when I was 18 . I was kindof shockedbut accepted that and killed all contact even tho he was a short term relationship that ended in friendship . I have no photos of ex partners except the father of my children who passed away when they were young and ofcourse is not a threat . HE on the otherhand has kept all intimatephotos and letters of his ex-girlfriends that I do n't search for but are just in everything ! When I go to find our old photos or sort out boxes they are there ! And it really hurts ! I have given him cards with meaning .. pictures and they are nowhere to be found ? ? ? that 's what hurts the most.I have considered throwing them out but the guilt gets to me ... Am I wrong in wanting to bring it up with him ? He still has quiet contact with some of them : - ( <p> laura 7 years ago <p> my boyfriend has pictures of his children absolutely everywhere . one is on a display unit that doubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that i 'm ' not supposed to look in ' as it has lots of ' scary stuff from the house ' that he shared with ex wife . i have n't sneaked in their for fear of being caught , but i recently had a flick through the ' album ' and saw one photo of the 2 of them with the kids . i assume it 's the ex as i 've never met her . i get jealous anyway , and this has made it worse . why not throw away such photos , and what else has he held onto ? i do n't feel able to bring it up and am so unreasonably ( ? ) jealous that i 'm thinking of ending it . i do n't want to always feel this way , and have no idea how to resolve it . i admire everyone here for sticking with their partners . <p> mee 7 years ago <p> my g/f has scrapbooks of ex 's and it kills me ! i just do n't get it ... i try not to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on ... i do n't want to waste my time on someone who 's not all in . <p> Ana 7 years ago <p> It 's understandable how it would make people feel but the thing that makes the most sense about keeping pics of the past are that it is what makes a person who they are today . Look at it this way , say one day you suffer from a stroke , disease or are involoved in any accident for that matter . If you suffer memory loss , you will be able to look through those pictures and remember who you are and what you have become . Pictures and memories are the only thing that make somebody who they are , so what happens if you lose your memory , what then ? <p> Jedink 6 years ago <p> I think It lies in the grey area . We can not determine that it is only as a matter of the past . If there is a suspicious behaviour around that , it should be a big problem . No one know about someone feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trust your partner , but you should listen to your instict . <p> I do n't keep pics of my exes . What for ? my brain memory is much wider than pics themselves . I prefer to keep them by myself , not to be seen by other people , especially by new partners . What is over , is over . <p> Before I got married with my husband , ex factor has never been discussed by us , since I thought both of us already free from our relationship more than one year . At our early datings I saw there were several pictures hanging at wall in his appartment , I never asked who she was , although I thought she must be his ex . But at that time , I did not really care . We were just dating several weeks , nothing compared to his relationship with his ex for 5 years . <p> We were together 5 years ( 4 years of them by long distance relationship ) before we got married . After getting married I felt suddenly so uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be found in our current appartement ( not the one they ever shared when they lived together ) . One day , I was looking for something in our drawer in our sleeping room , I was so schocked , because I found there were still bunches of pictures of his last ex and her old love letters to my husband . I talked to my husband that it shocked me , and somehow It hurt me.He said it was only his past , he said that he loves me , he even not thinks about her again.I understand it is his past , I should respect him . Since my husband keeps everything from old time , so I thought , it should not be problem , that he keeps old foresake from his previous relationships . I tried to accept it . Until one day , I found her picture again in other drawer in our desk , as I was looking for home stationary.I could not deal with it . I feel she has been haunting us . To hell no , the pictures were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But yes , he has also a box of old things . <p> As I have been feeling uncomfortable for several month , I talked again with my husband . He finally threw almost of pictures upon his own initiative ( I can tolerate the group picture ) and the love letters . <p> For the pictures of his other exes , I am okay . <p> Jealous 6 years ago <p> I hate my partners pic of his ex . They have one child together and I cant stand the pics of them all together . I even found some pics of my b/f and his ex kissing . I have gone through his pics and thrown lots away of him and her , none of the kid cos I appreciate that is his childhood however , photos of my b/f and the ex do not need to be kept . I have n't told him that I have done this and sometimes feel guilty but then I think , it should n't matter . I am pregnant with his child now and what matters is our relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found anymore I would throw them away too ! <p> sp 6 years ago <p> My BF keeps pics of his late wife and family in boxes , that 's ok . But several months ago I found a little box in his closet with a pic of his EX wife , cute pic with xo 's and luv u 4-ever . I got a little crushed recently when looking for a file I discovered that picture and another of the 2 of them hidden in an unmarked file . Kindof like hiding it ... makes me wonder what else he is hiding . I agree , I think they are still not over what was lost and they do n't realize they divorced 4 a reason . The ex is the past I am the present , luv me or let me go . <p> Heren There 6 years ago <p> My husband still keep his ex pics.From my point of view why should keep it it is the past.He title one of his exs pics my true love.I came across the pics by accident.They contact each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell him she still love him.His ex is still married to her husband and they lived together while she is still married to her husband ? Sometimes i want to let him go nomatter how much i Love him . <p> Sarah 6 years ago <p> I have just found out that my b/f of 6mths has asked his brothers g/f , ( who happens to be his ex ' best mate ) , to get some pics off his ex for him ... He did tell me about them and showed them to me ... But I wondered why he would want them , as they split up over two years ago ! When I asked him about it , he said he just wants pics to remember that time of his life , then got shirty and said that I was being moody and jealous ! Is this a warning sign ? As I now feel I ca n't tell him anything what bothers me , for him to just dismiss it and almost try and turn the tables on me , saying it was me just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I do n't know what to do . My boyfriend says he does not want to share a shelf with my exes . He thinks any picture with an ex in it should be destroyed . I hate to give up my memories . I have wonderful family videos with grand parents who have passed away , etc . How can I throw that away ? It 's like denying my life before I met him . I tried putting them in a box out of site but that is not good enough . I mentioned pawning them off to family members and he does n't like that idea either . I think if I do this , what will be next ? <p> Lorie 6 years ago <p> What is your take on ex wife after being divorced 25 years ago posting on facebook pictures of her old wedding pictures with my husband I 've been with for 7 years ! I feel this is total disrespect ! Not sure why anyone would do this ! This bothers me alot ! She 's the mother of his grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did this to cause us problems ! What do you think ? <p> Sly 6 years ago <p> Hey jj <p> I hope someday you fall head overhills in love with someone and they keep hot sexy pics of their ex and I hope it haunts you ! You clearly have never been in true love and are cold and heartless ! You make me sick ! <p> i have not had many serious relations before him but i would never do what he does , <p> I do n't want to be reminded of my old partners , 100% devotion to the one i love <p> Lanna 6 years ago <p> My ex and I broke up 2 years ago because I had moved out of town . He knew this going into the relationship that it was most likely temporary . However , recently I visited my home town and decided to contact him to see how he was doing , and found out that he still has pictures and videos of us . <p> He claims he has no feelings for me and has moved on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help but wonder why he still keeps them . I also wonder if he has showed these pictures off to others , although I do n't think he is that type of person . <p> Mary 6 years ago <p> Ok , so i understand that a man is going to have a relationship of some sort with his ex wife if children are involved . I 'm ok with that . I have been with my boyfriend for 2 1/2 years and living together for 2 . We have been through plenty of ups and downs but the recent one involved having a picture of his ex wife in his phone that was sent to him by her ! ! ! His daughter was going through pictures and ran up to me to show me one of her mom at work and of her new born baby brother . The mother remarried but her parents kicked her husband out less than a year later ! That 's her situation ... Anyway , when i comfronted him about it in private , he gave me the lame ( 5yr olds ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " ! I 'm at a standstill and love him to death , but I do n't think i was wrong in this situation . I did n't even ask him to delete it cuz it was in his phone , he did anyway . What reason is there to keep an ex 's picture after more than a year of seperation ? ? ? ? ? ? <p> krosen12 6 years ago <p> I am in a bind . My boyfriend and his ex broke up more than 5 years ago- his ex is now remarried . I am not threatened by their relationship , but sometimes curious since he rarely talks about it . We have been dating almost a year and have a wonderful relationship . However , recently my boyfriend left two huge cd cases which are filled with dvds at my house . While searching for a dvd to watch , I found one dvd with my boyfriend and his ex 's name on it . I was too tempted not to check it out . So I watched it . There was nothing bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I feel like I did something bad by looking at it without his permission . Do I tell him I watched it ? or is this something I should just keep to myself ? I do n't want him to lose trust in me . I wish I never saw it . <p> Sheila 6 years ago <p> I have a friend who was engaged to a girl who passed away tragically 5 years ago . He has had a hard time of it over the past few years , obviously--this was not a break up , rather something that he never wanted to have happen in a million years . He has found a new love and I am happy for him . She destroyed pictures of his deceased fiancTe and destroyed furniture and property that used to belong to her . She insisted that he drop all family and friends of his dead fiancTe off Facebook ( they are hurt and confused because they felt there would always be a bond between them ) . She found pictures on his computer of his dead fiancTe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a past . She will never be a part of that time period . He should be able to remember someone that he loved . He is allowed to have a picture of his brother who died when he was a boy hanging on the living room wall , just not the dead fiancTe . Do n't get me wrong--he does n't wave these pictures in her face or anything and they certainly are n't  hanging on the walls , but I know he might enjoy a picture to remember her by . There are 6 friends that come over to his house and from time to time a memory or story may come up that involves his dead fiancee--we are not allowed to talk about her at all . Ever . Again-- <p> Sheila 6 years ago <p> Oops ! ! Anyways , He loves this new girl and has done everything she asks of him--get rid of it all , do n't talk about her , do n't be friends with any of her friends and family . I 'm sure the new control freak girlfriend will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these things , and eventually she will be gone and he will be left with no memories of his dead fiancTe and no girlfriend . She 's crazy . I am married and my husband has an envelope of pictures from his previous marriage . He also has a photo collage of his daughter and his ex hanging in his daughter 's room . This is a comfort thing for the daughter when she comes to stay with us--she misses her Mommy--understandable . She also has a picture of her Daddy at her Mommy 's house to remember Daddy by when she 's at home . Totally reasonable . Am I jealous of an envelope full of photos from his past taken before he even met me ? ? Of course not--that 's silly . They are pictures . He loves me and made a commitment to be with me . We have been married for 10 years and have 2 wonderful children together , as well as a wonderful ( step ) daughter . Get over your partner 's pasts I say--it was a time before you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen to be with you now , so live your life forward from this point . Do n't begrudge him a few pictures and memories from his past . I also have photo albums of pictures , of which I 'm sure have ex boyfriends in them .... does this bother my husband ? Not at all . We have no secrets--if he asks me who this is in the picture--I tell him . Straight up . Because I have a picture of an old boyfriend does that make me more likely to run off and have an affair with him--doubtful . I 'm married and happy . They are ex 's for a reason . Keep your pictures folks . <p> Sheila 6 years ago <p> She is nuts and what 's gon na happen when they break up ? All those wonderful memories of his love will be gone . I lost my fiancT 4 months ago . On the day I found out I was pregnant with our first and our only child . It tears me apart to think of ever letting those pictures go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very young so to say I will be alone for the rest of my life is unreasonable . When the time comes I will make some concessions like putting them away in a box or all in my son 's room . I was not broken up that love never goes away I 'm not sure anything you find after will compare . There will always be this big cloud of broken hopes and dreams for me . Being that in love I know he died feeling that way . I will die feeling that way about him no matter who may come after . I only have these photos and videos left , he can never take another with me . They are priceless . I would talk your brother into evaluating what kind of girl he 's with . She 's not being repectful of what he lost . I can bet a million his late gf would never have asked that of him . Your right about talking to your partner . Its may be a trust issue in some cases but what threat is a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do wonder about is what am I supposed to do with the more intimate photos/videos ? <p> Aaron 6 years ago <p> Do n't know how I came across this hub , but very interesting . Not long ago I bumped into my ex and her boyfriend of 6 months ( we spilt 5 years ago ) . We got on well and I went back to theirs for a couple of drinks . I noticed she/ ( they ! ) had 7 or 8 photos of me hanging on the living room wall . At the time I did n't think much of it , but now , after being reminded by this site - I think keeping pictures of your ex on display ( especially when you 've a new partner ) , a tad unhealthy ( it gives me the heebie jeebies knowing they 're there ! ) . <p> Chris 6 years ago <p> A while back my hopefully soon to be wife found a couple pics from years ago of my first wife ( torn half naked , could n't see much of anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an old daytimer I found them and was going to throw them away ( just not at home ) well I forgot she found them ... NOT GOOD . So they were thrown away . <p> I told her that I would for her to do the same if she had any of ex BF 's . She made it clear that what she had was in photo albums from trips etc ... ok not a big deal I can live with that . <p> Now she was snooping on me , so my brain got on the track that just maybe she is just maybe hiding something . Well first place I looked it turns out I was correct she had many photos of ex 's stashed in a box in plain view in our closet . There were pictures of a guy from Cuba which she was talking to for a few months after meeting on her vacation with the gals , half naked ! Also pix of her ex who stole money from her , cheated on her and resulting she got a STD from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Also her best friend is an Ex , I only started to be a bit uncomfortable with this months after finding the pictures of them kissing . Last night we got in a fight and well I let the cat out of the bag by putting the pics under her door . Well she freaked ! ! <p> She still thinks that it is OK for her to keep them because there memories .... oh ya and her excuse is that she is helping raise my kids . <p> What are your thoughts on this situation ? <p> Krystal 6 years ago <p> Chris , <p> In my opinion , ex 's should be the past . And should be left in the past . If you an her are going to get married and love each other than , I think that you should both do what makes each other happy . She should respect you and get rid of those pictures as well as you should not have any pictures either . If I were you , I would tell her that it bothers you a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is friends with her ex-lover . I am a female , and I do not think that it is right to be friends with your ex-mate , not like that ( best friends ) . Talk to her . Do not argue , but tell her how you feel . And if that does n't work , then do the same thing to her , to show her how you feel . Sometimes , that needs to happen in order for them to realize that they are wrong . I wish you best of luck . <p> Celeste 6 years ago <p> Wow ... an interesting subject . 1 week ago , my husband found photos of my ex boyfriend who i was with for 7 years on my computer and was really hurt . I did n't even remember I had them on the computer . I deleted them all , but he said he stayed up all night thinking about it , and he said if he saw him he would want to knock him out . He said he just hates seeing another guy with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aweful in the end . I have no feelings for my ex what so ever , but when he found out i was married with a son and am expecting another baby , he drove down to our old neighbour - stalker ! nah , but he is with the girl with 3 kids and so fat and ugly . i love my husband and have never been in love with anyone before like with him , but I just want to know from a man 's perspective why this would hurt him so much , and why he wo n't just drop the subject and focus on us ? <p> Sticky Situation 6 years ago <p> I friend I worked with introduced me to her son nearly 3 years ago . Her son 's wife had left him 6 months prior . He and I instantly connected and starting hanging out . One thing lead to another and we ended up in a committed relationship . To my knowledge , my boyfriend does n't have any pictures of his ex but the weird thing is that his mother ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her deceased husband hanging in her bedroom . <p> It 's bothered me for a long time but I never let on . I felt awkward having to mention it . My boyfriend and I do not officially live together but spend most of our free time together . My issue is that recently my boyfriend 's mother brought up the topic and mentioned she thought to take it down and replace it with her own wedding photo but was worried how her son would take it . I awkwardly suggested to ask him . <p> I overheard her mentioning it to him a few weeks ago when we were visiting and felt relief . I did n't want to eavesdrop , so I focused on the tv while they talked . <p> A few days ago , we go to his mother 's for dinner and I hang my jacket on her coat rack ( which is placed in her bedroom ) and notice that his wedding photo is still up . I was naturally really disturbed , upset and felt disrespected to the extreme ! <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned I felt uncomfortable about it and he insisted that I am insecure and jealous . That it 's a happy memory and his father is in the picture . I 'm not suggesting that they get rid of the picture , just take it down . He refused and we argued and he broke up with me . I feel extremely disrespected , hurt , and I believe he 's not over his ex . Am I in the wrong here because this seems like common sense to me .... <p> Sandoo 6 years ago <p> O.k. glad I found this hub . I seen all the comments , But what about the deceased ex . I had the eight by ten hanging on the front room wall . After 3 yrs finally took it down When my new boyfriend expressed his feelings . I still however have a picture in my wallet . The other day I was showing a friend a pic of my grand baby . She began flipping through all my photos and asks me who 's this ? When I explained to her it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , She offered her un asked for thoughts in front of my boyfriend . Needless to say My boyfriend got upset about the pic . I do n't think I should have to get rid of my pic . I feel It 's his silly insecurity as a dead man is no threat to him . <p> Confused 6 years ago <p> This has all be quite helpful . I have been dating a man for awhile , and he keeps all his pictures on FB . It would n't bother me so much if I did n't know she could see all of them . Seems odd that he would send her the message that she could take him back with the snap of her fingers . I am not a game player , and I am honest and open with him . If he still loves her , he should be with her . I love him enough that I truly want him to be happy . The lack of respect he has shown me shows me that he , in deed , does n't feel the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accept how things are or leave . I guess I have a lot of thinking to do . <p> Bier 6 years ago <p> I have ( i think ) a less serious problem , but would like advice . <p> I just got married two months ago , and many months ago , at the request of my new wife , deleted all the photos i had of my ex gfs ( there were only 2 exes ) . I do n't  mean naked pictures , I mean all pictures . <p> Keep in mind , I have an iPhone , so every picture in my pictures folder get copied onto my phone . Thousands of pictures , hard to go through every single one . A few months before we got married , she was on my phone looking at pictures of my dog and found one of my ex ( fully dressed ) napping with my dog . She made a big deal out of it and an argument ensued . Then , again today , she found a photo from 5 years ago of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i thought I 'd erased every pic of her , but had one remaining . She accused me of lying to her about deleting photos and said i do n't  know who you are she has n't  answered her phone and its been about 8 hours . Its getting late and I 'm worried . what should I do ? Is it really that bad ? <p> I should also mention that she still has photos of her ex bf on her computer and I have not asked her to get rid of them . The way I see it , it 's part of her past those relationships taught her things , that sequence of events happened in the way that they did so that fate could bring her to me . I do n't like the idea that she has pictures , but can accept it . So , why is it such a crime when I missed one or two while purging my history ? <p> S 6 years ago <p> You folks are crazy . I have pictures of most of my exes . I do n't display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in that included an ex . The pic is almost 10 years old . I am not the slightest bit interested in reuniting with any of these people , but they most certainly are a part of my history and the person that I have grown into being . I would take a pic down if my partner requested I do so , but I certainly would n't throw it away . Unless your partner obviously has continued feelings , or the photo involves pda , I ca n't begin to think of a reason you would want someone to erase a part of their life . Show a little self-confidence ... appreciate everyone 's journey . You are acting like scared little wimps . Oh , and I 'm female so do n't start calling it a dude problem . Certainly , talk your feelings out honestly like any issue , but I would advise you to be less threatened . It 's way hotter than being jealous and demanding . <p> The Ex-Files 6 years ago <p> A relationship without trust is like a car with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go anywhere . With that said you people really need to look inside yourselves and see why you are insecure . People keep pictures to remind them of the good times they once had in their life and not all relationships have ended on a bad note . Most of you are okay with the fact that your significant othesr are still friends with their exes yet the pictures bother you . I have pictures of my ex and my gf does n't care for the simple fact I 'm with her and not my ex . As much as you want them to not dwell on their past you must do the same because you are intimidatd by a woman/man that has actually done nothing to threaten your relationship . So on that note , unless your partner is doing something suspicious do n't worry about it because if you do you 'll soon end up as one of those pictures . <p> bigd 6 years ago <p> Right- I went through my bf 's history on his laptop-not snooping-looking for a website I 'd been on before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sexual nature of his ex-this then led me to look further and found a hidden file on his laptop full of videos and pics of his exes that he had created when he was with me and then viewed them . His excuse-well he did n't know they were there and just looked at them ! He thinks it was wrong of him but just one of those things and everyone would do it ! I know I certainly would n't . When I met him any videos which are of a sexual nature got deleted . Am I right ? ? ? I 've got rid of him today cos I ca n't stand the sight of him and the thought of him watching his ex do what she was doing to him and also what he was doing why he was watching it and why he did ! He said he knows he should have deleted them before- 2 yrs ago- but obv had n't and had no intention to until he 's been caught out . Help please .... <p> sandrajohn201142 6 years ago <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Been together for 3 years , he had an ex whom I found out recently that he still keeps her pictures ( nude ones ) on his PC , physical pictures in his closet and to make it worse he decided to move a street across from her house . What confuses me is that I was introduced to his family , and we are supposed to get engaged this year.My personal anlaysis is that he s not over her , he still checks her profile regularly and chances are he s also checking her pictures on PC to remember what feeling she gave him . <p> What am I supposed to do , if I tell him I found the pictures accidently which indeed happaned when he asked me to look for something in his closet , knowing him he 'd be so mad , shout , scream ... how do I handle this ? how can a guy be or prtened to be serios about someone or even thinks about getting into a relationship when he s not over his ex ? chances are he/or later we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood , I am not comfortable talking to him and not comfortable moving on in this relationship knowing that he pingponged between me and his ex 7 times before , he eventually left her and claimed he only wants to be friends with her and kept on seeing her for 5 months until they had a big fight and he stopped seeing her ? <p> Emma 6 years ago <p> How about this .. my boyfriend had two very large photos of his ex wife above his bed and this was in a house that he bought subsequent to his divorce . <p> I have finished with him not just because of the photos but because he was constantly meeting up with the ex behind my back and she refused to have me in her house but invited him round frequently . <p> Asian Guy in Houston 6 years ago <p> I have been involved with my girlfriend for almost 6 years . She has an album full of pictures of her and her exes or by themselves in her bedroom . One afternoon I was over at her place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I noticed there was one album I asked to see and she was extremely hesitant because they were pictures of her ex boyfriend(s) . I insisted on seeing it , and when I did there was some PDA and some other pictures along with her friends with them in a group . I never met anyone who had an album full of their ex boyfriends pics before . From the beginning , we lived and worked together ( BIG MISTAKE ) , while working together , her exes would call work one by one not on a daily basis but at least once a week and she used to stay on the phone with them in front of my face . Rather than jealousy , I found that extremely RUDE . I confronted her about it and she accused me of being " insecure " and " jealous " when plainly , I thought it was disrespectful . Over the years , her exes kept calling her and she kept talking to them for over 10 minutes with me next to her as if there 's nothing wrong with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would bring up to her friends saying I am " jealous " and " insecure " , over 3 years of that , I 've had it with her and lost interest . We broke up every 2 to 3 weeks for the last 3 years , going back and forth . Today , I told her how much it bothers me and she brought up why I ca n't get rid of my high school class picture with my ex in it . That 's like an yearbook for me with all my friends , my history of high school , how can she compare that to her photo album full of her exes pictures that are non-school related ? ? We got back together 3 weeks ago and I thought everything 's going to fine but it 's not . She yelled and said I wasted 6 years of her life where she could have been married and had children . I 'm done with this nonsense . She 's not going to change . I thought it was a small request but she did n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to move on . <p> Someone in need of advice 5 years ago <p> I am looking for some serious advice . More so spiritual advice than any . I saw this site and thought i would give it a try . My wife and I have been married for 2 months now . I will try to keep it brief , but i get long winded sometimes . She has had 4 sexual partners before me . At age 16 , she was dating and this was her first . He went away to college and they broke up . She then started dating the ( i will refer to him as the " GUY " ) the GUY . They dated for 2 or so years and never had sex . This GUY was a family friend and the families are still friends and she is too . Keep that in mind for later . They broke up and she dated another man , whom which she had sex with . Then that ended , and she then was having sex with a man who she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were watching a show ... the phrase " F .... buddy " was said . She said to me " I had one ... " , with an embarrassed look on her face and then said " you think i am a s .. t do n't you " Hard to respond . So we moved on and got over that . And then i find out the shocker ... she was drunk and then several times just went to the GUY 's house to have sex . She says only a handful of times . I have a really hard time with this . being around , friends , getting his wife a birthday gift , seeing there baby , and just anything to do with him and it mostly stems from this ...... she just willingly had sex with him no questions asked .... it is bothersome for me because while we were in our dating and engagement we WERE having sex . 6 months before we were getting married , she told me that she wanted to stop and that she wanted God to be happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's eyes . I agree , but as human as i am , i just had the thought of " why did all these guys just get to have sex with her " " why is it that i have to be around this GUY who was just looking to get laid " " why am i in this situation " . So before judgement or advice is casted on her or me , here 's about me . I have been with 2 woman before her . I also was married for 4 years , her being 1 of them . I do not have friendships with either one of the woman and i do not desire it . I know for a fact that my wife is more important to me than anyone of my past relationships would be if i even had a freindship with them now . I know the answer to her quesiton of " would you give her up to be with me ? " answer is YES . Well , just this last weekend things really blew up . I 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " straw that broke the camels back " . We have been arguing for days . i have asked her not to bring his name up and not have contact with the GUY and what has happened is that i am " attacking her character " " being her father " " demanding her to obey me " and " unbelievably unreasonable " . I do n't think that she understands my feelings as she has told me that it is my problem and i need to get it fixed and go see someone for help . I need advice and to know ... am I off my rocker ? Do I have a resonable feeling ? Or am i completely crazy and wrong ? <p> jamie 5 years ago <p> Words ca n't describe how good it feels to find these postings ! I am going through something rather difficult . <p> My bf who I just moved in with 2 and a half weeks has got me mindf***ed . Just on the first week of being here I decided to use his computer to check online email , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm doing since I moved 2,000 miles away from home to be with him . So anyways I was on his computer going to get on his webcam to take some cute/sexy pics for him . Then suddenly I stumble upon pictures &amp; videos still in the webcam folder of him and his EX wife ! My dropped and I felt so shitty knowing that my bf who I am completely falling for still has this of his EX wife .. <p> It broke my heart because just that morning I had ripped a picture of my EX bf who I was engaged with but then he cheated on me and I could n't be with him because I could n't understand how someone can say they love someone yet f*ck someone else ? ... <p> He broke my heart and made it so difficult for me to trust , but when I met my bf who I am with now . I felt that I could trust and that things were real and nothing was going to ruin it . Sad thing is I find this after I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ANYONE here besides him .. I have nobody to run to , no one to talk to &amp; I feel like I 'm being destroyed mentally inside from this nonsense that should n't be happening .. <p> He promised me he was totally over her &amp; that he loves me . So when I confronted him with this he was completely sh*tfaced ! Like a guilty person ! I felt like I was dying inside , betrayed , mislead , lied to , fooled . Because I do n't understand why he would n't tell me this beforehand that he had this sh*t ? And then the fact that he got all defensive and refused to delete it all . There was a dirty pic of him grabbing her boob ? ! Now what the hell kind of a memory is that ? ? It 's so disrespectful . It made my views of him change so much .. Do n't get me wrong I love him , but this sh*t hurts . And I told him fine you keep those lame pictures and videos and when YOU are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because of me , I want him to do it because he is DONE with that sh*t . Another thing that gets to me is why does he have to mention her name ? Her name irritates me , and it 's not jealousy . It 's envy because I want him to only think of me and being with me , the person who has done nothing but respect him , care for him , be with him , and love him . I just do n't get it . I understand to keep photographic memories because I have memories aswell but I do n't mention my EX , nor do I secretly attempt to hide pictures of him . Because he is my ex for a reason &amp; things ca n't be changed &amp; good things fall apart so that greater things can come into place . <p> I 'm just truly praying he begins to see what I feel &amp; see what I am to him . Because if not I do n't know how to fake things &amp; I know I ca n't be with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a pathetic memory in the past that f*cked him over so much . <p> howie 5 years ago <p> well , i do n't care what kind of pictures anybody keeps or displays . being in a relationship with someone does n't mean you get to control what pictures they keep or display . <p> My fiancT made me purge pictures of my sons mom , i did it to humor her but now she 's my ex fiancT , the demand for me to purge pictures was the first of MANY demands ... <p> i now realize this is an indicator of real boundary issues , so next time a lover makes a request like this i 'm heading straight for the door ... <p> unknown 5 years ago <p> mine is a little bit different its the mom of my husband keeping photo of her son 's ex.it displayed one of her shelf on her living room.the picture is together with my husband sister and the ex was takin some years ago.i always felt bad everytime i see it it made me not having a nice feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i did n't want to see it its just make me mad and feel bad about them.i got hurt ofourse i have feelings too : - ( .. made me think that maybe that was her favorite lover of her son ... <p> Bonnie 5 years ago <p> to the ones who 's husbands ex wants to take pictures at family events ... I know how you feel ... My mans ex is just like that and what bothers me is that HE wo n't speak up and stop it ... I do n't want to hurt someone feelings either but if it where reversed I would gladly NOT take a pic with my ex .. child or no child ... It 's just an ex 's way of hanging on or trying to have some sort of admonition over the new love in his life ... <p> **26;8393;TOOLONG 5 years ago <p> I 'm right in the middle of this dilemma . What to do with 21 yrs worth of family photo 's ? I 've decided for the kids sake that I keep , put away , family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm doing this so they live their lives knowing that they were wanted and their parents loved each other when they were born . I feel that it the least I can give them , since I ca n't give them a home with a mother and father . <p> I personally ca n't even get to the point of thinking what his girlfriend cares about . I do n't give a shit . He 's still married . That 's her problem and the next and the next ones problem . <p> Yes I 'm mad . I 'd love to burn it all and enjoy every minute of it , but I have to think about my kids . <p> jane 5 years ago <p> i found a pic of my bfs ex in his wallet and he said he forgot it was there . when i asked if he still had feeling foe her he said yes because they got on so well .... when i asked if he missed her he said yes as a friend .... he says he is scared to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to talk to her ) . she was declaring her undying love for him a few months ago , until she found out we were together .. and my gut feeling is that he still fancies her ... am i being paranoid ? ? oh and he also said if we were not together he would probably be back with her just for the company ! <p> RBridge 5 years ago <p> I was married for 15 years and have 3 children and am remarried to a man with 2 children ( all of which are teens now ) . When I got divorced , I kept my ex 's pictures as they are memories to our children . When my ex passed away last year my daughter made a beautiful picture collage from those photos and displayed it at her dad 's funeral . I am so grateful for the kids sake that I had saved all of those photos as it is the only memories now they will have of their dad . So those of you with children , keep that in mind . The collage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current husband has no problem with it as it is a memorial to my kid 's dad . His kids have many pictures on display in our home of them and their mom . ( I am not fond of her , but I would never tell them they could not display her photo ) We are a family and like it or not , our ex 's are part of our children 's family . So we include everyone for the kid 's sake . If you are mature and adult , you do what is best for the kids , not what is best for you . <p> RBridge 5 years ago <p> So keep your photos people . And those of you who feel threatened by old photos , you need to realize they are the past , you are the present and if you want to be the future , get over your insecurities and start creating your own memeories together . And to the woman who 's mother-in-law keeps a photo of her son and ex on display , did you give her a nicely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to display ? Give her a nicely framed photo for every occasion that depict happy times with her family and I am sure she will be very proud to display these photos . <p> BW 5 years ago <p> I am married for 3 years . What if not only you find pictures of your husband 's ex hidden away , but pornographic photos of her ? THAT is what hurt most . I can see keeping greeting cards and face photos but the rest I find to be completely disrespectful . <p> iamad 5 years ago <p> I just broke up with a guy ( dated three years ) that had a self sketch ( partial nude ) of one of his x 's in his bedroom . I guess he considered it artwork so it was ok . I was trying to be reasonable about it but I had to look at it everytime I was in that bedroom . I had a difficult time with it but never said anything ( and he would not have moved it anyway . ) Also he never once put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can say that i did not have a photo of him at place either . However I was waiting for him to make the first move on that one . <p> I am glad I finally ended that relationship . We were n't kids either both in our late 50 's . I think it is ok to keep photos of x 's in a box somewhere . Once the heartbreak of breaking up with someone is past it is also good to look back on the good memories . Some of the photos are like on trips , with other people , family and so on . So ca n't expect to throw all that away . When you are lonely , not in a relationship , older fun to pull all that out and remember . May want to show some new friends <p> one day . <p> Peter 5 years ago <p> I am a guy and I can not see my gf having photos with EXs . I have told her many times to through these stuff away , but still I find pics and love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not important to her . But she still has them . Whenever I see some photos , she puts them away she always says she did not know about that specific one . <p> I am losing my strong feelings for here that 's not what I want to do . It is just natural . <p> Peter <p> danjor 5 years ago <p> My situation begins like so many others ... Finding a picture of his ex ( in my case soon to be ex-wife ) and questioning the need to have the picture rather than the existance of the picture itself . <p> My SO and I have a long history . His parents were friends with mine ... Every summer we traveled from wherever my father was stationed ( I 'm a military brat ) and visited family which included his . <p> We both had feelings for each other , but his somehow grew deeper as he recently claimed . He and I went on his Junior and Senior proms and he carried many memories from our time together - to include keeping pictures from each prom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept them on display in her living room and always desired and made proclaimation that we should have married each other . <p> Seeing that my SO and I never had a steady relationship due to distance etc .... There were many " friends " and a few girlfriends that filled his time and heart as a result . I too had a few crushes and even a few loves , one of which produced two beautiful children , but none of which resulted in marriage . One such love went on to marry a woman with my first and middle name , which I found ironic and oddly flattering . <p> With respect to my SO , he went on to marry a woman who found herself in this very situation . Although I am not here to write about her account , I find it necessary to provide the backdrop to what now results in my own issue of keeping pictures of the ex ... My SO had kept several pictures of me to include those taken at each prom . She found them and tore them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , as she never felt she had his whole heart . The pictures and those of other women were a catalyst to her fear and subsequent controlling behavior for 16 years of marriage . Although my SO loved her and many good times were shared , the breakdown due to jealousy and insecurity undermined their marriage and resulted in distrust , i 'll communication , disrespect and disregard . They have separated as a result , yet she is not willing to end their marriage amicably for reasons unkown . <p> Now the irony here ( if you can even call it irony ) is that I recently found a picture of his soon to be ex-wife in his wallet . The first siting was on his cell phone which I saw when he was showing me pics of his kids etc . I kindly asked him to delete them and he did . There was no issue , only the desire to keep the relationship in perspective and encourage respect . <p> Well fastforward to a month or so ago . I was retrieving a card out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife in the flap part of his wallet - not in plain view . It is quite possible that he does n't see it that often and even forgot it was there , yet removing it was what I felt to be the most respectable thing to do . He said that he would and I trusted in his word . Now does this mean I want him to get rid of every picture of her and the children ? By all means no ! They are memories and if they bring joy to his heart , the love I have for him has no desire to stand in joys way . <p> Even further , I actually enjoy the fact that my SO is desirable and that women compliment him all the time . However 16 years of marriage is nothing to regard as insignificant - no matter how badly it may have ended . <p> Most recently my SO was singing songs about lost love as he bathed in the tub . My gut started to question his behavior and for some reason I was compelled to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture . And he had or so I thought ... <p> What he had actually did was remove the pic from the flap and bury it in a side pocket amongst medical cards . <p> When I called him on his motive he took the pic and threw it in a drawer . I was n't satisfied so I asked him to throw in the trash and he did . <p> What still haunts me is that when I asked him did he " want " to keep the picture he kept saying he did n't " need " it and tried to put the destruction of it on me ... I asked again , " Do you WANT the picture ? " . He responded ... " I do n't know " . <p> What contradicts this whole scene is that he treats me like I am number one , he 's romantic and his actions are often nothing short of honorable . <p> Wonering woman 5 years ago <p> How would u feel if your bf 's aunt made a scrapbook for him for christmas and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids with this ex . But pics do n't have the child in them . They r just of him and <p> her . I do n't like them in the scrapbook but he refuses to have them removed . <p> christine 5 years ago <p> I have personally been in this exact situation , , I was happily married for 12 years and have two amazing children . although my marriage ended in divorce we remain very close friends . I was single for 5 years before meeting my current boyfriend . we had to deal with that very same issue , good life is unfair and hard enough on children let alone to be asked to remove pictures of their parent , not only is it a sign of insecurity but also sign of disrespect and insensitivity to the kids I do agree with a previous comment not putting the pictures in the children 's room should be a healthy compromise . if that does not work for the other partner this is a relationship that is doomed to fail <p> Stlrfn 5 years ago <p> Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being insecure " over ALBUMS of other women . Women he lied about being in contact with AFTER we married ... Did n't remember to tell anyone on face book he married ( till I found out about his Facebook by accident ) he has pics of ex wife ... They have kids ... That does n't bother me ... He actually said he wished he married these other women so he 'd be ALLOWED to keep their pics ... BEFORE we married , I told him I refused to compete w/ any woman ! ! Said if he wanted female friends PARTICULARLY Ones he " loved &amp; slept with " DO NOT MARRY ME . He did &amp; just lied about communicating .. he . Ca n't understand why I would feel insecure now ? ! ? I hate him now &amp; do n't know how I could ever trust him ... He did n't love me enough from the start . He did n't have to marry me ... I tried to give him every out to protect myself from this kind of thing . He wanted cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wrong with ME <p> birney 5 years ago <p> I have been living with my boyfriend for the past year . When I moved in he had me burn most everything I had kept from my ex-boyfriends and my ex-husband . However , it took him several months to finally burn a box of old pictures he kept of his ex-girlfriends . He still has many pictures stored on the computer with his last serious girlfriends ( which he says he will delete but still has n't ) . He has also had me deactivate my fb page and start a new one in which he dictated who i should add . There are times I did just add people ... but if he felt they needed to be deleted he would ask me to ( or he would do it himself as he has access to all my accounts ) . He has maintained his fb page since the day he started it and refuses to delete anyone , even after I 've asked if he would do the same for me . He is extremely faithful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be bothered by all of this but I still ca n't help but feel it is unfair that I have done so much for him , out of respect for him . I 've actually told friends that I had to make a choice and i chose my boyfriend over them ... I was lucky they understood and remained my friends . He says that he should n't have to delete anyone because he can control himself by CHOOSING NOT to contact any of his exes meanwhile I have no such control ( according to him ) so he made actions he felt necessary to prevent things from going too far with me and those I communicate with . I have tried to be patient with all of this but after a year I 'm starting to be bothered . I also do n't like the fact that he can still text his last serious girlfriend and says he ca n't delete her from his contacts list because she is like a " co-worker " ( they used to work together doing volunteer things for the community- which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassure me that he always knew he never loved her and never felt anything long-term with her as he does with me . Yet , I 'm not allowed to stay in contact with any of my exes even if I gave him the same reassurances . I 'm tired of trying to find ways to broach the subject but getting really annoyed that I have to put up with it . I do love him very much , regardless . <p> me 5 years ago <p> I found pics of my boyfriend and his ex . I looked at them and I put them back were I found them . He must have realize that I was looking through his photos . He said " honey did you get rid of some of my photos ? " I said " NO why would I need to do that ? " He said " yes you got rid of photos of me and my old friends . " So then I got pissed that he accused me of doing something that I honestly had not done . So the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . Now I 'm guilty and do n't care . Your ex should not have pics of his or her ex . There is no purpose . get rid of the Crap . <p> wendycity 5 years ago <p> I have been living with my boyfriend for 3 years . He has 3 grown children from his marriage of 25 years . He 's been divorced from his ex for 3 years , his choice . This morning I found him looking at photos of his ex and his ex with he and his children from a recent graduation which are stored on our computer . I asked him about it and he went crazy and told me to ***** and **** off and pack my **** and move out ! A bit of an overeaction I think . Sooo , I 'm going to pack now .... <p> PLS HELP ME 5 years ago <p> Ive been living with my bf ( who recently became my fiancT ) for nearly 4 years . He has a daughter from a previous 3-month relationship and she is now 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby was just 8 months old and so she does n't remember her mother . He has no contact with her as she also left the country when he kicked her out . They were not on speaking terms then , or now . She is totally out of his and the child 's life but he still keeps the photos from his daughters christening which include her . I 've asked him to chuck them out but he says he does n't want to because his daughter is also in them . Then i asked him just to throw out the ones with the ex in but he is still reluctant . There all millions of them all with similar poses . Is n't it a bit fishy that he does n't wan na get rid of them or is it really about his daughter . he is mad in love with his child so should i believe it is maybe because he ca n't face chucking out any single photo which has his daughter 's face in or is it about the women ? ? what do you guys think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Indonesia <p> In whatever reason , should n't keep publishing the picture of him and his ex ! <p> GespepGosse 5 years ago <p> composed by hsm 2012-06-11 <p> It also desires to provide wind or h2o proofing .

There were a few pictures in the beginning of our relationship that I did n't care for that were of her ex . Not because he was her ex , but because he treated her like a hired hand ... spat on her , belittled her , mentally abused her . In short , I have nothing but complete and utter dislike for this " person , " and therefore do n't want to see his face on my walls . <p> After she took down those pictures , the only one remailing of her ex is hanging in her son 's room . One out of however many is n't bad , but I 'm looking forward to the day whe her child is old enough , and I do n't have to hear about the " mental and psychological " reasons for having his picture hanging anywhere in my home . <p> Oh , and I think I recently discovered " hidden " pics of her ex on the laptop . I was trying to figure out why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden files , etc . " When I un-checked it ... poof ... pictures of her ex came out of nowhere . I can only imagine what pictures she 's been hiding and if that 's the case ... I do n't need to be here . <p> Nick 4 years ago <p> I have been in a relationship with a woman for about 16 months now and for the last 13 months we have been talking about getting married . Yet on her facebook page , she will not remove photos of her with guys she dated and slept with from two to three years ago . I asked her to remove this photos about a half dozen times over the course of December and January , yet , she never did . I have n't made mention of it , but I am still deeply troubled by this . <p> Nick 4 years ago <p> And she recently made mention of these photos , but I did n't make any commment since I did n't want to start a fight . Any thoughts ? <p> Linda Cassini 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly objective commentation ... Kudos : ) <p> Utku 4 years ago <p> I also have a similar problem with my gf . Especially with the new facebook life it became more complicated . My girlfriend have some photos with her ex guys ( some of them were serious boyfriends some of them were shit ) both on her computer and facebook account . Even there are some photos of kissing , touching etc . First I asked her to delete them on facebook and pc but she only deleted the kissing picture on facebook and the old profile picture ( after a big argue ) . But the rest of them stays . Keeping some pictures with your serious ex-bf in some archived folder is understandable for me unless they are romantic pictures like kissing , nude etc . Once she agreed to do it and then changed her mind back . <p> But why she keeps these kind of pictures on facebook and pc ? When I ask , she says they are part of her life although she does n't have a feeling for them . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys just used her and did n't care and respect to her . I am very romantic and caring guy ; I buy flowers , make surprises , prepare romantic dinners , buying gifts , doing her housework and cooking soup when she is i 'll ( we live in different houses ) , thinking about small details to make her happy etc . But at the end I see these photos of shitty guys next to my photos . <p> Also she still has contacts with some of them . It is very annoying when these guys are making comments , giving advices to her about our relationship . Why ca n't you just delete the contacts and photos to start a new , clean , innocent , lovefull life ? <p> If you are curious , I do n't have any pictures and contacts with my ex 's . <p> Velvet 4 years ago <p> Emotionally have been disturbed for a while and i came to a conclusion that i was not meant to love and possible die of loneliness ..... i tried all i could to get my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people here have been writing good things here on TOPIX about professor Lucy <p> initially i never belived and of the posts and testimonials cos have once fallen victim to a fake spellcaster but the real mind in me gave it a trial <p> i contacted him and he said some prayers for me and that was the begining of the solutions to my problems <p> in a nut shell , my ex who happened to be the mother of my child came back to me after 7 days of the prayers <p> professor Lucy is simply the most powerful spell caster one can ever trust <p> you can also contact him if you are having the same type of predicament , contact him via : **25;8421;TOOLONG <p> colby 4 years ago <p> What would i have done if not for shamu spell , my name is Colby , I am 27 years old and i have a son .

@@96276107 @476107/ <h> Men , Intimacy , and Emotional Vulnerability in Relationships <p> Intimacy and emotional vulnerability are two aspects of long term committed relationships that go hand in hand and often provide sticking points between partners . Especially for men , these two aspects of relationship can range from the mysterious and confusing to the frightening and avoiding-at-all costs . It can be helpful to understand the dynamic between intimacy , emotional vulnerability , and how men are raised in their family and socialized in their culture . <p> For many men , the word intimacy ' is usually synonymous with sex ' . And sex is one of the few places where men will allow themselves to become emotionally vulnerable . But intimacy is far more than just sex ( and sex can be devoid of intimacy ) . Intimacy encompasses the intellect , the emotions , non-sexual physical touch , and spirituality . Furthermore , not all intimacy feels good . Sometimes intimacy feels exceedingly bad , like when a loved one dies . Intimacy that feels good , like being in love also places us in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you ' for the very first time to some one . Both positive and difficult intimacy carries with it feelings of vulnerability . So the first task is for men to expand their concept of what intimacy is , as well as the different types of intimacy . Secondly , it is important for men to understand emotional vulnerability and learn to tolerate and use it in relationship . <p> Intimacy might be described as the ability to share one 's deepest thoughts and emotions with another person in freedom and confidence , regardless of how the other person receives that sharing . We most often believe that intimacy is something that must be reciprocal , but is indeed unilateral ( Schnarch ) . Men , especially , are used to relating inside the context of power , and often interpret the giving of intimacy as being vulnerable , and expect a return of intimacy in kind to balance out the perceived power in the relationship . This understanding of vulnerable ' is not the same when the word is attached to emotional ' ( emotional vulnerability ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synonymous with weak ' . <p> Power issues aside , any time a man is intimate , he may feel quite vulnerable in the process . The equating of intimacy and vulnerability , though , is a fundamental error . In fact , it takes a great deal of courage and strength to be intimate , and intimacy itself has the power to strengthen the man . The effect of feeling vulnerable when we are intimate comes from the world we live in and not the intimacy itself : any emotion that is considered tender , gentle , kind , or open is interpreted as weakness in our culture . While these characteristics may indeed not be appropriate for the business world , or on the gridiron , there is a place in life to allow ourselves to be emotionally vulnerable : in our intimate relationship with our partners . <p> Indeed , it is the man who pushes away intimacy that becomes truly vulnerable in the negative sense . Intimacy provides a tremendous amount of information about situations through the interpretation of emotions . Our emotions have important information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most guys can readily identify and relate to ) is an important emotion that tells us that something is wrong in a situation . Much like physical pain tells us that there is something wrong in our body , anger tells us that something is unfair or out of line . If we recognize and use our anger in response rather than in reaction , it can be a powerful ally in getting things done and setting things straight . <p> Far more intimidating for men than anger , the emotions surrounding deep love and longing for our partners often makes us feel vulnerable . We may interpret this vulnerability as something weak and something we should not feel , and we may push it away . But that is a big mistake in love relationships . We must truly become vulnerable in order to enter spaces of intimacy with our lovers . And it in attending to intimacy and growing in intimacy that we keep our love relationships fresh , vibrant , and resilient . People who are not experiencing enough intimacy with their partners often complaint the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both people feel more like roommates than lovers . <p> Yet another problem surrounding intimacy and emotional vulnerability is that most men are not given the emotional knowledge ' and emotional vocabulary ' to identify and express their emotions effectively . Without these , we men are like commanders of an army who 's communications systems have been knocked out by the enemy . We may stumble and grasp for the words to express what we are feeling , and when we finally do say something intimate , we once a again feel vulnerable , maybe even silly in expressing all that mushy stuff ' . <p> Countless men in counseling have told me that they so wish that their partners would change , do something interesting , become more passionate , become playful , or that things go back to the way they used to be at the beginning of their relationshipand their partners say the very same thing about them . One thing is for sure : if you want things to change or improve , you have to do something about it . Do n't expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can begin to grow is in your understanding and use of intimacy and emotional vulnerability in your love relationship .

@@96276109 @476109/ <h> How to Show Lack of Interest Politely for Women <p> Unrequited displays of affection are always hard to handle , and even more so if you 're the recipient . There are many ways to show the other party that their work is a vain attempt , but doing so to keep both reputations intact with the least degree of feelings being hurt takes finesse and extreme perception . Luckily for us , this is the age of information . Both men and women consult the Internet for everything from best camera deals to relationship advice . <p> For this article , I looked up many online articles regarding " Signs She 's Not Interested , " and compiled the most frequent signs men read up to determine the mixed signals coming from the lady they 're interested in . Hopefully , the man that you 're not interested in is wise enough to consult the Internet and stumble upon the same sites I 've stumbled upon . The following is a list of the top signs you can give out to let him know subtly that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Talk Too Much/Keep Your Space : <p> This is the most frequent sign popping up in most of those help sites . Women have earned a reputation for being the more verbose gender , so use this stereotype to your advantage . Do not initiate most of the conversation . Keep your responses terse ; preferably limited to " yes " and " no " . In addition , keep a distance between the both of you . People naturally breach personal space when interacting with the person they are attracted to . By maintaining a professional distance between the both of you , you subtly suggest that you are not interested in him . <h> Look Around the Room : <p> This is the second most frequent sign I 've read up . They say that the " eyes are the window to your soul " and there are reasons why lovers are usually said to look amorously into each other 's eyes . To show disinterest , do not maintain eye contact for more than around 3 seconds , or the average length for you to just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're expecting someone to show up . <p> The guy is sure to sense a definite lack of chemistry between the above two signs . If he is a persistent one , please read on . <h> Talk About Other Men : <p> Let the guy know how much he reminds you of your brother , or one of your best guy friends . In addition , talk about some characteristics that you are attracted to in men that he obviously does not possess . Yes , this talking conflicts with #1 , but these are things that interested men do not want to hear from a prospective romantic partner . <h> Say That You 're Not Looking For a Relationship : <p> Both men and women tell other women and men that they are not looking for a relationship to prevent a relationship with that particular chick or guy . Try to sneak that bit about you in the conversation . For example , if you guys are talking about goals in life , mention that you are currently thinking about your meaning of life a lot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do other things such as having fun or dating . <p> Notice that I am not laughing , in addition to looking around . The optimum combination of nonchalance . <h> Does Not Laugh at Jokes : <p> When asked what qualities makes the other gender attractive , both men and women consistently rate humor as one of their top turn-ons . Women , however , are attracted to men who can initiate humor , such as telling good jokes . Thus , to show affection , women laugh with the men that they are interested in . Men on the other hand , are attracted to women whose sense of humor is align to their own . A man loves it when a woman if she laughs at one of his cleverly-laid mines . To show your lack of interest , simply guard your laughter as if it was made of $100 bills . If the above theories are true , it may even work so well that the man becomes turned off . He may see that you lack his sense of humor . <h> Tell Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fails , tell him that you 're not interested . This is a very careful maneuver , but with the right setting and a good grasp of words , it can be done . It is highly suggested that you chose to tell him in a private place to keep his dignity and your reputation in place . Tell him that you might be bold to assume that he is interested in you , but if he is , you apologize for not being interested in him and for sending out mixed signals . By saying this , you give him a chance to deny his interest for you , which keeps his dignity intact in front of you . You can then end the conversation by saying something along the lines of , " that 's good , I do n't want to further any misunderstandings . " If he admits that he is interested in you , tell him what you think of the relationship .

I think it should be the first thing you say to a guy . Either girls can be misleading in their ways they approach a fellow male that is courting him or her , or like my ex used to say " guy are oblivious creatures " . The poor fellow ( as I was once in my life ) , might not be able to comprehend the girl distancing him and view it as the girl being hard to get . So when a girl just says no from the beginning , she makes things clear and the poor guy wo n't have to drag his bum around chasing a heart that will never be his = ! ! <p> DUDES ! ! ! 7 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not interested , he will back out of it so quick it will make you head spin ... trying to say that he was n't into you like that , or saying that you are taking his attention way too seriously ... you have to use subtle approaches for subtle flirtations , especially in a world where men are constantly flirting with women that are attractive , and it 's up to the woman to maintain professional demeanor and not assume the man is n't being professional as well . THE SUBTLE HINTS ARE NECESSARY ! If you are meeting someone at a bar and it is casual environment , then you have the freedom to speak frank . <p> I have a job where I am in sales so I must maintain good eye contact and interest , even if it is not romantic interest .

Be straight forward and to the point nicely , if you are rude and ignore another human being it says a lot about you . It is infantile , rude and can backfire . It is a small world and there is no small enemy . My philosophy is , if someone approaches me with a sincere interest and has taken the initiative and energy to approach me in a respectful way , I take it as a compliment and let him know that I am not interested .

Arrogant behavior <p> That is the " once " official criteria for diagnosing a narcissist . However , there are some aspects of their disorder that are harder to pinpoint and are potentially devastating if you are not aware of them . <h> Shape Shifting <p> When you are with this person , do you have a very uneasy feeling they are thinking something they are not saying ? Do they do little things that plant seeds of doubt as to what their intentions are and leave you feeling " sick " or " creeped out " ? You could be experiencing narcissistic shape shifting . The narcissist is an adept at playing roles , being two faced and phoney . Other personality disorders also manifest dis-ingenuousness , but with a narcissist , there is a sense of stage management to their tableaux . Secretiveness to hide their real motives , yet putting on an act to suit a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the allusion you are kindred spirits , impress you , sabotage you , manipulate and control you . It is all about getting narcissistic supply , which is to put it simply - admiration/attention - the narcissist is addicted to it . They must create a persona which constantly elicits receiving it - a false self . They use this false self to regulate the flow of their supply . They are to put it simply , stuck up or full of themselves . If the narcissist is not kept on a pedestal in keeping with their fake persona , they will take action , using any means possible to ensure it . They will assume any form necessary and are experts in hiding the transitions . Most people who encounter them do not immediately see the inconsistencies , but over time it gets more obvious . Those who do not distance themselves become enmeshed in their needs , resulting in codependency or co-narcissism . The rest report feeling emotionally i 'll around the narcissist . <h> Childishness and Pettiness <p> The abusiveness of the narcissist is often observed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another aspect to their complete self-centeredness is petty immaturity . If you refuse to be manipulated , you will be accused of not caring about them , taking advantage , or being ungrateful . A guilt trip may be employed . You will be told you should be ashamed of yourself . If you complain about their behavior , they will counter with something you did . For example , if the child of a narcissist questions their parent on certain toxic behavior , they might bring up something their gown up child did when they were young , while their acts are being done as an adult . The odd truth is that the adult narcissist does not make a distinction between behavior appropriate to a child and that of an adult . You may think their requests are silly , or they ca n't possibly mean what they are saying in certain situations , but they are completely serious . If they are thwarted , they will find a way to pay you back . <p> It can be little things , like not letting you have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with . They will go out of their way to make sure you know they are withholding something you want , that is in their power to give . Sabotage holidays , backbite , bicker , wind people up to bully and abuse you . Typical school yard tactics . Quite often these are things they " think " you want or are afraid of , but in reality have no interest in or it is not a personal button for you . Because they have no real connection with anyone , they often get it wrong , and the withholding and or petty/abusive behavior becomes plain . If they are very intimate with you and are used to receiving their supply through your relationship , they may wrongly be perceived as " difficult " or that is " just their way " when the truth is something much more problematic . Friends and family members will able to see it , by the easiness with which they could address your issues or fulfill your requests , and the odd glee with which they blatantly do not . Narcissistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are common in the home . <h> Inappropriate Expressions <p> One of the signs of a narcissist are inappropriate facial expressions . This is not just the common " phoney smile " , but an odd array of disingenuous facial sets , mixed with bursts of their own true emotions , that are truly disturbing in what they reveal of their inner world . One of the things commonly reported by those who live with narcissists is , " the smirk " . You are in emotional or physical pain , usually of the narcissists making and they are exuding a weird glee that shines through their eyes . Sometimes they compose their face in line with what the world has taught them to exhibit , then walk in the next room and bask in their joy in private . Other times if you accidentally injure their false self , you can be given " a looks could kill " glare , over something you thought was relatively innocuous . <p> A quote from Dangerous Liaisons sums it up well : <p> Marquise de Merteuil : " When I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the role I was condemned to , namely to keep quiet and do what I was told , gave me the perfect opportunity to listen and observe . Not to what people told me , which naturally was of no interest , but to whatever it was they were trying to hide . I practiced detachment . I learned how to look cheerful while under the table I stuck a fork into the back of my hand . I became a virtuoso of deceit . It was n't pleasure I was after , it was knowledge . I consulted the strictest moralists to learn how to appear , philosophers to find out what to think , and novelists to see what I could get away with , and in the end , I distilled everything to one wonderfully simple principle : win or die . " Les Liaisons dangereuses by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos <h> Shock and Awe <p> It comes out of nowhere , people connected with this person say odd things to you , and you have no idea where it is coming from . You feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on somewhere else . You are pretty sure someone has been talking behind your back and the stories they are telling are at best twisted and at worse fiction . Often you get the feeling that they are obsessed with you , and you find you ca n't stop thinking about them , even when you have already written them off and do n't want to pay them a moments notice . What is happening to you is projective identification : <p> " Projective identification differs from simple projection in that projective identification is a self-fulfilling prophecy , whereby a person , believing something false about another , relates to that other person in such a way that the other person alters their behavior to make the belief true . The second person is influenced by the projection and begins to behave as though he or she is in fact actually characterized by the projected thoughts or beliefs . This is a process that generally happens outside the awareness of both parties involved , though this has been debated . " Wikipedia <p> You become drawn into a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narcissists things your instincts immediately tell you not to . You are saying things you do not believe and have the odd feeling you can not be yourself around this person . At some point you start going along with the play they are directing , hoping they will like you and you are oddly afraid of them emotionally if you do n't . You think if you dance to their tune everything will be o.k. , but they still subtly or overtly betray you in ways that are completely deniable , making you feel you are going insane and you start doubting your own reality . You ca n't trust your own truth and you either start becoming unstable yourself or long to be on the other side of the world from them . You are being effectively being gaslighted . The narcissist does this to control/punish and exact narcissistic supply . <p> I always ask first before I feature anyone 's lens ( so you can review the content of my work first ) . Please let me know on my bio page ( no rush ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear from you , I will assume that you rather I did not ) . <p> Most respectfully , <p> Rose <p> sousababy 6 years ago <p> Thank you so much , I just added your lens to mine ( right after my DSM book section ) . Take good care , Rose <p> sociopath-free 6 years ago <p> You nailed it and the visual is perfect ! <p> anonymous 5 years ago <p> Excellent and you did hit the nail on the head several times here and helped me understand someone I was once in relationship with and why I responded the way I did . <p> atirial 5 years ago <p> Very informative about narcissists and the images really fit the theme . A great lens ! 64473 @qwx924473 <p> I have been gaslighted by my sister in law . I lived with her for three years and had to endure excessive competitiveness , false friendliness , false accusations against me and i usually see her hidden expressions when she feels happy about a misdemeanor in my life . i wanted to run away , but i was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyday . she is 10 years older than me . I always felt shaky around her , afraid of her , because i knew her intentions towards me are sinister in some way . now she has a baby and i 'm pretty sure she will throw that in my face just to prove to me that she 's better than me , or to try to make me jealous . the worst part is that i am not envious of her , she just scares the shit out of me and that 's the only reason she gives me anxiety attacks . I suppose she reminds me of my ex , because my ex was a narcissist and enjoyed seeing me in pain . I 've been praying to God about it , I really ca n't stand these anxiety attacks around a person anymore . so yeah . <p> julieannbrady 4 years ago <p> Gosh , are these really " secret aspects " after all ? I 've surely seen a few around the internet and in real life . Thankfully , none of them were my friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the great lense . I , myself , was married to a narcissist and was embroiled in the drama of it even years after the divorce . What you say is true ... and the worst of it is when you are the healthy one , yet questions yourself and start to believe what you are being told . God help anyone who is in this type of relationship . 64473 @qwx924473 <p> I was in a relationship with a narcissist for nine years and , unfortunately , we have two children together so I need to keep contact and be civil . The games never end however .... You know the way to beat them ? Wait it out until the moment they relax because you have n't struck in quite a while . Hit them where it hurts . In this case , it 's money . A threat of loss of money due to outing them at work for things they 've done wrong , a threat of letting people around them know of their deception etc . Not all at once - one small implied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " but , I would n't do that - would I " said ever so sweetly . It 's unfortunate that we have to sink to the slime ball level of these crazy people but , if you do n't , you give away all your power . I 'm telling you though - it never ends . I 'm sitting back watching it all transpire again . This time treatment is needed for cancer - never mind there is PLENTY of money in the bank to cover an medical expenses not covered by insurance - I 'm sitting back watching fundraisers take place and people from my childrens school donate to " help " while she pays for her car and her sisters car to be detailed , goes on a quick trip to California to visit an ailing grandparent etc . " BUT - please - do donate as I have all these medical bills that have n't been covered . Never mind I could pay them ten times over - it 's better if you do it for me " DESPICABLE 64473 @qwx924473 <p> I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a name to what I am ( this article is enlightening ) . I have never connected to people , basically acted and manipulated all of my life because I have this emptiness inside of me that has always been there . When I was between the ages of 1-3 I was physically and emotionally abused by my Mother and her boyfriend ( who is now in prison ) . Even though as you will know I do n't care what your opinions are I do feel the need to justify and explain that we are who we are and besides killing ourselves what would you have us do ? I recognise that I can not connect to people or ' truly ' love but it is not because I do n't want to . I do n't consider myself a bad person , just somebody who is fucked up . I try to channel who I am to strive to be achieve the best I can in my career and sports . <p> There will be quite a lot of people out there like myself and I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes enough . Al though we ca n't love in the traditional way we can love in our way . <p> Let 's face it we all have our own different faults and NOBODY is perfect . 64473 @qwx924473 <p> @anonymous : I 'm assuming she is your brother 's wife and you are living with them .

@@96276111 @476111/ <h> Internet Dating Scammers : How to Identify Them <h> You Do n't Have To Be A Victim <p> By now we are all familiar in some way with the internet and how it all works . With today 's lifestyles becoming more and more hectic the effort to get out there and meet people seems too much of an effort . More and more people are now gathering at the proverbial " watering hole " in internet dating site chat rooms . While the development of these datings sites started out as a great convienience it has now become dangerous in many ways . Not only do we have pedophiles looking for our children but we have a new breed of rapist , an emotional rapist , otherwise known as a dating scammer . Someone who uses your emotions to get to your money . <p> Unfortunately we have different catagories for these internet leeches , one being an individual who not only does it for fun but those who do it for business . This has become a very notorious money making business in underprivileged countries like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries along with Russia , Ghana and the Ukrain . In some of these areas the scammers work for the local mafia and are set up in cafes , homes etc . Getting involved with a scammer such as this can be very dangerous because they know what they are doing and tap into your vulnerabilities creating a trust where you are willing to give up your information such as bank account numbers and personal info . Who would be stupid enough to do this ? Well it really is n't stupidity . We are all vulnerable in some way , we all want to be trusting and we are all looking for that something special and these guys and gals KNOW it . It does n't matter if they are working a scammer cell or individually . <p> I went on a dating site and I met someone but after a few chats I just got this feeling that things were n't adding up . I did some checking and found some sites about scammers and also joined a group on Yahoo about scammers . I had gotten quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man , and I 'll assume it was a man , I exposed him but only after I played with him for awhile just to see how far he 'd go , WOW , he had the role down pat . lol <p> The stuff I learned was so mind boggling that I just have to share it . I ' m pretty savy about the internet but was totally clueless as to how deep this deceit goes in the internet dating scams . Please remember that it does n't have to be an out of country scammer but someone right here taking advantage of someones emotional state . We are all vulnerable in some way and these people will find the weakness . It 's how they make their living . Also just because there is a picture it does n't mean that is the real person you are talking to . You could be talking to a woman thinking it 's a man and vice versa . After all they have no real intention of meeting you . They just want your money . <p> There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They also will steal images from other dating sites and will go as far as including pics of children from these modeling sites claiming them to be their children . Another way to grab your sympathy . <p> At the time I was researching this and playing with " my guy " there was a lawsuit in process because some one had stolen another mans pic from one dating site and used it to exthort money from someone else on another dating site . So you see nobody is safe from these people . They prey on your emotions and though most of us will say it ca n't happen to me ...... well do n't be too sure . Some of these people are quite a bit more subtle and the signs are harder to see so Just beware of any online relationship . <p> Things to look out for : <p> They even set up bogus websites for their fake companies . That way they can make themselves look legit . Check It Out ! My guy did and the address was legit but not for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , this is gon na be very interesting . <p> Look at the spelling .... " I " is always i . Most out of country scammers never capitalize their I when speacking of themselves . <p> The speech is broken and does n't fit their profile or pic , for example . i see you very pretty , like to know you well . Although it 's no crime to have an accent and I 'm not saying all broken speech is a sign of a scammer , but when the picture and profile posted is of an obvious Italian CEO and the language is way off base ....... RED FLAG <p> Most will say they are Native American ..... Like my guy did and when I questioned him about what tribe he said oh no tribe originaly from America but moved to UK First red flag for me . <p> The discription for their matches is wide open . There are no specifics . All body types , religions , nationalities etc are accepted . <p> Ages for their matches range from 18 to 63 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viscious spouse who took their child away or wife and children , killed in a car accident , orphaned etc .. <p> They will proclaim their love for you within a few chats which they always request to be away from the dating site.Do n't do it . If you do it you ca n't expose them to the site autorities . They know this , after all their main objective is to win your trust so you will send them money . Soliciting money is prohibited on these sites . <p> They will tell you they are contractors , engineers etc. for big companies who travel around the world and are currently working on a job site in Nigeria etc. that way they can easily have you send the money western union and will always have you send it in a " friends " name , which is really their own . <p> After you have talked and they have told you how you are the one they were always looking for and get you to reciprocate the feelings they will then begin telling you about losing their wallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their passport until they get paid.And of course they ca n't cash their ckecks because the banks there do n't deal with American banks . Please send me some money so I can come home . <p> WEEEEEEEEEEL first off if they are working for a big company they would be covered for all of this . No major company is going to abandon their employees in a foreign country . There is also an embassy in every country they can go to . I mentioned this to " my guy " to see what his response would be and he said the embassy said they would n't help him . Ha ! another red flag . He got angry with me because I said I did n't have any money to send which in turn he tried to tell me I did n't love him lol lol lol Never told him I did in the first place lol lol <p> They get really agitated if you ask a lot of questions . They 'll try to get you to just talk about love and how they will take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes you may be talking to someone totally different . If it 's a " scamming cell " , it 's not uncommon for someone else to " work " anothers mark . I had noticed a distinct difference in the writing and language use on several occasions while chatting with " my guy " . Watch for this . <p> You 'll often have times when they seem to have gone off line for a little while and then they are back saying , " I had business call " or " the internet is bad here " . The real reason is they are talking to more than one mark online at a time . <p> I 'm sure there are many more ways they have come up with by now to scam people . They have to because more and more people are onto them but the basics are the same . I know not all people are scammers on those sites .

You have given a detailed account on how these scammers work . I have busted a romance scammer myself from cheating an online friend of mine . <p> 7 years ago <p> Thanks Anamika , <p> Sadly these people seem to be everywhere . <p> venezia 6 years ago <p> Another way to catch them is if they claim to be out of the country , say in the UK , but use a 4470 number . I was almost scammed by a supposed international telecom engineer who was suddenly called away to work in the UK right when we met , so we could n't meet in person right away--RED FLAG #1 . If there 's interest , they will met you in person . He had a girlfriend killed a car crash story--RED FLAG #2 . Was supposedly from Texas but had a Brit accent , claimed he was educated at the UNIV of LONDON--RED FLAG#3 . He claimed to be in love with me and all this undying love for me ( his favorite words were ETERNITY and ALWAYS and FOREVER ) , after only chatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that running a background check will work . He stole someone else 's identity and photos--so everything checked out because I was looking at a real person 's record . I IMed him and talked to him on the phone , though his webcam never seemed to work--BIG RF#5 . I could n't see him . I thought his phone number was legit until I found out that 4470 means it 's being rerouted to anywhere in the world , often Nigeria . NEVER EVER give out info to ANYONE about credit cards etc . Anyone who asks you to pay for a subscribed site for them--even if it 's a little amount . Do n't do it ! They choose small amounts so as not to trip fraud alerts , then take your card numbers and run them . I thought I was being careful--these guys are real pros . But once you know what to look for--red flags like I have listed above--you can spot them a mile away . <p> web design in Maidstone 6 years ago <p> It is interesting to see someone talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net of scam masters , not just the financial losses . <p> yeah , internet has many sides <p> dave lspa 6 years ago <p> I 've got a feeling that someone maybe trying to scam me at the moment.A young lady 20+ years younger than myself.She has given me a sob story and sent me photos of herself.So ive jumped in first , said i 'd love to meet her and that I cant get enough of her photos etc etc.Another idea ive had is to request a specific photo of her ( in red clothes haha ) May I also add that she does n't really answer the questions I ask , that must be a red flag surely . <p> Author <p> AnythingArtzy 6 years agofrom OHIO <p> Dave .... first red flag is the sob story and the second is the non answering of the questions . Definite scammer. also take into account the kind of pics . Are they too professional ? If so red flag #3 . Most people who just want to meet someone for real will post candid pics . Scammers have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , Most of the " women " scammers are really men simply because they KNOW how a man thinks and what will get his attention and what better than a woman 20 years younger . drop her/him and be very careful . <p> nicky 6 years ago <p> i do n't  blame nigerians ... they do n't  have a choice .. . all because many of them are poor . .. and not evrybody who ask for money is a scammer .. that the fact ... and even though there scammers you gat help them .. cuz they pleased you .. so u gat pls them too .. so that 's it <p> Author <p> AnythingArtzy 6 years agofrom OHIO <p> sorry Nicky I must disagree . I do blame anybody who intentionally commits a crime . And anybody who asks a complete stranger on the net for money by giving a false tale to work on their sympathy IS a scammer . And No I do NOT have to help a scammer , they are NOT pleasing to me or anyone of the people who they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago <p> thanks so much ! the link for IPTrackeronline worked great ... seems the first IP address was from the states but the header was huge and when i looked thru the details i found another IP address that was from Nigeria . actually should have known better from the 10 paragraph email from a guy i 've never talked to before and it had a lot of the other ' details ' as noted in this article .... again-THANKS ! <p> Author <p> AnythingArtzy 6 years agofrom OHIO <p> You are most welcome Sharon . I 'm sooooooooo glad this helped . you would not believe the horror stories I 've heard about the theft and damage these people do . <p> EDWARD 6 years ago <p> I 've had a few scamers contact me recently : <p> 1 , Have been contacted by a woman saying she is in Afghanistan , and is serving in the US Army . Also claims that she is native american but , her home country is New South Wales , Australia . <p> I have also had a sob story that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her emails have been traced back to Nigeria . I have confronter her / him about it , and they deny it of course . <p> 2 , Have been contacted by a woman in Ghana . Again the country on her profile did not match . All of her emails come from Ghana but , strangely there is never any contact at weekends . <p> 3 , Have been contacted directly by a russian scammer , she has not yet said what she wants but , I have told her I do not want to know . <p> I guess the one to look out at the moment is the people posing as US military personnel , as they can post pictures in uniform , and send you so say official looking documents from the US forces . <p> anne 6 years ago <p> I caught one with the IP address and years ago I caught other two without it . At the moment they ask for money is not when you can catch them because they always give hints before that ... for example never chat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids do n't look like them ! That is so easy to find out and also they give you telepjone number but it is always disconnected or does n't exist ... <p> R. Findley 5 years ago <p> I knew I was n't the only one but I have never had the chance to hear it or say--I have had several on g-going chats and fotos exchanges over the last few months with these women . I am a 60 yr old single guy retired to Mexico living in a condo on the beach--prime target ! ! I know that ... I am obviously being scammed by : very young , beautiful and women , in a foreign country with a tragic story , madly in love with me , will not answer specific questions , single and promising marriage , children lasting love , etc . They all have these things in common . And they need money ( help--for US ) . I have caught a couple of them ( they do n't have web cams or the few that do do n't have a speaker so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ) , Anyway , I confess I am having fun with it at times . I have even called them on what I know they are doing ... some of them are very clever and some of them are rookies at it--I have even told them so . Long pauses in a chat session is of course an indication they are chatting with more than one person , wchich they will deny . Some of the untrained ladies will get short tempered with you--basicaly , it sometimes seems they studied the same manual , have the same instructor or went to the same black school . I hope you do n't get fooled--there ARE legit sites out there . Rick <p> Patrys 5 years ago <p> Is it at all possible to find the man who 's pictures were used in a romance scam . I have been able to trace some of the pictures to an address , by the details ( longitude and latitude ) that was attached to the pictures . But what now ? <p> Author <p> AnythingArtzy 5 years agofrom OHIO <p> Patrys .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just happen to stumbble upon them in your search . Most pics used by scammers are taken from modeling sites or other dating sites . Quite possibly even just randomly found on the net from various sites and blogs . It 's easy to find the originating site of the emails but they NEVER use their own pics . It 's best , in my opinion , to just stay away from dating sites all together . Even the best still have scammers infiltrating them . Sorry to be discouraging but these people are ruthless . <p> i was contacted by a girl from nigeria who said both her parents died , and she wanted to come back to the uk , but she needed money to do that and asked me for help , i was n't sure if she was lieing or what until she asked about my inheritance . then i was like , she 's messing with the wrong one . so i got my revenge and just annoyed her to the point that i think she thought it was n't worth it LOL so do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobblesmom 5 years ago <p> I am looking for some thoughts on my situation . My mother in law has been talking to someone she met on Christian mingel . It has been about 6months . He claims to be from our state but is in the middle of the Irish sea working as a deep sea welder . His mother and daughter are in London . I 've heard many times about him returning home to be with my mother , but something always comes up . She <p> says he has never asked for money , but a couple days ago he asked for her bank account info so he could deposit 7500 into it and then she was to wire it to a so called company so he could finish the job and come home to meet her . Well , she did all of that and a couple days later something else came up where he still was unable to come home . He gave her his home address and my husband and I are thinking of taking the drive to check his story . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all that I read sounds very similar to this situation . My mother in law is a very sweet caring Christian woman and I would hate to see her hurt and taken advantage of . Please can you help and give me your thoughts on this . Any questions I will be glad to answer . Thank you . <p> Author <p> AnythingArtzy 5 years agofrom OHIO <p> Bobblesmom ..... have your mother-in-law change her account number NOW ! ! ! ! . He has no intention of meeting or depositing any money . This is definitely a scam to get access to her money without asking for it directly . People are starting to " catch on " to them when they ask out right so now they have to come up with different ways to get at your money . THEY ALWAYS WANT TO COME HOME BUT CA N'T FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER.It 's how they play on peoples sympathy . <p> No need to waste precious gas looking for an address either , it 's bogus . Use the link in the article above to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Author <p> AnythingArtzy 5 years agofrom OHIO <p> Wizzy ... you have just proven my point ...... Dear readers , I normally would have deleted this message because of the launguage and I apologize to my followers and any who read this article , but then what better proof of who and what these people are than a comment from one . <p> bobblesmom 5 years ago <p> We tried to tell her that , but she is so caught up in this fantasy and what he is saying , she is not hearing us . The thing is , there was $7500 deposited into her account and the next day she went to her bank and wired it to another account which he gave her the information for . That 's what 's confusing , he did put money into her account , but everything else screams scam . The address he gave her also came up on my GPS map . Now if it is truly his residence , who knows ....... Do you still believe she is being scammed ? <p> bobblesmom 5 years ago <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in law . She said she always uses this # to call him . He does not call her . The # is 011-44-70-703-591-0692 . I read above that 4470 is a # used to redirect . Does the number I just gave you fall into that category ? I 'm sorry for asking so many questions . I just want to know all the possible signs that show . I love my mother in law and want to see her happy and not hurt over a fantasy . Thank you sloop much for your help and hope to hear fro you again : ) <p> Confidence Man 5 years ago <p> If you are an older man and you use any dating sites he careful with the blonde gold diggers you see frequenting these sites , I was talking to a 40 year old Caucasian blonde woman who first told me she was from New Jersey and then after a few conversations she told me that she was now living in Sweden because she went there for her job as a stwerdess for an airline and she started hinting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to America the point I am tying to make is people are not aware of the Caucasian blonde barracudas that prey on fools . <p> Here is what you will see written in a typical barracuda profile <p> Looking for a man who knows how to treat a lady . <p> Looking for a successful driven man . <p> I appreciate the finer things in life . <p> Looking for a man who is well traveled . <p> Looking for a man who is chivalrous and old fashioned . <p> Looking for a man who can laugh at himself . <p> Looking for prince charming . <p> Queen looking for her king . <p> Where is my prince . <p> If you see this written anywhere run the otherway or risk losing everything you have . Do n't  let a pretty blonde fool you . <p> BEWARE GENTLEMAN ! <p> Author <p> AnythingArtzy 5 years agofrom OHIO <p> Yes I do ! ! big red flag for me . My first thought was ... If he had the money and the info to wire the money to someplace else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it for him ? and second .... why not have his mother or daughter do it ? My take is he just wanted her banking info and by actually depositing the money forged a way to gain her trust . As for the address , My " guy " gave me a legitimate one too , it just was n't his address . I googled the addresss and it came up as an accounting firm in London . She really needs to get a new account set up , and NOW ! There is always an excuse about their jobs and needing to come home . it 's the standard line . read the comment above by Wizzy , obviously a scammer . Very enlightening . <p> joanie 5 years ago <p> whew , great information- I just got out a scammers reach and I was emotionally exhausted and felt so stupid that I fell for this ... handsome English chap who was a marine engineer , widow , raised his son along , owned his business .... never answered my questions and his story kept changing each time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was almost trapped in the same senerio you have outlined . Thank you for your kindness , it 's nice to know there are some people in this world that genuinely care about others . Thank you . <p> Sadly , I too think I 'm being scammed . UK girl living in Ghana . All comments made are very similar to those mentioned . <p> Any suggestions on how to catch them out , whilst conversing ? <p> mjalmostgotscammed 5 years ago <p> wassa - they do n't know current news . Ask them where they are and then google some current news . They have no idea . Also their style of speech is more formal - Americans do n't talk like that . They are predators that prey on the lonely - simple . They send flowers with teddybears - not sure what the teddybear is about , but they usually do . <p> As for the woman with the mother-in-law .... she I guess has to find out the hard way . She will lose money for sure if she does n't change her bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door - I guarantee somebody else lives there . Hard to believe that there are rotten people out there , but glad the website showed the post of the rotten scammer saying you deserve it . NOBODY deserves it - especially the lonely . <p> mjalmostgotscammed 5 years ago <p> I forgot to mention ... when they drop the L word and you have n't even met them - now you KNOW they are a scammer . I ca n't tell you how many I 've run into . I quit the dating sites because of it . I actually messed with one and offered him more money than he asked for - and he was all excited . I took the information to send it to , and of course never did send it . He immediately kept doggin me with " Where is it ? Where is it ? " And I said " Any day now " - if I answered him at all . Then he got really mad and dropped the " If you loved me you would X , Y Z " - but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first time it 's very strange , but you get good at recognizing it . LONG e-mails are a huge Red Flag also . I tested them also by telling them something I liked .... " I like when you call me honey . " Then every other word is " honey " lol ! They really are n't all that astute . AND they always want to talk on msn or yahoo . I hope you show your mother-in-law some of this blog and hopefully bells will go off in her head . I also like to call them out - I said you are a black man in Nigeria preying on lonley women - shame on you . He said " No offense . It 's my job . " OMG ! ! ! Job ? ? ? I told him when he gets to the pearly gates he has some big explaining to do . They do n't like to be preached to . <p> Also another one I played the diva - telling him I hope he has tons of money cuz I 'm one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money on my man . I became the love of his life over night . Most men will Runnnnnnnnn . <p> Challenge your mother-in-law .... make her try some of this stuff . I 'm so concerned about her . <p> Bonnie 5 years ago <p> I met a gentleman on the site over40andsingle . He claims he is an engineer , from London , graduated in Canada , is currently finishing a project in Manila and he gave me a 4470 number to call . The name he gave me checked out with the job profile . Barry Callaghan , company Bacal . He gave me names of mother , father , sister , son and daughter . The only discrepency I could find was in the age . He claims to be 48 . I googled this . No 48 year old Barry Callaghan . I discovered by opening his yahoo email to me , properties , that this email he has been using was created the very day he asked me to switch from communicating on the over40 's site .

Let our Brains work very well that 's my only advice here . If not how did he know all the strategies . I will never support evil but this is a clear case of legal Evil . Be wise <p> Guest 214 5 years ago <p> Harold Abbey , if I read your post correctly , I think I am agreeing with you . This is to Jane20 . The way you spell your words and your use of punctuation , ( or lack of ) , makes me suspicious of you . Also your use of grammar and spelling is very similar to the way scammers write . I will give you three examples from your post : <p> 1 . " ... i badly need an advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans for our first meeting ... " <p> 3. " ... i do n't know if his real or not ... " <p> I just wanted to put in my two cents . <p> ANONYMOUS 5 years ago <p> I had a person that I met on a dating site that claimed that he was a Lieut General Brad Law ( Commander Task Force and commander of the NATO-led m 's International Security Force based in Afghanistan . We chatted on Yahoo every night till the early hours of the morning . He said that he needed to send money down with a diplomat that will deliver the metal boxes to me as he was retiring in the next three months . <p> I was was so thrilled with this and he promised to come to South Africa to settle down with me . He got the so called diplomat to phone me from Ghana to say that he needed 15 000 dollars to be sent via money gram in order to the boxes to be released . Apparently it was confiscated and if the money was not paid I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 8.30pm and if I did not send the money on time he would not be able to board on his flight to South Africa . <p> I was too much in love to even question my stupidity . I sent the money . My lover then said that the diplomat paid the money in and now they are requiring further documents which I was not aware about . They now needed a further 20 000 dollars to get the documents done . I then smelt a rat and kept on telling my lover that I can not raise that kind of money . He made me believe that if I do not send that money in then he will be locked up for money laundry . I got the shock of my life when he said that . According to him he is allowed to do this kind of thing since he is in the military and since he is going on retirement . <p> Once he found that he could not get any more money from me he stopped chatting with me and I then knew that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt depressed that there are people out there that think nothing of scamming you out of your last cent . <p> I am glad that I did n't send more . This is a lesson to all lonely hearts out there BE VERY CAREFUL OF SCAMMERS THAT LOOK FOR YOUR PROFILE . They know who is single , lonely and has money . <p> liz47 5 years ago <p> Look out for Sgt.Martinez tall hazel eyes with child , lost his wife bitterly in a car accident .

His bio said he has a masters , but you could n't prove it to me by his writing .... sad ! <p> gvlpamrob 5 years ago <p> Cindarbug - <p> the person I have been chatting , is now in the hospital after being robbed and stabbed , I told him I could not help him , I know he is scamming me but I playing him back now . This email he sent me telling me this was the last straw I blew up at him and I sent him an nasty , nasty email after he told me of being stabbed and robbed accusing him of being a textbook scammer and that I was turn him to all of the scammer sights with his email address , IP address and pictures . He wrote me back that he was insulted and hurt that I used curse words against him and even told him he was going to hell . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me feel guilty . Next thing I knew he was asking for money to get him out of the hospital , I told him I could not help since I had already sent him money a couple of times ( I know stupid me ) , told him no several times and then he acts like nothing is wrong he always say it is okay baby , he would not answer questions either or even show me documentation that states who he is , he is afraid now that I will show to US Marshalls and FBI . Iam playing hard to get now and not being on Yahoo Messenger as visible , I think he is too but the minute I change it he is on there . I am just messing with him now to see what he does . WE did have some really interesting and sensual conversations and then that is when the asking of money started . He keeps telling me that he will send me my money because he loves and I am going to ask him for it this week . We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him that I have copies of all of our conversations , chats , emails , texts and prepared to show them to the authorities , not sure I would do since there is some scandalous conversations in there . Not quite 50 Shades of Grey but closer to 50 ways of Scamming . <p> Drew 5 years ago <p> She wants me you send money to the Philippines so her manager knows who she us meeting up with . So very many pictures of the same girl and some are model based but others are like friends hanging out and she us in every photo . Some pro done some not even close to pro . Story sends so legit but yet I am not to sure . No sad sobe story of any sort . Any advice on this would be nice <p> Drew 5 years ago <p> Sorry about the spelling on my last post . Was on my phone and stupid autocorrect . Lol . Still hoping for some advice on that subject . : ) thank you <p> Liz 5 years ago <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he was in Malaysia , a building contractor , His pics on profile were very handsome ... I felt I could easly fall for a such a handsom man . We chatted for about 6 days 2-4 times a day for hours . Yes he did tell me within the first couple of days that he loved me .... emailed me poems . Wrote beautiful things , said he could n't stop thinking about me . And I was a fool to I replyed that I could n't stop thinking about him . I was really starting to have very strong feelings .... then the red flags started ... #1 wanted me to take my profile off Match.com on the second day #2did n't answer a lot of my questions about him , some he did answer by on one of two word anwers #3 asked for my passwords to my computer ..... then BAM .... claimed his son who was with him in Malaysia came down with a terrible disease and needed money to treat him . Made me feel very quilty fo not helping him out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he prefered to use google chat ) he keep saying how could I do this to him ? Do n't you love me , I love you ... I would do anything for you .... blah blah blah ... well after two days of going round and round , I was at that time playing him , wanted to get him back good . I finally said a few choice words to him and typed done .... that was it , never heard from him again . Now I think I am being scammed again the only difference is he text 's me alot . I have n't heard much about texting , he did call me once and sounds nothing like his pic . What are your thoughts on these scammers texting ...... I have decided not to proceed with him but just was wondering about texting . I did not give him my address , just my cell phone number . I hope I did n't make a mistake ... Please some advice ! ! ! ! Thanks <p> Jenny 5 years ago <p> I would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone on an on line dating service . He was very charming but thankfully I have great friends who said he was to good to be true . So I started investigating on my own and found out he was lying BIG time . Of course he was . Anyway the thing that mad me the most mad was , here he was using pics from someone that was in the Army . He created 4 facebook accounts all saying different things ( he is not that smart . ) So I got to thinking , what if I could see if the real person that he was pretending to be was actually on face book . He used the guys actual last name , since it was on the uniform pic that he sent me . And it is not a common last name thank God . Well this is why I 'm sharing my story . I did find the Real person on facebook and messaged him and told him what was going on . That someone was using all of his information and pics to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pretending to be me . I feel so violated from this person that I let into my life , I could n't imagine someone using all of my information to be pretending to be someone else . So I feel at least better for finding the actual person and letting them know . I got lucky in finding them . <p> lol 5 years ago <p> Smiles <p> cindarbug 5 years ago <p> Really sad how these people work on your emotions . I 've never given anyone my phone number only a generic email address . So I ca n't say a bout texting , but you can always block the number . Funny thing , my sweet talker is now gone from Christian Mingle and has not responded to my last email suggesting we meet for coffee .... chances are ... he was a fake . <p> Sherry 5 years ago <p> I was love scammed and married him . He is from Nigeria his name Christian okonkwo , goes by Christian desire now cause he made his way illegally to the USA I believe he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Haiti , all lies , he is player soccer there by that name . Beware ladies <p> gvlpamrob 5 years ago <p> Can we put the scammers names , alias names and email addresses on here ? The person who scammed me made the mistake of sending counterfeit USPS money orders and I took them to the Post Office and now it is in their hands . This scammer claimed he needed to have me cash them at a check cashing store and I told would but I went striaght to the Post Office and turned them over and sure enough they are fake . He acted appauled when I told him they would not cash them and and then accused me of cashing them and keeping the money . I seriously ca n't believe I was so stupid to fall for some scammer ....... not a glory moment and I will never forget it . I will gladly publish his name , supposed pictures , info . etc . if I can . They people must be stopped . <p> Galwaygirl 5 years ago <p> CARSTEN FRIEDMANN got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! ! address phone number etc which he asks you to look at , to understand his work all very convincing the address is real and phone number live till you refuse to send money , but a scam artist , and i got taken in , please be aware ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> roz 5 years ago <p> Liz , I wonder if we meet the same man on match.com working in Malaysia , as a building contractor on a hotel . Very handsome and he sent me two pictures . <p> cindarbug 5 years ago <p> I saw a news video recently about how to look up someones ip address ( where the email originated ) . They also have good examples on YouTube . You can also check to see if their email is blacklisted . I also recently subscribed to a website spokeo.com , it 's $23.70 for 6 months , but it gives you the ability to search people by username , email , address and phone . That 's where I discovered my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hi , I have been chatting to a girl , who says she from Australia , her mums from Ghana , so at the mo she is in Ghana with her mum as she split up with her fella a long time ago , she sent me gorge pics , but I dough ted , they were real , so I told her go on cam , she said she has n't got cam , but if that 's what will prove to me , she is real she will get a cheep cam.Any way she did , &amp; whent on cam lol , anyway she said she wants to come to England to see me , but cant afford the flight , so I said I would pay here in England , &amp; she can collect the tickets at the airport . But she said that would n't work , as in Africa its all bribes , &amp; she would be messed about , so it would be better for me to send the money hmmmm can any1 advise plezzzzzz lol <p> gvlpamrob 4 years ago <p> Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If anyone uses Match.com and they get IM from people , it is usually a fake profile , especially if they ask you to switch to another way to communicate ( yahoo , etc . ) I would block all people from IM . I hope this person that scammed me gets in trouble , he had someone send me counterfeit USPS money orders and now they are investigating . Not sure what will happen , I know I will never get my money back and I wish I had read this article sooner , it would have saved me some money and especially heart ache . I will never allow anyone to do that to me again . If they sound too good to be true it usually is . <p> haze 4 years ago <p> Hey what 's up ? I think I 'm being scammed , well I 'm not , cause I ai n't sending a damn thing . Lol , but a girl in Nigeria ... rf started hitting me up , things seemed ok , said she was an art collector.then asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you would not want me to starve or die of hunger " haha this is what she says to me after 4 days of talkin ... give me a break . I straight up called he out on it and told her she was tugging on my heart and that ai n't cool.I also said that your work would not just stand you like that . So now she wants me to send my info , name , where I live , and my phone numbers . I told her I 'm not having my identity stolen , that 's my life.she swears she is n't a scammer , her emails are never all that long but I said how my questions never seem to be answered and her photos do n't look professional , but her and her friends do.my gut says I am but I ca n't be quite sure . I would love to give her the benefit of the doubt but I do n't think I 'm that stupid ... oh yeah , she wants my info because she won a cancellation prize of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she wants to send it to me then I do n't Know what ... should I do it and keep the money . <p> gvlpamrob 4 years ago <p> She will probably send you fake money orders , get all of her info and have her send then expose her for the scammer she is . The person that scammed me would not even send any kind of I 'd . I was stupid do n't send her anything . <p> haze 4 years ago <p> Thanks man , love all of the help and support you receive on sites like this . It makes me very happy and gives me tremendous hope for mankind that there ARE descent ppl out there who truly care about the well being of others.I feel for everyone and their stories in this column . I really do , it is so beyond wrong to prey on the lonely and the vulnerable.I only want to be happy . I have learned alot from this site in particular , and have put it to good use . After I read all this info I emailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to answer . Guess what ? I have n't heard anything since . Haha I think they is pretty funny , I asked if she really was a black Nigerian man and if so the things he said to me is just disgusting and made me sick.I hope all scammers rot , they totally deserve what ever misfortune befalls them.gvlpomrob , I 'm sorry you had it done to you , I never meant to call you or anyone else stupid . That was a poor choice of words on my part . This can happen to anyone with a good heart , its a blessing and a curse . I 'm sorry , no one on here is stupid , you are all good descent ppl with the exception of wizzy . Talk about your all time scumbags . Lucky I do n't know where to find you , you . punk . Straight up ... tear that dudes face off and would n't feel bad about doin it . Well thank you for the support and advice , means the world to me . I will definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . I wish we could put an end to this but they seem to be everywhere . After here I have noticed them everywhere and count my blessings I figured this out before who knows what , bankrupt comes to mind among other things .... thank you again so much , can not begin to describe my appreciation . peace <p> nwkgirl 4 years ago <p> Hello everyone . Thank you for posting your comments . I too was scammed by the same man that may have contacted a few of you . His scam name is " Barry Callaghan " . He said he is from the U.K. and working out of the Philippines as a contractor . I was very lonely and depressed when I lost my father over a year ago . This is how this man scammed me . Something in gut kept nagging me about things not adding up , but his words were intoxicating . I thought he cared about me and so I sent him money . I only came to find out the truth after chatting with him for nearly 4-months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chatting with . He also took this woman for lots of money and robbed her of her emotions . Thankfully , he only got our money and we are now friends . We manage to get on with our lives and often left with a sense of betrayal on how someone can steal and lie to woman this way . I told him he would pay for his actions , maybe not to me or the police , but to God . <p> Good luck to you all and beware when talking to strangers . Listen to your gut and talk to your family and friends if you dig someone from a dating site before you take next steps . <p> With warmth . <p> jayjae 4 years ago <p> Hi Roz , This sounds similar to the story being told to a friend of mine . Very handsome , working on interiors in a big hotel , his materials for the job stuck in customs , he 's never worked abroad before , does n't much care for the food , has been sick , etc. etc. etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago <p> Anythingartsy - <p> Can we post their pictures on here of who they claim to be ? <p> Glitter214 4 years ago <p> I talked to a man for two weeks . He came on strong ... but english was good for the most part . ( Everyone makes a mistake here and there ... ) He said he was in Malaysia ... originally from Illinois . Even had a website for his company ( which only had been formed in June 2012 . Said as soon as he was done he wanted to meet . I 'm thinking ... okay ... maybe he 's okay . ( His accent was stronger than I thought it would be as he said he was born in France ) . Then yesterday he said that the job he was working on was stopped . ( Engineer ) That the Malaysian government insisted he pay taxes up front . He said he knew nothing about this . He had almost all of the money ... but needed 10,000 dollars . I said I had no money . Then he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up with the 1500 . I said I was sorry , I had no such money . He said he would end up in court if he did n't pay within 48 hours . I said .. " You are not listening ... I do n't have the money " . He said I 'll call you tomorrow ... I am so sorry . Next day I get an email ... he 's sorry ... he loves me ... but is there anyway I can raise the money ! OMG ... ( He sent me many pictures ... and just to make sure I said ... send me one from your hotel room ... and sure enough he did ... and it was the same pics that were on Match.com ) So for a while I thought ... okay he 's on the up and up .... UNTIL the request for money ... and how for an hour he kept at me .... not in a mean way ... but making me feel sorry for him . Glad I 'm not rich ... lol . Also I 'm glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking man ... too bad . My first scammer . <p> gvlpamrob 4 years ago <p> Please delete the iamscam above it is offensive ! <p> gvlpamrob 4 years ago <p> to Glitter214 what is the person 's name you have been corresponding with and on match.com . This sounds just like the man I was corresponding with . <p> Bottlemagnet40 4 years ago <p> Hi I myself dealt with a scammer recently.She had really pretty pictures and a kind heart and a good talker . We fell in love over a few days then she said she needed money for a plane ticket to see me.She claimed to have been recently out of work and fallen on hard times.I was aware of what was going on i did not want to believe it because i loved her but she failed the test.No money was taken only my heart . Watch for all red flags trust your gut.Aloha <p> sonfollowers 4 years agofrom Alpharetta , GA <p> Yeah , this is really great stuff , and very accurate . I saw all of these signs when I was on Match.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news is that it 's really very easy to spot them , generally . I did notice that I never saw a scammer on eHarmony ( something to consider ) . Either way , they do make it more obvious than they really intend . Once you sniff out a couple of them , the rest are easy to spot . <p> Thanks for writing this ! <p> Adam 4 years ago <p> I 've been chatting with this woman who claims to be originally from Los Angeles , says she is in Nigeria for business regarding jewelry and is needing money in order to finish up and come back to the United States . Her backstory is as a child , parents were killed when she was young , then moved to the U.K. to live with her grandmother , and now she tells me how I 'm the only person who can help her with getting back to the U.S. She has provided me with not only supposedly pictures of herself but also supposed documentation of things to prove her claims are legitimate . The main things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken English for a while and then all of a sudden will respond back with picture perfect sentence structure , spelling , grammar , and punctuation . Also she only answers my questions here and there . Another thing I 've noticed is the person continually uses the BUZZ ! ! ! in order to get my attention . This whole situation is really weird since they keep claiming how I 'm the most wonderful person and keeps saying how God brought us together and that we are meant to be together . I 'm starting to see past the lies and they also claim that their internet is bad over in Nigeria and why their computer either has to reboot or why they are not online for a long period of time . <p> Has anyone else experienced this sort of situation or perhaps is potentially being scammed by the same person ? <p> sonfollowers 4 years agofrom Alpharetta , GA <p> Yeah , very , very common . I actually heard this sob story a couple times ( was n't Nigeria though ) . <p> Kellz 4 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will save some innocent people from emotional heartache as well as financial loss ! Ca n't believe the crack pot who posted that people who scam are in the right because they are poor ! Start a charity through the local governement and not a scam ! How ' bout that ? All the time spent scamming can be put into something legal and positive without praying upon innocent and vulnerable people . I am going to do my part in spreading the word to beware of these criminals . Is n't that what scammers are ? Criminals ! <p> DivaRN 4 years ago <p> Glitter214- <p> This sounds exactly what just happened to me ! ! ! ! I would love to compare notes ! He states that he is from Chicago ; however he is in Malaysia doing business as a contractor . He and I talked via e-mail , texts and phone on a daily basis . He came on very strong , but I thought that it was because he ( supposedly ) was Greek ; ergo , I overlooked it . Within two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean " to him and demanding him to pay $62K in taxes PRIOR to him getting paid for the contracting job . He proceeded to ask for my help . I , in a not so gracious manner , told him I could not help him . He then told me that I never cared for him and that if I did , I 'd give him money . I called Match.com . I was informed that the account he was using had been a woman 's previously ... He ( or whomever ) had hacked it . The man in the photos was beautiful . I wish I could find him ... the REAL man in the photos ... As I 'm pretty certain that poor man has no clue his pics are being used . There is a very special place in hell for these scammers ! <p> michael147 4 years ago <p> I am recently talking to a girl who says she is in Ghana with her Mom because her Dad passed away . Her number starts out +233 . She has sent me pics that look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all look like her . I have actually seen her on cam and it really was her . She had her hair up and I asked her to let it down and she did so I know I was really talking to her and it was in a bedroom not a cafe or some place similar . Everything I have read about her sounds familiar from what I am reading on here but other things make me think she is real because of the number and actually seeing her on cam knowing it is her I am talking to . She is in school to be a nurse . I have constantly told her I have no money to help her but she continues to talk to me . Saying money is not an issue . I even asked her how long is she willing to wait to meet me . I am confused because some things sound like a scam but other things just make me think she is actually real . No sob story either . No kids . Please help . Thanks <p> Kays65 4 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I know not to email him as he said in his profile so I did . I talked to him quite a bit , and I have to admit I did get caught up in it . It seemed to good to be true so I started checking him out and trying to find stuff about him . He said he lived 60 miles from me , but I had a home phone and cell phone for him and they both showed he was not where he said he was . I finally told him to not contact me anymore , but he kept pursuing me . I had made the mistake of letting him have my phone # and we texted back and forth . I agreed to chat with him last night if he would answer questions I had , and needless to say he did a very poor job of answering them , and the ones he could n't answer like inconsistencies in his story he would turn the subject toward me and not trusting him . I had flat out told him days before that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't understand what his motivation was . Do they sometimes try to get you so in love that you will marry him ? I do n't even think it was the guy in his pics . Do you think I need to worry that he has my phone number ? It is a cell . I do n't think he would come where I am , but you never know . <p> Mo 4 years ago <p> I just sent a comment about the guy from Texas who lives in London now , who used to be an engineer , but now says he is a soccer scout and undercover agent . I looked up his IP address from his emails and it said the message was from the UK . <p> Mo 4 years ago <p> I do n't see my previous post on here . I met this guy on Cupid who had just 1 picture , but sent me another one through personal email . He said he does n't have any more pics of himself cause he does n't like taking pictures . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK - London - the rest of the year . His profile said he was an engineer . I asked some questions about engineering cause I work with a bunch of engineers . He eventually told me he does n't post his true profession because he wanted me to like him for him , not his career . He said he was a soccer scout for professional teams . He is saying now that he is also an undercover agent , and that 's why he could n't do video chat . I ended the " relationship " then . He had some broken english , but not too bad . He also kept calling me baby , honey , love , etc. and after 2 weeks told me that he loved me . <p> 2 weeks after that , he contacted me again . Is this typical ? I was very cautious , but still chatted with him . He has sent me a few emails , and the other day he said " I LOVE YOU SO MUCH " and signed off as Forever Yours . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always capitalizes his I 's and uses some punctuation ( especially ... ) . I 'm not sure if he is a scammer or what . I mentioned to him that he sounds like he could be and keeps telling me to trust him , that he is truly who he said he is . He said we will meet soon and that I just need to be patient with him . <p> What do you think , is he a scammer , or could he be legit ? Do I give him some more time , or give him the boot ? <p> Mo 4 years ago <p> An update , he has had some players and agents from South Africa visiting him and he said he subscribes to DSTV to watch the soccer matches . I checked online and DSTV is based in South Africa , so I 'm not sure if someone from London can get that service . Also he is going to Portugal tomorrow for ( supposedly ) watching some players to possibly sign up for soccer . <p> manuelaricci69 4 years ago <p> Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's in Malysia and quite few details are matching , except he is from Spain . Good spelling endless phone calls from him and txt 's ... i wanted to end but he is not giving up . Telling me that he loves me and so on . Seems very caring guy . Wonder if we are talking to the same person ? lol <p> Mo 4 years ago <p> The name of the guy I am talking to is Mark Jeremy . I have never gotten phone calls or texts cause I have n't given him my phone # . He freaked me out yesterday cause he said he was going next to Africa to check out players in Nigeria &amp; Ghana . His storis that he tells me sounds more and more legit every day and sound pretty true , but I still am not sure . I wish there was an easy answer . <p> Author <p> AnythingArtzy 4 years agofrom OHIO <p> Dingy .... Sorry it took so long to get back here but I hope you have dumped your Guy by now .

I 've read each comment and though I have n't commented on every one it does n't mean a slight in any way . <p> I 'm saddened by some of the stories and laughed at a few where you have played them back . Just please4 keep in mind , no matter what else they may say and how convincing it is , the basics are always the same . First they will ask you to LEAVE THE SITE TO COMMUNICATE . If they do just that one thing , it 's a dead giveaway so do n't let yourself get drawn in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i am talking to someone at the moment she says she is from ghana and she works for world vision and she has got her own place and her previce relationship she was beaten we have been talking for 3 days now and she asks me if i want a long distance relationship and she wants me to send her money for a calling card so she can phone me i see wot you have written she does sign off a lot then come back on at the moment she has talked to me every day she even gave me her address and sent me pictures it does feel strange as i have read your comments it seems the same would they send you their address that bit confuses me <p> gvlpamrob 4 years ago <p> AnythingArtzy , <p> Can you insert pictures on here for these people who are scamming ? I think if everyone could show who they think are scamming them , so others could see . <p> DANNY 4 years ago <p> hi there i am hanged up with this man who keeps asking me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I am a scammer but has never received money from any of my victims after serious chats and serious phone calls . Do you know what I need the money for , no none of you bastards on this website ever know and I am going to tell you . After messing around with our money also government officials are also messing up the education systems and parents are forsaking their children , so what do we do ? ? <p> No jobs to do and nothing else to do you guys should just pray for your selves and wait to see better moves coming up ... <p> Good Day . <p> I hope my victim sees this website very soon because if he does n't he is a dead man . <p> Sherian 4 years ago <p> I too , have been scammed and the scammer just keeps emailing and trying so many different ways to scam me . So far , he has worked on my emotions so , that he has gotten over $3000 dollars from me . He was coming to see me and pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse that he ca n't come . He had more unexpected expenses that has come up before he can come and see me . All this put me out of my home , because I could n't recover from that amount of money given to him that I was suppose to get back . I have n't turned him in yet , just playing with him and seeing all the different ways he 's trying to scam me . <p> Red Face 4 years ago <p> An hour ago , while I was checking my e-mail , a pop up screen appeared and threatened to " confiscate my internet access and put my computer the hands of the US govt . " This was n't if I gave whoever sent the message $300 . It was clearly phony . There were misspelled words too . <p> I received scammer messages before stating that they want to put me in jail for stuff I never did in another nation if I did not send money . Notice how there is no address mentioned for where to send the money in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report them . <p> sara 4 years ago <p> just curious , my scammer has actually video chatted with me . He looks just like his pictures . A VERY handsome white man . When I speak to him on the phone he sounds German , but claims to be English albeit with an " unsorted " accent . How do they do the video chats ? <p> DoveHeart 4 years ago <p> It 's sad what the world has turned into . Am Nigerian , and for whatever it is worth , I totally condemn fraud and am ashamed these ills are now almost synonymous with Nigeria . It feels like a continental disease ! <p> And now , some of us are deprived access to credible dating experience on the internet . <p> Finally , I want to thank you Admin for this exposure , I love the redemptive roles . <p> kristal 4 years ago <p> i met a man from confirio.com , we chatted first like he is checking my values and views in life , then after 4days of chatting regarding some question and answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is looking for to be his next wife . He is very God fearing man and told me that he has 1 daughter aged 15yo . Actually i do n't  see him on cam bec he told me that he is in ohio now but originally living in dallas texas and has house there with 5 bedrooms . our love story is to good to be true , in 2 weeks chatting , his agent send me a requirement to obtain my visa . then after submitting my documents , in less than a week his agent send me his flight booking . i never doubt he is kind of scam . I also chatted with his daughter and its seems like im talking to a kid who really want to have another mother . He told me that his wife died bec of blood cancer . everything went smoothly .. until one day he told me that he will go to London for some work related , after 3 days in london , he told me that he is a victim of identity theft . he is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embassy was helping him to get through with that mess . then here 's the redflag begin .. since he is a victim of identity theft all his credit cards and even his bank account was put on hold and he dnt have way to get money .. his daughter need money to attend the school activity , he knows that i cant resist the charm of a kid , by the way i do n't  chat with her on cam too bec she is in school dorm only but promised me that i can see them both when they are in dallas texas . i have no choice but to send her daughter $500. they keep communicating me after i send money so i thought if its a scammer after i send money they will disappear too but since they still communicating with me i thought they are for real . he told me that he will come back to texas 2 days before their flight to manila and we have a chance to chat on cam and he will send back my money too . but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flight he did n't come online but sending me an email msg telling me that they are in a hurry to go shopping and no time to come online since the flight is on the evening that day too . the second thing happen is they are put on hold in amsterdam bec of his document , the airport officers seized all their things and he cant get the money on his bag . they need to submit the document from high court to allow them to take the flight going to manila . but they need $7500 to have that document .. i told him to ask for the parents of his daughter 's best friend , and that 's what he do , but told me they can only lend him $7200 , see he need $300 to come up with the money , that 's the time i investigate his name online . i found his email address as one of the romance scam i told him that but told me that i 'm not trusting him , he is mad at me , since i really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what i found out about his email address . He keep insisting to send me at least $100 to add up to the money he needed in order to get the document or else they have no choice but to wait them to be deported back to US. i check his IP address and found out he is from nigeria not in amsterdam but he has dispute about that , he said the ip address is varying when it is roaming . he is mad at me for not trusting him and want to end our relationship bec he said how we can be together if i do n't  trust him . it seems like he is blaming me for the end of our relationship . i 'm so confused what to think , i 'm still hoping he is for real but in his statements there 's lot of loops and inconsistent . after i read all the stories here , i was convinced that he is kind of scam. he 's using the name harper dean , with yahoo i 'd harperdean72@yahoo.com , he has daughter name teri using yahoo i 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal immigrant officer . cassie and alan jones is the name of teri 's friends . <p> mike 3 years ago <p> When they get angry when you refuse to send money that 's when you know its a scam . A stranger do n't just ask for money or say they love you after a week get real lololololololol ..... I make sport of them on some of my free time . Just to build up their expectation then I crush them on all there mistakes that 's when they go away ... <p> Shrud 3 years ago <p> I started an online chat with girl from UK . After chating with her for a long period of time .. about month/half . Then she ask if I could send her $200 to help her and that she would pay me back . I started to think about all this , because she had a job . She kept telling me she loved me and she would like to come to America to stay with me for life . Then I started to come across stories about what some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . I started to look into all this and found a lot tips on scamers and what to look out for . Key points were noticed in this girl I have been chanting with . Then my prayers were answered , I had leave to see my son , in an emergency i need the money i was suppose to send her ; I email her and explained to her what and why I can not send her the money . I ask her to email me back and hope that this does not effect our relationship . Its been over due for her email me. she was always emailing me every morning telling me that she miss me and loves me . Then i knew i had be hit by a person wanting money only and disappear after receiving it ... as a lot of stories had been told . So it was a close call for me . Now I am direct in questions and most of the girls do n't reply back . So every one just be direct with questions and answers . <p> colorado-tex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to have a site like this--and I am grateful because you all helped me to stop a scam before it went any further . I was scammed by Barry Callaghan from London , UK . Engineer working in the Philippines . I did send him a small amount of money , but stopped before it got worse . Totally beautiful words . I was smitten and taken . My heart hurts and it was a good lesson . He has a GREAT story , sends great pictures ( himself , his mom , sister , and children ) . Found him on Match.com . Please watch out ! <p> luv2laugh 3 years ago <p> Glitter214 - I think I have met the same person but on How About We . His name is Mark Royce , says he lost his wife in a car accident , has a 12 year old named Brian who lives with his Spanish mother in France but he lives in Tampa FL and only sees his son on holidays . He claims to be a construction engineer on a project in Malaysia . Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting to that point . What tipped me off that this was really too good to be true was when he kept asking me the same questions and then provided the same exact response - word for word , mind you - about what a romantic time was . Well , I got suspicious and googled the who paragraph only to find that most of our " chat " was a finely scripted scam ! Needless to say , he has been on google messenger , sent emails , etc asking where I was . I have no intention of responding . Let him wonder . <p> Charm 3 years ago <p> I met someone on a dating site that turned out to be a scammer . He was not the cuties guy on the block , but seem to be the nicest . Everything moved extremely fast , from friendship to undying love . He offered to come an see me , but I already had a commitment for that weekend . He said he had to travel to Malaya on business , and sent me his American Airlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match . Red Flag . On top of that , he called me when he was suppose to be boarding the flight . Red Flag . When he arrived in Malaya he suddenly ran into all these financial difficulties , but was trying to work it out . Then , was able to do so with a company in the UK on a Saturday , and they were going to send in $100,000+ . Red Flag . However , his account was frozen and wanted to have the money sent to me , then for me to transfer it to him . Red Flags , Alarms and Whistles ! Instead of calling him out on it , I decided to go another route and wrote , " It 's not you , it 's me routine , " to back out of the relationship completely . I did n't want to contend with the back and forth pleading emails , phone calls , and texting . So far it has worked . Even though I was no long associated with the dating site , I knew he was . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it very seriously . <p> Daisy 3 years ago <p> I started talking to a guy i met on a dating website . I did n't really think anything of it , or it being a scam until we actually started chatting on Yahoo . It has n't turned into a money situation , but the first red flag for me was when he told me that his wife died and he moved out here to get back on his feet , but left his son behind . Who the heck leaves children behind after a death of someone so important ? ? Then a couple days later after I asked that ever popular question " what do you like to do for fun ? " His reply was , I take the long drive to NJ to see my daughter . So then I 'm thinking that he has two kids , but later in the conversation just says its his daughter . She lives with his sister . But never really goes into detail . <p> The only thing we really talk about his what do I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good wife , because I have good wife qualities . We do n't talk all the time , we talked on the phone for like five seconds before he dropped the call and he tried to blame me . I 've been trying to arrange a meeting with him , but he always says he is busy . He never answers his phone , even that day we talked on the phone , he told me to call and he never answered . <p> He started professing his love for me after our first chat . There is no way you know enough about me to say you love me , or for me to say it back . He does n't answer many questions . Just today he told me that he bids for online jobs for roads . He is going to Nigeria of all places for a couple of months . Funny , I was pretty sure you were already from there . <p> I 'm thankful that he does n't know that much personal stuff about me , but it just never occurred to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told me he was going to go to Nigeria . Every one knows Nigeria is a hot bed of scam activity . He should also know from our conversations that i have no money to send him . But I 'm curious to know if he 'll ask . I think I may just keep talking to him just to see how far he 'll take it . <p> Anyway I just wish there was more information about dating scams , but I guess dating in general is a risky endeavor . <p> Ispy13 3 years ago <p> ( SMITH JAY NARK ) IS HIS SCAMMER NAME ; <p> This message is from the scammer , he sent me this message on Match.com . <p> BEWARE OF THIS PHONY SCAMMER ! <p> Hello there ! ! ! ! !

The talk of sex over and over again will disconnect a man 's brain from his logical self . After 8 dates with a lady she wanted $100k diamond after a wild sexual encounter . She said she wanted me to show her that I really loved her and was not just using her . The lady collects rings from every date . She said she would not accept costume jewlry if you really loved her . This lady had no heart and no conscience and was super hot looking and smiling . An older lonely man and a younger woman is the perfect set up to be taken and cleaned out as much as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off because you " do n't trust " her . These women look back over a year and at the " diamonds " they have gotten from love struck guys and they are proud they are so good at their game . Jewelry to a woman is the first hint of a scammer----------jewelry to a woman is the way they can get $$ out of you on the pretense of affection . Tell them after 1 year of marriage you will give them that $200k diamond----not after 8 weeks . <p> Maryanne 3 years ago <p> Met a real life local scammer ... goes by the name of Jeremiah Watson ( his real name ) and lives in Los Angeles .

But ? If it looks and sounds to good to be true then it probably is ? <p> No matter what we do to stop these scammers , however we do it or report it as many guides and books are written on the subject you will never stop the scammers as they just move on with other identities and different photo 's to catch their victims ! <p> Whilst some of us are on the net trying to find love in a genuine capacity there will always be room to be scammed so my advice is ? Use what life has given you and that 's the intelligence of knowing that if something seems to good be true ? Then it probably is ! and if you fall for it then you have have yourself to blame and learn from it ? <p> However , if you want revenge knowing that you are being scammed then complete a file of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and anything else such a copied passports , copied visa 's and any other documentation and send a copied file to the Embassy where you live that pertains to the scammers ethnicity and a copied file to your Embassy of the country that pertains to the scammers ethnicity i.e Russian Embassy in the UK and British Embassy in Russia . <p> Of course ! Do not let the scammer know your doing this as keeping them talking could give you additional information like for instance ! If they ring you after you provide your number to them as you can do a phone number check to see where that number originates from ? <p> i.e. If the scammer pertains to be from Russia and the number after checking ( if it is not witheld ofcourse ) originates from let 's say the Nederlands then its guaranteed to be a scammer ? <p> Like wise , if the number is witheld then it 's more than likely to be a scammer as anyone who says they love you ( after a couple of weeks ) would have no reason to withold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the scammer would have your number but for a small price in not being scammed paying for a number change might prove to be a lot cheaper than your life savings ? <p> And yes ! Before you ask ? I too have had the unfortunate experience of being scammed by a Russian Woman and as I speak to you this day Thursday 02/04/2015 4 files have been sent to The Russian Embassy and British Embassy in Russia and ( due to the phone call ) The British Embassy and Dutch Embassy in Prague and she ( or could be a he ? ) does n't know ... <p> I could probably say a lot more , but I do n't want to bore you , but trust me ? There are ways to riddle out these scammers if you 're prepared to scam the scammer with only one result ? Arrested and the key thrown away ! ! ! ! <p> For all you genuine people out there ? Good luck in love and life , and for all you scammers out there ? We are not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK <p> Judy 2 years ago <p> i have been talking to a man on FB for about 5 months . The first time he was in Tennessee n then he had to go to Spain n then S Africa he told me his car had been burned with his briefcase n everything he had in it . Started asking me for money . Small amounts saying he was hungry his name is Gino Jovanni . Says he 's Italian but when I talk to him on phone he can barely speak English n says he was born in Italy but was raised in U.S. He has sent me 6 pictures . He is very nice looking n says he wants to marry me . He also says his wife n son were killed in a car accident but has a son who lives in Tennessee city , Tennessee . I would love to post his picture can I ? ? <p> Heartbroken 24 months ago <p> I was just nearly scammed . I have been talking to a woman these past 2 weeks . She is exactly like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Her profile showed we were both from the same state in Australia and she was currently working in Turkey for FCF which is a foundation that assists in 3rd world countries ( real organisation ) . She travels the world helping people in need as she is a registered nurse . She works overseas 3 months at a time then comes home for 6 weeks . At this time she had already finished her official duties and was staying back volunteering to help a 6 year old girl called Tara who had a hear condition and was awaiting funding so she could be transferred to Germany for surgery . <p> We spoke about family and how she was born in Scotland , then moved to Argentina when she was 15 where her dad died . then 8 years ago moved to Australia with her mum who later was revealed to have died of cancer just 2 years ago . her mum was also a nurse . <p> This girl had great values and was really too good to be true . We even chatted on webcam the first night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microphone did n't work so we typed . She even new the city I lived in although we never went in to too much detail . <p> Anyway now that Tara 's funding had come through , she was now booking her flight to return to Australia . After which she went to cash her cheque but the banks would n't accept it as it needs to be cashed in the country of issue . First red flag for me . Who gets paid by cheque these days ? she only had 24 hours to come up with the balance or risk losing her flight , flag 2 . The company she worked for refused to help as she had already missed her flight by staying back to help Tara , flag 3 . I then stuoidly offered to help and she told me the amount was $735 USD which is $1000 AUD , flag 4 . I almost went ahead with it before taking a step back and googling turkey datung scams and found all the signs I picked up on were used with other people . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. then stopped replying to me which used to happen quite often which I read is another sign . Anyway today I googled the address she gave me to accompany the money and found it was a hotel . I called the hotel who confirmed no one by that name is staying there . <p> I am so glad I did not send any money and was smart enough to look it up . I do feel very stupid for falling for it all as I really was feeling in love with a girl I had n't met . I 'm happy to share the longer version of the story if it helps other people and even the conversations we shared . <p> Be careful with your hearts people . I was very guarded but dropped my guard for her . Big mistake . If it 's too good to be true , it probably is . <p> jeffrey coventry 22 months ago <p> I had gotten on one of those date sites and all 4 ( supposed claimed ) females had almost the same identical sob stories ! Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1st one claimed that she was from Uk and had recently moved to Nigeria for a better life and good job there but when she got there they robbed her and took all her credentials passport money ect . RED FLAGS IN THE 1ST 2 TEXTS ! ! ! Nobody move sto Nigeria for a better life ! Sob story in the 1st sentence !

RED FLAG ! And her email address did n't even check out anywhere and another dead give away is when none of them even have a FACEBOOK I have not met a female yet that did n't have one ! And then the last 2 girls had must of been reading from the same scripts ! One claimed to be a freelance interior designer from San Antonio Tx and how she got mugged at gun point and they took all of the money that her customer paid her to go get materials with and could I help her with $400 so she could finish the job ! RED FLAG ! And then she said that she was in Pittsburgh in the Ohio Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! OHIO VALLEY IS IN OHIO NOT PA ! WELL I PLAYED HER BACK FOR A WHILE and then she went on about how she was doing Papers Works on her dead fathers inheritance ! How she was going to get millions ! SHE KEPT SLIPPING WITH HER MIS SPELLED English too ! Any way the other girl had the same identical story about the dead fathers inheritance claim and doing ( Pappers Works ) and how she was going to get millions and soend it on me and how I was the perfect man for her and so on and so on ! Neither one of them wanted to talk to me at all always had excuses except when I kept insisting the last 2 girls called me from different # 's from different states and only wanted to say Hello with an indian or Arabic accents but both of them sent me pictures of blue eyed blond girls and claimed that they were born and raised here in the US !

@@96276112 @476112/ <h> Five Symptoms of True and Deep Love <p> Love , in all forms is a pleasing emotion . People who are in love , are healthier , happier and more active socially . It is often the case that , with love , comes an aura of beauty around women , and a sense of confidence and courage in men . <p> Indeed , those who have never fallen in love , are missing out on a great deal . Love is a product I am trying to promote for my own selfish personal gains , which include , living in a more caring and loving society , talking to people who understand love and have loved , building relationships with people who know what relationships are , et cetera . <p> This article is for those who have , or think they have fallen love . I am not going to talk of signs of infatuation , which appear like symptoms of love , but are far more pronounced and ephemeral . So , here are the 5 symptoms : <p> The world seems a better placeNo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is just your perception and point of view that changes . With love comes more self-confidence and courage , allowing you to face the world with increased vigor . <p> A distorted sense of time when you are thinking about the personIn the absence of the person , you might lie down in bed thinking fondly about him/her , and it only seems like a few minutes when in reality you might have spent more than an hour . And to top it all , you are not even tired of thinking so much . It is a fact that people in love have daydreams which are not only longer , but also more real.On the other extreme , a day in the absence of that person might seem extra-ordinarily long . <p> Acceptance of flaws without complaintsYes , in the state of limerence , you might just not be able to see any flaws with your object of love . With the passage of time however , when that stage has passed , you do recognize and realize that your beloved is neither godly nor flawless . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if necessary , compromises are consciously made . <p> Deep sense of sharingYour happiness does not seem complete until you have shared it with your beloved . Any and all possessions you have , you willing share with him/her . You do not think twice about compromising on your needs , if you feel the needs of your partner are not fulfilled . <p> You never get bored of the personNever .. as in , even after several years of knowing each other . Everyday , you can talk and chatter and never run out of words , or grow tired listening .

Many times the self-sacrificing that is done takes you away from your partner ; however , in most cases , the sacrifices must be done . Circumstances and situations arise that take away from the fun times and alone times that is longed for to remain . The moments together is beautiful and the intimacy is most magical , but real life sets in - family , jobs , responsibilities - that are not always pleasant . True love stays and waits patiently for the more intimate and together time moments , that makes staying all worth it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather be at or share ones life with . To live without your partner is to be in a world alone , even tho surrounded by others you love . Being in love is a more intimate of love . You must display and have the qualities of love to be in love - Patience , forgiveness , respect , kindness , peace , joy , to name a few . Without these qualities one can not say he/she is in love . Lacking those qualities in ones relationship , when in love , would be detrimental . Ones in love need those qualities in their relationship to deal with outside influences , negativity and the imperfections that exists in us all . With in love comes a price , but the joys and moments of intense happiness is all worth it .

Source <h> When You Think Your Spouse is Having an Affair <p> As an online writer , I look for frequently searched keywords and phrases so that my articles are more likely to be seen on Google 's search results . When researching phrases for coping with cheating spouses , I was shocked to learn that there are a few thousand monthly searches for surviving an affair , but nearly a hundred thousand searches on how to have one ! <p> Looking deeper , I found that there are also just a few thousand searches each month for topics relating to how to hire a private detective or investigator , but many thousands of people offering their detective services for pay . <p> If you think your spouse is cheating , hiring a private eye will only be as good as the detective 's skills . It 's truly one of those areas where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many contacts that will provide sensitive data , or could be relying on public information and stakeouts , which proves costly for his or her clients and does n't produce great results . <p> Before you hire someone to spy on your spouse , do some footwork of your own with these tips and tools . You 'll be able to save time and money , and you will get to the bottom of things quickly and effectively . <h> Have You Had a Partner that Cheated on You Before ? <h> Signs that Your Spouse is Cheating <p> Maybe your gut 's telling you something is wrong , but you ca n't quite put your finger on it . You do n't want to make unfair accusations or ask questions that imply you do n't trust your partner if they 're not doing something wrong since that can hurt your relationship . If , after taking a look at these signs , you discover that you do have sound reason to suspect an affair , you may still want to avoid asking questions temporarily . <p> If your partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover what 's really happening . In my opinion , it 's better to investigate first and ask questions later .

Then again , some people cover their tracks very well , either to protect their own reputation or others ' feelings . ( I know , if they really cared about someone 's feelings , they would n't be having an affair in the first place ! ) <p> Before we start looking at investigative steps you can take , I want to talk to you about the idea of snooping . Some people take great offense at the idea of snooping . They claim it 's a breach of trust , and they 're right about that . " If you do n't trust your guy or girl , just leave , " they 'll say . <p> Their advice is not necessarily practical . You probably realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might be worried about an affair because you 've seen indications that something has gone wrong with your relationship and you want to set things right again . Maybe you think your partner 's preparing to have an affair , but if it has n't happened yet , you 'd like to know how to get your relationship back on track before it happens . <p> Another reason people fear affairs is their own insecurity . If you 're insecure and your partner has not given you reasons to be suspicious , it may be tempting to use these methods to reassure yourself at first , but doing so often leads to compulsive behaviors . You may find yourself unable to resist checking up on your partner , and in doing so , you 'll eventually be discovered and it can destroy your relationship even if your partner has done nothing wrong at all ! I do n't suggest using these methods to address insecurity when there are n't at least two of the signs of cheating discussed earlier . <p> Ok , back to business .... <h> 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods , you will need to obtain passwords from your partner or bypass security controls on his or her cell phone or computer . If you bypass security codes , you could be on the hook for illegal activity depending on the laws in your state , so you should become familiar with what the law does and does n't allow you to do , or avoid getting discovered . <p> 1 . Look over the information you can find on your partner 's cell phone . Do you see frequent calls to or from an unfamiliar number ? Do you see calls identified as someone you know calling much more often than they used to ? Cheaters may assign a man 's name to his mistress 's number to mask her identity or vice versa . Write down any numbers you do n't recognize and run them through several search engines to see if it hits upon any useful information . <p> 2 . Examine text messages . Frequent texting may also be shown on your cell phone bill . Some companies provide more thorough information than others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what numbers sent and received text from a phone on your account . Either way , reviewing your cell phone bill periodically will instantly reveal if your partner 's been texting dozens of messages a day to another number . Another important piece of information that 's easier to see on your cell phone bill than the phone ( though it can be there , too ) is call duration . Is she spending two hours on the phone with a certain number ? <p> 5 . Use the free " Find my Phone " app available for iPhone users to track all the phones on your account . This does n't require access to your partner 's cell phone or his consent , but it does require that both the phone you 're using with the application and the phone that 's being tracked are on the same account . <p> 6 . You can install a keystroke logger on your spouse 's computer . These software programs are difficult to detect , but you should also know that it may be illegal to use keyloggers . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , and why . You may violate federal wiretapping laws if these restrictions are n't followed . If you go this route and your spouse discovers how you obtained your information , you could face jail time if you have n't followed the strict limitations . If you meet the requirements and install this software , it can send e-mails and screenshots to an e-mail address that you specify . <p> 7 . Get access to your partner 's computer and access his or her e-mail and social media accounts . If there 's a chat program installed , look for chat histories . Check the deleted and trash folders ( they 're not always the same ) to see what has been removed . Review the Sent Messages folder to see what your partner has sent to other people . <p> 9 . Check your partner 's browser history and cookies . If they have been deleted , check again in a few days . If they 've again been deleted , be concerned . <p> 10 . For a fee , you can hack your spouse 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text messages , e-mail contents , and more by downloading apps of your own . A simple internet search for spy applications will reveal a number of applications with varying costs , ease of use , and features . The programs take several minutes to install and are not easily detected on the target 's phone . For an overview of how these aps work , watch this video . ( I do not endorse any specific company or website for this purpose , including the one responsible for the video . ) <h> Bonus Investigative Tip - Retrieve Deleted Texts <p> If you need to retrieve deleted texts from a cell phone , follow these instructions from the computer that your spouse uses to synchronize his or her phone . It will only provide texts sent between the two most recent syncs , but that may be enough , especially if they do n't synchronize very often . <h> Comments <p> There may be legitimate reasons for clearing browser history , but it is still a sign that someone may be cheating . Thank you for commenting ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browser history every week on my pc or it will keep buffering and not play youtube vids . so the history clearing " evidence " is total bullshit <p> Louis 10 months ago <p> If you 're asking the question about your own spouse , then you 're already suspicious and there 's a problem .

@@96276115 @476115/ <h> 3 Types of Behavior That Are Burning Red Flags in a Relationship <p> In every relationship there are issues . You have to take the good with the bad . Arguments happen . That 's normal . People have their quirks and if you want to be part of a couple for a long period of time , you do need to learn how to accept certain traits or annoying habits that could be less than desirable . <p> But what about traits or behavior patterns that are not good for the long haul ? How do you know when someone is going to be a destructive force in your life rather than a healthy influence ? <p> Here are 3 glaring red flags that , unfortunately , get brushed off early on in relationships when infatuation takes over : <h> 1 . The Need To Control <p> If a person is attempting to control the clothes you wear , the friends you have , time spent with family , or even the words that come out of your mouth - it 's time to reassess your situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to control what I wore so that other men would n't find me as attractive . He wanted me to constantly be covered up . It was ridiculous , but I took it as a sign that he was really , really into me . <p> Wrong . <p> He was really , really into himself and how he looked to the outside world . He wanted everyone to see that I was completely within in his power . I was nothing more than an accessory to his ego and a pawn in his sick game of power and control . <p> If anyone ever tries to manipulate you or threaten to take their love away unless you look or act a certain way in their presence , you can bet that relationship will be detrimental to your overall health and well-being . It 's actually a form of abuse and it 's not acceptable under any circumstances . <p> When a partner tries to control your daily moves - it may be a serious red flag Source <h> 2 . Complete Emotional Shut Down <p> We all get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pout for a while . But most of us get over it within a reasonable amount of time . <p> But some people take it to the next level . They shut down . Completely . They stop talking to you for days , maybe even weeks . They cut you off . <p> It could have been a disagreement over something small or something big . Either way , this kind of person does n't offer the ability to hash things out in a reasonable , respectful manner . <p> While you may think that emotionally shutting down is much better than outright physical or verbal abuse this is , in fact , another form of mental terrorism at it 's most insidious . <p> When you 're in a relationship with someone and they just shut you out without warning and you have to sit around playing a guessing game as to what went wrong or beg them to talk to you , then you 'll need to pull the plug on the relationship . Unless a person like this is willing to fix their issues or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner loses their temper daily over small issues - it may be time to reassess your relationship Source <h> 3 . Highly Aggressive/Short Fuse <p> This one is probably the most obvious of the 3 . But that does n't mean it 's the easiest to break away from . <p> When you meet and get into a relationship with someone who starts to exhibit characteristics of an extremely bad temper - pay attention . This kind of behavior is potentially dangerous and even life threatening . <p> Look , everyone gets mad . Even furious sometimes . But over what ? Someone cheating or someone lying perhaps ? Possibly . But getting to a level of anger over something as simple as a change of plan or the waiter bringing the wrong dish to the table while you 're out to dinner is another story . <p> It does n't matter if the person you 're dating is smoking hot or amazing in bed - if they constantly lose their mind and start screaming over small issues , then they have a problem . It 's not you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . It 's them . <p> It 's not normal to yell , scream , punch walls , or physically assault anyone on a regular basis . If you 're in a relationship with someone who does these things or even threatens to , please make sure you have a good support system around you and seek help right away . This includes sexual aggression where you do n't feel 100% safe during sex or feel forced into it in any way . <p> We all make mistakes and we all choose the wrong relationships from time to time . It 's not okay to stay in an unhealthy relationship just because you believe you 're in love or you 're lonely . There are people out there who can have healthy , functioning relationships . I promise . Do n't settle for anything less than that . <h> Comments 64479 @qwx924479 <p> sending <p> sabih ul hassan 9 months agofrom pakistan <p> health is waelth <p> dashingscorpio 9 months ago <p> There are only two ways to experience joy and peace of mind in relationships : We either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what we have .

Invariably , the work would get done , but do you recall the work involved in trying to work with your partner ? The compromise ? The having to swallow certain comments back in order to truly get anything done and be successful ? <p> Well , life 's like that , too . It does n't matter whether you are discussing a job partner or a life partner . There are compromises to be made and sometimes , you may end up biting your tongue in half in an effort to keep the proverbial waters calm . Relationships are tough to navigate in general ; there 's a give and take , to an extent , and it 's all too easy to fall under one or the other of the categories instead of walking the fine line between the two . <p> That can lead to relationship challenges , especially when it comes to communication . Resentment can run high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing all the " heavy lifting " in a relationship . Communication can falter , and then , you become as though you 're roommates and if you 're lucky , friends and nothing more . While that may work if that 's what you truly want , most people are looking for something that 's a little more fulfilling in their long term relationships with a partner . <p> So how do you work around it ? Of course , if you 're the likes of Erica Kane , or some other soap opera vixen , you 're looking for ways to check up on your person , whether that means skulking around their phones , rifling through their personal email accounts , or even just tracking their movements . However , we need to function as though we have some sort of rationality coursing through our veins and not jealousy - we need to communicate as though we were mature and responsible adults . <p> But why is that so hard ? <h> Relationships Can Be Funny <p> Source <h> Communication Is Hard , But Necessary <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If someone yells at you , I 'd bet you feel instantly defensive and start shutting down . You might feel as though the other person has no interest in hearing what you have to say and that you 'll either be talked over or simply dismissed , so there 's no equal exchange of ideas . There 's no opportunity for calm discussion ; there 's only resentment and pain . <p> The biggest part of communication is knowing that it 's about exchange . It 's not " I talk , you listen and we 're done . " It 's all about sending messages to each other , either verbally or through written means , and actually allowing that passage of a message to come through . You have to stop and listen to what 's being said , see how you feel about it , and then respond honestly and openly about it . <p> You ca n't bully someone into listening to you ; you have to be willing to work with the person in order to ensure that words are clear between both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to the other person 's ideas while still working towards clearly communicating your own honest views . <p> There 's also the whole notion that you need to pay attention to body language . Ursula the sea witch sang in The Little Mermaid that people " should n't underestimate the importance of ... body language ! " and that is very true . Nearly 90 percent of the communication we have is nonverbal , which can be a very difficult sort of communication to interpret . In addition , you ca n't pull a Homer Simpson and just glaze over like the donut you might love to eat . You have to stay focused and pay attention to what 's happening during the conversation and around you . Having such a conversation would not work if you 're basically out to lunch about it . <p> So , work on sharing messages back and forth ; do n't stop working together for the growth of your relationship and turn things into " fine " and " whatever . " It 's going to be a real challenge , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , your partner , and everyone else that might be involved in the relationship - kids , relatives , whomever that might be adversely affected if something goes south for your relationship . <p> Just trust in the communication flow and be open and honest .

" Do n't sweat the small stuff !

Most women dealing with a cheating husband or boyfriend start thinking of ways to fix the situation . We wonder what we 've done to drive him to the arms of another woman . We struggle to think of ways to bring him back . <p> STOP ! <p> Cheaters cheat . That 's it . Cheating is not about boredom or dissatisfaction . Cheating is the result of a psychological flaw that allows men or women to rationalize cheating and breaking vows . Affairs are not normal , healthy reactions to uncommon relationship struggles . Rather , they are unhealthy reactions to trials and tribulations that are common to most relationships from time to time . <p> Do n't torture or embarrass yourself making the same mistakes millions of women make when they know their man is cheating . Save your self-respect , dignity , and time by cutting your losses and freeing yourself for a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mistake #1 The Investigation <p> When women suspect their man is cheating , the first mistake they make is launching a fact-finding mission . Spying , calling around , and interrogating their partners , women invest their energy in a senseless hunt to prove what is already obvious : the relationship is seriously broken . <p> You do n't need proof that your man is cheating to know that something is n't working between the two of you . Whether he 's actually cheating or you 're just seriously paranoid , evidence is n't required to know something has to change . Driving yourself mad trying to catch him in the act of cheating wo n't deliver the peace of mind you are looking for . It will only make you look and feel crazy . <p> Source <h> Mistake #2 Blaming the Other Woman <p> Yeah , she 's got to be pure evil to steal another woman 's man , but that 's really not the point . She 's not the one who committed to you and promised to be true to you , and then cheated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , it would be someone else . <p> People cheat because they are cheaters . When a man cheats it 's not because he was innocently seduced by another woman 's wicked charms . It 's not because she offered something you did n't . It 's not because she 's better than you . Cheaters cheat . They do n't need temptation to have an affair . <p> Let go of your anger towards the other woman . It 's misguided . Focus instead on the fact that the partner you were in a relationship with violated his commitment to monogamy . If it was n't her , he 'd have found someone else . Even if she leaves the picture , there are millions of women in the world for him to cheat with . <p> Source <h> Mistake #3 Changing to Keep Him <p> First of all , if your man is cheating , the last thing you want is to keep him around . Cheating is a pattern of behavior that wo n't stop no matter how many promises he makes or how many changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheated on you , it 's time to move on . Cheaters cheat . . . and cheat . . . and cheat . <p> Second , you did n't drive him to cheat . If your man is cheating , it 's not a reflection of your worth , but an indication that he is incapable of handling the responsibility of maintaining a relationship . He is lacking mature adult coping skills . The problem is his , NOT YOURS . <p> Because you did n't cause your man to cheat , you ca n't stop it either . There is nothing you can change in yourself to make a cheater be loyal . Stop thinking that if you were thinner , prettier , wilder in bed , or more exciting he would be faithful . If your man is cheating , he 's not thinking about you one way or another . <h> Comments 64479 @qwx924479 <p> sending <p> random 7 months ago <p> you have no facts in there , rather you seem like someone who has been cheated on and is butthurt. grow up . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cheating us he the one cheating on me <p> Anna 5 months ago <p> Thanks for writing this article , I 100% agree with everything you wrote in it .

Each person will have their own rating for the severity of the breach of trust . For someone a cheating spouse is worse than having money stolen , or having a child indulge in some sort of ' inappropriate behavior ' seems a lot worse than some friend borrowing an article and never returning it . <p> Trust yourself Source <h> How Can I Forgive That Person Who Broke My Trust ? <p> Breach of trust seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend just taking a step back from the situation . Observe your emotion and its intensity . Ask yourself why you have put yourself in that position . Before judging another ask yourself where you have broken trust- in relation to another or even to yourself . For example you promise a friend you 'll call and you do n't . Do not judge it as ' it was such a small thing , you ca n't take it seriously ' . No matter how trivial the matter - it is still a promise not kept . You do n't know that your friend may have waited and waited for you to call , maybe it was serious to her/him . When it is you breaking that trust no matter in how trivial a manner , you do n't give it a second thought . <p> Often we make promises to ourselves that we can not keep . We make resolutions that we forget . it could be simple things like- I 'm never going to smoke a cigarette again and then you find yourself giving in to a craving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat ' restricted ' things . We do n't take these breaches of promises and trust as seriously as we do a breach of trust by someone else . We are the offended party , we are the victims , the drama kings and queens . <p> Well , here is the news : our subconscious mind takes all things without question . If you habitually break promises to yourself , create a breach of trust for yourself , then according to your subconscious mind it is expected and acceptable behavior , and you will then find yourself in these situations over and over again , breaking trust and having your trust broken . <p> The first thing that you need to do is introspect . Find your your own breaches of trust for the universe is but a mirror , mirroring to you your own actions . Forgive yourself . Watch your words , do n't make promises that you never intend to keep , no matter how trivial . If you are going back on your word , be consciously aware of the fact . Change your behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As you make these changes within , start being trustworthy to yourself and others , you will find them being reflected back to you , in relation to yourself and to other people . <p> You Trust that the sun rises each morning- no matter what , is it not easy then to trust the universe to do the right thing for you ? Source <h> Trust the Universe <p> Trust that the Universe will bring to you the perfect situation for each of your lessons . It will never bring to you something that you are not in alignment with . The only way you can bring Trust in your life is to begin to create it in yourself first . The ways of the universe are also straightforward , only we do not perceive them to be so . In order to learn forgiveness , you will be put in a situation where you are required to forgive ; maybe having your trust broken is one of them . <p> In conclusion I can say- get over it , forgive yourself and forgive the other . It is a lesson well learned .

I am going through such turmoil , as I asked for the separation , after years of hesitation . I finally plucked up the courage and felt such relief at that time , but unfortunately can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My husband stopped speaking to me in May - NO communicatiaon whatsoever - and moves out of the house this week . I have been miserable with guilt since the beginning and am so filled with fear but I know in my heart we could not have continued . I need help with sorting out my emoitions , as he has got the bad end of the deal - moving out , visit rights , contribution for our son , and the bare hatred that he shows me is killing me . Over and over , I ask myself if I did the right thing - he did not treat me as a wife and enjoyed his life with ' the boys ' , made no effort to work at the relationship etc . So , does anyone have any advice for me on how to stop feeling so desperate and lonely ? Thank you in advance , TG <p> Author <p> Karen Fritzemeier 3 years ago <p> So sorry you are going through this . It is a painful , very difficult time . I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call , or clergy . I found counseling helpful too . I have n't been in one of these groups , but have heard good things about them from a couple of friends . Perhaps there is one in your area ? http : **39;9188;TOOLONG <p> I found when my husband moved out , it was one of the most agonizing parts of the process . I had lots of tears that week . Give yourself the space to grieve that you need . <p> GG 3 years ago <p> My wife of 17 years just moved out couple days ago while I working far from home . I left work behind came home immediately to find an empty house . There was no warning and I thought my marriage was stable . We do not have kids . This has been devastating to me emotionally to me as I did not see it coming . I stumbled upon your writings looking for some help . Thanks , your words are encouraging . The first thing I 'm having to do is breathe ... I do n't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardest thing emotionally I have ever gone thru . She was my best friend . <p> Author <p> Karen Fritzemeier 3 years ago <p> GG , I am so sorry for the pain you are going through . I had a few tears when I read your message . You are in my prayers . <p> Theguff 3 years ago <p> Dear GG , I am so sorry to read your experience and all I can say is let 's hold hands through this - me losing my husband and you your wife . There is always an ear on the other end of the line , so do write your feelings and people will respond and help in many ways . Lonliness is the killer , so make sure you try to do things out of the house . Where is ' here ' ? COuntry ? My friends have been a great help but one of them said to me that the most important thing was to learn to depend on myself ( something I have never had to do ) . So , I 'm taking one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings me . You 're in my prayers , hang on in there , there are brighter days ahead . Theguff <p> mark 3 years ago <p> my wife of eleven years left me with my five kids one bright Sunday morning love her to death and 6 months later ca n't stop crying with counseling meds and all . my grief is overwhelming she wont talk to me even though she let 's me see the kids i feel like i am losing my mind with pain it feels like a knife in my heart from morning till night even though i work full time may god have mercy on me and end my pain <p> Author <p> Karen Fritzemeier 3 years ago <p> Hi Mark , It is heartbreaking to hear about the grief you are going through . I attended this , and it really helped me with the pain I was dealing with . Might want to see if there is one near you . Highly recommended . LONG ... Praying for you and your family . <p> Narelle 3 years ago <p> Have just started this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advise is really helpful . <p> Author <p> Karen Fritzemeier 3 years ago <p> Thanks Narelle , I 'm so thankful you found it helpful . <p> Juz 3 years ago <p> I am also going thru this awful life changing event and still can not come to grips that my husband has left me after 27 years and 3 beautiful children together ... out of the blue and he is no longer in my life .... how do I accept the fact that he appears to be handling this very easily where I am left in the foetal position most of the time .... I just do n't see a time that I wo n't miss him and love him and even want him back .... where he appears to already made plans for his life without me .... no looking back seems to be his motto whereas I am still stuck in the life that we shared ... <p> Author <p> Karen Fritzemeier 3 years ago <p> When I was going through my separation , it was so painful , just like that . One day at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Except there is no funeral , no cake , no flowers , no chance to say good-bye , no crowds of friends and loved ones coming together in a big group , helping to mourn the loss . For some reason , just hearing that analogy was a comfort to me . It is pretty much devastating as if someone had passed away . The grief is very real , and very similar . I am so sorry and know that I am praying for you today . There is nothing to do but to wade through , and there will be better days ahead . Praying for good support in your life , and for your children , and that you can reach out for it . <p> Brendan 3 years ago <p> my wife is under serious stress at work and i in my job also , , over the last few months she started to distance herself from me , , this lead to me suffering a breakdown as she would not let me talk to her ! ! then my paranoia triggered something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was leaving us .. stating that she needed time away , but would still come home once a day to check on our children.I was devastated , , she was my childhood sweetheart and i will always love her , , 30 yrs we were together , i hope someday she can get over her illness and be friends with me again ..... but i would like any advice you can give to help heal the pain . thanks <p> Jonesd4 3 years ago <p> My husband and I have been together for 16 years and married for 15 . We have three beautiful children . Our journey of marriage started when I became pregnant after being together for 4weeks . I was told I could n't get pregnant they were wrong . After finding out when I was six weeks pregnant he told his parents and then asked me to marry him , I of course said no but when I was 6 months pregnant I decided we should . As it was we were young and immature I was only 23 and he was 21 . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't expect him to be perfect or the marriage to be a fairytale , but still it 's not what it should be and like many I have talked to I thought having more kids would help. ( wrong ) our kids are preteen sand teens now and one recently has been diagnosed with ADHD ( the youngest ) . I have struggled with him being an alcoholic and now he is abusing drugs ( prescription ) and to top it off he is taking my daughters pills for her ADHD Concerta . I have to hide them or he will take them it 's sad . To top it all off we bought a house 3 years ago with his mom in her name we live in the main house and she in the in laws quarters not wired for 220 so no stove or dryer for her she uses mine . We started out doing well in this venture but it started to get out of hand about a year ago . His mother pays all the little bills elec water etc and we make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate most of the things she does it has definitely added strain as well . She is widowed and has very low self esteem so obviously she relies on him a lot . Not to mention the fact that she started acting like our live in maid , she did n't stop there she started opening my kids mail report cards etc. for awhile I tried to brush it off then I started to get angry and venting to him . Now it 's all I can do to hold back . ( he is very defensive of her and puts her needs and feelings first ) I am not blaming my failing marriage on her but it 's sure not helping . Now it 's to the point where I want to separate temporarily to give both of us space and time to see if we can rekindle what we had in the beginning which as I said was very stressful . I do n't want a divorce but he is being rude unreasonable saying hurtful and mean things yet then he will text me obscene messages and inappropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am angry and hurt and need space he says ok and then I found out he 's been speaking with police and trying to figure out a way to kick me out so to speak . I feel in comfortable as it is as the house is in her name . I have asked several times to do MC but he declines for one reason or another . ( Money , lack of willingness to open up etc . ) I do n't know what to do ? Advise please would be appreciated ! ! <p> SALJR24 3 years ago <p> Hi I recently separated with my wife of 15 yrs ... I am lost confused and devastated .... I do n't understand how I as a man feel so much pain as to where she tells me she feels happy alone ... one good thing about us we are still good friends and the communication is there I just do n't understand how she can be so heartless towards me I have done everything and anything for my family one thing that kills me is that I am overweight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past year but she seems to not care anymore I am in a world of pain and I do n't see the light at the end of this very dark tunnel we have been together since she was 15 and I was 17 I ca n't give up on my family but I feel that she has <p> Terri 3 years ago <p> My husband separated from me this past weekend after 29 years of marriage . I also feel so much pain . I ca n't stop crying , I ca n't eat or sleep . I asked if we could try to work on our marriage but he says no . So I know I need to get through this but I just ca n't seem to get my act together . This was such a shock to me . I keep hoping he will just walk through the door and say we can start over . To make it worse there was a time that I had these feelings and I wanted out . He begged me to stay and work it out and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . It took time but we made it through and I was able to be happy and in love again . But he wo n't give me a chance to make changes in my behavior . He just wants out . I have been told to let him go and leave him alone and I 've been told if I still want the marriage I should fight for it . He holds all the cards because I really am afraid to do anything . I 'm afraid if I do get myself together and move forward with my life and there is a chance he might change his mind that this might make him think I do n't care . And if I try to get him to give us a second chance that he will not like that at all and push him further away . This is the hardest thing I have ever been through and the most painful . I wish I could just make it all go away . <p> Dona 3 years ago <p> Almost all of these stories fill the blanks of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last 13 years and have been with him for 18 years . I have been through three other bouts of his infidelity . Each time he asked for my forgiveness and I have taken him back . This last and 4th time he again found someone else to be with in our marriage . We now have two small children and I fill like I am losing my mind . I have begged , pleaded and groveled for him to leave this person alone . In the meantime , he has given many gross details and concluded that she is his dream girl . I have tried to keep this embarrassment from friends and family but I can not stop crying . I cry at work or at the drop of anything . This time I expected him to come back to me since I told him that I want him and will forgive him . He keeps telling me NO . The fear has overtaken me of raising children and moving on . I have even tried to commit suicide to escape the deep pain . He talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't go through with it , I 'm playing mind games . I am a my wits end , I want to move on so bad and see light but my life seems so dark . I have tried to find some light and him coming around everyday this is killing me . I do n't want to utter another plea but I just want him to come to his senses and come back . I am so confused , hurt and betrayed . <p> Maria 3 years ago <p> My husband kicked me and my kids out of the house 2 weeks ago .. He had another girl calling my phone saying they have been messing around .. We we 're together for almost 4 years . What i did was turn to god . And nothing else . Yes the pain is unbearable ! I sometimes feel lost and miss him . <p> Leanne 3 years ago <p> My husband of 13 years told me last weekend he wanted to separate . We have two children , 12 and 10 . In the past , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate you , why are we still together , we need to quit pretending that things are ok , etc ... ) all of this would be said after we would get into an argument about money , parenting , sex . However , we usually got over the verbal abuse and go about our daily lives . Well , last weekend , out of nowhere ( no argument was taking place ) , my husband decides that he has had enough and wants out of our 13 year marriage . I am devastated . Yes , I have said hurtful things to him , things that I said when I was angry that I never should have . However , I am deeply , deeply sorry and the last thing I want him to do is leave . I have poured my heart out to him through text because he wo n't communicate with me any other way . I 've even changed the way I am doing things just so I can prove that I love him and that I really do want our marriage to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has cut all communication with me , all social activities we had planned to attend as a couple he is going alone . He told me I could not go . He has come home every night this week at the wee hours of the morning , and sleeping until I get the kids and myself off to work and school . Then he gets dressed and goes to work . This morning , he packed a few clothing items and bathroom necessities . I 'm assuming my husband is not coming home tonight . I am at a lose ! ! ! ! What do I do ? ? ? I love my husband VERY much . I do not want him to leave . I 'm scared ... <p> Kevin 3 years ago <p> My wife of 21 years packed her bags and walked out on my kids and I six days ago . She sent me an e : mail to notify me of her intentions . The kids and I were totally blind-sided ... I have so much to say , but just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few to be a fairly hard and tough guy . I consider myself to be a pretty hard and tough guy , to find out how weak I actually am . At 51 years of age , I 'm an emotional wreck , totally not coping with this at all . Through the years , I 've taken some hard knocks , but nothing like this . Just now I start sounding like a right wimp , but geez I did n't believe something like this could hurt so much . I mean us guys are supposed to be able to deal with stuff like this , apparently not . <p> Msad 3 years ago <p> Kevin <p> Going thru this pain and devastation right now myself , it hurts no matter male or female when your the one left behind . I feel your pain and hopefully someday happiness will return to our lives . <p> Kevin 3 years ago <p> Msad <p> Thanks Msad ... I was kinda feeling I was the only one in the world inflicted with this human sickness , emotion . I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know which is worse , it effects my kids . Anyway , adversity is either going to break me or make me a better person . I hope you cope and come out ahead . <p> Author <p> Karen Fritzemeier 3 years ago <p> Kevin , you are exactly right . Someone once told me " Life can make you bitter or better . " Take the higher road and you will see ...... the pain will not last forever . My separation was over ten years now , but it was still therapeutic to write about it and share with others what helped me . I pray everyone who has posted here can find support , friendship and faith to help them through . There may just be a beautiful life yet ahead .... and you will be all the richer for what you have been through . <p> Kevin 3 years ago <p> Thanks Karen , but shooo I miss her ... This may be a bit cliche ' , but she is going to have to search a 1000 worlds and a 1000 lifetimes to find someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen Fritzemeier 3 years ago <p> Maybe I should re-phrase that . The pain does n't completely go away .... it just gets easier with time . The acute pain does n't last forever and the intensity lessens , thankfully . I felt the same way , Kevin . It was heartbreaking . There was a good book called " Love Must Be Tough " by Dr. Dobson I found helpful . Also want to say , you can always pray for reconciliation . All things are possible . She may turn around ..... I pray she does . But may the Lord help you and bless you in this uncertain time . <p> lisa 3 years ago <p> I have been with my husband 23 years and married 12 ... we have 3 children and he left me over Memorial Day weekend .... and does n't seem like there is any faith of us getting back to where we used to be ... He stepped out of the marriage 2 years ago n I seem to not be able to get over that and it 's killing our marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assure and show me that it was a mistake n that he loves me and wants me but I 've been so stuck on not forgiving him that I have pushed him away and now finally going to counseling but I think it might be to late . .. All I want to is let the past go but I need help on how to do it and I still have the feeling that there is someone else now in his life and that influenced his decision to decide out of the blew this is the time . ... I am not giving up without a fight but I do n't want to be hurt again and I do n't want to be alone either ..... He is my world and it 's hard being strong for your kids and I 'm still up in air at where I stand on this marriage ... he 's not giving me answers just keeps saying that I need to focus on getting counseling because I need to let all this anger go ... I just wish I knew if he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how do I approach the question without being so harsh and demanding .... <p> Carla 3 years ago <p> Oh my I do n't know where to start , I 've been with my husband 7 years married for 4 , we have new baby girl 5 months old . We went through ivf to conceive her , it was tuff , my husband was there but not , he was physically there for support but emotionally absent , I 'm packing up house now to move in a couple of weeks and my heart is breaking , but at the same time I have n't felt a connection with my husband for years , we rarely had sex and when we did I would make a comment like " that was so good " even though it was routine and plain . He 's response has always been " mmm hmmm " <p> I just feel like I want someone would can connect with me on a deeper level , I know this next phase in my life is going to be so hard especially with a baby but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with him . For years it was all about him , sport , friends hobbies ect and when we were " together " we watched tv in different rooms.He would take me to fancy places for dinner but there was no communication . I would look around the room and see couples laughing talking holding hands and we were just blank , he would be checking sport scores I would be twiddling my thumbs.our conversation were very mundane " how was your dinner ? " <p> To top this all off he is totally dependent on his mum , she has been the core of many arguments as she loves control and has access to everything in our lives , from money to bills to where we go for check ups for the doctor.after having my beautiful daughter I just could n't take the control anymore and began to speak up , they did n't like it and it has caused this break up as well as all the other things mentioned . I mean his mum wanted to be called mama , she bought a whole nursery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was overwhelming as it 's was happening but his response would be " she the grandma she can do whatever she wants " or " she 's just excited " he has NEVER stood by me in any disagreement with his mum , she always gets his support , while I stand alone , I just ca n't take anymore , my husband still thinks I 've over reacted but I feel I. Just speaking my mind . <p> There sis also another red flag which I discovered when we were first dating , he is very into a creepy fetish , when I approached him he said it was a joke , so I left it , I was going to marry this guy , I had to trust him . But then a few weeks back I found he was looking at this porn again and it totally broke me , I asked again and the same reason as many years ago was given.it makes me question his sexuality and he refuses to talk about it . I think why is he using all this energy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have sex and intimacy ? I 'm just so disappointed , he looks great on paper , great job , works hard , business , owns properties , plays sport , but on a deeper level he is absent . I 'm so sad , I hope I cope.he says it 's a trail separation but I do n't know if I want invest the rest of my life in a loveless marriage , I will have to wait and see , only time will tell , the saddest thing is I had pictured a family of my own with a mum and dad , now I 'm trying to picture it differently , it 's hard I hope I can find someone who will love me and my daughter and be connect on a deeper level <p> Author <p> Karen Fritzemeier 3 years ago <p> I 'm so sorry for all the pain you are going through . <p> Lisa , I think counseling sounds like an excellent idea . Also the " Love Must be Tough " book by Dr. James Dobson is so helpful . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read about porn addiction and what it can do to a marriage was called An Affair of the Mind by Laurie Hall . I highly recommend that book . I also wrote an article on hub pages ( see my profile to find it ) about the reasons to wait on dating , which would apply to separation as well as divorce . <p> MBRB 3 years ago <p> My wife decided Friday that I was to go live with a friend . She talked with them earlier in the day . Pretty much told me I could go that night or the next day she did n't care . <p> She tolded me she was n't in love with me . But loved me as a person . She only married me cause , I loved her unconditionally . <p> 2 weeks ago , I found out she has been talking to friends about our relationship for 6 months . That she is n't happy and I had to pull teeth to get her to talk to me . I asked her weeks before if anything was bothering her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Right around that 6 month marker she talked with a friend who is n't the best judgment for relationships . Who runs at the first sight of trouble . <p> We had an argument that night and I asked her to please talk to anyone other then them . Someone who is married or a closer friend . She agreed that they were n't the best choice to have gotten advice from . <p> ( It was n't advice really they just talked down about me and did some comparing themselves to me . ) <p> I found out that she has been talking to that same person about our relationship for the past 6 months . Also other friends . She stopped talking to me altogether about our issues . I was thinking things were going well . I worked on a few things and thought we were happy . <p> She told me she has been putting on a show for me that she was happy . ( The last person she should be putting a show on for . ) She has n't been talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I thought that was crazy I would never raise my hand to her or have ever showed signs I would . I do n't believe in violence . I 'm a very honest upfront kind of person . <p> She also said she wanted to bounce ideas off people before coming to me with our problems . I said that 's fine as long as it was a few days later not 6 months later . That a long time to deal with a problem that 's going no where . <p> So .. now , I 'm at my friends house with 1 of my dogs in a not my comfort zone trying to deal with this shock . Since there should have been more things to try before separation . Also longer then 2 weeks time to try to work things out since that 's when I was told about everything all these issues . <p> She did tell me I have worked on all of them and its not crazy things . But more thank you 's and being more positive . <p> But here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut out of my marriage and lied to for so long . She does n't want to talk to me . How is that going to help . That 's what got us to this point ! <p> I stumbled across tthis looking for some helpful answers . I did n't mean to just go off . But I 'm confused <p> Ed 3 years ago <p> I 've read through , and can relate to everything posted .... I 've known my wife for almost 25 yrs .... We 've been together the last 12 , and have only been married since 2011 ... A while back , I went to her , and told her we needed to talk ... I told her that we have slowly drifted apart over the last few years , to which she agreed ... She informed me that she " loves me " , but is n't " in love " with me anymore and needs her space and time ... I told her that I would be supportive , if she felt that is what she needs .. A week or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move out ... Again , I am being supportive ... She ca n't move just yet , so she has been staying in the house with me and our 10 yr.old son ... Now she is at the point that she does n't want to give or receive affection ... She also tells me that she is sorry for hurting me like this , but that she has no idea why she feels this way .. She says she has no answers as to why she feels the need to separate right now ... I 'm totally devastated . I have always loved this woman from day one ... I do n't drink .. I do n't do drugs ... If I 'm not at work , I 'm at home ... She even said that I am the " perfect man " ... I am just so lost at this point . I am on an emotional rollercoaster every day that is filled with so much pain and hurt ... No shame when I say that I cry every day ... <p> Kevin 3 years ago <p> Hi Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yep , some serious emotional pain . ( I have a couple of posts up above about two weeks ago ) I 'm not religious in anyway and this hub has a strong leaning toward Christianity , but what got me to peruse this site was the " HEADER " , getting through those early days of separation , because I really thought I was headed for a TOTAL BREAK-DOWN and having kids and all , I just could n't afford for this to happen . Anyway , in one of karenfritz 's responses to me , she indicated writing had helped her . So guess what , I just started writing and writing some more , in the third person , in an attempt to be totally honest with myself and less subjective toward my wife and her ( cruel ) actions to date ... Ed I do n't know where all this writing is going to go , but I tell you I 've seriously unravelled a lot of truths I have hidden from myself , really stuff and actions I 'm not particuarly proud of AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife 's premeditated motivations pertaining to her actions to date . The influences of environmental conditioning dating back to her childhood , i.e. in her extended family , one out of eleven remains married , the rest are either cases of abandonment etc , that have resulted in divorce . In my extended family , my mother has just now passed on , but was married to my father for sixty ( 60 ) years this year , my sister thirty six years , myself until recently twenty one years and in my whole extended family , I have a single cousin who has been divorced once and currently happily remarried ... GO FIGURE ... My wife as of recently , I do n't reckon has a chance of beating those environmental influences from her past . What do they say , we 're a product of our environment . Anyway , I do n't have answers for myself as of yet , but I have a jigsaw puzzle that I 'm building with my writing , which is seriously helping me cope with some of the pain of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame sitting right at my own doorstep , and insights of my previous partners psyche that I 've just chosen to ignore over these many years ... Bottomline , the most difficult thing in the world to do , is be BRUTALLY HONEST WITH ONES SELF , I reckon and sincerely hope I come out of this whole thing a better person . Probably to late for me to have another go at relationships , I 'm no youngster or oil painting for that matter , in great shape though ( LOL ) , but if I understand how this whole thing landed up unravelling on me , maybe my kids will have the benefit of this knowledge , so they do n't make the same mistakes I 've made my whole life through ... Good luck Ed , karenfritz is right , I do n't think the pain will ever leave me completely , but it certainly lessens in intensity with time . <p> Lisa Marie 3 years ago <p> Wonderful suggestions , sans the religious mumbo-jumbo . <p> brownie83 2 years ago <p> Hi ive been looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ive left my wife after 3years we always argue non stop she hit me 2 years ago blacked my eye we went to buy the house we were renting but i pulled out she not got much money and that 's all she cares bout is having a roof over her head she does n't get paid much so i pay for everything and i feel so guilty for this but we will end up doing something nasty to each other if i stayed there . My first wife left me for another man and 6 months later i was married again i think i rushed in2 it she is 14 years older than me and does n't like me going out anywhere with my friends as she do n't trust me im totally feel like crap sorry to use tgat word <p> Author <p> Karen Fritzemeier 2 years ago <p> It is an awful spot to be in . I am so sorry you are going through this . <p> Tess 2 years ago <p> My husband and I have been together for nine years , married four this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me yesterday that he thinks we should separate and I 'm totally crushed . He has always been very affectionate where as for me that does n't come very naturally . He started to distance himself from me a couple of months ago . When I approached him about this he said it took him having to pull away from me to for me to show him affection . I love him more than anything and I 've told him this but I do n't think he believes me . He says maybe we just got too comfortable together and that not living together might reignite our love . I cheated on him three years ago and denied it for two years . He said he 's still angry and hurt about that . I thought we had moved past it . He wants to see a counselor ( for himself ) and says he does n't want to get a divorce . When he says he loves me but needs to figure out if he 's in-love with me it 's like a dagger in my heart . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me anymore but is afraid to say so because he knows how much it will hurt me . I know this is my fault but I feel angry . Nothing makes sense and I ca n't stop crying . I feel lost , scared and alone . I do n't confide in people very often so this is n't easy for me . <p> Author <p> Karen Fritzemeier 2 years ago <p> Tess , I 'm so sorry I did n't see this sooner . I hope that things have improved for you since this was written some months ago . I apologize for not responding sooner . <p> Karen 21 months ago <p> Glad found this information to help me cope with the pain of being abandoned after 20 years of marriage .
