Specific date ? <p> The Navajo code talkers were also deployed in the Korean War ; the use of code talkers ended shortly into the Vietnam War . <p> Code talker is a term used to describe people who talk using a coded language . It is frequently used to describe Native Americans who served in the United States Marine Corps whose primary job was the transmission of secret tactical messages . Code talkers transmitted these messages over military telephone or radio communications nets using formal or informally developed codes built upon their native languages . Their service was very valuable since codes and ciphers can be broken , but languages must be studied for a long time before being understood . <p> The name code talkers is strongly associated with bilingual Navajo speakers specially recruited during World War II by the Marines to serve in their standard communications units in the Pacific Theater . Other Native American code talkers were used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War II , using Cherokee , Choctaw and Comanche soldiers . Soldiers of Basque ancestry were used for code talking by the US Marines during World War II in areas where other Basque speakers were not expected to be operating . <p> The first known use of Native Americans in the American military to transmit messages under fire was a group of Cherokee troops utilized by the American 30th Infantry Division serving alongside the British during the Second Battle of the Somme . According to the Division Signal Officer this took place in September 1918 . Their outfit was under British command at the time . <p> Adolf Hitler knew about the successful use of code talkers during World War I and sent a team of some thirty anthropologists to learn Native American languages before the outbreak of World War II. 3 However , it proved too difficult to learn all the many languages and dialects that existed .

" 5 <p> Two Comanche code-talkers were assigned to each regiment , the rest to 4th Infantry Division headquarters . Shortly after landing on Utah Beach on June 6 , 1944 , the Comanches began transmitting messages . Some were wounded but none killed . <p> In 1989 , the French government awarded the Comanche code-talkers the Chevalier of the National Order of Merit .

In the seventh month , on the first of the month , there shall be a sabbath for you , a remembrance with shofar blasts , a holy convocation. -Leviticus 16:24 <p> Rosh Hashanah occurs on the first and second days of Tishri . In Hebrew , Rosh Hashanah means , literally , " head of the year " or " first of the year . " Rosh Hashanah is commonly known as the Jewish New Year . This name is somewhat deceptive , because there is little similarity between Rosh Hashanah , one of the holiest days of the year , and the American midnight drinking bash and daytime football game . <p> There is , however , one important similarity between the Jewish New Year and the American one : Many Americans use the New Year as a time to plan a better life , making " resolutions . " Likewise , the Jewish New Year is a time to begin introspection , looking back at the mistakes of the past year and planning the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept at Days of Awe . <p> The name " Rosh Hashanah " is not used in the Bible to discuss this holiday . The Bible refers to the holiday as Yom Ha-Zikkaron ( the day of remembrance ) or Yom Teruah ( the day of the sounding of the shofar ) . The holiday is instituted in Leviticus 23:24-25 . <p> The shofar is a ram 's horn which is blown somewhat like a trumpet . One of the most important observances of this holiday is hearing the sounding of the shofar in the synagogue . A total of 100 notes are sounded each day . There are four different types of shofar notes : tekiah , a 3 second sustained note ; shevarim , three 1-second notes rising in tone , teruah , a series of short , staccato notes extending over a period of about 3 seconds ; and tekiah gedolah ( literally , " big tekiah " ) , the final blast in a set , which lasts ( I think ) 10 seconds minimum . Click the shofar above to hear an approximation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific reason for this practice . One that has been suggested is that the shofar 's sound is a call to repentance . The shofar is not blown if the holiday falls on Shabbat . <p> No work is permitted on Rosh Hashanah . Much of the day is spent in synagogue , where the regular daily liturgy is somewhat expanded . In fact , there is a special prayerbook called the machzor used for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur because of the extensive liturgical changes for these holidays . <p> Another popular observance during this holiday is eating apples dipped in honey , a symbol of our wish for a sweet new year . This was the second Jewish religious practice I was ever exposed to ( the first one : lighting Chanukkah candles ) , and I highly recommend it . It 's yummy . We also dip bread in honey ( instead of the usual practice of sprinkling salt on it ) at this time of year for the same reason . <p> Another popular practice of the holiday is Tashlikh ( " casting off " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creek or river , on the afternoon of the first day and empty our pockets into the river , symbolically casting off our sins . Small pieces of bread are commonly put in the pocket to cast off . This practice is not discussed in the Bible , but is a long-standing custom . Tashlikh is normally observed on the afternoon of the first day , before afternoon services . When the first day occurs on Shabbat , many synagogues observe Tashlikh on Sunday afternoon , to avoid carrying ( the bread ) on Shabbat . <p> Religious services for the holiday focus on the concept of G-d 's sovereignty . <p> The common greeting at this time is L'shanah tovah ( " for a good year " ) . This is a shortening of " L'shanah tovah tikatev v'taihatem " ( or to women , " L'shanah tovah tikatevi v'taihatemi " ) , which means " May you be inscribed and sealed for a good year .

In Judaism , Nissan 1 is the new year for the purpose of counting the reign of kings and months on the calendar , Elul 1 ( in August ) is the new year for the tithing of animals , Shevat 15 ( in February ) is the new year for trees ( determining when first fruits can be eaten , etc. ) , and Tishri 1 ( Rosh Hashanah ) is the new year for years ( when we increase the year number .

The term first appears in the Tanakh , in Ezekiel 40:1 . There , however , it does not refer specifically to the first day of the year , but to the " beginning " of the year . <p> In fact , Judaism has four " new year " observances which mark various legal " years " , much like 1 January marks the " New Year " of the Gregorian calendar while other dates mark fiscal or other " new year " events .

Some midrashic descriptions depict God as sitting upon a throne , while books containing the deeds of all humanity are opened for review , and each person passing in front of Him for evaluation of his or her deeds . All of these names are also referenced in the holiday 's extensive liturgy . <p> This holiday is the first of the High Holidays or Yamim Noraim ( Hebrew , " Days of Awe " ) , the most solemn days of the Jewish year ; the Yamim Noraim are preceded by the month of Elul , during which Jews are supposed to begin a self-examination and repentance , a process that culminates in the ten days of the Yamim Noraim known as Asseret Yemei Teshuva - The Ten Days of Repentance , beginning with Rosh Hashanah and ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me about Rosh Hashanah ? ? <p> Rosh HaShanah is the Jewish New Year . We repent for sins we have done against G-d and against other people . We pray for a good new year . <p> We blow the shofar ( a horn from a ram ) on Rosh HaShanah for many reasons , the main one is to " wake us up " to repent . <p> The prayers on Rosh HaShanah have three main themes : Proclaiming G-d as King of the world , Remembering G-d 's promises to us , and the Shofar and what it stands for . <p> On Rosh HaShanah we eat symbolic foods , such as apple dipped in honey , to represent a sweet new year . <p> There is a custom to walk to a body of water on Rosh HaShanah , and pray that our sins be washed away in the water . <p> For more information , you could post this question in the " Yom Kippur " category .

A few years back , The Great morel spotted three small grey morels ( the 3 " variety ) after repeatedly checking on a known patch .

A second one grew just under a half inch and the last one showed growth that was almost immeasurable . So with this scientific study in hand - yes they do grow .

Too much soil moisture is not a good thing nor is too dry of soil . Again , it 's tough to determine at what point rain levels are too high , but too much rain can sometime have a negative effect . Not enough rain is definitely not good for the morel either . Soil temperatures will typically range from 50 to 60 degrees .

For several reasons , one being it allows your morels to breath thus keeping them fresh and let 's some of the little critters fall out . Some believe this also allows the spores to disperse out of the sack and replenish the woods ( just a theory as far as The Great Morel knows ) .

Unfortunately , many health care providers are not up to date in what they 're telling parents , and many , many books are not up to date . <p> The following organizations recommend that all babies be exclusively breastfed ( no cereal , juice or any other foods ) for the first 6 months of life ( not the first 4-6 months ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * US Department of Health &amp; Human Services <p> * American Academy of Pediatrics <p> * American Academy of Family Physicians <p> * American Dietetic Association <p> * Australian National Health and Medical Research Council <p> * Royal Australian College of General Practitioners <p> * Health Canada <p> Most babies will become developmentally and physiologically ready to eat solids by 6-9 months of age . For some babies , delaying solids longer than six months can be a good thing ; for example , some doctors may recommend delaying solids for 12 months if there is a family history of allergies . <p> Reasons for delaying solids <p> Although some of the reasons listed here assume that your baby is breastfed or fed breastmilk only , experts recommend that solids be delayed for formula fed babies also . <p> * Delaying solids gives baby greater protection from illness . <p> Although babies continue to receive many immunities from breastmilk for as long as they nurse , the greatest immunity occurs while a baby is exclusively breastfed .

The probability of respiratory illness occurring at any time during childhood is significantly reduced if the child is fed exclusively breast milk for at least 15 weeks and no solid foods are introduced during this time . ( Wilson , 1998 ) Many other studies have also linked the degree of exclusivity of breastfeeding to enhanced health benefits ( see Immune factors in human milk and Risks of Artificial Feeding ) . <p> * Delaying solids gives baby 's digestive system time to mature . <p> If solids are started before a baby 's system is ready to handle them , they are poorly digested and may cause unpleasant reactions ( digestive upset , gas , constipation , etc . ) . Protein digestion is incomplete in infancy . Gastric acid and pepsin are secreted at birth and increase toward adult values over the following 3 to 4 months . The pancreatic enzyme amylase does not reach adequate levels for digestion of starches until around 6 months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucrase do not reach adult levels until around 7 months .

From birth until somewhere between four and six months of age , babies possess what is often referred to as an " open gut . " This means that the spaces between the cells of the small intestines will readily allow intact macromolecules , including whole proteins and pathogens , to pass directly into the bloodstream.This is great for your breastfed baby as it allows beneficial antibodies in breastmilk to pass more directly into baby 's bloodstream , but it also means that large proteins from other foods ( which may predispose baby to allergies ) and disease-causing pathogens can pass right through , too .

Healthy , full-term infants who are breastfed exclusively for periods of 6-9 months have been shown to maintain normal hemoglobin values and normal iron stores .

( for example , see Wilson 1998 , von Kries 1999 , Kalies 2005 ) <p> * Delaying solids helps mom to maintain her milk supply . <p> Studies have shown that for a young baby solids replace milk in a baby 's diet - they do not add to baby 's total intake . The more solids that baby eats , the less milk he takes from mom , and less milk taken from mom means less milk production . Babies who eat lots of solids or who start solids early tend to wean prematurely . <p> * Delaying solids helps to space babies . <p> Breastfeeding is most effective in preventing pregnancy when your baby is exclusively breastfed and all of his nutritional and sucking needs are satisfied at the breast . <p> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start solids later can feed themselves and are not as likely to have allergic reactions to foods . <p> I encounter this situation frequently in my office . Many parents have the misconception that all infants will be ready for foods between 4 and 6 months of age . The truth is that very few infants are developmentally ready at 4 months . In addition , it is now recommended to delay foods until 6 months in order to decrease the chance of allergies . I also have found that some infants are not developmentally ready for solids until 8 or 9 months . You can click here to read about what signs to watch for to determine when your infant is ready for foods . Breast milk is nutritionally complete for at least the first year of life . This means that infants can go for at least a year on breast milk alone , without eating any foods , and be nutritionally complete . Offering foods between 6 and 12 months of age is simply for social development and to get infants used to eating . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old into accepting solids before he shows many of the signs of being ready . This can create a picky eater and negative feelings about eating . <p> All mammals are protected by the same thing -they ca n't physically eat food until they are physiologically ready to digest it . For humans this means picking up the food , placing it in their mouth , gumming it , moving it back with their tongue , and swallowing it . The most obvious of course it the tongue thrust that newborns have -this reflex actively keeps food out of their body until they can digest it . But the other steps all have safeguards as well . <p> For healthy , full term infants the ability to eat food develops around 6-9 months . In recent years there have been numerous studies looking at the risks of certain things ( allergies , asthma , anemia , etc ) in relation to when solids are started and almost all have shown that the lowest risks are when solids are started between 6-9 months . <p> However it should also be noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , and that breastmilk is nutritionally complete for at least the first year of life despite earlier statements that it is not . An unpleasant feeling in the mouth is often a first sign of allergy and may cause babies to spit out rather than swallow allergenic foods . This is a very useful safeguard that should not be overridden . <p> You will know that he is really ready to start solids when : <p> * he is about six months old <p> * he can sit up without any support <p> * he continues to be hungry despite more frequent nursing which is unrelated to illness or teething <p> * he has lost the tongue-thrusting reflex and does not push solids out of his mouth <p> * he can pick up things with his finger and thumb ( pincer grasp ) <p> Babies who are ready for solids can usually feed themselves . Mothers often report that they knew their babies were ready when they picked up food from a plate , chewed it , swallowed it , and wanted more . <p> Most babies will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of age . For some babies , delaying solids longer than six months can be a good thing ; for example , some doctors may recommend delaying solids for 12 months if there is a family history of allergies . <p> The following organizations recommend that all babies be exclusively breastfed ( no cereal , juice or any other foods ) for the first 6 months of life ( not the first 4-6 months ) : <p> * World Health Organization <p> * UNICEF <p> * US Department of Health &amp; Human Services <p> * American Academy of Pediatrics <p> * American Academy of Family Physicians <p> * American Dietetic Association <p> * Australian National Health and Medical Research Council <p> * Royal Australian College of General Practitioners <p> * Health Canada <p> It appears that a baby 's general development keeps pace with the development of his ability to manage food in his mouth , and to digest it . A baby who is struggling to get food into his mouth is probably not quite ready to eat it . <p> The babies who participated in the research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not able to feed themselves before six months . Some of the younger babies picked food up and took it to their mouths ; some even chewed it , but none swallowed it . Their own development decided for them when the time was right . Part of the reason for this study was to show ( based on a theory of self-feeding ) that babies are not ready for solid food before six months . It seems that we have spent all these years working out that six months is the right age and babies have known it all along ! <p> It seems reasonable to predict that if parents choose to provide babies with the opportunity to pick up and eat solid food from birth they will still not be able to do it until around six months . The principle is the same as putting a newborn baby on the floor to play : he is being provided with the opportunity to walk but will not do so until about one year " because his own development stops him . But : everything depends on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his mouth for him . Since it is very tempting to do this , it is probably safer to recommend that babies should not be given the opportunity to eat solid food before six months . <p> Many parents worry about babies choking . However , there is good reason to believe that babies are at less risk of choking if they are in control of what goes into their mouth than if they are spoon fed . This is because babies are not capable of intentionally moving food to the back of their throats until after they have learnt to chew . And they do not develop the ability to chew until after they have developed the ability to reach out and grab things . Thus , a very young baby can not easily put himself at risk because he can not get the food into his mouth in the first place . On the other hand , the action used to suck food off a spoon tends to take the food straight to the back of the mouth , causing the baby to gag . This means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choking " and makes one wonder about the safety of giving lumpy foods off a spoon . <p> Why not cereal ? <p> Cereal is not at all necessary , particularly the baby cereals . Regular ( whole grain ) oatmeal is more nutritious for your baby . <p> The truth is , there is nothing special about these foods that makes them better to start out with . Babies do n't actually even need rice cereal <p> Meat provides additional protein , zinc , B-vitamins , and other nutrients which may be in short supply when the decrease in breast milk occurs . A recent study from Sweden suggests that when infants are given substantial amounts of cereal , it may lead to low concentrations of zinc and reduced calcium absorption ( Persson 1998 ) . Dr. Nancy Krebs has shared preliminary results from a large infant growth study suggesting that breastfed infants who received pureed or strained meat as a primary weaning food beginning at four to five months , grow at a slightly faster rate . Dr. Krebs ' premise is that inadequate protein or zinc from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the weaning period . Both protein and zinc levels were consistently higher in the diets of the infants who received meat ( Krebs 1998 ) . Thus the custom of providing large amounts of cereal products and excluding meat products before seven months of age may not meet the nutritional needs of all breastfed infants . <p> Meat has also been recommended as an excellent source of iron in infancy . Heme iron ( the form of iron found in meat ) is better absorbed than iron from plant sources . In addition , the protein in meat helps the baby more easily absorb the iron from other foods . Two recent studies ( Makrides 1998 ; Engelmann 1998 ) have examined iron status in breastfed infants who received meat earlier in the weaning period . These studies indicate that while there is not a measurable change in breastfed babies ' iron stores when they receive an increased amount of meat ( or iron ) , the levels of hemoglobin circulating in the blood stream do increase when babies receive meat as one of their first foods . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your infant . Babies have limited enzyme production , which is necessary for the digestion of foods . In fact , it takes up to 28 months , just around the time when molar teeth are fully developed , for the big-gun carbohydrate enzymes ( namely amylase ) to fully kick into gear . Foods like cereals , grains and breads are very challenging for little ones to digest . Thus , these foods should be some of the last to be introduced . ( One carbohydrate enzyme a baby 's small intestine does produce is lactase , for the digestion of lactose in milk.1 ) <p> ... <p> Babies do produce functional enzymes ( pepsin and proteolytic enzymes ) and digestive juices ( hydrochloric acid in the stomach ) that work on proteins and fats.12 This makes perfect sense since the milk from a healthy mother has 50-60 percent of its energy as fat , which is critical for growth , energy and development.13 In addition , the cholesterol in human milk supplies an infant with close to six times the amount most adults consume from food.13 In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ten eggs a day and almost ten ounces of chicken and pork for at least a month after birth . This fat-rich diet ensures her breast milk will contain adequate healthy fats.14 <p> Thus , a baby 's earliest solid foods should be mostly animal foods since his digestive system , although immature , is better equipped to supply enzymes for digestion of fats and proteins rather than carbohydrates.1 This explains why current research is pointing to meat ( including nutrient-dense organ meat ) as being a nourishing early weaning food . <p> The results indicate that in a group of healthy , well growing 12-month-old Swedish infants one-quarter is iron-depleted , although iron deficiency anaemia is rare , and one-third may be zinc-depleted . The high cereal intake of Swedish infants from 6 months of age may have limited the bioavailability of both iron and zinc from the diet . <p> Conclusions : These results confirm that meat as a complementary food for breast-fed infants can provide a rich source of dietary zinc that is well absorbed .

A computer then stacks and assembles the individual slices , creating a diagnostic image . With CT technology , physicians can view the inside of organs - a feat not possible with general radiography . <p> Magnetic Resonance Technologists are specially trained to operate MR equipment . During an MRI scan , atoms in the patient 's body are exposed to a strong magnetic field . The technologist applies a radiofrequency pulse to the field , which knocks the atoms out of alignment .

That will give you a good idea of how long he likes to go between naps , its usually fairly consistent . And knowing that will help you predict when he will be tired and ready for a nap in the future .

" <p> Hope it helps . <p> What is malaria ? <p> ( m ) <p> Malaria is a life-threatening parasitic disease transmitted by mosquitoes . It was once thought that the disease came from fetid marshes , hence the name mal aria , ( ( bad air ) . In 1880 , scientists discovered the real cause of malaria a one-cell parasite called plasmodium . Later they discovered that the parasite is transmitted from person to person through the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito , which requires blood to nurture her eggs . <p> Today approximately 40% of the world 's population mostly those living in the world 's poorest countries is at risk of malaria . The disease was once more widespread but it was successfully eliminated from many countries with temperate climates during the mid 20th century . Today malaria is found throughout the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world and causes more than 300 million acute illnesses and at least one million deaths annually . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa south of the Sahara mostly among young children . Malaria kills an African child every 30 seconds . Many children who survive an episode of severe malaria may suffer from learning impairments or brain damage . Pregnant women and their unborn children are also particularly vulnerable to malaria , which is a major cause of perinatal mortality , low birth weight and maternal anaemia . <p> There are four types of human malaria Plasmodium vivax , <p> P. malariae , P. ovale and P. falciparum . P. vivax and P. falciparum are the most common and falciparum the most deadly type of malaria infection . Plasmodium falciparum malaria is most common in Africa , south of the Sahara , accounting in large part for the extremely high mortality in this region . There are also worrying indications of the spread of P. falciparum malaria into new regions of the world and its reappearance in areas where it had been eliminated . <p> The malaria parasite enters the human host when an infected Anopheles mosquito takes a blood meal . Inside the human host , the parasite undergoes a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various stages allow plasmodia to evade the immune system , infect the liver and red blood cells , and finally develop into a form that is able to infect a mosquito again when it bites an infected person . Inside the mosquito , the parasite matures until it reaches the sexual stage where it can again infect a human host when the mosquito takes her next blood meal , 10 to 14 or more days later . <p> Malaria symptoms appear about 9 to 14 days after the infectious mosquito bite , although this varies with different plasmodium species . Typically , malaria produces fever , headache , vomiting and other flu-like symptoms . If drugs are not available for treatment or the parasites are resistant to them , the infection can progress rapidly to become life-threatening . Malaria can kill by infecting and destroying red blood cells ( anaemia ) and by clogging the capillaries that carry blood to the brain ( cerebral malaria ) or other vital organs . <p> Malaria , together with HIV/AIDS and TB , is one of the major public health challenges undermining development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasites are developing unacceptable levels of resistance to one drug after another and many insecticides are no longer useful against mosquitoes transmitting the disease .

Every Mule Day you will find numerous warm and friendly occasions , most of which have very tenuous links to mules !

As a result , the mule has the sure-footedness and endurance of a donkey combined with the strength and vigor of a horse . Mules are a little slower than horses , but can do more work over the course of a day than a horse ( horses can pull heavier loads , but do n't have the endurance of a mule ) . A mule is also more sure-footed than a horse , allowing it do work better over rough ground , such as plowed ground . Mules are also able to endure the heat better than horses , less prone to disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mule 's surefooted trait gained from its donkey father makes it better suited to plowing as a mule is less likely to step on crops than a horse .

Mules though do not reach full maturity until they are five years old . <p> Mules were used in agriculture to pull plows and other instruments and to pull freight wagons . Before gasoline- and diesel-powered engines , mules were the tractors of their day . A farmer could plow about 16 acres of land each day using a team of mules . <p> Most mules were sold at auction and the price varied according to the size of the mule . Average-size mules -- 15-to-17 hands , or 60-to-68 inches from the hooves to the withers , which is a ridge between the shoulder blades of the mule -- went from anywhere from about $85 to $100 each .

On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the Festival of Sukkot , seven days for the L-RD. -Leviticus 23:34 <p> The Festival of Sukkot begins on Tishri 15 , the fifth day after Yom Kippur . It is quite a drastic transition , from one of the most solemn holidays in our year to one of the most joyous . Sukkot is so unreservedly joyful that it is commonly referred to in Jewish prayer and literature as Z'man Simchateinu , the Season of our Rejoicing . <p> Sukkot is the last of the Shalosh R'galim ( three pilgrimage festivals ) . Like Passover and Shavu'ot , Sukkot has a dual significance : historical and agricultural . Historically , Sukkot commemorates the forty-year period during which the children of Israel were wandering in the desert , living in temporary shelters . Agriculturally , Sukkot is a harvest festival and is sometimes referred to as Chag Ha-Asif , the Festival of Ingathering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and refers to the temporary dwellings that we are commanded to live in during this holiday in memory of the period of wandering . The Hebrew pronunciation of Sukkot is " Sue COAT , " but is often pronounced as in Yiddish , to rhyme with " BOOK us . " The name of the holiday is frequently translated " Feast of Tabernacles , " which , like many translations of Jewish terms , is n't very useful . This translation is particularly misleading , because the word " tabernacle " in the Bible refers to the portable Sanctuary in the desert , a precursor to the Temple , called in Hebrew " mishkan . " The Hebrew word " sukkah " ( plural : " sukkot " ) refers to the temporary booths that people lived in , not to the Tabernacle . <p> Sukkot lasts for seven days . The two days following the festival , Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah , are separate holidays but are related to Sukkot and are commonly thought of as part of Sukkot . <p> The festival of Sukkot is instituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the first and second days of the holiday . ( See Extra Day of Holidays for an explanation of why the Bible says one day but we observe two ) . Work is permitted on the remaining days . These intermediate days on which work is permitted are referred to as Chol Ha-Mo'ed , as are the intermediate days of Passover . <p> . <p> why did n't jewish have a Thanksgiving Day ? <p> Sukkot was the original Thanksgiving . Jews celebrate TWO Thanksgivings -- the Jewish Thanksgiving and the American Thanksgiving . The Pilgrims were extremely religious and had lived among the Jews of Holland learning Hebrew and much about Jewish holidays . When landing in America , they used Sukkot as a guide for the American holiday . <p> Many Americans , upon seeing a decorated sukkah for the first time , remark on how much the sukkah ( and the holiday generally ) reminds them of Thanksgiving . This may not be entirely coincidental : I was taught that our American pilgrims , who originated the Thanksgiving holiday , borrowed the idea from Sukkot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to find a way to express their thanks for their survival and for the harvest , they looked to the Bible for an appropriate way of celebrating and found Sukkot . This is not the standard story taught in public schools today ( that a Thanksgiving holiday is an English custom that the Pilgrims brought over ) , but the Sukkot explanation of Thanksgiving fits better with the meticulous research of Mayflower historian Caleb Johnson , who believes that the original Thanksgiving was a harvest festival ( as is Sukkot ) , that it was observed in October ( as Sukkot usually is ) , and that Pilgrims would not have celebrated a holiday that was not in the Bible ( but Sukkot is in the Bible ) . Although Mr. Johnson claims that the first Thanksgiving was " not a religious holiday or observance , " he apparently means this in a Christian sense , because he goes on to say that the first Thanksgiving was instead " a harvest festival that included feasts , sporting events , and other activities , " concepts very much in keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beliefs of the Pilgrims and Debunking a Popular Internet Lesson Plan . <p> . <p> Jewish people - What is a succah and why do you build one for Sukkot ? Thanks ? <p> Following on the heels of the High Holidays is Sukkot , a seven-day festival ( 8 days in the Diaspora ) characterized by the outdoor Sukkah-huts that we sit in , and the " Four Species " of plants waved together each day . <p> Sukkot is a holiday of immense joy , where we express our complete trust in G-d , and celebrate our confidence in having received a " good judgment " for the coming year . <p> Throughout the week of Sukkot , we eat , sleep and socialize in a Sukkah , reminding us that : <p> * The Israelites lived in huts during the 40 years of wandering in the desert . <p> * G-d is our ultimate protection -- just as He protected the Israelites in the desert with the Clouds of Glory ( Exodus 13:21 ) . <p> The Four Species <p> On Sukkot , we are commanded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty : <p> * Esrog " the citron , a fragrant fruit with a thick , white rind . It is often picked from the tree while green , and then ripens to a bright yellow . <p> * Lulav " the palm branch , which is defined in beauty by having a straight shape and leaves tightly bound . <p> * Hadas " the myrtle branch , which has a beautiful plated pattern of three leaves coming out from the same point in the branch . <p> * Arava " the willow branch , which should have oblong leaves with a smooth edge . <p> We bind all the branches together -- two willows on the left , one palm branch in the center , and three myrtles on the right . We then lift them together with the Esrog and shake it in all directions , as a symbol of G-d 's mastery over all Creation . <p> The Four Species are waved each day ( except for Shabbat ) in the synagogue , during the recitation of the Hallel prayers of praise . Hallel is followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bima . <p> It is a special tradition to " beautify " this mitzvah by getting the nicest species available . At the very least , there are specific requirements to be valid for the mitzvah . Since the details are many and technical , it is not recommended to search through the forest on your own for these species ! ( Particularly the Esrog , which can easily be confused with a lemon . ) <p> The Sukkah Hut <p> Building your own Sukkah is a great activity to share with your family and friends . The Sukkah must be at least 27 inches by 27 inches square . It can be built in a yard , apartment balcony , or even on the back of an elephant . <p> Your Sukkah needs at least two complete walls and a small part of a third wall . The walls can be of any material , as long as they are sturdy enough to withstand a normal wind . The walls should be at least 38 inches high ( 96 cm ) , but not higher than 30 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build walls especially for the Sukkah ; you can use the side of a building , or even a hedge of bushes . And if you can find an area that is already enclosed by 2 or 3 walls , then your job will be that much easier ! <p> The roof material ( S'chach ) must be made from material that grows from the ground -- i.e. branches or leaves ( but not metal ) . If you 're using unfinished boards , they can not be wider than 15 inches . Also , the material must be presently detached from the ground . This means that nothing can be overhanging your Sukkah " not a tree , a gutter , air-conditioning unit , etc . <p> The roof must be sufficiently covered so that it gives more shade than sun during the daytime , yet it should be sufficiently open so that the stars are visible through the roof at night . The roof material can only be added after the requisite number of walls are in place . <p> Since the Sukkah is designated as your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is customary to decorate it nicely . Many people hang fruits and flowers from the ceiling , and tape posters of Jerusalem and other Jewish themes on the walls . <p> It is also traditional to " welcome " the seven shepherds of Israel ( Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , Moshe , Aaron , Joseph and David ) as guests ( ushpizin ) into one 's Sukkah throughout the festival . <p> More Sukkot Traditions <p> It is a special mitzvah to rejoice on Sukkot . To this end , the intermediate days of Sukkot are marked by celebrations called Simchat Beit HaSho'eva , commemorating the water libations that were offered during Sukkot in the Holy Temple . <p> Sukkot is closely connected to " water , " as it is the day of universal judgment with regard to the blessings of rain and irrigation for the coming year . <p> Sukkot is also a time of universal blessing for all peoples -- symbolized by the 70 additional offerings brought in the Temple , corresponding to the 70 nations of the world . <p> The Book of Ecclesiastes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sukkot . The theme of Ecclesiastes is the folly of pursuing temporal pleasures of this world , as opposed to more eternal spiritual pursuits . Indeed , the Sukkah 's flimsy construction reminds us that material possessions are transient . <p> The seventh day of Sukkot is called Hoshana Rabba , which features seven circuits around the bima , with the Four Species in hand .

Also , December is summertime in South Africa . <p> Those who can afford to go on summer holiday , usually leave around this time , as Reconciliation Day adds one extra day to their holidays .

Otherwise it may be necessary to go through and match every single transaction in both sets of records since the last reconciliation , and see what transactions remain unmatched . The necessary adjustments should then be made in the cash book , or any timing differences recorded to assist with future reconciliations . <p> For this reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is good practice to carry out such reconciliations at reasonably frequent intervals . Reconciliations are generally performed by specialised accounting software though the understanding of what occurs is important for a successful reconciliation . Also , Bank reconciliation statement is a statement prepared on a particular day to reconcile the bank balance as per Cash book or Bank statement showing entries causing difference between the two balances . <p> Why do n't we have a National Reconciliation Day for the races of America ? <p> we do n't even get the day off for the election ... and they wonder why some people do n't vote ... I think we should start by making election day a national holiday .

Look it up , do n't just believe everything the Rushes of the world tell you . <p> " Problems that originated in the credit markets and first showed up in the area of subprime mortgages have spread throughout our financial system , " said President Bush last Friday , like he was talking about dry rot . <p> Just where did the moisture seep in , wetting the timbers and spreading fungus to all the beams and struts ? <p> " The United States is fortunate in that our homeownership rate is at an all-time high , " announced Dubya himself in June 2003 , " and low interest rates continue to encourage millions of Americans to become first-time homeowners . " <p> But this record-high homeownership rate just was n't high enough " and so that month marked not only the ( first ) final victory in the War of Terror . It also saw the Bush administration declare June 2003 to be National Home Ownership Month . <p> George W.Bush has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from National Safe Boating Week to World Freedom Day ... National Poison Prevention Week and Great Outdoors Month to National **37;255;TOOLONG Awareness Month , all coinciding in November 2005 . <p> The month of June has in fact been National Home Ownership Month in the United States every year since 2002 . You 'll note that word , " national " " as in nationalism and nationalized . Capitalist America 's march of progress since the Depression " back when the typical home-loan matured inside 10 years , on a loan-to-value ratio of 50% , and with a balloon payment due at the end " can be measured in the range , variety and free availability of its mortgage products . <p> Meaning it 's taken something of a step back recently . Perhaps the state really does need to help out . <p> " By a significant margin , " the Decider went on in June 2003 , " minority families are less likely to own their own homes ... " And so " the goal , " as Bush had explained 12 months earlier to the Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody who wants to own a home has got a shot at doing so . " <p> Hence the term " subprime " " meaning mortgages lent to people who , without the US state on hand to help them buy what the home-lenders would not otherwise fund , could n't previously raise a loan . Maybe that was an issue of race , opportunity , education . Some 40 million Americans remain " unbanked " today on some estimates . Lacking the very simplest financial service " a place to receive their pay check " they also represent a key market for check cashers , pawn brokers , and local loan sharks . Bush made it a political point either way . <p> For here was a problem , a social problem . And what 's the point of government if not to fix social problems ? <p> " The problem is ... three-quarters of Anglos own their homes , and yet less than 50% of African Americans and Hispanics own homes , " Bush reported . " That ownership gap signals that something might be wrong in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . " <p> During that same June 2002 speech , Dubya also promised he would " make sure America is secure from a group of killers , people who hate " you know what they hate ? They hate the idea that somebody can go buy a home ... " <p> Housing , therefore , was not merely any old social issue ; it was the very biggest of issues the United States could ever address . Here , inside the four walls which a record 68% of American families got to call " home " , the War on Terror collided with race , immigration , liberty , inclusion , opportunity and the American Dream . <p> Maybe again it was just coincidence that the Federal Reserve was then on its way to slashing interest rates to a five-decade low , delivering the first negative real interest rates ( after inflation in the cost of living ) since the super-soaraway ' 70s . Either way , Bush wanted " the entire housing industry to help at least 5.5 million minority families become homeowners by the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the three barriers to increased home-ownership " barriers now rebuilt and raised : <p> High Down Payments " " probably the greatest single barrier to first-time homeownership , " as Bush noted . " People take a look at the down payment , they say that 's too high , I 'm not buying ... " <p> Hence the American Dream Downpayment Initiative ( ADDI ) , signed into law in Dec. 2003 . It authorized some $800 million in home-buyer assistance between 2004 and 2007 " small beer compared with bailing out the No-Money-Down madness it accompanied , with homebuilders and their finance divisions literally giving away homes on 100% credit and more , only to get the keys posted back as the debtors began fleeing in summer last year . <p> And lacking hindsight , along with the sense they were born with , why ever not ? <p> " Innovations in the mortgage market have lessened down-payment requirements , " concluded a study for the St.Louis Fed in early 2007 . And so it was n't just minority groups who got to " buy " homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the decade to 2005 , this same Fed study found , the home-ownership rate amongst US citizens aged 35 and below rose from 37% to 43% . Unsurprisingly , " loans with minimal down-payment requirements tended to be the contract of choice , " because if you 've got little or no money , buying a home with little or no money down sure beats the alternative when house prices " as if by magic " are rising ten , twenty or even 30% per year , as they did between 2000 and 2006 in New York , Miami , L.A. , San Diego , San Francisco and inside the Beltway . <p> " The long-run importance of new mortgage products , " the Fed research says , " ranges from 56% to 70% " of the change in US home-ownership rates . So nor was it only younger home buyers upping their game . Home-ownership rates also rose sharply across all age groups and income bands . Because moving in for free makes moving in a whole lot more attractive , even to die-hard rental tenants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing , or trying to cap the price of privately-built homes ( both applied here in the United Kingdom since 2003 , but with little impact on our own record home-ownership rates ) , " the best way to deal with that problem , " said Bush , " is to set up a single family affordable housing tax credit to the tune of $2.4 billion . " <p> In other words , over-priced housing needed more people to get more money so they could start buying more houses . Home prices in the most densely-populated US cities promptly doubled between 2002 and mid-2006 . Yet falling prices then undid Bush 's aims even faster than the boom , despite the Hope Now initiative claiming to stall more than two million foreclosures over the last 14 months . <p> Already by the start of 2008 , the US homeownership rate had sunk back to 2001 levels . Here in autumn ' 08 , the Census Department says that almost 3% of owner-occupied units are vacant , almost twice the historical average . RGE Monitor reckons some four or five million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Average home prices across the top 20 metropolitan areas have meantime fallen by one-fifth from their 2006 peak . And yet sales of both new and existing homes are running one-third below their peak rate of 2005-06 . <p> The Fine Print " " The third problem , " said Bush , " is the fact that the rules are too complex . <p> " People get discouraged by the fine print on the contracts . They take a look and say , well , I 'm not so sure I want to sign this . There 's too many words . ( Laughter . ) There 's too many pitfalls ... " <p> No , really " that 's just how it played when George W. Bush launched his first National Home Ownership Month in June 2002 . He blamed the small print lurking at the bottom of home-loan and sale contracts " all those boring warnings about interest-rate risk , late payments , foreclosure orders , repossession , buyer beware and so on " for locking minority and first-generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Either way , Bush got his people " to simplify the closing documents and all the documents that have to deal with homeownership . " Why ? Because back in 2002 , " it was essential that we make it easier for people to buy a home , not harder . " <p> Whereas today ? Would-be home buyers and anyone facing foreclosure might wish the government would try to make things harder , not easier . <p> Given its record , that might actually help . <p> Adrian Ash <p> Just wanted to share with you all .... ? <p> thank you for loving animals I wish more people did .

Easter ( Old English ' ; ; Greek Paskha , the latter two derived from Pesa+ ) is a Christian festival and holiday celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ on the third day after his crucifixion at Calvary as described in the New Testament . <p> Easter ( Old English ' ; ; Greek Paskha , the latter two derived from Pesa+ ) is a Christian festival and holiday celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ on the third day after his crucifixion at Calvary as described in the New Testament . <p> The Eastern Time Zone ( ET ) is a time zone encompassing 17 U.S. states in the eastern part of the contiguous United States , parts of eastern Canada and three countries in South America . <p> Easter time is perhaps the most crucial event within the Christian religious calendar ( alongside Christmas ) , and remembers the dying and resurrection of Jesus . Contemporarily ( and non-religiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swapping of Easter eggs . <p> On Easter Sunday , Christians celebrate the resurrection of the Lord , Jesus Christ . It is typically the most well-attended Sunday service of the year for Christian churches . <p> Christians believe according to Scripture , that Jesus came back to life , or was raised from the dead , three days after his death on the cross . As part of the Easter season , the death of Jesus Christ by crucifixion , is commemorated on Good Friday , always the Friday just before Easter . Through his death , burial and resurrection , Jesus paid the penalty for sin , thus purchasing for all who believe in him , eternal life in Christ Jesus . <p> There are several variations of the story of the origins of the Easter Rabbit or the Easter Bunny , or perhaps more correctly , the Easter Hare . The hare was was associated with the Pagan celebration of the goddess Eostre , from whom the word Easter is derived . Eostre was associated with fertility , so was connected to both hares and eggs as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon and therefore may have indirectly become associated with Easter since the date of Easter is determined by the phases of the moon ( the first Sunday after the first full moon after the spring Equinox , March 21 ) . An article from the About.com 's Paganism / Wicca site gives more details of the Pagan origins of both the Easter Bunny and Easter eggs . <p> The appearance of a rabbit as a creature that lays brightly colored eggs as gifts for children is documented in Germany in the 1500s , where kids eagerly awaited the arrival of the Oschter Haws . The tradition seems to have been brought to America in the 1700s by settlers , where the Easter Bunny became firmly established as a popular symbol of Easter . Germans are also credited with creating the first edible rabbits ( pastry-based ) in the 1800s . <p> Despite claims being made that Easter Eggs were originally pagan symbols , there is no solid evidence for this . It was not until the 18th Century that Jakob Grimm theorised a putative pagan connection to Easter Eggs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suggested German version of Eostre . <p> At the Passover Seder , a hard-boiled egg dipped in salt water symbolizes both new life and the Passover sacrifice offered at the Temple in Jerusalem . The ancient Persians painted eggs for Nowrooz , their New Year celebration falling on the Spring Equinox . This tradition has continued every year on Nowrooz since ancient times . <p> In Christian times , the egg was a symbol of new life just as a chick might hatch from the egg . The Easter egg tradition may have celebrated the end of the privations of Lent . In the Medieval Europe , eggs were forbidden during Lent as well as other traditional fast days . During the strict Lenten fast of forty days no eggs were eaten . It was traditional to use up all of the household 's eggs before Lent began , which established the tradition of Pancake Day . This was because , in Christian times , the egg was a symbol of new life just as a chick might hatch from the egg . Eggs were viewed as symbols of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that for this reason many ancient cultures , including the Ancient Egyptians , Persians , and Romans , used eggs during their spring festivals . In Eastern Christianity , both meat and dairy are still prohibited during the fast , and eggs are seen as " dairy " ( a foodstuff that could be taken from an animal without shedding its blood ) . That is the reason why eggs laid during that time were often boiled or otherwise preserved . <p> It was during Easter that the consumption of eggs resumed after the strict Lenten fast . Eggs were thus a mainstay of Easter meals , and a prized Easter gift for children and servants . And this is probably the reason why eggs came to be associated with Easter . <p> Many traditions and practices have formed around Easter eggs . In Europe an egg was hung on New Year trees , on Maypoles , and on St. John 's trees in midsummer . Indeed , all were of one accord in using the egg as a symbol of the regenerative forces of nature . Later during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Good Friday , if kept for a hundred years , would have their yolks turn to diamond . If Good Friday eggs were cooked on Easter they would promote the fertility of the trees and crops and protect against sudden deaths . And , if you would find two yolks in an Easter egg , be sure , you 're going to be rich soon . That 's what they believed ! <p> An Orthodox tradition related with Easter celebrations is the presenting of red colored eggs to friends while giving Easter greetings . According to a History channel documentary about Mary Magdalene and her role in Christianity , the custom derives from a biblical event . After the Ascension of Christ , Mary supposedly went to the Emperor of Rome and greeted him with " Christ is risen " , whereupon he stated , " Christ has not risen no more than that egg is red " ( pointing to an egg on his table ) . After making this statement it is said th <p> Where did Easter start ? <p> EASTER NOT FOUND IN THE BIBLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Anglo-Saxon Eastre or Estera , a Teutonic goddess to whom sacrifice was offered in April , so the name was transferred to the Pashal Feast . The word does not properly occur in Scripture although the AV ( King James Translation ) has it in ACTS 12:4 where it stands for ' Passover ' as it is rightly rendered in RV ( Revised Version ) . There is no trace of Easter celebration in the New Testament ... " ( INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BIBLE ENCYCLOPEDIA VOL.2 , P.889 ) . The word ' Easter ' has confused some but the word in the original form is " Pascha " meaning " Passover " . It occurs 29 times in the New Testament &amp; everytime it 's translated Passover except in Acts 12:4 . If you read carefully ( ACTS 12:1-4 ) ; it says that Herod killed James and was trying to kill Peter in an effort to " vex the church " ( Please the Jews ) . Then in VERSE 3 " were the days of unleavened bread " ; see LEV.23 . He put him in prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Now if Herod was trying to " please the Jews " &amp; " vex the church " Why would he have delayed the trial until after ' Easter ? ' " If this was a " christian holy day " , especially one in honoring Christ 's resurrection , he would surely not be pleasing the Jews , Would n't it be more pleasing to the Jews to vex the church by killing one of it 's Apostles on it 's own " holy-day , " would it not ? <p> ORIGIN OF EASTER : WHERE DID IT COME FROM ? <p> Easter was never observed by the Apostles of Christ or Christ 's Religion . " The name ' Easter ' comes to us from the mythlogical writings of the Ancient Teucrians ( who lived 1200BC along the southern coast of Palestine ) where it 's known as ' Ostern ' " BY GROVER STEVENS . " The name ' Easter ' is merely the slightly changed English spelling of the name of the ancient Assyrian and Babylonian idol goddess , Ishtar ( pronounced eesh-tar ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-historic name of a pagan spring festival . " THE OXFORD DICTIONARY OF ENGLISH ETYMOLOGY says , " Easter is derived from the name of goddess whose feast was celebrated at the vernal equinox . " THE SCHOLARY NEW SCHAFF-HERZOG RELIGIOUS ENCYCLOPEDIA says , " This goddess is also widely known as Astarte ... The cult originated in Babylonia and spread to Assyria , Mesopotamia , Syria &amp; Palestine , then through the Phoenicians to all of the Meditteranean peoples ... Ishtar was in fact primarily and chiefly identified as Venus , the most beautiful of celestial objects &amp; from the terrestrial side , the primarily motive of the worship of Ishtar was the impulse to deify sensuous and sensuality . " ALEXANDER HISLOP SAYS IN THE TWO BABYLONS ( P.103 ) , " Easter bears its Chaldean origin on its forehead . Easter is nothing else than Asarte , one of the titles of Beltis , the queen of heaven ... " <p> The Easter Bunny and eggs deal with fertility of the goddess Ishtar . " Eggs , the obvious symbols of fertility and reproduction , were used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magickal symbols and then cast into fires or buried in the earth as offerings to the Goddess . In certain parts of the world , Spring Equinox eggs were painted yellow or gold ( sacred solar colors ) and used in rituals to honor the Sun God . Easter , like every other Christian religious holiday is rich with an abundance of Pagan overtones , customs and traditions such as Easter eggs and Easter bunny .

The initial reputation for this very day was the Worldwide Day 's Disabled Persons . The day 's roots go as far back to 1981 and also the Worldwide Year of Disabled Persons , that was produced to enhance the lives of disabled people all over the world , in addition to prevent disabilities from occurring to begin with.Your Day can be used for holding discussions , forums and campaigns relevant to disability , and towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may vary from hosting a musical to some play , and disabled people should engage in these productions .

World Soil Day World Soil Day <p> I 've tried a lot of different combinations for potting soil in years past -- from store-bought to elaborate homemade mixtures that took hours and a motorized shredder/grinder to mix . Buying dirt in a plastic bag just is n't my thing and the noise of the shredder was hardly a pleasant experience ( besides which we sold it ) . I decided I was making this project far too complicated and too hard , so I looked around for another solution . <p> Well that solution was easy and right near at hand . The compost pile . <p> We have two garbage cans in our greenhouse which are filled each fall with compost trucked from the compost pile in the garden via wheelbarrow . And that 's it . In the early spring I sift the compost through a 1/2 " hardware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen for fine soil for planting seeds . Sometimes I 'll mix in some sharp sand if I have it . When it comes time to transplant I might sift the compost through the 1/2 " screen for the flats , or I might just take it straight and pick out the larger lumps , depending on the quality of the compost and what I 'm feeling that day . For larger flats and pots I use the compost straight . <p> The plants and I are quite happy with the results . I spray the seedling flats with a strong chamomile tea and that takes care of any damping off problems . Chamomile is easy to grow ( I just let it self sow in the garden then let a few plants grow here and there ) . When I 'm done harvesting blossoms for tea for myself , I pull the whole plant and dry it for the tea for the seedlings . <p> 2004 UPDATE <p> The above little piece was written written years ago and updated in 1998 . Now it 's almost 2005 and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my main potting soil ingredient see the Compost article , but over the years I 've found it often to be too heavy for the greenhouse plants . So now I 'm back to adding a bit to the mix . Also , I 've found it easier to screen it all before storing . I have a nice homemade , wheelbarrow size 1/2 " hardware cloth sifter that makes it easy see Sifters article . As with many cooks , I have no exact recipe , but I shovel in and screen maybe a third or half wheelbarrow full of compost , then add several shovels of sharp sand , and generous dusting of wood ashes , a few shovels of old sawdust , and several generous handfuls of screened , shredded old dry leaves and well dried clippings ( run over several times with the lawnmower ) . Mix thoroughly with the shovel and store . This has worked well , though I sometimes get some white mold on the flats . This is n't the same as damping off , as it does n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I often will put the dirt in the flats and pots then water with hot water before planting ( letting the dirt cool off first , of course ! ) , which seems to eliminate the mold . <p> Now , I 've also potted up small transplants and full sized plants out of the garden to bring in the greenhouse in the fall , using plain garden soil and they have done just fine . But my experience using garden soil for indoor winter and spring potting soil has n't been good , so I do n't include regular garden soil in my mix . It tends to pack too much and I had more trouble with damping off when I used it . I 'm sure this would depend on your soil , however , so experiment . <p> One way or another , there 's no reason to BUY potting soil , particularly that packaged in non-disposable , landfill-filling plastic bags . Make your own ! If you eat , you can make compost . If you live where you ca n't have a regular outdoor compost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Healthy plants and healthy people start with healthy soil <p> If 3rd world nations werent 3rd world ? <p> Third world nations are often exploited by developed nations . <p> It has nothing to do with race , it has to do with the fact that we 're willing to do wrongs to these people outside of our borders where there are fewer civil rights laws to protect them . <p> One example ? <p> African countries . Where do you think we get our diamonds and precious jewels ? ? ? Many of them can be acquired simply by hiring the locals to mine and sift for diamonds . Diamonds cost THOUSANDS of dollars , do you know how much we pay them ? Well ... A " rich " congolese family in the diamond mining business can earn around ten dollars a month .

They mass produce products , that 's the whole chinese advantage . American companies go to China because they know they can pay the workers less than our minimum wage for a whole day of working at a factory and building petty goods . <p> Trust me , third world nations are not incompetent , they are taken advantage of . The developed nations ( not more than 30 ) use up 85% of the earths resources , leaving 15% to be shared among all other countries ( over 100 countries on earth ) . <p> No .

These other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we often fight wars over resources , but in some cases like the ones I 've mentioned it 's the hand of big big business and capitalism that has in a sense ROBBED other countries to make our lives better . <p> Would you want to pay twice the normal amount for diamonds ? Would you like to pay twice the normal amount for each gallon of gas ? Would you like to pay twice the normal amount for medicines you need to buy every month or even week ? Would you like countries like China to start advocating for their peoples civil rights and actually give them decent pay ? Because if you wanted that for Chinas people , prices like the ones you get at Walmart would NEVER exist . <p> Other people suffer for our bountiful way of life ... <p> In response to your additional details : <p> Do you think people who ca n't even afford an airplane ticket will " exploit " a developed nation ? No ... I 'm proud to be American , but I also have immigrant roots that I revisit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more altruistic than other nations . You ca n't generalize like that , some people have more to give .. Some people wish they could give but do n't have enough . Like I said , we 're not superior in any sense except for a material sense . <p> To your second additonal post : <p> No I would n't expect them to have developed before us , some people like the Native American Indians were too rooted in cultural values to try and develop advanced technologies like we did . Our success on American soil was fine , but our exploitation of other countries without governments , civil rights , or developed lands can be seen as tyranical . Again , if you do n't believe me just look at the middle east . They are ripping one another apart for oil and religion , and we exploited that situation in the war in Iraq . The war we literally JUST left was an example of how western countries have leeched off of the wealth that would have been used by others who are now impoverished . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old days ? <p> I do n't think that we can revert back to the old days . We have to be careful when we speak of the " old ways " being better . There was a lot of soil contamination in those days from people growing their own food . I think we have to have a combination of the old ways with new technology and knowledge . We should continue to strive towards a healthier food source while protecting our environment more than they did in the old days . Another point is that it is becoming more obvious that our food supply can be an easy target of terrorist groups and we should definitely pursue development of providing ourselves with a food source that is reliable and safe .... which means grow your own ! ! !

I always recommend that you educate yourself in addition to this about proper nutrition , after all , eating is something you will do the rest of your life . It is important that you understand how your body works . Each day when you wake up your metabolism rises to its highest level of the day . Metabolism is what you need to be concerned with for weight loss . As the day goes on your metabolism drops at a rate which is specific to every individual , but we can alter this metabolic drop with diet and exercise ( a secondary factor ) . In order to raise your metabolism you need to space your meals apart into 6 rather than 3 meals . The reason being is that when your body is digesting food it raises your metabolism because your body is burning energy . To keep this burning going on , you need to eat more often throughout the day , but have smaller portions and proper foods . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most important factors in weight loss . The main foods to eat are the following ; poultry ( chicken or turkey ) , eggs , fish ( all types ) , whey protein shakes , beans , potatoes &amp; yams , brown rice , oatmeal , whole grains ( breads , crackers ) , green vegetables , nuts , fruits ( bananas do the most for you ) and some dairy ( low fat yogurt , low fat cheese ) . Due to the media , we have been taught to hate all carbs , but the fact is that the media is notorious for leaving out information such as the difference between a good and bad carb . Good carbs are complex carbs ( whole grains , oatmeal , beans and brown rice ) . Bad carbs are simple sugar carbs ( candy , soda , table sugar , chips , pizza dough , and the list just goes on ) . You NEED to eat good carbs to lose weight , they are full of dietary fiber which helps your body flush out waste . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a particular food all together , you just reduce the portion size . As bodybuilders/models prepare for photo shoots they rely on diets very similar to this and just lower their portion sizes as the weeks come closer to the event . This diet is already set low so try this for at least 2 weeks before adjusting it in any way . In order to remain healthy you must get the nutrients from ALL the foods included . Here is a sample meal plan ; <p> It is also very important to drink at minimum 64 ounces of water a day . Water will help flush your digestive track , keep you hydrated , feeling full , and help remove toxins from your body . This is a great meal plan , but what does exercise have to do with weight loss . Well here is a simple reminder to always remember ; exercise = muscle toning , nutrition/diet = weight loss/weight gain . Exercise does play a very important role in our lives , but it is not the factor to weight loss . Exercise helps us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faster rate . However , you can exercise and not lose a pound due to poor diet . Many people argue that they can jump on a treadmill for an hour and lose 2-3 lbs , but you 're not actually losing fat weight , just water that comes out in the form of sweat ; this weight is then replaced when you drink water later on . I also want to debunk one more myth that not eating will lose weight , this could not be more far from the truth . The reason is that when the body is deprived of food it goes into what is known as starvation mode , this is when the body tries to use less energy ( fat ) and stores it for later on because it is not receiving enough nutrients now ( slows metabolism ) . Not eating anything or enough is just going to cause reverse effects and you may lose weight at a very slow and unhealthy rate .

To craft an ideal Haiku , you have to include some seasonality , along with a cut ' ( whether word or through punctuation ) to produce a comparison between your styles and content from the haiku . <p> Haiku originally emerged from ' Hokku ' ( Meaning ' Starting verse ' ) . But in those days ( Around the Mid-1600 's ) , Hokkus were used only with Haiki no Renga ( Prose mixed with Poetry ) . In a long narration , a Hokku ( Opening line ) was used to capture the entire feeling of the prose , but was never viewed as a separate poetry format . <p> But with time , ' Hokku ' was separated from prose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the name ' Haiku ' and declared it as independent . However , Matuso Basho ( 1644 " 1694 ) and his students promoted ' Hokku ' as an independent format long before the format was even named ' Haiku ' . <p> After this , as with most poetry formats , new possibilities emerged in Haiku writing . The two most important being - Yosa Buson endorsing Haiga ( Haiku combined with corresponding art ) and Kobayashi Issa introducing human feelings . As said before , Masaoka Shiki not only coined the term ' Haiku ' , but modernized it so as to open it to all kinds of people . <p> In the Early 19th century , Haiku began spreading in the nearby colonies ( Europe , England and America ) and by the end of 20th century , Haiku had become an important part of English poems .

@@30237298 @3937298/ <h> Tuba Day 2018 is on Wednesday , May 2 , 2018 : facts on a tuba instrument ? <p> The tuba is the largest and lowest pitched of brass instruments . Sound is produced by vibrating or " buzzing " the lips into a large cupped mouthpiece . It is one of the most recent additions to the modern symphony orchestra , first appearing in the mid-19th century , when it largely replaced the ophicleide . <p> An orchestra usually has a single tuba , though it is not uncommon for an orchestra to have three . It serves as the bass of the brass section , though its versatility means it can double as reinforcement for the strings and woodwinds , or increasingly as a solo instrument . <p> Symphonie Fantastique by Hector Berlioz was the first major work orchestrated for tuba . It was originally scored for two ophicleides , but Berlioz changed it after hearing the newly invented tuba . <p> Tubas are found in various pitches , most commonly in F , EG , CC , or BBG in " brass band " pitching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 feet long , while that of a CC tuba is 16 feet , of an EG tuba 13 feet , and of an F tuba 12 feet ( not including any valve branches ) . Tubas are considered to be conical in shape as the bore of their tubing steadily increases in diameter along its length , from the mouthpiece to the bell . <p> Bass clef music for tuba is usually in concert pitch , therefore tubists must know the correct fingerings for their specific instrument . However , traditional brass band parts for the tuba are usually written treble clef , with the B-flat tuba sounding two octaves and one step below and the E-Flat tuba sounding one octave and a major sixth below the written pitch . Consequently , the tuba is generally treated as a transposing instrument when it is written for in the treble clef , but not in the bass clef . <p> The lowest pitched tubas are the contrabass tubas , pitched in C or B-flat ; ( referred to as CC and BB-flat tubas respectively , based on a traditional distortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost exclusively used in brass bands because the other instruments are usually based on B-flat . The CC tuba is used as an orchestral instrument in the U.S. because they are perceived to tune more easily with other orchestral instruments , but BB-flat tubas are the contrabass tuba of choice in German , Austrian , and Russian orchestras . Many younger players start out with an E-flat tuba , and the BB-flat tuba is still the standard adult amateur instrument in the United States . Most professionals ( and those trained or training to be professionals ) in the U.S. play CC tubas , but most also are trained in proficiency of all four pitches of tubas . <p> The next smaller tubas are the bass tubas , pitched in F or E-flat ( a fourth above the contrabass tubas ) . The E-flat tuba often plays an octave above the contrabass tubas in brass bands , and the F tuba is commonly used by professional players as a solo instrument and , in America , to play higher parts in the classical repertoire . In most of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplemented by the CC or BB-flat only when the extra weight is desired . In the United Kingdom , the E-flat is the standard orchestral tuba . <p> Tubas are generally finished in raw brass , lacquered brass , or silver-plated brass . Some believe that the external finish of the tuba can play an important role in the tone production , though this has never been objectively measured . Performers have individual preferences on the finish that they select , and will sometimes have horns in more than one finish for different musical settings . Although tone quality is subjective and there is no scientific basis for these claims , tuba players generally agree that silver-plated brass affords a brighter tone , while raw brass produces a richer tone for lower notes . <p> National Musical Days ? <p> Honey , I do n't even know if there is a national harmonium day . <p> Can a Bass Clarinet play Tuba music ? <p> Advanced and professional bass clarinetists read tuba and bassoon parts at sight all the time . It 's simply a required skill at that level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that common at the high school level . Tuba is written in concert pitch in bass clef , bass clarinet is written in Bb in treble clef . As long as you can read C bass clef and immediately transpose it to Bb treble clef ( and the fingerings of the bass clarinet ) then you 're good to go . Another " but " though - bass clarinets are n't so great for marching with . Proper playing position ( straight in front of you , not slung like a sax ) makes marching with one a real pain in the knees . There are better choices . <p> For a lighter version instrument for a tuba player you might consider either the EEb tuba or euphonium . Euphonium would be the easier switch but EEb tuba is the most similar sound to BBb tuba and sousaphone . Euphonium ( bass clef ) uses the same fingerings and reads in bass clef as does the BBb tuba . EEb tuba reads the same part as the BBb tuba but has different fingerings .

Almost everything is closed at night so you have to scramble to get things done during day hours like shopping , banking and taking care of business .

I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 chapters are : " The Mayflower and Before " , " Becoing American " , " By the Dawn 's Early Light : Forging a National Identity " , " We 're in the Money : The Age of Invention " , " What 's Cooking ? : Eating in America " , " The Pursuit of Pleasure : Sport and Play " , " American English Today " , " Democratizing Luxury : Shopping in America " , " Sex and Other Distractions " . <p> The second book , also by Bill Bryson , is " The Lost Continent : Travels in Small-Town America " , His opening line is , " I come from Des Moines . Somebody had to . " And this sets the tone for the book . It is humorous and very revealing of the people in small-town America across the country , as he travels throughout the country . <p> A third book , " The Audacity of Hope : Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream " , by Barak Obama . Again , a very different view . As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a candidate for the office of president of the United States . <p> People who only see American movies and do n't look further , have a distorted view of the American way-of-life .

You can easily forget , though , precisely how important she 's towards the well creatures of ourselves and our fellow school buddies . What can we all do whenever we injure ourselves or feel unwell in school with no school nurse and her fortunate sick notes ? To remind her that people do n't take her efforts as a given , there 's a unique day annually where we are able to celebrate her in fashion : School Nurse Day !

Here 's to individuals diligent nurses , and also to the great health they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , hard work , determination , and dedication ... just make sure you are prepared ... especially in AP1 , AP2 , Microbiology .. but it sounds like you are determined now so I 'm pretty sure you will do great .. but all I 'm gon na say is do n't get discouraged when things get too hard . Just make that a reason to work harder ... oh and a great website to join for all things nursing is ALLNURSES.COM .. its a community of nurses and nursing students from all around the world .. they can help you with anything and I mean anything nursing .. and that 's before and after nursing school .. please do n't hesitate to join ... Good luck in nursing school : ) <p> What do school nurses do all day ? <p> When I was a kid i used to always claim I was sick to go hang out with the nurse and talk . ( She was probably the coolest nurse in the universe ) And one time I asked her that same question . They do some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in and the reasons , etc . Then they also have to keep track of everyones medicines , and doctors notes in some cases . Usually they are kept pretty busy if it is a decent size school and do n't have very much actual down time . Even when they are not " doing anything " they are there to keep an eye on the people resting there . Basically a school nurse is just like a nurse in a hospital , and do n't have very much down time . But when they do it is spent chatting it up with students who like to get out of classes by feigning illness . <p> Could I go through nursing clinicals while pregnant ? <p> I graduated nursing school a year ago . Two of my classmates were pregnant as we ended the 2-year program . One went into early labor ( at 7-+ months ) just prior to the end of the semester . She missed only TWO days of clinical , the last test , and the final exam , and she was not allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick days earlier in the semester ) . This was in June . She was not forced to repeat the entire semester when school started back up in September ; however , she did have to make up the two clinical days , and take the test and the final when they were given in December , after being away from the school environment for 6 months . It was difficult for her , but she did pass . She now regrets not graduating and going through the pinning ceremony with the group she 'd been with for two years . <p> #1 , you ca n't ever depend on a pregnancy being textbook normal . You might have terrible morning sickness that would slow you down while getting ready for class or clinicals . You could have spotting , or be confined to bedrest for several weeks . Or , like my friend , you could deliver early . There are worse possibilities that could keep you out of the program even longer , such as a miscarriage . <p> #2 , Nursing school is a rigorous program and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all times . If you do n't , you might not pass . <p> #3 , another option would be to take a leave from the program for a semester or two , if your school allows it . This way , you do n't have to worry about doing both at once , OR losing your place in the program . <p> #4 , you are 21 . Although there is never a " right " time to have a baby , you have at least 15-20 years to start a family . <p> #5 , if your eventual intent is to go to medical school , I do n't recommend getting a BSN and MSN first . It is very time-consuming and expensive . If you want to be a nurse , be a nurse ! If you want to be a doctor , finish up the program you 're in , and go to medical school . Do n't waste time ( and take other people 's slots ) going though nursing programs for ten years , and finally end up in medical school What 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> #6 , as a pregnant mother , you are going to put your baby first , of course . So whether you 're in nursing school , medical school , or some other school , you 're not going to want to expose yourself to anything hazardous . This could be chemicals , infectious disease , or patients in isolation . It could also be mental health patients who can turn violent without warning ; it could also be a clinical rotation in the emergency room , where someone in pain is flailing around uncontrollably , and you just happen to be in the way . Healthcare professionals have the potention for exposure and/or injury every day . If you are already a nurse when you get pregnant ( lots and lots of women are ) , you can shoose a position in a less-dangerous area ( say , newborn nursery or patient admitting ) . But when you are a student , you can not pick and choose your areas of clinical rotation . <p> All that being said , good luck to you from a nurse , mother , and former nursing school student .

On the plus side if your not adept at spotting Lions in the bush the large congregation of cars is a dead give away that something big has been spotted .

If you do decide to visit this Game Reserve I 'd recommend you start your search for Lions and Cheetahs in the Southern part of the park at a place called the Sontuli Loop ( Buy a Map when you get there - it 's R30 ) , most ( about 70% ) of the Lion and Cheetah sightings I 've seen in this game Park has been in this area .

" But it was not until the 1960s that the debate intensified , and became a subject of considerable controversy culminating in the Great Flag Debate of 1964 . The principal political proponent of the change was Prime Minister Lester Pearson . Pearson had been a significant broker during the Suez Crisis of 1956 ( for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . ) Pearson was disturbed when the Egyptian government objected to Canadian peacekeeping forces on the grounds that the Canadian flag ( the Red Ensign ) contained the flag ( Union Jack ) of the United Kingdom , one of the belligerents . According to Mike : The Memoirs of the Right Honourable Lester B. Pearson , Pearson 's principal concern was for the Canadian flag to be distinctive and unmistakably Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of the opposition and former prime minister , John Diefenbaker , who eventually made the subject a personal crusade . " <p> " Pearson was leader on a minority Government and risked losing power over the issue ; however , Pearson knew the Red Ensign with the Union Jack was unpopular in Quebec , a Liberal base of support . The Red Ensign was strongly favoured by rural English Canada , the heart of Tory support . On May 27 , 1964 , Pearson 's minority Liberal government introduced a motion to parliament for adoption of his personal favourite design of a " sea to sea " ( Canada 's motto ) flag with blue borders and three conjoined red maple leaves on a white field . This motion led to weeks of acrimonious debate in parliament , and the design came to be known as the Pearson Pennant . Diefenbaker demanded a referendum be held on the flag issue , but Pearson instead formed a 15 member multi-party parliamentary committee to select a new design . Through a period of study with some political manoeuvring , the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F.G . Stanley , inspired by the flag of the Royal Military College of Canada , in Kingston , Ontario . The ultimately favoured design with red bars and a single maple leaf was voted unanimously by the committee on 1964-10-29 . The new flag was passed by a majority vote in the House of Commons on 1964-12-15 . The Senate added its approval two days later . " <p> " Flag of Canada : History " : <p> " Pearson sought to produce a flag which embodied history and tradition , but he also thought that time had come for Canada to cut the umbilical cord of the banner of the United Kingdom . So the issue was n't whether the maple leaf was pre-eminently Canadian , but whether the nation was pre-eminently Canadian . " <p> " John Diefenbaker led the opposition to the Maple Leaf flag arguing for the retention of the Canadian Red Ensign . Diefenbaker and his traditionalist lieutenants mounted a filibuster . The seemingly endless debate raged in Parliament and the press with no side giving quarter . Pearson forced members of Parliament to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then on September 10 , the Prime Minister yielded to the suggestion that the matter be referred to a special flag committee . The key member of the 15-person panel , Liberal MP John Matheson recalled , " we were asked to produce a flag for Canada and in six weeks ! " " <p> " On 1964-09-10 , a committee of 15 Members of Parliament was appointed . It was made up of seven Liberals , five Conservatives and one each from the NDP , the Social Credit Party and the Ralliement Creditiste . The Conservatives at first saw this event as a victory , for they knew that all previous flag committees had suffered miscarriages .

For some of us , it is best to avoid getting together with our families at all . For others , you ca n't imagine not getting together with your family , because although dysfunctional , they are your family and it is the holidays . So , to keep your sanity , here are a few encouraging reminders to get you through . <p> Do n't take the bait . Dysfunctional families are made of master manipulators who throw bait out like they were at a national fishing derby . They throw it out via snide comments , criticisms , and even rude questions . Sometimes the bait comes at you offhandedly , sometimes it 's blatant . However it comes , do n't take it . You might have to bite your tongue until it bleeds , but refrain from answering . Remain silent . A fight ca n't take place if there is no fuel to feed it . <p> The same goes for when the family is attacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it might be to talk about the person currently being trashed , it 's wisest not to . Somehow , the things you said about that person will be told to them , while the things that everyone else said will be conveniently left out . Spare yourself the pain of blame later , and just do n't enter the conversation . Besides , the sad truth of the matter is , you 'll be the next victim they dissect as soon as you walk away . Be above that way of relating . <p> This next pointer has been especially hard in my own life : Do n't own everyone else 's misery and dysfunction . If you are the sensitive sort , like I am , you can take the blame , somehow , for everyone 's miserable behavior " and they 'll be more than happy to let you do that . It 's called scapegoating . The thing is , they are the ones to blame . Their choices and their negative outlook on life is why they are the way they are . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then determine that you are going to be different than them and actually lead a happy , healthy life . <p> Along the same lines , do n't let their moods determine yours . That 's another hard one for me , or I should say , it used to be . I could be in the best mood and then I could get together with my family ( or other people for that matter ) and their negativity quickly became my negativity . It 's like I almost felt guilty for being happy when they were so unhappy and as if I owed it to them to be miserable like them . <p> I got tired of that kind of up and down life eventually , however , and now , if those around me are seeped in negativism , I do all I can to not let it seep into my own soul . I have enough struggles in life ; the last thing I need to do is take let other people 's emotions determine mine . <p> That being said , if you need to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are less than healthy , sometimes it 's easy to point fingers at everyone else and blame them for the state of the family . Do n't forget you 're human too , though , and chances are , you 've probably helped contribute to the state you 're all in . <p> You might have done this by your own bitterness and despair or by reacting in red hot anger as soon as a flare-up happens . On the other hand , some of us do n't contribute by being jerks . We contribute by being enablers . We sooth and coddle our unhappy family members , and in so doing , never force them to take responsibility for their own behavior . Examine your role in your family , and where it has been wrong , make adjustments and even apologies where necessary . <p> Do n't rescue people . If the family starts fighting , do n't jump in and try to make it all ok . And do n't try to defend everyone to everyone else and try to offer explanations for everyone either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of if you 're used to it . I hate conflict and will do all I can to stave it off if I see it coming . But it 's exhausting . Not to mention , while I 'm busy defending everyone , I usually get attacked in the process . If the family insists on fighting and tearing each other apart , let them . But guard yourself in the process . You guard yourself by not trying to step in and rescue all of them . Sometimes , the best thing us rescuers can do is let them all duke it out . They may even figure out how to work it out afterward , and all without your help ! <p> Leave if it gets abusive/out of control .

Addiction is possible but not the only signs . <p> The difference between social drinking and alcohol abuse is when alcohol becomes your focus . You might only want to attend social events that involve alcohol , or you ca n't enjoy yourself . Getting to the bar , or making a drink after coming home from work becomes more important than connecting with friends or family . Alcohol might be your way to avoid painful feelings or troubled relationships . And you might resort to dangerous behavior , like driving while drunk or even increased violent behavior . Increased dependence on alcohol leads to alcoholism , where you are physically dependant on alcohol and have lost control of the amount you drink . <p> Alcohol abusers , or problem drinkers , are people who drink too much on a regular basis .

While some people are able to maintain this pattern for a long amount of time , alcohol abusers are at risk for progressing to alcoholism . This might happen in response to a large stressful event , such as retirement or losing a job .

Alcoholic symptoms include a physical dependence on alcohol , and inability to stop despite severe physical and psychological consequences . Some alcoholics can hold down a job or appear to be functioning on the surface , but the drinking inevitably leads to impaired job performance and troubled relationships . <p> The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism provides a screening questionnaire for assessing the differences between alcohol abuse and alcoholic dependence . Remember , though , the bottom line is how alcohol affects you . If it is affecting your relationships , job , or health , yet you ca n't seem to stop yourself , than the problem is serious .

Obstipation refers to severe constipation . Causes of constipation may be dietary , hormonal , a side effect of medications , an illness or disorder , and anatomical . Treatment is with a change in dietary and exercise habits . <p> In people without medical problems , the main intervention is the increase of fluids ( preferably water ) and dietary fiber .

Enemas can be used to provide a form of mechanical stimulation . <p> Laxatives may be necessary in people in whom dietary intervention is not effective or inappropriate . Stimulant laxatives ( e.g. senna ) are generally avoided , as they may worsen crampy sensations commonly experienced in constipation . In various conditions ( such as the use of codeine or morphine ) , combinations of hydrating ( e.g. lactulose or glycols ) , bulk-forming ( e.g. psyllium ) and stimulant agents may be necessary . Many of the products are widely available over-the-counter . <p> Enemas and clysters are a remedy occasionally used for hospitalized patients in whom the constipation has proven to be severe , dangerous in other ways , or resistant to laxatives . Sorbitol , glycerin and arachis oil suppositories can be used . Severe cases may require phosphate solutions introduced as enemas . <p> Constipation that resists all the above measures requires physical intervention . Manual disimpaction ( the physical removal of impacted stool ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoids pain and loosens the anal sphincter . <p> In alternative and traditional medicine , colonic irrigation , enemas , exercise , diet and herbs are used to treat constipation . <p> Constipation is usually easier to prevent than to treat . The relief of constipation with osmotic agents , i.e. lactulose , Polyethyleneglycol(PEG) , or magnesium salts , should immediately be followed with prevention using increased fiber ( fruits and vegetables ) and a nightly decreasing dose of osmotic laxative . With continuing narcotic use , for instance , nightly doses of osmotic agents can be given indefinitely ( without harm ) to cause a daily bowel movement . <p> MedlinePlus is a website containing health information from the world 's largest medical library , the United States National Library of Medicine .

There are no state or national requirements to be a practicing farrier in this country . All of the certifications in America are voluntary . Therefore , a local farrier can literally attend a two-week course and come home and start a business . The difference between certified and non-certified is that at some point a certified farrier has met the standards set by a particular organization and has been judged by his peers to be capable of meeting those standards . The largest and most recognized organization is the American Farriers Association ( AFA ) ; which , is the only organization recognized by the FEI . The AFA has four levels of certification and two endorsements . To learn more about the AFA , go to the website www.AmericanFarriers.org . The second largest certification program in the U.S. is the Brotherhood of Working Farriers ( BWFA ) , which has five levels of certification .

I imagine some make more than others depending on where you live , how good you are at your job , and how much you charge , but a direct quote from my farrier was " You get paid like a doctor to smell like a hobo ! " <p> I found this quote for you : " According to The State of The Farrier Industry November , 2000 published by the American Farriers Journal , Farriers spend 39.5 hours on their farrier business , working with 34.5 horses and serving 14 clients per week . In 1999 the national average annual gross pay for a farrier was $58,536 . That is a 24% increase from the year before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find better numbers I 'll edit them in . <p> Here 's another quote : " What the farrier wants to earn for a gross income ( before taxes ) : Beginning Farrier - Six weeks shoeing school , $24,000.00 a year . Journeyman Farrier with continuing education - $36,000.00 a year . Master Farrier with continuing education - $40,000.00 a year . Add a college degree of a four year BS/Equine Science , add $5000.00 a year to base salary ; a six-year degree , M/S Equine Science , add $8,000.00 per year . If the person has teaching credentials and further education , you could add $25,000.00 per year to the base salary . These figures are what the average is outside the equine industry and within the sales force that services the equine industry . " <p> And for equine dentists : " The Southern Illinois University approximated the national average annual income of an Equine Dentist at $40,000 . " <p> My horse just got shoes for the first time and balks when I ask him to collect . Could he just be adjusting ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but maybe he 's the sensitive type who over-reacts to every little change ? Why do n't you just back off his training for a couple weeks and see what happens ? Lunge him , ride him lightly on a longer rein , and just let him get used to the shoes . If he 's still acting weird after that , get the vet to look at him . It may not be a bad shoeing job , but your horse may have something weird about him that requires an adjustment to his shoeing.

In her journal circa 1928 Rand quoted the statement , " What is good for me is right , " a credo attributed to a prominent figure of the day , William Edward Hickman . Her response was enthusiastic . " The best and strongest expression of a real man 's psychology I have heard , " she exulted . ( Quoted in Ryan , citing Journals of Ayn Rand , pp. 21-22 . ) <p> She described him as , " A wonderful , free , light consciousness " born of the utter absence of any understanding of " the necessity , meaning , or importance of other people .

Atlas Shrugged ? modern day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim she was brilliant at anything other than self promotion is just an example of her style - a faux romantic style that aims low but claims high .

Put differently , in response to this ever-increasing awareness of the disintegration of traditions , the sensitivity of Rousseau compelled him toward the intelligent examination of love ( amour de soi/amour-propre ) , whereas the absence of sensitivity compelled Rand toward what is essentially loveless : the life that the iron-hand granted to Rand herself , and in a perverse way , Rand overcelebrated as amor fati .

This is inimical to the interests of relativists , collectivists , existentialists , and others who do not choose " objectivity . " Objectivity is inimical to them because it requires admitting there are answers to questions . <p> She also did what philosophers do : commented on currect events using her unique epistemology and her metaphysics and ethics . She gave answers for questions . For this , she is villified . <p> She defines " altruism " as the expectation that one will sacrifice some part of himself because society expects it . She said everyone is free to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That duty was altruism . <p> She recognized all the questions that put emergencies in the forefront of the subject : " What if you saw a man drowning , and it might cost you your own life to save him ?

Doing it for one 's own benefit is taking the " social duty " out of helping the needy . People do n't like that she denies " duty .

If the need is not inimical to your interests even if it does not coincide with what you believed was your own interest , it is not duty to do it . At that point , you are under no coercion to decide , and thus you have free will to choose . You can not have " free will " under coercive rules of " duty .

As a result , the mule has the sure-footedness and endurance of a donkey combined with the strength and vigor of a horse .

Mules are also able to endure the heat better than horses , less prone to disease and can live on poorer fodder than horses . The mule 's surefooted trait gained from its donkey father makes it better suited to plowing as a mule is less likely to step on crops than a horse . Mules also show more patience under heavy weights than horses and , due their harder , less sensitive skin , can be in their harnesses longer . Mules though do not reach full maturity until they are five years old . <p> Mules were used in agriculture to pull plows and other instruments and to pull freight wagons . Before gasoline- and diesel-powered engines , mules were the tractors of their day . A farmer could plow about 16 acres of land each day using a team of mules . <p> Most mules were sold at auction and the price varied according to the size of the mule .

Large , prize mules could go for several hundred dollars . <p> In addition to purchasing mules , mule breeders offered their jacks ( male donkeys ) for breeding with a farmer 's mare . The price was $10 to $20 , with the larger jacks , and a large jack could be up to 16 hands ( 64 inches ) tall , going for higher prices ( the larger the jack , the larger the mare , the larger the produced mule and larger mules meant more work could be done ) . <p> So if you are advertising mules , you want to advertise the number of mules in a lot and their general-size ( e.g. " 16 mules for sale in a single lot , most 15-hand , but some approaching 16-hands .

This certification program is slightly different than the previous guild that I have mentioned . <p> Astrological Lodge of London-probably one of the old 's astrological guilds in the world . A spinoff from other groups of astrologers . There are education courses that they offer , as well as certification internationally . <p> Australia has a couple of different guilds . They have reached in a far more uniformed way in how astrology is taught , there is standard that must be passed before they are considered a school . Therefore , most of the schools in Australia are quite solid . However , certification programs may not always be recognized internationally . <p> AFA American Federation of astrologers . Again another well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 80s . If memory serves me correctly . <p> AFAN Association for astrologers networking-an international organization for astrologers to help astrologers . They have a very good mentor program . But they do not have certification programs . <p> These are the most common international organizations for Western astrology . Vedic astrology has her own guilds . This also applies to Chinese astrology , which to my knowledge has no guilds whatsoever . <p> As far as Yahoo ! answers , I cringe . Sometimes when I see some of the answers . I struggle when people copy and paste , as usually that indicates to me , that they did not know how to explain things in their own words . Not all who are here know astrology . So not all the answers are valid . Some are opinions . Some are just bashers and trolls . So , to learn astrology , I would not consider this , then you the best . I have seen a few people who claim to be certified , yet , to claim may have a PhD in astrology tells me they 're not certified .

The two most common symptoms of endometriosis are pain and infertility . Some women have pain before and during their periods , as well as during or after sex .

And the body 's natural anti-estrogen is progesterone . <p> Controlling the Symptoms of Endometriosis with Progesterone <p> We know that when a woman falls pregnant , often endometriosis will disappear , only to return again after pregnancy . There is some very strong correlation between the two . This suggests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced in pregnancy play an important part in controlling this disease . <p> That 's why progesterone is recommended from days 8 to 26 ( just before menstruation ) or whenever your normal menstrual cycle ends , breaking from cream briefly to refresh receptor sites . This mimics a pseudo-pregnancy state , and facilitates healing . <p> Higher than normal doses are required which appear to be well tolerated . Levels around about 6080mg/day are usually required for pain management . You know you are taking too high a dose if you begin to feel sleepy after applying cream . <p> Most women will find that they can reduce their dosage of progesterone after 7-12 months , however , attempts to go below 40mg/day progesterone often allows symptoms to creep back in . <p> Keep in mind that a delayed diagnosis of endometriosis after numerous years of medication and synthetic hormone cocktails often leads to liver dysfunction , adrenal exhaustion , and chronic pain / fatigue which can compromise the uptake of progesterone . <p> No one is suggesting progesterone cures endometriosis but we certainly know , based on empirical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in controlling its distressing symptoms . We know that women who stopped progesterone felt great for a few months and then suddenly , after progesterone stores had washed from the body , the disease would flare back up . <p> Most women with endometriosis remain on progesterone cream for maintenance and pain control , and adjust their dose when necessary , increasing when indicated such as in times of stress . <p> Catherine Rollins <p> If you need more info ... please e-mail or visit .... <p> **43;402;TOOLONG <p> Michelle Jones <p> endometriosis ? <p> In endometriosis the tissue that lines the uterus is found on the outside of the uterusNormally , the endometrium is shed each month during the menstrual cycle ; however , in endometriosis , the misplaced endometrium is usually unable to exit the body .

All I can say is that if you do n't find that reason to be there , you will fail . It takes a lot of discipline to be in the military . <p> You need to find an MOS that interests you . There are so many jobs in the guard , from human resources to medical to satellite programming . I would look for something that has a real world equivalent . <p> For instance , you might go in as a medic ( health care specialist ) and with the EMT license you earn there , start working on ambulances when you get home . You can then use the GI Bill to get paid to go to school , working on a nursing certificate . You finish that in three years , and boom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sure mom and dad would n't have a problem with that . That 's only one example of how the guard can help you get your life together . <p> Go to www.goarmy.com and look at the career tools to help you match your personal interests to an MOS ( job ) that you might like . <p> A basic day : When you are in training you will first attend Basic Combat Training . See more of that here : <p> It 's a lot of waking up early , exercising , and military BS . But it will get you out of a civilian mindset and into a soldiers mindset . Try to absorb and believe the soldier 's creed . Try to understand that when you say " I serve the people of the United States of America " what a noble calling that is . <p> After BCT , you will go to AIT to learn your MOS . That can be anywhere from 5 weeks to a year , depending on what MOS you choose . Look at it as free job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in BCT , but it still is n't really army life . <p> Once you 're out , you 'll have to settle into a one weekend per month , two weeks per year lifestyle of drill . It is n't hard , except in a scheduling way . Things will tend to fall on your drill weekends . You 'll have to get used to saying " no " to offers to do stuff because you 'll have your military duties . <p> If you 're smart , you 'll be going to school on the GI Bill , to further the career you chose in the Guard . Learning business if you 're in Human Resources , Nursing if you 're a medic , etc . <p> Workouts : Run 2 - 3 miles three days a week . You can start out run / walking if you need to . Shoot for 2 miles in under 18 minutes . Another three days a week , do three sets each of push ups and sit ups . Shoot for 20 push ups in a row on your toes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's army standard . Basic will be a lot easier if you can do all that when you first arrive . <p> Crossfit is another great way to get in military shape . Do that five days a week and you 'll kill Basic Traning . <p> As for being shy , do n't worry about it . When a drill sergeant gets in your face , just remember that is how they say " I love you . " It 's all a head game to get you into a soldier mindset . It is n't personal . <p> Good luck ! Remember to keep you sense of humor when you 're sucking gas in the gas chamber in BCT . Just keep saying " fuck you , Cailano , why did you talk me into this bullshit ? ? ? " 
@@30237467 @3937467/ <h> Be Kind To Humankind Week on August , 2017 : would you kill yourself to save earthhumankind ? <p> 0 . *NIX - worth investing your time learning , because your skills will still be useful in a decade . <p> 1 . Mac OS X - because it is *nix underneath the lovely user interface , and <p> 2 . Ubuntu , in a Virtual box on my Mac ( to test and run web scripts before deploying them ) and on my virtually hosted webserver <p> start of rant about Windows <p> I have successfully avoided Windows since the last millenium , after it had wasted several years of my life rebooting , re-installing and troubleshooting Windows servers and desktops . I 'm sure it has improved since then , but I have no wish to get on the Microsoft perpetual treadmill of expensive licenses , certifications , upgrades . I 'm glad to see that Bill Gates has turned philanthropist to use his ill gotten gains for the betterment of humankind , so I 've forgiven him the weekends spent in windowless ( the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands , surviving on pizza , snickers and coffee . Unix and Linux are so much more worth investing your time learning - the same skills I learned in 1990 are useful today . With Windows , you can throw away everything you learned more than 3 years ago , because it will be made intentionally obsolete to keep you spending your money on the next version , and the " professional " certification you need to get or keep a job fixing it . <p> end of rant about Windows <p> Do you get scared when ... ? <p> Dang ! ! It is that kind of male humankind that make women feel insecure. ! ! <p> Such perverted brats of doggy poo people should be kicked in the arse !
