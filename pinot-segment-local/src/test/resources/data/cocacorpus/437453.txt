Whilst I like the much more evocative title of Pre-mortem the purpose is the same ie " what might go wrong and how to prevent/ mitigate it " By the way I too like the tactility of using pencils so I did agree with the previous cast ! <p> Hey Dan really relevant for me as I have just finished Charles Duhiggs new book Smarter , Faster , Better .

It enables teams and individuals to look at all aspects of a problem , idea or solution i.e. why are we doing this ? , what will it look like ? , how do we feel about the idea/solution ? , and what can go wrong ? <p> And then you can do the post mortem what worked , what did n't  , what were the results and what actions do we need to take for next time ?

If we do something one way on Tuesday , odds are well do that same thing the same way on Wednesday . <p> Sometimes that helps us . Think about those who floss regularly and cant imagine otherwise . Other times , it can rot our brains and hollow our souls . Think about those who arrive home each night and unthinkingly switch on the TV . <p> So how do habits come to be ? And how can we change them ? <p> Charles Duhigg is a reporter for the New York Times who 's written a new ( and fascinating ) book on the subject . Its called The Power of Habit : Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business and its already climbing the bestseller lists . ( Buy it at Amazon , BN.com , or IndieBound . ) <p> One of my bad habits is interviewing authors about their books . Against his better judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . here 's a piece of our conversation : <p> 1 . All of us have a sense from our day-to-day lives of what a habit is . But you 've dissected habits into a three-part loop . Explain . And give an example . <p> In the last 15 years , as we 've learned how habits work and how they can be changed , scientists have explained that every habit is made up of a cue , a routine and a reward . The cue is a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use . Then there is the routine the behavior itself which can be physical or mental or emotional . Finally , there is a reward , which helps your brain figure out if this particular habit is worth remembering for the future . Over time , this loop " cue , routine , reward ; cue , routine , reward " becomes more automatic as the cue and reward become neurologically intertwined . <p> Take exercise . Studies have shown that people who identify simple cues and clear rewards are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to start running in the morning , for instance , research indicates you 're more likely to succeed if you choose an obvious cue ( like always putting on your sneakers before breakfast or leaving your running clothes next to your bed ) and a clear reward ( like a treat afterwards or the sense of accomplishment that comes from recording your miles in a log book ) . After a while , your brain will start anticipating that reward " craving the treat or the feeling of accomplishment " and there will be a measurable neurological impulse to exercise each day . <p> 2 . You write that a rather astonishing amount of what we do each day is unconscious and habitual rather than conscious and volitional . Should that alarm us ? Does it mean we have a lot less free will than we think ? <p> One paper published by a Duke University researcher in 2006 found that more than 40 percent of the actions people performed each day were n't the due to decision making , but were habits . In a sense , that 's alarming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were thinking less . Our neurological activity literally decreases as the habit unfolds . That 's why the behavior feels so automatic , almost unconscious . <p> But that does n't  mean that habits are destiny . Habits can be ignored , changed , or replaced . And studies show that simply understanding how habits work " learning the structure of the habit loop " makes them easier to control . Once you break a habit into its components , you can fiddle with the gears . <p> The secret , however , is to identify the cues and rewards driving particularly behaviors , and then adhere to what is known as the Golden Rule of Habit Change : only change one part of the loop at a time . To change a routine , for instance , keep the old cue and find a routine that delivers an old reward . Do n't  try to change everything at once . <p> 3 . Let 's say that Pink Blog readers have a habit eating junk food , frittering time away on email , procrastinating on big projects that theyd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Its important to understand that you cant eliminate a habit you can only change it for a better alternative . And the single most effective step is identifying the cue ( what triggers the behavior ) and the reward ( what craving it satisfies . ) For instance , I had a bad habit of eating a cookie every afternoon . To change it , I identified the cue by paying close attention to what preceded my cookie urge . Research indicates that most cues fit into one of five categories : location , time , emotional state , other people or the immediately preceding action . So whenever my cookie habit hit , I wrote down where I was , the time , how I felt , who else was around and what I had just done . Pretty soon , the cue was clear : I always felt an urge to snack around 3:30 . <p> I also needed to figure out the reward . So , I conducted a few experiments . One day , when I felt a cookie impulse , I went for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coffee . The next , an apple . I wanted to test different theories regarding what reward I was really craving . Was it hunger ? Or the desire for a quick burst of energy ? Or , as turned out to be the answer , was it that I wanted to socialize , and the cookie was just a convenient excuse ? <p> Once I figured out the cue and reward , it was fairly simple to shift the routine . Now , every day around 3:30 , I stand up , look around for someone to talk to , spend 10 minutes gossiping , then go back to my desk . The cue and reward have stayed the same . Only the routine has shifted , and I 've lost 21 pounds since then . <p> So much ( book promotion-related ) synchronicity ! I 'm reading this book because I 'm scheduled to interview Charles tomorrow and I actually caught the tail end of the NPR interview yesterday . However , I did n't  realize who was being interviewed until I read the cookie story above , because that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other thing . On the question of " volition , " I was re-reading Karl Weicks " Social Psychology of Organizing " and he referred to Gregory Batesons notion that " one of the major insane premises in Western thought is the belief we have self-control . " <p> I was thinking of this when I read that finding from Duke about the habitual nature of our behavior . While I agree that Duhigg demonstrates that our habits can in fact be changed , it is important as well to recall that , at any given moment , we are not willfully deciding what we are going to do so much as running our established routines . So , to that degree , we are not in conscious control of what we are doing almost half the time ! <p> This is really a very powerful information . I often fall into the same traps because of the unpleasant bad habits incorporated into my body . I learned that too much resistance will only cause friction and pain in the long run , that is why it is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to break it . I believe if I work on the right mechanisms and on much easier and effective ways , I know I can do better . The cue , routine and reward can be remembered and sculpted into the mind very easily . I hope I get the copy of that book , in hard copy , I hope our local bookstore will have it . C : <p> I really like the idea of breaking a habit down into its components to study what function it is filling and then systematically going about to find a healthier subsitute for meeting the underlying need . <p> The most popular recommendation currently is to distract ones self by engaging in a competing activity that keeps one from doing the undesirable behavior . In my experience , it has limited success as the underlying need driving the behavior is not met which in turn creates a stronger craving rather than reducing it .

Some people , she says , have a- fixed view of intelligence : They believe that intelligence is an entity , that were each endowed with a particular finite supply . Others have a- growth view of intelligence : They believe that intelligence can expand through practice and effort . <p> In the lecture , Dweck set out three rules that nicely summarize the differences between the two mindsets along with quotations from students that demonstrate the rules . <p> RULE #1 <p> Fixed mindset : Look clever at all costs . ( " The main thing I want when I do my school work is to show how good I am at it . " ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is much more important for me to learn things in my classes than it is to get the best grades . " ) <p> RULE #2 <p> Fixed mindset : It should come naturally . ( " To tell you the truth , when I work hard at my school work it makes me fee like I 'm not very smart . " ) <p> Growth mindset : Work hard , effort is key . ( " The harder you work at something , the better you 'll be at it . " ) <p> RULE #3 <p> Fixed mindset : Hide your mistakes and conceal your deficiencies . ( After a disappointing exam score , " I 'd spend less time on this subject from now on . I 'd try not to take this subject ever again , and I would try to cheat on the next test . " ) <p> Growth mindset : Capitalize on your mistakes and confront your deficiencies .

And be sure to check out her books either Mindset or the more academic Self-theories. <h> 21 Responses to " The 3 rules of mindsets " <p> Over the last decade , I 've slowly slipped into a fixed mindset . The Creativity World Forum ( where I enjoyed your talk ) really kicked started my mind . I 've made a conscious effort to have a growth mindset .

To this end , I have shared Gladwells observation from Outliers that mastery comes at 10,000 hours of focused practice . The culture of innate intelligence is a strong one , and the irony is that it hurts those who believe in it much more than those who do not . <p> Carol was kind enough to give me a review copy of her " Mindsets " book to summarize on my blog .

His answer : Growth mindset , most of the time ! Hope other young students are learning about Dr. Dwecks research early in their academic career ! <p> Leadership expert John Maxwell contrasts a growth mindset with a goal mindset ( somewhat fixed I guess , though not always bad ) . <p> I believe our tendency to label plays an important role in moulding our mindsets . Labeling is good for grasping new concepts and communicating them .

Great post . <p> This meshes well with the idea of innovation and creativity depending upon the ability to challenge ones assumptions . Its not just brain plasticity but the idea that being smart is something that can be cultivated and nurtured , and that it is not just onw way of thinking but that there are different ways to be smart . <p> I wonder if Dweck comletely rejects Geoffrey Millers case for the importance of what he calls General Intelligence .

@@26895293 @595293/ <p> In the book , Chip uses the grammar and lexicon of arithmetic to some deeper truths about life . ( Ex : Joy = Love Fear . ) Much like math itself , the technique is simple and elegant so much so that I wanted to introduce it to Pink Blog readers . <p> In the short interview below , I ask Chip to explain three particularly intriguing emotional equations : <p> Viktor Frankls landmark book " Mans Search for Meaning " was my salvation 3-4 years ago when I was going through a depressing time . I turned that profound book into this equation so that it could serve as a daily reminder or mantra on a bad day . Suffering is basically a constant in life . If you 're a Buddhist , that 's the first Noble Truth , but its just as relevant in a punishing recession and in many relationships . Meaning is the variable its what you make of it . The way this equation works , if you increase the meaning of something and suffering stays constant , then despair declines . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson or learning in this ? " Often , I had to think of life as sort of an emotional boot camp and that the way I created meaning from a challenging situation was to imagine what emotional muscles I was training whether its resiliency , humility , compassion , or courage that could serve me later in life . <p> Experts in Anxiety distill the ingredients down to two primary elements : what we do n't  know and what we cant control . I created an Anxiety Balance Sheet to assist with alleviating this debilitating emotion . Imagine something that 's making you feel anxious . Then , pull out a piece of paper and create four columns with the first one being " what I do know " about this issue that 's creating anxiety . The second column would be " what I do n't  know " ( these first two columns cover the " Uncertainty " part of the equation ) . The third column is " what I can influence " and the fourth is " what I ca n't influence . " Take ten minutes to list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ive found is that most people are surprised when they have more items under the " good " columns ( 1 and 3 ) than they have under the " bad " ( 2 and 4 ) . Additionally , you can look at what 's in column 2 ( what you do n't  know ) and ask how could I learn more . In fact , if you 're worried you may lose your job , the answer may be to ask your boss if your job is in jeopardy . And , I 've also seen people move items from column 4 to 3 by asking themselves , " How can I create some influence on this issue even though I 'm not feeling it right now ? " Just the act of getting logical and proactive about anxiety helps to loosen its grip on you . <p> Does that mean if we declare that we will never be powerless that is , if we reduce the Powerlessness component to zero well be anxiety-free ? <p> Provocative question . You may have heard about a social science experiment in which research subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric shock now or receiving half as painful of a shock sometime in the next 24 hours but at a time when they werent expecting it . The majority of people chose to experience the extra pain now since mental pain can be more threatening than physical pain ( note to leaders : better to deliver bad news as early as possible ) . In an updated version of this study , they gave people the ability to have a little more power over when the shock could occur I think it was within a one hour window and this led people to being more inclined to choose the pain later rather than the excessive pain now . In a multiplicative equation , if one of the two variables edges toward zero , it takes away the combustibility . So , if you tell yourself that you have huge job insecurity which is leading to uncertainty , but you are doing all kinds of prep work ( job interviews , making connections on LinkedIn , saving some money ) that give you more of a sense of power , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surprisingly , your equation for Happiness which we often think of in terms of more uses division . ( Wanting What You Have / Having What You Want ) . How does that work ? <p> I learned this one studying the Gross National Happiness index in Bhutan for a week three years ago . An alternative way of looking at this equation is Happiness = Practicing Gratitude / Pursuing Gratification . When you appreciate or want what you have , that 's a form of practicing gratitude , something that is foundational for many devotional practices like Buddhism in Bhutan . In the U.S. , we are proud of our " pursuit of happiness " and the fact that its even in our Declaration of Independence , but if you read some dictionary definitions of pursuit ( " to chase with hostility " ) , you understand the risks associated in the denominator . Many of us pursue our goals or gratifications so aggressively that we end up on the hedonic treadmill constantly chasing the next shiny object or opportunity .

It really annoys me that the world still believes the mythology about Bhutans gross national happiness . It is book cooking at its best . How can a country that boots out one sixth of its population because they are not Buddhist and leaves them to live in over crowded refugee camps for years be considered a pin up for happiness ? These refugees are now arriving in Canada , USA , Australia etc. after 15 years in the camps . Look them up and find out the whole story . <p> Would you consider going " potty " a mechanical skill ?

She then realized she would n't get anymore treats and broke down crying . <p> Thanks , Danfor the interview . Chip , I believe the best pursuit of all is to gain a little more understanding of myself on this earth and how I can be the cause of problems for others . If Im happy and grounded , the earth around me is much more peaceful . For the doubters up therewhy is n't a little simplification of these issues a breath of fresh air for you ? Its great to promote any idea that will help one individual calm his/her lifes anxieties and fears down . The ripple effect brings peace to us all ! I say , go for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( though I do believe therapy/therapeutic programs are important ) , why not allow humans to find their way through simplicity with a few tools that help them to problem-solve and feel empowered themselves ? <p> Hi Dan , I am a big fan of these kinds of simplifications as they can act as really useful rules of thumb for dealing with complex aspects of life . I have one concern with the Anxiety = Uncertainty x Powerlessness however . I think that this can be useful as a rationalization for dealing with acute anxiety , when recognising that the power/control we actually do ( or could ) have is enough to reduce our anxiety . However I think that the logical conclusion of this equation is that we require complete power/control in order to be free from anxiety . This is obviously unachievable . On the contrary , I think that having a life filled with Joy , Love , Happiness and minimal Despair and Anxiety comes from us learning to be okay with uncertainty and our inherent lack of control . <p> Wonderful ! ! Emotional responses or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart disease is the number one killer of the physical body and I say emotional heart disease is the number one killer of relationships ; personal and business . Thank you for sharing this book . <p> The danger is to be too simplistic in the meaning and confusing it with why . I do n't  think its possible to understand this equation with out being spiritual and looking for a higher meaning . If I have cancer , a doctor can technically tell me why I have it . But if I believe that my peace and attitude in the midst of my suffering with be an inspiration to others , then I now have found meaning in my suffering .

I have read all of your books and recommend others do as well ; even though you captured them in less than 15 sec.they are worth the read .. as many of us can not digest things that quickly . Thanks again <p> Im having a hard time seeing how 1% makes up a synopsis of the 100% . Distilling the big idea into just thata big ideahow is that represented by 1% ? I feel the analogy of forest through the trees is a better visual ; the forest is the book and its main ideas and the trees are those ideas a bit more close upbut the forest does n't  make up 1% ofthe forest . <p> Have read all three of those books and loved them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopwatch science . <p> Thanks for another great nugget of wisdom , Dan ! To respond to another comment above , your mini synopses of the books was intriguing -made me want to go back and read the ones I have again , AND , inspired me to buy the Selling book , which I have not yet read . <p> Dan , I appreciate your concept , but not the language of " 1 percent " which has negative connotations up the ying-yang , and is n't aspirational , meaning you may have arrived but at the detriment of all others . Moving on .. your concept of what is the central meaning or the " tah dah " is what effects and informs thoughts and actions expanding from that center . Pretty powerful to isolate that one driver . <p> This is great advice Dan . So often I hear people engaging in never-ending debates over the 99% . I attend business meetings where much of the discussion focuses on the minutia and the 1% seems to get ignored . My action from this is to make an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others get there as well . Thank you . <p> While this podcast was focused on books or difficult materials and gaining a foothold to understand them , I believe that the message also applies to broader life . <p> when meeting someone new , what 's their key ( 1% ) interest or connection point ? when calling on a new prospective customer , what 's their key ( 1% ) motivator or problem ? when determining what task to undertake next , what 's the key ( 1% ) that will propel you forward ? <p> As usual , another great ( and efficiently shared ) message . The 1% rule is useful for focusing and prioritizing , but also as a way to check that we actually fully understand ( and can synthesize ) what were communicating . Bravo and thanks for sharing !

Its important for graphic rep folks not to feed into the lazy data dumps like the rest of the world . I expect more from you <p> I tried to write a response to each but , there is some duplication and , it is all very very subjective .

But as an adult , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you at the right time .

This comes with connection , listening , caring and also surrounding myself with those who energize me . At the same time , one inevitability in life is that we will " bump into " others who are " takers " as you say , or sap energy , rather than zap you with new energy .

Our school superintendents are caught up in this same issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they my need to be both sides of the same attribute to create the right amount of disequilibrium and not too much .

Great kindling to stoke the fire of good conversation . <p> It may simplify things for us to put ourselves into these black and white bins but I 'm not sure how helpful it actually is in living a fulfilling and fulfilled life . If you are taking 100% responsbility for your own reality , and avoid rushing for the victim position that blames others for your reality , then perhaps you can open yourself up to accepting and loving the grey shades in us all including yourself . <p> We do live in a world that is shades of grey , polarization is n't always helpful , but I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could add additional catagories , does n't  make any contribution , etc . In this case I think polarizing is a good idea , get on the bus or get off the bus . <p> Very thought provoking ! Those are such great responses .

I 'd like to think I 'm the type of person who helps people discover how wonderful and talented they are . Hopefully , I encourage people to enjoy life at work a little more as well . <p> Reminds me of C.S. Lewis , the Weight of Glory .

@@26895319 @595319/ <h> 15 Responses to " How to Pitch Better : The Email Pitch " <p> I 'm sure that the book goes into a great deal more detail , but people who watch this video only should proceed with caution . <p> The video suggests that piquing peoples curiosity is a good way to get them to read your emails . The example is the Obama campaigns email , titled just " hey ! " The video acknowledges that the email came from Obama himself , but does n't  explicitly make the point that the same email heading would have been far less effective coming from almost anybody else . <p> Curiosity will only work if you have built up sufficient credibility . Without credibility , the same email will have the opposite effect . Its not that curiosity arousing emails are not very effective , its just a lot trickier to create the circumstances for them to really be effective , and not counterproductive , than the video implies . <p> I have actually found the email pitch to be one of the trickier ones to use , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have been doing some reading about headlines for writing copy , and the curiosity factor could definitely be an attraction in an email , if you practice it a bit ! Something like , " How many family members can fit in a boat ? " to organize a family reunion at the lake . Or " Which deli do you think will be bringing the snacks today ? " to call workers to a meeting . Or " Resistance is futile " when reminding union members of an upcoming meeting ( too many undertones on that one for me to go into it ! ) . <p> It probably takes longer than we are used to spending on an email heading , but as Mr. Pink points out , it could be pretty effective ! <p> I agree with David above . Ive taught business writing for years and agree that , while spammers may want to roll the dice by employing curiosity , it is not advisable for working people trying to generate a higher response rate . I 'd recommend the watchwords be relevance and specificity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action is requested ) . <p> You both make an excellent point . Curiosity is unlikely to work in the absence of credibility on the part of the sender . That 's probably why spam itself is so ineffective . <p> Also , the Carnegie Mellon research showed that when recipients had heavy email loads , utility was by far the more effective strategy . Curiosity , by contrast , was effective when people had lighter loads . So one has to factor in who 's *receiving* the email along with who 's sending it . <p> I think the success of the Obama emails hinged on the TWO most important characteristics of a successful email pitch . #1 It was from a trusted sender . #2 the subject line did not just pique curiosity , it was in " his voice " . One could actually envision Barack Obama saying , " Hey ! " Because he says it so often . If you have gained the trust of your audience , they are way more likely to open messages from you . <p> Dan , Your follow-up comment strikes a chord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same rules as designing a website for your visitors first and foremost . <p> Its easy to say but very hard to keep in mind all through the development/writing process , and yet were all recipients and visitors ourselves , each and every day ! <p> Given how time-starved and information-overloaded most folks are these days , utility and relevance are so valuable . If you can help someone ( and make it clear from the subject line that you are there to help ) that person is so much more likely to welcome you in ( i.e. open the mail ) . <p> Utility vs . Curiosity I happen to be making a video about that but I call it the more ordinary objective vs. subjective . <p> A person who is rushed needs a more objective reason to open the mail they are invoking a higher level of scrutiny . A person who is has more time ( and as such may be looking for something personally interesting ) may offer the subject line more time and come up with more reasons ( cognitive dissonance ) to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases I offer the thought to have elements of both objective/subjective in the subject ( and even add some irony if you like ) <p> " Learn how to figure out what those emails are REALLY about ! 45% success rate . " " Our two minute course will earn you an extra vacation day every year " <p> I 'm not sure I buy the murky middle argument at the endis there data to back that up ? To me , the murky middle is only bad if its neither/nor in terms of utility/curiosity , but I think there 's a both / and possibility . <p> Dan , First off , I have read the book and would suggest the same to anyone trying to better understand how to move others . I do n't  sell a product or service but have to be very influencial in my job and have found the information invaluable . <p> With respect to an effective email subject line , and maybe I 'm oversimplifying things a bit , I typically use action phrases like Action Required For Your Action Revisions Needed etc. , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader knows the information requires their immediate attention . I will at times even included deadlines ( i.e. Action Required by 7/19 ) to create a sense of urgency . On the flip side , I will also use For Your information if the message does n't  require an action or immediate attention so the receiver can prioritize their inbox more easily . I have had pretty good luck with this approach and people appreciate the fact that I 'm setting expectations . <p> Isnt the secret getting into the conversation in the prospects head ? <p> Curiosity works when you are going after the conversation the prospect is already having about your solution . And the curiosity has to be the right kind . <p> You have to promise something of value to the prospect , meaning they have to feel that their decision will be aided by what you have written . <p> Then they will open it . <p> You also have to remember there is a vast difference in audiences . Obamas messages are being sent to people who already support him thus you can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet marketing guys sends crazy messages to his list but they love it . <p> This discussion is focused around engaging someone you do n't  know that is a completely different email . <p> Utility vs . Curiosity , I found this short sound bite a useful tool that helps writers slow down and think before they hit send . It may not be a perfect formula but it 's a formula and one I have implemented in my work readiness training program . My student 's subject lines have become more targeted , thoughtful , and functional . <p> Hi Dan I 'm one of the molecular small entrepreneurs you write about in your new book ( I bought the Kindle version after it was recommended on Brain Pickings today as one of the top 13 books of 2013 ) . <p> You talk about elasticity of skills and you 're so right .

The idea is that the more we embed systems on the job , for our health , in social movements with the mechanics and grammar of games , the more effective their participants will become . <p> Alas , like any white-hot meme , its often hard to sort the heat from the light . Thank heavens , then , for For the Win , a new book by Whartons Kevin Werbach and New York Law Schools Dan Hunter . <p> For the Win ( Buy it at Amazon , BN , or IndieBound ) is a smart and accessible guide to an intriguing subject . Its grounded in research , but also includes plenty of case studies to bring the research to life . <p> Because Pink Blog readers are interested in new approaches to human motivation , I asked Kevin to answer a few questions about games , Wall Street , and presidential politics : <p> 1 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinarily valuable tool to address serious business pursuits . " Is gamification a new tool ? Does its effectiveness stem directly from the rise of video games , or does it go back farther ? <p> Companies consciously applying game thinking to their processes is new . And its happening now because of the rise of video games . Todays digital platforms also make it possible to incorporate game elements into existing activities in ways that were never possible before . However , the concepts we describe in the book are really much older : what kinds of rewards and experiences motivate people , what makes a good game , and how fun fits into business . Think about it : Cracker Jack started putting toy surprises into every box exactly a century ago . <p> 2 . Seems like anytime a system includes a game , there 's someone gaming the system . Could you talk a little about the hazards of gamification ? <p> That 's very important point . So many gamification advocates focus only on the positives . There is an entire chapter of For the Win about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One issue , as you point out , is that any time you create a game , someone will try to exploit the system . That 's not necessarily a danger , though , if you anticipate it . Those are your most engaged players , and you can often redirect their energy in a positive way , such as giving rewards for finding bugs in the game . <p> A second concern is that gamification can become a means of exploitation or manipulation . If making an activity game-like is a way to trick your customers or employees into doing something they would n't otherwise want to do , you 're probably being unethical and its likely to harm your business interests in the long run . The approach we describe in the book is very different , because its built around the players interests . <p> 3 . You write , " The similarities between the interfaces of Wall Street trading terminals , enterprise collaboration software , and massively multiplayer online games such as World of Warcraft are too striking to ignore . " For readers who may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you expand on the similarities ? <p> Good information technology organizes and filters information to provide what the military calls " situational awareness . " Think about the Wall Street trader . Huge sums of money can hang on each decision . They have access to tons of resources : current prices , databases , market trends , analyst reports , and colleagues . Seeing the right information at the right time is crucial but information overload is a constant threat . Trust me , being a raid healer in World of Warcraft feels the same way . Your group can die any time you make a wrong mouseclick . A WoW raid is a symphony of data flows : commands , notifications , performance stats , and multiple communications channels to choreograph up to 25 players . While most real-world business roles are n't  such a pressure cooker , good decisions at work always benefit from good information and good feedback . We can learn a great deal from the way game designers and game players build systems with same goals . <p> 4 . You write , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamification was used extensively in the political process . " Could you tell us more about that ? <p> The campaigns on both sides , dating back to the primaries , have used mechanisms like badges and leaderboards to motivate volunteers and get out the vote . At one level , encouraging someone to " like " a candidate on Facebook or make a phone call is n't all that different from encouraging them to endorse or buy a product . The widespread behavioral micro-targeting of potential voters also draws upon the concepts we describe in the book , such as player modeling and engagement loops . That being said , we wont know all the details until after the election . Doing gamification well is n't easy , and there many ways that selling a candidate is different than selling a soft drink . I expect well see even greater and more sophisticated use of gamification in 2016 . <p> Dr. Abraham S. Fischler has commented , " Learning should be fun .

Bravo to Mr. Pink . His books should be condensed to POSTERS and those posters could drive students to read FLIP <p> Companies consciously applying game thinking to their processes is new . <p> I 'm not sure I 'd entirely agree with this . The USSR actually consciously applied game thinking to their processes also , as a way of increasing industrial production , and using game-like motivation in lieu of monetary motivation . Not quite the same , but I think there are surprisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sample to my Kindle . I am not sure how authors decide how much to put in the sample , but sometimes it is too short to get a feel for the topic . I probably will buy anyway based on your recommendation but Kevin may want to add a " bit of the meat " to the Kindle sample . Thanks for sharing . <p> My opinion is because of the difficulty system in games . Games are usually setup as levels with each one being slightly harder then the previous one . A well designed game should be just challenging enough to where to have to just reach past your current abilities to beat the current level . That level of difficulty has been shown to motivate people to tackle the challenge . <p> Typical work environments do n't  operate like that . Its more about throwing you in the deep end of the pool on the first day and being overwhelmed . Even if you get through it you do n't  enjoy it and you want to quit . If instead you had a mindset that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous time , then its much easier to handle . <p> The problem with your suggestion is that games , in general , are much more controlled environments .

This rings true for me but I must say I miss the reckless spirit that drove me as an entrepreneur and I said Hell Yeah more often then I do now . <p> Yes ! I love this tip too , and have shared it with my readers . I 'm super grateful for the " Yeses " you 've given me , Dan ! And if you ever ask me for anything , my answer will always be " HELL YEAH DAN ! " Keep up the good work . <p> I love this idea but now am torn . Chip and Dan Heath , in their book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend the WRAP model which I have used quite successfully . Daniel Kahneman , in his book Thinking Fast and Slow , warns against letting your System 1 thinking take over when more thought is required which also makes sense to me . The Hell yeah approach seems to be based on an immediate gut reaction to a request in which System 1 thinking takes over . I imagine it will be very useful at times but like other contributors to this thread I 'm not sure its so cut and dry . <p> Good point , Michael . I like the WRAP method , too especially the W part that calls for reframing " whether " questions . On the other hand , it seems there are so many things pelting us each day that for many of them , a simple rule of thumb can help . At least it does for me . Thanks for watching . <p> Michael you took my exact thoughts and verbalized them more eloquently than I probably would have ! <p> Where I 've landed is : typically heuristics are helpful as mental shortcuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works best when efficiency of decision making is most important ( e.g. for the many relatively low-stakes decisions we have to make each day/week/month ) . <p> Where heuristics get us intro trouble is when we use these mental shortcuts when more System 2 thinking would be beneficial , and a framework like WRAP would be a better way to think through a choice . <p> Just a thoughtnow Im interested to see if I can apply this perspective and see how it plays out in real lifecheers , and thanks Dan ! <p> This is good , but I think you can miss some opportunities because they seems bland . The other thing is that it rides strictly on positive emotion instead of what is really best . As an alternative I recommend the " If I was going to die in 30 days , would I do this ? " <p> Hm . Sometimes I do n't  do a " hell YES " but its a " have to " because family , because responsibilities , because whatever . Example , do I do a " hell YES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tennis ball at the teachers head ? Hell no but I say " yes " to that meeting because family , because responsibilities , because I really do have to for something that is more important than my own immediate gut rush of excitement . So yeah . <p> I tend to agree that most decisions have many grey areas . However , this is a simple approach for those of us who have difficulty deciding . CD Baby is really only good for the owner of the website who charges the artist to host . Many musicians pay their fee every month and do not sell anything . To be fair , CD Baby should only charge when a song is purchased . Its like getting your merchandise for free . This is why it is so hard to make it as an artist . My two cents ! <p> With all the nonsense stuff coming across our ( respective ) desks these days , we need the " hell yes " as a simple and effective decision aid . My cautionary note would be that gut reactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a George Mead sense . Additionally , the fight or flight " limbic " reaction can affect how we weight decisions . For example , getting an invite to a co-workers farewell party when your personal experience with this individual may be unfavorable but office politics dictate attending . <p> Hi Dan , my natural reaction is to say no to opportunities . I have been trying to change this reflex as it has undoubtedly cost me many valuable experiences . In my own case , " Hell yeah " probably sets the bar too high . I recently read or heard a different approach ( I 'm afraid I cant recall where ) which works better for me , which is " what would you advise a friend to do ? " . <p> Love it ! I have so much stuff coming into my inbox because I 've signed up to learn about publishing and marketing myself on-line . It ends up taking up more time than I spend writing !

@@26895337 @595337/ <h> Education <h> Does giving teachers bonuses improve student performance ? <p> One of the hottest ideas in education policy these days is tying teacher pay to student performance on standardized tests . The theory is that offering up cash bonuses will prompt unmotivated and unaccountable teachers to get their acts together and do better by our kids . <p> Now an even bigger study is out from- Roland Fryer , a prominent Harvard economist and an architect of some of these programs . In- an impressive paper published last week , he examines the effects of pay-for-performance in the New York City public schools . Here , from the papers abstract ( and with italics added ) , are his key findings : <p> " Financial incentives for teachers to increase student performance is an increasingly popular education policy around the world . This paper describes a school-based randomized trial in over two-hundred New York City public schools designed to better understand the impact of teacher incentives on student achievement . I find no evidence that teacher incentives increase student performance , attendance , or graduation , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or teacher behavior . If anything , teacher incentives may decrease student achievement , especially in larger schools . " <p> I 'm all for experimenting with new solutions . But it should be clear from these results not to mention , from 50 years of research on human motivation and performance that improving American education will take bolder and less convenient solutions that dangling a few carrots in front of our teachers . ( You can read Fryers full paper here . ) <p> Good one ! I 'm not surprised . Perhaps another way of looking at this is that no amount of money is enough to make people care if they care enough to do a good job , its for reasons other than their compensation . We observe this with nurses as well as teachers some really care about their patients/students , others not so much . Which ones do the patients/students respond to ? Those who care . <p> Bonus/merit pay may change teacher motivation , but the concern should be changing student motivation ; away from grades and towards intrinsic rewards and you will create an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are creating . <p> As an educator in an " strategic compensation " school district , I would have to say that there could be an argument both ways here . Since the inception of merit pay at our unique school district , we have seen increases in overall achievement and have been effectively closing the achievement gap . The graduation rates in our high schools have increased to a point well above state average . That being said it is hard to say whether this is an effect of the merit pay or of the increased amount and quality of professional development here in Eagle County Schools . The teachers in our district are superb and work very hard as a matter of pride . <p> Thanks for this , Dan . There ARE educational models out there that work . I encourage people to look at the school in Seattle I co-founded in 1994 , Puget Sound Community School ( http : //www.pscs.org ) , that Dan mentioned in " Drive . " One of our administrators posts daily to a blog in order to further consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As a former teacher , I would have to agree that tying student performance to teachers pay will not make marked improvements . Our issues with education in America do not have any " one " root problem . Money just seems to be the easiest answer we Americans throw at problems . = <p> Its interesting . Folks pull out the old college example to defend school choice , charters , etc. , but our highly successful college system does not operate on teacher merit pay . College professors are not given bonuses if their students pass standardized tests or not . Let 's pick an argument and follow it through consistently . The reason this does n't  happen is that there are no successful systems of any kind which , over time , consistently flourish based on merit pay . This just might be because it does n't  work . It is an over-convenient solution to a deeply complex systemic set of issues . <p> Attempting to explain an increase in student achievement to teacher incentives is kind of like saying that wet streets cause rain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scheduling time for them to meet as a grade group to compare and discuss their class data will encourage teachers to formulate a plan and motivate each other far more than a bonus . <p> I think what can work are the elements of purpose , ensuring kids understand the bigger purpose in getting an education . We 've used the tips from Drive with our 5 year old twins and the change in motivation and behavior has been remarkable . <p> My biggest problem with this concept is that tying bonuses directly to performance in standarized tests might shift teachers focus to teaching students how to take tests and not necessarily provide them with the skills they really need . <p> You could turn the question around and say " Do teachers who improve student performance deserve bonuses ? " I am pretty sure that most people will say yes . <p> Of course , part of that also means that we have to define what we mean by student performance . I do n't  believe that a standardized test will show the whole picture , and it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than teach for life long knowledge . <p> Simply put , we need more comprehensive KPIs for teacher performance . And when they perform well , money is not the only possible reward . <p> A learning revolution . That is what we need . The entire system from day 1 through being certified to teach is shot through and through with external motivation . If Daniel is right , this extinguishes intrinsic drives such a curiosity and generosity over time . One example : <p> I work with an organization that develops large scale mentoring programs for Global companies with thousands of employees . Thousands of mentors voluteer in these organizations . <p> In edcuational circles , mentors are a few certified experts who expect to be paid for mentoring . This approach is not scalable to meet the learning needs of practicing teachers . We have not been able to convince the educational establishment that teachers would volunteer to help each other in a similar fashion to the hundreds of thousands of busy corporate executives and managers we work with . Perhaps generosity is on the rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circles ? <p> Reading the paper now , it does n't  sound like it was about individual incentives- or about the performance of the individual teachers , and the whole basis for it was pretty flawed . <p> " Each participating school could earn $3,000 for every UFT-represented sta ! member , which the school could distribute at its own discretion , if the school met the annual performance target set by the DOE based on school report card scores . " <p> " Each school had the power to decide whether all of the rewards would be given to a small subset of teachers with the highest value-added , whether the winners of the rewards would be decided by lottery , and virtually anything in-between . " <p> " To our surprise , an overwhelming majority of the schools decided on a group incentive scheme that varied the individual bonus amount only by the position held in the school . " <p> It sort of boggles the mind that they wasted the opportunity to do a good study of individual incentives and performance here . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting DOE goals . Of course , these goals are n't  value added , so the goal they were trying to meet was ridiculous in the first place . <p> I taught for 18 years in East Los Angeles . My colleagues were the most dedicated group of people you could find anywhere . Many of us were hired during Operation Talent Search . Though we taught in elementary school , we were honor students in tough subject matter fields such as history , English , mathematics , music , and art . My father was a teacher . My mother-in-law was a teacher . My husband was a teacher . The implication that we were " bad " in some way because we taught in schools that served challenging populations is hurtful . Our transiency rate was very high . Many students entered our classrooms after the semester started and left before it ended . Some who took state tests had been in our classrooms only a few days or weeks . As time went on , there was less and less instructional consistency across the district , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disastrous . It was fed by a policy that had nothing to do with education . It took a number of months to evict a family for nonpayment of rent . They would move into a rental , stay for that number of months , and then move to the next , taking 4+ students with them from school to school . Support and remedial services could not keep up . This was just one problem . Any urban teacher could tell you many more . <p> Learning is less about the teachers and more about the students . If education policy is really going to be effective , its going to need to take into account that students hold the power in their learning . I 'm not sure how , but somewhere along the way , someone decided it was the teachers responsibility and now most policy is focused on pressuring the teacher to teach better as if that is possible . <p> A really good example of student-driven learning is a school in Russia that 's run completely by students . They run the administrative tasks , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ) , they cook the food , and they teach each other . The school originated on the idea of Mikhail Petrovich Shchetinin . If you look up his name , you 're sure to find more information about the school . <p> I was a teacher in public schools for 24 years . I quickly discovered that there are many things that teachers can not control . One issue that very few people mention is that many children enter school with numerous problems that include learning disabilities , low intelligence , behavior problems , a lack of student motivation and parent indifference and from experience I know that all of these issues can inhibit academic progress . The conventional " wisdom " has been to blame teachers when , in fact , many of the problems can not be solved by teacher intervention alone . Teacher blaming is an easy way out . It is not about money but about responsibility and accountability for all involved children , parents , schools and community . <p> Thanks for these links Daniel unfortunately , no surprises . The direction of current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia ) is towards rather simpleminded standardised testing as a way of assessing educational effectiveness . A fascinating book on this subject is by Diane Ravitch , describing her road to Damascus moment : The Death and Life of the Great American School System : How Testing and Choice are Undermining Education . I cant recommend this book too highly . I review it here : LONG ... <p> Extrinsic motivators , by nature , rarely work . Its no surprise that the teachers receiving bonuses did n't  score any better than their counterparts . <p> I think bonuses , across the board , are relatively the same . Performance based financial incentives only slightly move the dial , if at all . Some professions are more respondant to extrinsic motivators , and that is largely due to their social make up and personality type . Sales folks for example , may perform slightly better with a bonus plan in place . When that plan is removed , and base salary adjusted , I am going to guess that performance remains about the same . <p> I am a fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals , and the goals are hard measurements not approximations , and that the goals are based on the individuals performance . I 've had performance plans based on other peoples efforts and all it did was create animocity and illwill . <p> In the case of a test score pay-for-performance plans , I 'm not sure that the behavioral and cultural make up of teachers matches that of a bonus-based program . Teachers go into their career to help and nurture ( at least they should ) , not because they expect to become filty rich . Their successes are defined by the childrens successes , and that is n't always based on answers A , B , C , or D on a 400 question exam . Teachers are ones that pride themselves on helping others an intrinsic motivator . <p> The question then becomes , how can the system better reward teachers with intrinsic motivators . Having teacher of the year awards is a great idea that has happened for decades . It is often based on popularity and longevity in most school systems at least that has been my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big enough parts in determining who " teacher of the year " should be or even " Teacher of the month " . Let 's get back to the PTA and involving all parties parents , teachers , administrators , and students . When the 4 groups get together and help each other out , and support each other , the real teaching begins to evolve in classrooms , and the students end up winners . <p> Let 's teach our children that answering " B " for question #173 is n't the real world . Let 's instead teach our children that collective opinions , the feedback loop , and conversations are what makes the real world tick . Then , education will have evolved . <p> As a former veteran teacher and now an education consultant , I work in high poverty school systems and am in and out of lots of classrooms and observe lots of teachers in action . The vast majority of teachers are competent , fewer are excellent , and , definitely , there are some that are quite weak . But the notion that pay incentives will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at other professions . If you paid a doctor or dentist more money would they work harder or smarter to heal you ? I 'd like to think not . Would a public defender work harder for a client for an extra bonus ? I think that most people work up to the levels of what their abilities , knowledge and skills allow . <p> There were flaws with the incentive approach : One was the previously mentioned lack of individual incentive . A second was the size of the offer . I 'm not so sure the amount was a sufficient motivation . It might have represented only about 4-5% of a teachers salary . If carrot motivation is really possible , is that a large enough carrot to have a teacher dramatically alter her behavior ? <p> But I do n't  believe that is the issue . <p> The real flaw of this picture is trying to measure teacher efficacy by one standardized test . There are simply too many other variables at play : learner motivation ( other interests like art or baseball ) learners ability to persist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school parental support for education language barriers access to professional development for teacher ( new ideas and ways of improving teaching practice ) support from administrators and colleagues <p> A bit of extra money ( taxed , comes to about $43 a week , give or take ) cant overcome the obstacles of the above listeasily . <p> The current political environment around education is looking for simplistic answers to complex issues . This one clearly failed . Too bad it cost so much money ( I read it was about $75 million ! ) , which could have provided a lot more support than it bought . <p> The part that is of most interest to me is tying everything to test scores . Testing tied to student scores incentivizes teachers to teach to the test , and memorization rather than critical thinking moves to the top of the priority list . That simply does n't  work ! <p> My objection to the wave of support that incentive-based pay plans have been collecting is due to the underlying logic of these plans , as I see it . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in higher student achievement because teachers will be motivated to work harder toward this result . This perspective then must be based on the assumption that teachers are not already working as hard as they can to produce the highest student achievement possible . <p> From my perspective , this must be the underlying assumption ; otherwise there would be no purpose for the incentive to motivate teachers to work harder , to do a better job . This assumption is the basis for my objection to these plans . The teachers that I know are literally already working as hard as they can through as many hours as they can . Of course , things can always be improved as they continue learning new methods and growing in skills . However , most definitely any factor standing in the way of higher achievement for their students is not the level of work , effort , motivation , or care that they are already bringing to their work . <p> Notice the last statement does not say there is nothing that teachers or schools could do differently to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with possibly the most powerful of these found outside the school building ) that would have to be addressed in order to create wide-spread improved student achievement . <p> From my view , it is just an insult to teachers to imply that students would be doing better if teachers would just work harderthat the only thing keeping American students from achieving more is their teachers who are ineffective and should be working harder ; and teachers could be motivated to go ahead and work harder just by enticing them with a bonus of a couple thousand dollars . <p> I am not saying that there are no teachers who are less than stellar or less effective than they should be ; of course there must be some , as there would be in any profession or industry . However , when speaking generally of the profession across the country , I believe these individuals are fewer and farther between than the national discourse would have us believe over the past few years . <p> Just because we keep hearing the sound-bite through the media that our schools are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not actually make this so . However , as it gets repeated over and over again it becomes believed and accepted . Then after wearing the public down into this way of thinking , it starts to see incentive-pay as a possible solution for motivating our ineffective or lazy teachers ( as proclaimed ) into working harder and doing a better job for the students . <p> Seriously , does the country really believe this ? Each person should simply think about their own personal experience . As each of us walks into the individual schools that our children attend , have you encountered a building full of ineffective , lazy teachers who do n't  care intensely about the students achievement ? I have to believe that if the situation as described in public discourse was the reality that most Americans are experiencing in their communities and their own schools , a unified public outcry ( not an outcry of politicians , public figures , or " experts " ) would have already been experienced . <p> I reflected on autonomy-mastery-purpose as applied to my teaching job during your Waterloo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception of not being able to choose my own colleagues ( and being ruled by the clock , obviously ) I 'm very autonomous within my class .

Ed law , in fact , be the beginning of the answer to the US meta-cognitive educational deficit , but that 's another story . <p> Apart from the obvious , performance pay is a bad idea , because good teaching is very difficult to quantify , or to set a criteria to . The masses will want to see improved grades , or higher pass rates . Both are exceedingly easy to manipulate and will keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best teachers will continue to quietly toil with the less clean , less academically inclined students with less hope . <p> Making good students better is really really easy . Even money-motivated information disseminating teaching units can do it , and with a sound-bite-friendly criteria as a basis for performance pay , theyll be rolling in dough . Now consider the teacher who improves a students grade from 5 to 45 , and his attendance from 40 absences to fewer than 20 . This student now has a hope of contributing to society , instead of taking from it , and his change in academic achievement is incredible . His teacher will not be collecting any rewards , however . Nor will she bother pleading her case . Shell be too busy working with the next of the hopeless cases . And the next . <p> I do n't  know what the answer is exactly , but what it certainly is not , is dissuading great teachers from shoring up the frightfully low achievers , by introducing merit pay . <p> As a teacher in Australia for the past five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not become teachers for the money or holidays . If they do , they usually leave the occupation within the first year . It is because they have a passion for helping , nurturing and fostering the development of young people . Therefore , the motivation is in the occupation itself and the rewards teachers find rewarding enough are their own personal breakthroughs with the individual students . These breakthroughs and progress are based on each students personal situation and their ability to learn and show an understanding of that learning in their own way . Standardised testing does not deliver accurate results for the individual and is not a true indication of their ability or progress . <p> To motivate teachers , freedom and flexibility to exercise their craft in their own way is required . This will empower the teacher to take control of themselves and allow them to instil their passion of teaching and educating their pupils . This in turn will have a direct correlation to the students performance . <p> Watch this brilliant and informative RSA Animate clip about what really motivates us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful completion of staff development and Outstanding Teacher . While it did n't  motivate me to be an outstanding teacher , it sure felt like a giant " thank you " for all my hard work . However , the money for staff development did help it paid for the class and gave me gas money . It was n't much but it motivated me to take the classes which in turn , made me a better teacher . <p> I 'm concerned that teachers are always evaluated on student test scores . We need a more well-rounded look at student performance . Growth from beginning to end of year would be much better than comparing one class of students to another class . <p> I do n't  think we should nix the idea of pay for performance entirely . Just rethink it . <p> I 'm not surprised by those findings at all . To the first commenter , its not as simple as getting teachers to " care .

It gets worse everyday ! I would rather evaluate teachers on their ability to challenge a child to create or solve a real world problem or evaluate them on their creativity in lesson designthan to watch them robot around . I would bet if you offered up a little autonomy .. it would go a LONG way . Freedom is what we humans like ! <p> I worked at a school that actually did this and unfortunately it led to some teachers doing some pretty illegal things with the tests . Some teachers went back and erased and filled in bubbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the directions they give their students and would read a reading test to them and other teachers had given answers to their students while the students were taking the test . <p> What may sound like a good idea sometimes in actuality is n't . Why should a 3rd grade teacher get an incentive when all of the teachers in Kindergarten , 1st , and 2nd grade are actually part of the childs performance . It is crazy . <p> I worry that no one will want to teach the lower achieving or special needs children . <p> Also , if teachers are competing for a limited amount of funds , they will not be so eager to share their ideas that really work . Newer less experienced teachers will be saddled with the most difficult to teach or reach students . <p> Finally , it seems unfair to diminish a teachers ability to earn the bonus because students simply do n't  show up to class . Student attendance is a driving force in their ability to achieve , and if they do n't  show up , its difficult to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He can develop a strategy to attract talent . Let 's say he wants to blow 20% of his cap on a three time golden apple winner and then leverage that golden apple winner as a player/coach in his school ? So be itthen he could fill in his roster with young up-and-coming ( less expensive ) teachers <p> This goes right along with the NY Times call this week to raise the status of teachers in society . Who thinks teachers go into the profession for the money ? ! ( Though the low pay does prevent people from becoming teachers in the first place . ) Actually acknowledging that many teachers have mastery of this domain and turning to them to come up with and implement solutions to fix our schools would be far more effective than bonuses . Instead they get burned out trying to implement the latest " silver bullet " they know wo n't work when it comes down the pike . Or good teachers get burned out defending themselves to administrators and parents who do not recognize that perhaps they may know what they are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the media seems to loose site of the fact there are really amazing teachers out there . <p> The blogger forgot to mention there is literature showing positive results for this kind of policy in other countries . Indeed , Fryer writes in his introduction : <p> " The paper concludes with a ( necessarily ) speculative discussion about what can explain the stark results , especially when one compares them with the growing evidence from developing countries . " <p> He references three such articles ( two of which show good results and the third with only short-term results ) . <p> So the discussion should be why bonus pay does n't  work IN THE USA , not why it does n't  work period . As a Brazilian engaged in the issue , I do n't  feel compelled at all to discard the idea , nor do I think you ( north americans ) should before more thorough discussion . I 'm waiting for some professors here do similar studies with local programs . <p> Maybe we are trying to motivate the wrong corner of the educational triangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students education consists of three components : the student , the parents , and the teacher . Focusing accountability just on the teacher , assumes that the other two areas are holding up their part of the equation . But are they ? In some cases , yesbut not to extent I think we would like to see . Do n't  get me wrongthere are things we need to change in education . But I think focusing only on one area that needs to change is n't going to solve the overall problem . We need to take a magnifying glass to our society and parents need to take a good hard look at their role in all of this as well . Yes , I do have school age children so I am one of those patents who need to assess my role in my childs education and what I can do to help my child succeed . <p> I 'm really enjoying this discussion . Thank you Daniel ( et al ! ) I cant help thinking that , without knowing how to easily measure good teachers , ( assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallible measure ) then , how can we reward good teaching fairly ? It simply may not be possible . <p> Matt Nelson suggests a salary cap , which I think may not work because of the inequities in leadershippopular principals will attract popular teachers . Sorry : popular does n't  necessarily equal pedagogically sound , nor does it come with a willingness to wade into the educational fray with the yucky kids , unfortunately . <p> Scott mentions increasing pay . I completely agree . Again , as a Canadian , I think were paid really well , and encouraged to educate ourselves through a variety of incentive programs ( as an earlier post alluded to ) . When money is no longer an issue , the best cognitive work gets done . Scott may not have been able to resist his entrepreneurial spirit entirely , but it sounds like hed have remained in the classroom much longer at least . <p> As a teacher , what would motivate me would be if parents , administrators and students treated me with respect and dignity . I am paid well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " teacher , but over time , became disappointed with the way that teachers are treated at all levels . <p> Treating me as a human being would make all the difference towards my attitude . <p> Anyone who has read Dans book could have predicted this outcome . I have taught for nearly 10 years , and while more money would help my family from living from paycheck to paycheck , I did n't  get into education to make money , but to make a difference . I have a drawer in my desk at school filled with thoughtful notes and cards from teenagersthose are my bonuses . <p> Eleven or so years ago when I was in graduate school getting my teacher certification , I had to go and observe classes in my area ( art ) at an elementary school . To help the teacher out , I would work with some of the more boisterous kids . In one class I made a deal with a student that if he was doing his work , and behaving , I would sit at his table with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made with the most disruptive student was that as long as he was n't disrupting the class I would stay away . <p> Sometimes to motivate students , you really need to spend time with them . For me , a bonus would be great , but what I would love even more is an administration that takes its teachers word more seriously than its students ; more time to prepare ; and fewer students in a class . Those things would help me do a better job more than money ( although with the money only , perhaps I could dress better ) . <p> I have to agree . What will history say about a society of adults who lived in fear of their children ? We must consider what they have to say , and accomodate their needs , but that does not mean that we let their expectations and demands dictate policy ; for they speak from a lack of experience and still developing critical thinking skills . <p> After43 years in education , I have not met one teacher who was motivated to do a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good teachers need to be rewarded for jobs well done as those in other professions are . They hold the future of many young people in their hands . <p> Vanderbilt Universitys National Center on Performance Incentives conducted a scientifically rigorous examination of the impact of merit pay for teacher on student achievement . The principal result being that , given the limited scope of the effects and apparent lack of persistence , performance incentives did not lead overall to large , lasting changes in student achievement as measured by the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program . <p> How about hiring motivated , creative , teachers ? What is really sad is what happens to the underfinanced schools where the students have little parental involvement so they under-perform at school . Teachers do n't  have the resources to teach them effectively . The students do n't  perform well , so the teachers are not bonused.soooo.the teachers ( motivated and creative ) look to move to a school where they will be bonused leaving those children left behind . <p> This is why I struggle to pay for private school . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going in for paying our teachers what they deserve . <p> I am against performance pay and I am a teacher . I have seen performance pay lead my colleagues to do unscrupulous things just so they can " get their bonus " , as one colleague put it . Not once in the conversation that she and I had , did she state that she wanted to see them do well . Her motivations were for her own financial gain . The way I see it , she should work in the private sector where that is expected . Ive read other postings mention about family involvement .. THAT indeed is key , as you can have the best teacher in the world , but without anyone at home to support your endeavors , you are sailing on a shipped destined to sink . <p> Even if incentive pay for teachers was n't and extremely flawed strategy , it still would n't matter . Politicians and school administrators are trying to grasping at straws to try to fix the existing system . The existing system , an obsolete remnant of early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Our schools are designed to mass produce , mildly educated , obedient factory workers , which in the 1940-1970s it did a reasonable good job of . However what we need now are technological in information craftsmen , not robots . <p> I believe we need to begin looking at education as more of an apprenticeship , where we provide the student with the basic skills necessary for them to being to follow their own path . While I am not a proponent of homeschooling , I believe that one of the reasons home schooled students tend to excel on standardized testing is for the very reason that their education has more in common with and " educational apprenticeship " than one sizes fits all , top down , micromanaged factory school curriculum . The home schooled get the basics , and then the freedom to follow there interests . <p> Teach reading , writing , compression and math and then encourage the kids to explore . <p> I would agree that a pay incentive would not increase test scores for a very obvious reason . Teachers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the best education possible , did not start teaching because of the money . They started teaching because they loved to teach and that was satisfaction enough . The only reason I could imagine that an increase in pay would help students test scores is that teachers would be able so spend more time on developing great curriculum instead of having second jobs . But if a teaching is not teaching well because the pay is too low , they should not be teaching at all . <p> Incentive pay does n't  work and isnt fair . A teacher is either already motivated or un-motivatable . Its unfair because different teachers can get different kids . I have always volunteered to get more sped kids and the ELLs . I am used to working with them and I am willing to work with their IEP teachers with them . So my classes are weighted down with the kids who do more poorly on the standardized tests . Why should I be penalized for going above and beyond ? Socioeconomic status of the school is also a HUGE factor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always the teacher . Home life/support system is the biggest factor . I teach at a school in a fairly affluent area and my scores are top notch but I also spent five years in an inner-city school with very poor scores . I 'm the same teacher , doing the same stuff , teaching the same subjects . <p> As a student about to leave the public education system and head to college , it seems to me that overall performance , not simply test scores , would absolutely improve with extra incentives offered to teachers . My mother is a teacher , and although our retirement system here ( Colorado ) pays fairly well for state workers who have been in the system for 30+ years , there is no doubt in my mind that the happiness of a teacher is directly corrolated to their salary . While many of you may say that happy teachers are not necessarily good teachers , I would beg to differ . Outside of my my household , holding conversations with my current teachers , its easy to see how teachers are simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizes , and decreased benefit options . There is simply a MAJOR feeling of indifference that floats around the staff of our school now that they are expected to have students perform better with even less resources then before . I have seen first hand that teachers who are happy are not only more respected by their own students in the classroom , but also have more motivation to be better teachers and to receive better results out of their students . Teachers pursue there career because they want to be around adolescents and make a difference in their lives , and it is of no suprise that their happiness level would increase if their success rates did go up . Simply put , extra tutoring that students might need costs money , and there are very few cases in which students who receive outside help do not improve in that certain subject . These tutors charge high rates and would n't take an extra hour out of the day because they felt good about it , its because they are getting that extra little bit of money . With public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how these teachers simply do n't  feel the need to be the absolute best they can be . Incentives help whether statistics show it or not ! <p> As a veteran teacher for 17 years I have to say that you missed part of Daniel Pinks major point . Before we can begin discussions about incentives we have to pay people " enough " . The problem with teachers at your school , and most everywhere else , is the fact that they do not receive enough pay to begin with . ( See Ann and Danas comments ) If merit pay were offered at your school many teachers would be motivated to cheat and lie for monetary gain . Plus , how do we equitably reward teachers when some are dealing with far more difficult student populations ? <p> As the daughter of two teachers , both of whom taught in the same school district for 30 and 37 years , I can assure you this system is not a one-size-fits-all solution . My father was the outspoken president of their teachers union in their poverty-stricken rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly given the " problem " students in their classrooms as punishment for fighting for their rights . How would compensation for standardized test scores be fair when the overwhelming majority of the students in one classroom were learning disabled and anything but standardized ? There would need to be some sort of assurance that equal numbers of high performing and low performing students were in each classroom . Should my parents be punished with lower compensation because they fought for ALL the teachers to receive better benefits and better wages in the first place ? <p> What many people are n't  taking into account is the role that home life plays in education . My mother has many students in single parent households or being raised by grandparents , and unfortunately has a few students every year with incarcerated parents . No matter how good of a teacher she is , these kids are n't  focused on school . <p> I do n't  think there are any teachers who went into the profession for the money , and while having more of it certainly would be nice I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . <p> This might sound like a good idea on the surface , but anyone who really knows how the school systems work would be outraged . <p> There is so much talk about improving education ( which I support ) , and lasering in on teacher performance . In at least one of our great states , overpaid and overcompensated teachers became the " root cause " of the budget problems . It strikes me that the challenges in our education systems are less about the teachers ability to teach and more about the grinding bureaucracy of an outmoded model of education and an outmoded educational outcomes . <p> Where is the evidence that says that corporate bonuses improve individual , senior executive , or business performance ? I believe that studies commonly show that extra money in the form of bonuses has little impact on performance . People want to be recognized and appreciated and listened to and to feel that they are part of an inspiring vision larger than themselves . As long as people are fairly paid and the pay makes it possible to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary in any environment ? <p> And why is the conversation about improving education focused on individual teacher performance ? <p> Well pay incentives do n't  really work in the financial world either so why would they in education ? Of course the pay scales are different so the marginal impact will be different , but he point is people are not motivated as much by money as other things . <p> I am not a teacher , but the parent of a teacher and of course a former ( still learning ) student . <p> This is a very complex problem that has been oversimplified by armchair quarterbacks . In a complex society we do not really understand the challenges of different occupations . When I was in elementary grades my parents took an interest in my progress , provided lots of reading material in the home and talked to teachers . I am sure there is a lot of that in American and Canadian homes , but from a distance it seems teachers do have extraordinary challenges , but little respect from others . Gene , in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was shown more respect . <p> No one who is the object of abuse can stay strongly motivated forever . The abuse comes from politicians saying what they say to get votes , parents too busy or preoccupied to really understand and support their kids , and a general public attitude that teaching is for those who ca n't do anything else . <p> I think a teacher can make a difference . Time spent one on one and time spent preparing is important . As a salesman one example that impressed me was of a doctor who asks lots of questions before making a diagnosis and suggesting treatment . Teachers need to ask lots of questions of their students and ideally of the parents and then apply their knowledge and creativity to helping a student learn . We all need to that and we all need to respect the uniqueness of each others challenges . <p> Most teachers are some level of motivation , but like everyone else can find their level of motivation sapped by abuse . <p> This simply verifies what many of us in education already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not use this type of system as a means to improve school quality . I am a teacher , actually , one who was asked to be on our schools Q-Comp committee to research and implement such a program this next school year . Most of our teachers are against the proposal , but only because they do not wish to be scrutinized under the regulations . <p> Really , as an educator , this is my realization : <p> We are teachers , most of us in areas where the amount of jobs are low , and the applicants come in by the hundreds . We have reduced funding , added responsibilities , next to nothing in terms of support , and increasing demands . Many teachers are overworked . ( I can say this as a mother , who is a full time teacher , and is on 7 different committees at my school . ) As we reduce the number of staff in our buildings , we increase the amount of responsibilities on each remaining staff member . ( Yes , do realize the corporate world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out as an item of interestin terms of what level the working class is going to be willing to shoulder as far as responsibilities , given the decrease in pay and recognition . It is the same for educators . ) As my class sizes increase , my pay decreases , my responsibilities increase , and the scrutiny of my students testing is placed under greater intensity each year . Every year , our individual class scores are put in a presentation and shown/compared/analyzed with the rest of the grade level and schools . Teachers with lower averages are asked what they need to improve on to raise scores . While this is absolutely a question which merits attention- we NEVER look at individual rates . For example , were there 3 kids who had an absentee rate of 34% for the year ? Did student A spend 1/2 the year living out of a car ? Student B has abuse issues being investigated . Certainly even the best teacher can make some gains ( or stay level ) with these situations , there are times the outside variables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not imply causation , especially when there may be an unknown factor contributing to the outcome . Teacher A having a poor class overall score does not prove poor teacher quality . ( but we all know instances in which it does ! ) <p> With these in mind , I do not doubt for an instant that several of my colleagues will cheat on these tests . Until the system is reformatted in such a way that the teachers do n't  feel the pressure , it will continue . It is the same as the CEOs with their big bonuses . When the heat is applied , different actions are taken . I could list a couple colleagues who we strongly suspect of this . It really is sad , because it is our children who suffer in the end . <p> As a researcher in the field of incentives , I find these studies interesting in that they often fail to provide a true test of " incentives " vs a test of a unique approach to the application of an incentive program . The studies assumed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers 2 ) that the plan is best designed by a committee with little expertise in incentive design ( and must fit union requirements of equal payout to all participants ) 3 ) that the value of the award was valued by the recipients 4 ) that the plan was top of mind ( promoted ) to the participants 5 ) that the time period was appropriate for this type of incentive plan . <p> Bottom line : most incentive plans that fail to produce results are the result of two issues : poor design and poor implementation . So we tend to toss the tool because the user is not proficient . <p> There are teachers who enjoy seeing their wards do well . These category require little or no type of motivation to do well or even better . <p> To those who it is not a calling , either intrinsic or extrinsic motivation can only toss them here and there in a little while.However , appreciating performing terachers in whatever way appropriate to any school manager is good . <p> Like in our spectacular Nigerian case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be encouraged highly especially to those who enjoy seeing their wards doing well and are actually working hard to achieve this . <p> Interestingly , some of Dr. Fryers earlier work suggests that , with respect to student achievement , it may be better to create an incentive structure for students rather than teachers and make the agency effect more direct . I am including a link to the " Time " article that described this interesting research . <p> While Prof. Fryer is an economist by training , and much of his work is tested and proved in many cities in the country , the lack of success in NYC proves that these approaches may be transferable but generally not generalziable ; due to factors and variables that are out of social scientists controls . Nevertheless , a thorough review of organizational theories would have shed some light on the motivation of employees in an organizational system . As an educator , my greatest concern is reducing the education of children to factory widgets , but the " Hawthorne Effect " was a seminal study on motivation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which resulted in factory employees producing more by the mere presence of " being singled out , being more involved , and made to feel important , rather than by giving more or less break times , more illumination , changing work times , etc .. This study along with theories of Maslow- states that it is more essential to satisfy psychological and social needs rather than offer remuneration as reward . Addtionally , a review of Mcgregors Theory X an Y , suggest that some individuals are self-motivated and assumes that others are resistant and apathetic about change or work . <p> Thanks for sharing this with us . I do agree that teaching is not all about money . We need an encouraging and supporting environment by parents , teachers , policy makers and community to provide pupils with good basics and guidance . These takes good planning by the policy makers , so that teachers can put them in practice ASAP without much time wasted in confusion and solving teething problem as the stds are the ultimate victimes . Teachers should spent more time teaching and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were to see substantial improvement in the pupils . The focus of the teachers are very important . <p> People who join the teaching profession fall into 3 categories : 1 ) Those who are passionate about teaching and nurturing and changing lives . Money is not going to change this group to do better because they are already pouring out their heart and life . 2 ) " Those who ca n't , teach " group . Money is not going to make any difference here , obviously . 3 ) Those who use the teaching profession as a stepping stone or transit to their real destination . Money might have an effect on this group but it would be very slight because their sights are set faraway and once they " smell " their ship coming ineven if it is a mere silhouette on the horizontheyre gon na pack their bags and run . <p> It is my opinion that the evidence is still out on this topic . First , if the performance based pay is actually based on incentivizing teachers to participate in school structural changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It takes a lot to get teachers to actually change an education paradigm in a school ; we 've been doing this public school education thing essentially the same way for fifty years ! Our incentive pay plan provides the professional development and other forms of support to change the instructional model . The initial data is very promising . <p> I know this is provocative but if intrinsic motivation is so natural and normal why does it take so much effort to foster it in so many environments ? While individuals who are intrinsically motivated have a hard time understanding those who are not , I am not so sure that most people exhibit much drive in any domain of their lives . <p> Ask your family , friends or peers what in their lives they do because they are driven . Ask them about the activities they participate in where they work towards constant improvement . Ask about those activities they would participate in even if they were not obligated to or were paid for doing it . I have done this and not one in a three dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their children is based largely on a feeling of obligation . <p> I want to believe that we can create an environment where individuals intrinsic motivation and passion thrive . I hope we can find a formula for this . I just am not convinced that everyone is as amenable to this type of motivation as those who truly are ! <p> One thing missing from the discussions on student performance is the question of the accuracy of the tests that seek to measure it . Those who created the value added models cautioned against using them for teacher evaluations since , among other problems , they were not designed to be used that way . Their reservations on the issue have fallen short of the actual problems that have occurred , such as the recent debacle in NYC where the VAMs produced no useful data at all . How can merit pay be determined with no data to base it on ? The insult of its failure then becomes an acute disincentive to remain in the profession when its continued use is insisted on by those with interests other than what is best for schools .

Its a culture-shaping , era-defining , not entirely uncontroversial extravapalooza that has earned the mind share , eyeballs , and admiration of tens of millions of global citizens . I had a chance to do a TED Talk a few years ago . And last year , my pal Bruno Giussani , one of TEDs impresarios , asked me to write up some advice for future speakers . <p> I stumbled across that advice the other day and decided to repurpose it on the Pink Blog in the hopes it will help the legions of TEDx speakers- and anyone else trying to move others by standing and delivering . <p> Here are my three key tips . <p> 1 . Prepare . . . but not too much . <p> These days , very few TED speakers arrive unprepared and just try to wing their presentations . That 's great . Preparing is a sign of respect for your audience and the only way to wrangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ive seen a handful of people who were too prepared and too rehearsed . Their presentations were so heavily shellacked that they seemed inauthentic ; their ideas suffocated under all that varnish .

Say something important . <p> There 's a big difference between saying some important things and saying something important . Your goal is n't to demonstrate how much you know or to catalog your many insights , but to leave the audience with one idea to ponder or better , one step to take . - When people hear some important things , their heads nod . When they hear something important , their souls stir , their brains engage , and their bodies prepare to act . <p> 3 .

Before you go to sleep , you 'll encounter dozens more . And you might desire some of these stories so deeply that you 'll pay for them . <p> My interest in the power of story goes back a long way , so of course I had a few questions for Jonathan about what he 's learned on the subject : <p> You make a very convincing case about our species-wide addiction to stories . - And yet so much of the time we spend immersed in story , whether reading novels , watching movies and TV , playing video games , or daydreaming , is characterized as " escapism " or " wasting valuable time . " Can you explain this paradox ? <p> We love stories . We are enormously fascinated by the fake struggles of fake people. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it feels so good , it ca n't be entirely good for us. - So , for centuries we 've worried not only that stories waste our time but , worse , that they promote laziness and moral corruption . I think this worry is misplaced. - My book argues that stories " from conventional fiction to daydreams " are an essential and wholesome nutrient for the human imagination . Stories help us rehearse for the big dilemmas of life , bring order to the chaos of experience , and help unite communities around common values . We should n't feel guilty about our time in storyland . <p> As you say in your book , storytelling permeates the business world a sales pitch is a very short story , a presentation is a longer one , and of course we tell motivating stories to each other all the time in the workplace . Do you think this has always been so ? Have business and commerce always been so storyfied ? Is it changing ? <p> There are two basic models of human nature in the business world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sapience " wisdom , intelligence " that really sets our species apart . Based on this model , the best way to achieve business goals is to crunch numbers , lay out facts , and wait for rational actors to flock to your point of view. - This is the traditional model . But a new model of human nature is emerging to complement " not replace " the traditional model. - This is what I call the Homo fictus ( fiction man ) model of human nature . This model acknowledges that humans are creatures of emotion as much as logic , and that facts and arguments move us most when they are embedded in good stories. - The worlds priests , politicians , and teachers have always known this by instinct , and so have the world 's marketers . What 's different now is a move to take storytelling beyond marketing and into all sectors of the business world that involve communication and persuasion. - Storytelling is increasingly seen as an essential business skill . <p> That makes sense . In fact , you refer to commercials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Links Beef Jerky ads as an example : " They say nothing about the product , by the way . They just tell stories about beef-jerky-loving guys who foolishly harass an innocent Sasquatch and earn a violent comeuppance . " Nothing about the product ? How does that work ? <p> Imagine you are a beef jerky marketer trying to take your relatively obscure brand to the top. - What can you say about your product to set it apart from other brands of dried , salted beef ? - You could claim that your jerky is very tasty or healthy , but that will excite no one . So Jack Link 's just decided to tell the coolest and funniest stories they could , with the jerky appearing in the stories only as product placement " in exactly the same way that a Coke can might show up in a sitcom . This attempt to create a positive emotional connection with consumers worked big time . People liked the commercials so much that they went out of their way to watch them many millions of times on YouTube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result , Jack Link 's is now a brand that most of know and think about positively . <p> What is one thing readers of this blog could do today to put what you 've learned about the power of stories into action in their lives ? <p> I 'd like readers to take a moment ( go ahead , do it right now ) to marvel with me about the role of story in human life " from dreams , to reality shows , to urban legends , to religion , to pop songs , to the life stories that define our personal identities . For humans , story is like gravity " it 's this powerful and all-encompassing force that we hardly even notice because we are so used to it . But gravity is influencing us all the time , and story is too. - Most of us think that our time in the provinces of storyland does n't shape or change us. - But research shows that story shapes humanity at the historical , cultural , and personal levels . Story is n't a frill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Story is a vastly powerful tool . By educating ourselves about story , we can use to learn that power in our own lives . <p> The use of stories in commercials really is fascinating when you think about it . Its very interesting to think about some commercials as very short stories with product placement as Jonathan mentioned . The Coca Cola commercials with polar bears is another good example of this . <p> I have to say I am intrigued . I will pick up a copy to read . I am curious to compare this to The Art of Storytelling . <p> I wonder if there is a distinction about the appropriateness , setting and purpose of storytelling in the workplace . That is , as Katie referenced " locker room " talk , becomes the reference base for serious issues that are cast by the teller as just an embelished story . This is already seen in the political arena with explaining away controversial comments with analagies and metaphores . <p> I am also curious if ethics and values are incorporated in the book relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hi ! Thanks for yet another useful and fascinating tidbit Dan ! Its so true about storytelling as a person needing to do my own marketing these days for a new business I am learning to appreciate its power . I love the reference to humanity as homo fictus . Reminds me of a story = one of my profs in grad school ( in intercultural communication ) said a better name for our species would be homo narrans , since what really sets us apart as a species is our propensity to tell stories , and our need to do so . <p> Yes , storytelling is important in so many ways ! For me , it 's connected with creativity and for others it 's better than therapy . <p> For the past several years , Baltimore has had a Stoop Storytelling series . Seven people ( and three picked from the audience ) tell their personal stories on a theme . Both my husband and I have been on stage telling our stories . <p> I am also a big believer in the power of story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selling and Presenting Yourself to Win Your Next Job , I include an entire section about how to tell powerful stories in job interviews . In fact , I tell my readers the best answer to an interview question is " Let me give you an example " which is an introduction to telling a story . <p> " We are not Homo sapiens , Wise Man . We are the third chimpanzee . What distinguishes us from the ordinary chimpanzee Pan troglodytes and the bonobo chimpanzee Pan paniscus , is something far more subtle than our enormous brain , three times as large as theirs in proportion to body weight . It is what that brain makes possible . And the most significant contribution that our large brain made to our approach to the universe was to endow us with the power of story . We are Pan narrans , the storytelling ape . " <p> This book open my mind to why we tell stories . There is no Narrativium in our universe like there is on Discworld but we humans acts as if there where = <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked all of this out in great details before him . Walter Fisher offered Homo Narrans decades ago and does work out the ethical implication . The key to understanding the power of narrative is that it is part of our ontology ( essence ) not simply a type of truth or genre . Once we grasped that , we can begin to " get it .

Its relatively easy to outsource work that 's " routine " that is , a task you can reduce to a formula , a set of rules , or series of steps that produces a single correct answer .

In both our cultural DNA and our laws and institutions , we 've created what I think our pretty good conditions for these sorts of abilities to flourish . That does n't  mean we have a lock .

Thanks ! <p> Dan I agree that too many sales commissions are too complex , but I also have seen the data that indicates many top sales producers want to work for commission . It is a big incentive to them . Perhaps instead of eliminating commission , you simplify it to focus on what you actually want to achieve .

Keep up the good work . Doug Green <p> Add this to the many reasons why I 'm a Daniel Pink fan . I 've visited McDs in every country Ive ever been in ( to my wife and friends horror ) . My favorite used to be the thick rice bun on the Taiwanese teriyaki burger . The McArabia in the Middle East was interesting too . India was most intriguing to me though .

I recommend " chicken rice , " " duck rice , " " mee hoon ( chow mei fun ) , " " kway tee ow , " or just be adventurous , point to something that looks interesting , and try it . <p> @Doug Fear not .

If you look at how Mcdonalds has revamped its image in the UK , it shows that they have adapted to changing demand from the public by adding Wi-Fi , relaxing armchair style seats and gone is the old red/yellow logos and plastic seats layout . <p> The US also has some culturally fascinating food choices at the McDonalds ( example : the pork burger ) . I have tried out the fun at McDonalds theory in Paris , only to end up sprinting ( okay , speed walking ) back to my hotel for a bathroom emergency .

However , I do like the idea of surveying the menu ( as a means for obtaining information about the local culture in a very " fast " way ) . <p> There are a few posts here that I think fundamentally missed Dans point . I have no doubt that Mr. Pink will be sampling the finest chicken and rice , fish head curry , etc. but his point to try McDonalds is still a good tip that should be considered after your initial no reaction that you 'll never go to McDonalds and that it is a waste of a meal . <p> Though I agree it is interesting to see the local offerings at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into local culinary tendencies/traditions , I tend to seek out the hole in the wall and truly local " finds " .

Half that gets you a large Coke at McDs . <p> Agree with this one . I 've eaten McDs in Spain , UK , Thailand , several US states ( they are NOT all the same ! ) , and yes , Singapore . <p> And sometimes , yes , you want to sample the local food . Sometimes , you 've been working in a foreign country for an age , and you want something you recognize from home . <p> For me , the foreign place is the US , and home is the UK , but eating at McDs is a guaranteed-to-work thing : everyone had it " at home " , so its a universal " familiar environment " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snob who must sample every cultures foods .

Happy ( Meaningful ) New Year ! <p> I like the part where Emily defined meaning connecting and contributing to something beyond the self . I think that contributing is important but the connection piece is what so many of us desire , especially in this new world where our phones and technology can isolate us from one another . So , in the end , we experience meaning by reaching out to others . This IS a good thing , a way to make our world a better place . Hooray !

Asymmetry is an issue when it comes to the Smiseks of the world . But I 'll bet there are ( at least partial ) solutions . <p> One is to narrow the proposition . For instance , maybe Smisek is available by phone one hour a week for such things . He would n't be able to answer very many calls but at least hed get a taste . Several big city mayors have been doing this sort of thing , in person , for years . Or perhaps Smisek spends one week a year taking customer calls . Its hard to imagine that this would make Uniteds service any worse . <p> ANother is to push the proposition downward .

As Seth alluded to , the internet is a giant megaphone , but it also allows for anonymity ( posting nasty comments on Yelp , etc . ) . There 's also the shadowy sense that you 're complaining to a " faceless " person . Writing about a poor establishment ( on the internet ) is much different than SPEAKING to the OWNER ! <p> I would hazard a guess that Farruggio does n't  get more than one or two complaints a month ( if that ) .

I am communications director in a small school district , where our middle school principal goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his business cards and on his e-mail signature file , and the office secretaries are instructed to give it out to anyone who is trying to get in touch with him . The guy has 20+ years experience as a principal , and he s been doing this since the advent of pocket cell phones . Parents , as you can imagine , absolutely love it . <p> But as for the issue of scalabilityI also previously worked in institutional communications at a large land grant university with 30,000 students , give or take . A senior VP has developed a remarkable reputation for being extraordinarily hands on . He remembers the names AND faces of hundreds of the new freshman each year ( possibly thousands , though Im sure at least hundreds ) . He remembers their home towns , their high school passions and all kinds of silly ( yet invaluable ) details that can make a college freshman feel welcome and , to a large extent , accepted . The point of this , however , is that this same gentleman does the parent orientation speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incoming freshmen . And at every session ( probably 20 or more each summer ) , he gives parents his cell phone number and tells them to call him any time , for any reason . <p> While I 'm quite sure nearly all of the calls go to his voicemail , I 'm just as certain that he " handles " every call very promptly , either by returning it himself or by dispatching the message on to any of his capable lieutenants . <p> While I 'm sure there are plenty of crazies out there waiting to give CEOs and the like a piece of their mind , I also know that the parents of college freshmen can be a frighteningly demanding crowd . He 's done this for 15 years or more , and in doing so he has , if nothing else , developed an admirable reputation for himself and for his institution as being a place that cares about students and their families . <p> Cell phone or not , I 'm with Jeremiah . Someone who genuinely values his or her consumers experience makes time to sincerely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracted to , uses JD Power surveyshalf of them come back anonymous and half of them sign their names . They have my cellthey know where I liveyet they still sign anonymous . Why ? Because just like memost of them do n't  really wont me to know that they complained . Maybe it 's that people approval thing that some have going on . I would n't ever call this restaurant owner if I had a NOT perfect response . I might if I had a really excellent ( above normal ) treatment by employees . But never if I had a mediocre experience . It would have to be " food poisoning " before I calledand even then , I 'd have my lawyer call . : ) I just would n't go back . There are plenty of restaurants . There is n't that many airlines and post offices do n't have competition in letter delivery . In my case of anonymous-signed surveys , I assume that the truth is the signer wanted a deeper relationship with me than what I was able to give . They wanted recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones that do sign .. they have that relationship . <p> GREAT post , Dan ! The issue here is n't WHO answers the calls , its that your restaurant owner found a way to demonstrate in a tangible way to his customers that the quality of their experience really MATTERED to him enough to inconvenience his own cell . Its not necessary for the CEO of United Airlines to provide his own , but it is CRITICAL that he and the organization convey to their customers that the quality of their experience REALLY MATTERS to him and the organization . That 's where the disconnect isbad service has become so acceptable and commonplace ( the larger the organization , the more likely size will be the excuse ) that consumers assume any message from the organization regarding service quality is insincere . <p> One solution in large corporations is to insist that every middle manager and above spends time answering ( or at least listening in on ) customer service calls each month . Having done this myself 4 hours a month for a certain former credit card company I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we percieved what it was like for the customers to be on the receiving end . Coupled with this , of course , was the companys commitment to excellent customer service and a culture of employee pride in that level of service . If the employees feel like they are working for " just another company " , the customers will always like they are doing business with " just another company " however hard the PR guys play with the smoke and mirror tricks . <p> It turns out that people do n't  actually call as often as you might expect . We are a software company ( www.rhino3d.com ) with hundreds of thousands of users . All our direct phone numbers and e-mail addresses are on our web site . <p> True , they are not posted next to the front door , but they not hard to find . My details are also on the bottom of the support page . " If nothing else works , e-mail or call me directly anytime " Bob McNeel " <p> My number is only answered by me , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my cell . <p> On average I get 2 to 3 calls per week from someone that really does need some help and only one or two " dumb " calls per year . <p> I always encourage business owners to chat with their customers . They are usually very delightful people . <p> All of the talk about cell phone numbers is interesting , yet there is a larger point afoot . THIS is how THIS CEO reflects his ownership and accountability . It is only one way to do it . What have you done or experienced from others in your life , that also creates a high level of ownership and accountability with regard to service or other aspects of your business ? <p> I flew Delta last night DTW to SLC . Plane had two gate changes in 30 minutes and arrived an hour late causing many people to miss their connections and spend the night in SLC . Now I live in SLC , so it was n't that disruptive for my travels , but for the others , it was very disruptive . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain why a plane arriving from Mexico at 6:56 p.m. was scheduled to leave at 7:15 p.m. when there is no way it could be deplaned , go through customs and boarded in 19 minutes . But maybe if a CEO received a call like that a few times a week , the schedulers would pay closer attention or maybe work someplace else . <p> Great post and discussion , one element that did n't  receive much attention in the post so far is the message that is sent to the employees of the organization where the boss is asking for direct feedback on the customer experience . It speaks to employees in at least 2 ways : <p> #1 Customer satisfaction and support is supported from the top down <p> #2 Holds employees accountable for making customer service a top priority . It would be interesting to know if the boss empowers those employees to do what it takes to drive positive customer experiences ? ! <p> Whether CEOs can offer personal accountability or not might be beside the point . The point is that FAR MORE people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardiologist offer his personal cell phone to patients . His patients know he cares about them as people and they love the heck out him and recommend him to everyone they know . <p> Dan I wanted to call you and discuss this blog post but I could n't find your cell number on your contact page . http : **25;331;TOOLONG .

Channels to the President/CEO are important along with empowering your people to make a difference for their customers . <p> Dan , This is the Internet , not a local restaurant .

He s been in the restaurant business for 32 years and said he finds it extremely valuable to get feedback directly from the customer . I shared that I live in North Carolina but grew up in the DC area and plan to visit his restaurant on my next trip to the area . And Dan , Mr. Farruggio says he will check out your site . <p> The concept of accountability is not entirely a lost art .

It is n't that the CEO does n't  want to be bothered ; in fact , all complaints are logged and examined for how to avoid future problems . Part of the procedure is to thank the customer for helping them improve . Empowered employees are motivated to provide the best possible customer experience . <p> Imagine how much better would it be to fly , for instance , if that were true of ticket agents and ground crew ? <p> Sorry Dan , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my taste . <p> A sign that says " I need your help !

Thanks ! <p> Dan , great column . The results do n't  surprise me though . When left to question , " Will I " or " How can I " it removes the expectation that the problem will be solved and allows for the brain to creatively find solutions . <p> Another question that opens doors to ideas begins with " What if. ?

There is something , almost disingenuous , about people who " puff themselves up " , trying to convince others ( and themselves ) that they can do almost anything . I 've never believed them , nor for myself . Maybe that means I am a self-doubter ? I work with a program that ALWAYS asks open-ended questions , which allows for more flexible thinking and multiple ideas . I think that when people are forced to question , either themselves or others it helps them maintain perspective . This article helped me to understand that people must look at their own limitations . We cant ALL do EVERYTHING and must set out to do the tasks of which we are capable . Thank you , again , for your insightfulness . <p> This is great , Dan ! I was raised around a whole bunch of adults that not only asked , " Can we fix it ? " but also , " Can we create something to do it better or to do something entirely new and different ? " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Columbia Basin . The Columbia Basin irrigation project was started in the 1930s , when this entire area was nothing but dirt , rock , sagebrush , and sand . Now its one of the foremost agricultural areas in the world . I like the attitude of " Can we fix it ? " because it assumes a solution and begs for innovation . <p> First of all , I just wanted to say I 'm truly a huge fan and because of you : I 've started a blog of writing mini-sagas to practice my " story sense . " You got me hooked on it Pink ! <p> Anyways , I just had to add my 2 cents in regards to this statement you made in the column : <p> " Self-help gurus from Norman Vincent Peale to Anthony Robbins might shudder at allowing a shaft of negativity to shine through our mental doors . " <p> Oooooo , I have to disagree here . Peale , Robbins , and the " quality success teachers " do not simply suggest to think positive or motivate yourself through affirmations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about truly understanding WHY you might be having those thoughts . In my opinion , negative emotions are a signal that a change is needed . <p> " Quality questions create a quality life . Successful people ask better questions and as a result , they get better answers . " -Anthony Robbins <p> Anyways , I just wanted to mention that and its always a pleasure to read what you write . <p> BTW I believe that we should n't wait until we are adults to start asking those questions . Education should be about the questions and less about getting the " right answer " . If we want to continue to be creative , out-of-the-box thinkers we need to focus on future generations and consider changing the paradigm of learning , now ! <p> I have mixed views on this as when solving problems , I tend to take the Bob the Builder approach . Yet my experience in sports coaching says positive thinking is often by far the most effective way of tackling anything where something scary is involved . As lack of commitment and self doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have seen many less skilled people complete a task simply because they thought they could do it , whereas people with more skill/talent failed as they doubted their abilities . Often it is simply believing you can do something allows you to do it and questioning it prevents you from carrying out task . This is assuming an adequate level of skill . <p> Though overconfidence in ones abilities can also lead to hospital visits if not careful . But not as often as doubting yourself when doing something like downhill mountain biking , where more speed can in many instances , be much safer than slowing down . Which is exactly what the less confident tend to do , causing one to lose valuable momentum which often carries you through the danger zone , leading to a crash and even more doubt in their abilities . <p> Dan , you got ta get outta my head man !

I also feel that Bob the Builders humble but confident approach invites realism . Do you feel that Barbara Ehrenreichs work connects with the research you noted ? http : //Www.lornerubis.com <p> I think its true that a certain amount of self assesment does n't  necessarily undermine your self-belief . I 'd rather be aware of poor professional or interpersonal habits and be able to change than be perperually trying to gloss them over by assuring myself that " I can be anything I want to be " etc . Self assesment is natural , it is pragmatic .

We should cherish people who have extricated themselves from trouble in the past . <p> I was especially intrigued by your idea of the " jagged resume " in part because I realized that I myself sorta had one of these way back when . Tell us what you mean by that term and why it matters . <p> Steve Jobs is a perfect example . Both in the 1970s and the 1990s , his life was a wild blend of great strengths and apparent failures .

Every year or two , a future All-Star sits unclaimed . Mike Piazza , the great catcher , was a 62nd round pick . Weird but true . Especially when you 're dealing with young , unproven people , some candidates show just a glimmer of promise . Their talent whispers . Do n't  scoff at them .

@@26895445 @595445/ <h> Dan 's Bookshelf <h> 3 articles worth reading <p> High on the growing list of endangered media species is long-form magazine journalism . In a world of 140-character updates and 60-second video clips , do we have the attention span ( and the business model ) to sustain carefully-crafted 5,000-word articles ? <p> I sure hope so . Because even in a tough environment , there 's some great work coming out of magazines . Here are three pieces I read in the past two weeks with ideas and stories hard to reduce to a Tweet and that really come to life on the printed page . ( Of course , this being the interwebs , I have to provide links . ) <p> 1 . The Science of Success ( The Atlantic ) David Dobbs reveals some remarkable findings from biological psychiatry showing that people with genes that predispose them to certain troublesome and self-destructive behavior can actually outperform those without such " bad genes . " They 're like orchids , Dobbs says . Theyre fragile in many environments , but in the right greenhouse they can bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evan Ratliff tried to disappear for a month , shedding his identity entirely . Meanwhile , Wired offered $5000 to anybody who could find him . The result is a riveting cat-and-mouse tale with some smart insights into identity in a transparent world . ( Added bonus : The photography in this piece is gorgeous . ) <p> 3 . Accept Defeat : The Neuroscience of Screwing Up ( Wired ) Many experiments in science fail , says Jonah Lehrer . But that 's not a problem . The problem is that most of those failures are ignored and its these often-dismissed anomalies that contain the seeds of real breakthroughs . One of the most thought-provoking articles Ive read in a long while . <h> 7 Responses to " 3 articles worth reading " <p> I really liked the idea in the Atlantic about Orchid children . It makes me recall all those people who have achieved greatness who were misfits in school . Because they were nurtured and taken care of , they were able to achieve greatness . Its a shame that our education system , which over-stresses conformity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not cause trouble , but they certainly wont change the world . An excellent article . <p> As the father of an autistic son , I read David Dobbs article with great interest . Though we never looked at it in terms of orchids and dandelions , our approach has been one of cultivating on and building our sons strengths while trying to minimize the issues created by the " weaknesses " resulting from his autism . <p> The article did n't  address autism specifically , and some will argue that autism is n't a genetically based disorder . I think , though , if they read the article and take what I believe to be its true meaning , they will gain a better understanding not only of their children but of their relationship with them . <p> I agree that the magazine is going the way of the dodo bird . I think the same is true for newspapers . Its interesting how the internet has changed our view of the world . It seems silly to me to kill trees just to deliver the news . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked a professor if results which do not reject the null hypothesis are published or recorded somewhere . I knew what the answer was , but I asked anyway . So what happens is someone comes up with an idea for an experiment to test , for example , if a chemical found in frog ear wax slows down the growth of tumor . Many hours are spent collecting the frog ear wax the experiment is performed and the results are negative . This never gets published . So , it is possible someone somewhere will go through the same steps all over again . What a waste of time . There needs to be a journal maybe the Journal of Non Significant Results . the old story about Thomas Edison he did n't  think he failed e Remember each time he tried something that did not work in his light bulb . He though of it as discovering something that did not work and then tried something new . <p> I also loved the first two articles , Orchid Kids and Vanished , but wouldve missed the third , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall Seattle on Monday and hearing more about Drive .

Suddenly there are no limits . True innovation will come from this creativity and experimentation and schools and teachers need to show students how to problem solve and think this way . Maybe the next Picasso or Mozart will be discovered , but more likely , students will realize there are no boundaries to discovery in business and science . They will learn to use the tools to create something new . This is a good thing .

Teachers are n't trained this way , and may not understand how to make these connections , but I believe would be happy to teach this way with the needed information . It needs to happen . <p> Sigh , I too tried locking my child in the closet , threatening military school , taking away Barney ! He was five , but no , he persisted in acting and I just kept taking him to to those lessons , then plays , then the Beach Blanket Babylon acting awards , then USC Film School , then film festivals where he was honored , and now , sigh , he is acting again in Hollywoodthe next Ryan Gosling but better looking .

The sales person is one person in a long chain of placement and selling , but have a sense of entitlement that far outweighs their true value .

@@26895463 @595463/ <h> 3 Questions for Blake Mycoskie , founder of TOMS Shoes <p> Describe the competitive logic behind Toms . Is it more like a charity that finances its charitable giving through shoe sales ? Is it more like a for-profit company that 's willing to sacrifice profits in order to do good ? Is a hybrid of those two models ? Or is it something else altogether ? <p> I think that TOMS is a hybrid of both . TOMS proves that business and philanthropy are no longer mutually exclusive , and can coexist for the greater good . If I had created a non-profit organization dependent on fundraising we would have been able to give shoes once , or maybe twice , but by developing the TOMS business model , we have been able to return to these communities and other areas across the world with shoes for children in need . This past September , TOMS gave away its millionth pair of shoes in Argentina . <p> Is this business model something that could work in other industries ? How about industries that are n't  selling tangible goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other companies incorporating the One for One in their business model like Warby Parker ( mentioned in the column ) , who gives a pair of eyeglasses for every pair they sell . We know that other industries ca n't always exactly do One for One , but we encourage businesses to think about doing good and somehow build giving into their model . There is no greater feeling that knowing you 've helped someone . <p> Are there limits to the profit motive alone as a route to business success ? Are we entering an era in which organizations must also be animated by the purpose motive ? <p> As an entrepreneur , I see no limits and will continue to look for creative ways to keep TOMS going . The only way we can give sustainably and responsibly , is to constantly create great product that consumers want to buy . 
@@26895464 @595464/ <h> Motivation <h> The best 82-minute movie on mastery Ive ever seen <p> I do n't  get to see a lot of movies these days and its almost unheard of that I 'll watch one twice . But this weekend marked my second viewing of the short documentary film , Jiro Dreams of Sushi . If you 're interested in the alluring , frustrating , asymptotic pursuit of mastery , this is movie is a must-see . <p> The film tells the story of Jiro Ono , an 85-year-old chef who runs Sukiyabashi Jiro , a sushi-only restaurant in Tokyo that has 10 seats and 3 Michelin stars . Ono is obsessed with his craft , so much that sushi ideas come to him in his dreams . And while his obsessiveness has costs for instance , his relationship with his sons , whove followed him into the family trade it is also inspiring . <p> A few choice quotations : <p> " Once you decide on your occupation you must immerse yourself in your work . You have to fall in love with your work . Never complain about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill . That 's the secret of success and is the key to being regarded honorably . " <p> " I 've never once hated this job . I fell in love with my work and gave my life to it . Even though I 'm eighty-five years old , I do n't  feel like retiring . That 's how I feel . " <p> " I do the same thing over and over , improving bit by bit . There is always a yearning to achieve more . I 'll continue to climb , trying to reach the top , but no one knows where the top is . " <p> Thanks Dan andthanks for your AWESOME interview with Michelle James on the Business Creativity Summit . <p> It was one of the most useful , info-packed , fluff-free interviews I 've ever heard . I especially liked your comments about noticing the type of work/creative endeavor you spend your time doing ( w/o getting paid ) for clues about the work you are meant to do ( versus continually asking " What am I passionate about ? " ) <p> Also , totally resonate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the coolest , most subtle lessons come from " simple " experiences that we will forget unless we write them down . <p> So thanks again for that and for sharing this story . I look forward to watching it . <p> Thanks for the recommendation , Dan . Ill check it out . In addition to Netflix , it can also be seen with Amazon Prime . <p> Another ( similar ? ) film you may want to see : " Between the Folds . " Documents the lives of several origami artists and theoreticians who are using paper folding as medium for artistic expression as well as scientific discovery . <p> Well , Cranky Old Lady dissents not with the value of loving your work . But with the need to remember passion and skill might help , but many jobs are not easy to love and are down for the pay check . <p> Lucky are those who love their work and can earn a living by what they love . For the rest it is called work for a reason . You have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing a hated job well or have a good union so the pay check makes it worth while . <p> As I said , I am a cranky old lady , but also love life and children and am distressed at what has happened to far too many children of the 70s , 80s and on up by telling them to just love their work . Much more complicated . <p> Alex here again . I am inspired to do another NewPath Movies that Motivate event . Our first was Iron Man back in 2008 ( ! ) . We need to do another and I have n't found one movie that I would deem worthy until I saw the trailer for this one . Just ordered it on Amazon in Bluray and will get a place to watch it with our NewPathers soon . <p> Do you have other movies that motivate ? Autonomy and Purpose movies ? We would like inspirational ones that could foster a discussion afterwards . <p> here 's our first ( and only ) attempt at this it was super fun and **38;358;TOOLONG . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree that its an excellent documentary . Its an inspiring story and fascinating to see how a master has worked for decades to improve his craft . <p> One thing I 'd like to add , though . I have to admit that I was a little uneasy watching Jiros pursuit ( obsession ? ) of mastery . I fear that we as a community can go too far in promoting the value of self-improvement and craft . Its important to take work seriously , but there are other valuable pursuits in life beside ones craft/career : family , faith , character , etc . Especially in a modern society that places so much value on " success " , I worry that a singular focus on mastery can become a bit shallow . <p> I certainly enjoyed this post , but the focus on mastery misses the most crucial point . What motivates his drive for mastery ? I perceive that he is really motivated by an incredibly strong sense of purpose , though largely unarticulated . People rarely drive for mastery for its own sake . They drive for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social good either for themselves or for others . When people have a compelling purpose , they will do whatever it takes to be great at it , even becoming obsessive . <p> Focusing on mastery is looking at the outside manifestation of a more fundamental process . I think this post and the movie would be significantly more valuable if it went past the superficial into the real driver of great performance compelling purpose . <p> Purpose seems to be a heavy subject . Most forms of art have no purpose in the popular sense of the term . Art of course does fulfill a different purpose , one that has to do with an inexplicable desire that may even lack logical justification . I love music . I just want to be able to make music that moves me . If I wanted it bad enough so as to become obsessed with it , I would no doubt attain mastery . I have no such purposes of entertaining the world with my music or making a difference to anyones lives through it . Yet , my desire drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I 'm nowhere close to mastery itself ) . <p> Does it necessarily take a sense of purpose to go far ? I suppose one can be taken over by the ghost of desire for absolutely no reason whatsoever . <p> I am deeply moved by Skanda Tejaswis use of the word PATH . In no other way one can describe ones passion for mastery . Of course , the word remembered me the passion of Joan of Arc . For many she was a heretic , but the underlying political , social and psychological assumptions and beliefs can never be thrown out . So one who is in the Path of mastery , is not egotistic , pursuing his/her own benefits but that of mankind . Thanks for William Seidman for his insight poured into the discussion . The question he raised What motivates his drive for mastery ? is a billion-dollar one . <p> I felt that I quickly needed to comment : I viewed Jiro Dreams of Sushi a month or so ago i was looking for some motivation or travel docu in general and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up being ! What a man/father and family . I have told friends and general people i chat with on the phone , at starbucks , a red light , or wherever to watch this film . I just wanted to chime in and give my two cents I 'm happy to see it being discussed and passed on to more people . <p> I have been working to describe and understand my mastery journey for the past several months . How did I grow this passion and when did I commit ? I am seeking to be more self aware as I think it will make me a better leader of leaders , manager , peer , friend , husband , and person . Jiro is an interesting polar example of Mastery . Some people saw the movie and took away mixed messages about mastery and the sacrifices Jiro clearly made during his life . I think there is some truth in that . However , personally having recently read Drive I saw a intoxicating mix of mastery , purpose , autonomy , and flow . <p> How does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go after Drive , Jiro , etc ? I was particularly interested in the secondary story of the apprentices . They bought into the mastery journey . How do you help people find that mastery journey ? I get that maybe it is up to me and my brain but it is certain accepting ideas and inputs .

" <p> This may be true of some women , but I think many women are grateful for the changes that have allowed us to earn money and understand that this means that it is not realistic to expect , nor do we need , the man to be more of a earner than us . That being said , I think most women do like for a man to have something he does that is valuable in the marketplace and some sense of personal financial responsibility , if for no other reason than that we suspect it is as good for mans self-esteem as it has been for womens to be able to earn and have a place in the political economy ? <p> You also say " And I 'm called lazy all the time according to women , strictly due to low income/eduction . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lazy . " They may have some concern about how you assemble a family on that working schedule plus the womans working schedule , and the need for $ that children especially have , but that 's not about laziness but more about trying to be realistic about what is possible . <p> You do n't  mention children in your post . I think the primary concern of working women of all educational levels who want to have a children is finding a man who has the capacity to relate to children , enjoys and wants to have them and the willingness to put in the hours of scut work it takes to raise them . Being able to balance this with some kind of paid work/career is the real challenge , and they are looking for men who are cognizant of these issues . <p> It is true that there continues to be some romanticizing and fantasizing about **32;426;TOOLONG homes generally in the culture , and I think this is part of the problem ; people feel like they are failing if they are n't  doing this , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do n't  want to set things up this way ?

I agree with much of what she had to say . <p> My boyfriend does n't  have a college degree ( which he s perfectly comfortable with he has never attended college , knowing all along it was n't for him ) .

I cant have a wife , get a mortgage , and have a family under just 30k a year ( that 's where I usually hit the glass ceiling , usually very early , then Im told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old and have played this entry level dance too many times . Do n't  tell me to just go to college , as I said , I failed college three times , its not for me . At least I do n't  have any debt because employers foolishly paid for college all three times , and then promptly fired me when I failed all three times , after I warned them several times that traditonal college education is n't the best path towards promotion for myself . <p> Obviously I had something of value for three different employers to want to send me off to college via their own dime , so why not just promote me out right into the regular staff ? I never understood the need to send your already qualified through experience off to college . <p> Most employers have the attitude , " because I went to college , you should too ! You just want a shortcut . " I have to laugh at that , college is the short cut , struggling with a life threatening disease , and still managing to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entry level job is a much more difficult and longer path . <p> Although I have now completely recovered from my illness , it has always left a side effect , my working memory is n't the greatest , that 's a non-starter for college exams , so college is n't for me . I wish people would get over it . I 'm actually confident in myself and my abilities , I just wish people could see past the lack of ******** college , so I can get paid nicely for what I do best , rather than get exploited because I do n't  have a college degree . <p> I really ca n't stand people who whine how they cant find a job without a college degree . If you have a college degree , life should be set for you . If the college graduates Ive worked with only put in half the effort I did , they would already be in upper management . <p> Don , you should start your own business . Put all that common sense and motivation to work for yourself instead of these companies . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and although I have to put in overtime from time to time , my job requires autonomy and provides great flexibility . <p> My husband is a restaurant manager , which is not flexible . If he gets sick , another manager has to come it on his day off . If I get sick , the work is just waiting for me when I 'm better ( for the most part ) . If our kid gets sick , or course I 'm getting him unless I 'm in the most important meeting ever . <p> I already make more than him , but would gladly have him make less than he does now for a M-F day job schedule ( or even stay home ) , but that 's not his " dream " . I appreciate that he s hard worker , but I wish the " dream " was more about what he can do and gets out of family than cooking food for other people . <p> My post sounds kinda harsh , which is interesting .

Will singles face an affordable housing shortage far beyond that experienced by families ? <p> I have been following housing issues for a number of years and am seeing an increasing incidence of conflict between local zoning/housing ordinances and groups of singles sharing housing . <p> A common zoning practice is to limit unrelated dwelling occupancy to a specific number often three of unrelated individuals . As the number and proportion of singles increase , more singles are competing in the housing market , existing unrelated occupancy restrictions are gaining more attention and enforcement , plus the regulatory heat in some places is being turned up . <p> Watch for this emerging trend toward unrelated occupancy conflicts and increased regulation to continue and gain momentum across the country .

@@26895528 @595528/ <p> Because Pink Blog readers are interested in the broad array of subjects Oliver writes about in this book , l asked him to answer a few questions . here 's our interview : <p> 1 . You call our cultures " fixation on positivity " a " disease . " But the cure you prescribe drawn from the teachings of the Stoics , the Buddha , and other deep thinkers is pretty challenging stuff . Wheres the harm in positive thinking if it makes us happy ? <p> Well , I 'm not sure that it *does* make us happy : there 's now plenty of psychological evidence to suggest that trying to make yourself think positive thoughts can backfire , leaving people feel worse . More practically , this focus on struggling to achieve the " right " emotional state " ie. , constant grinning optimism is a distraction from taking the actions that matter . ( Plus , those people are pretty annoying . ) The researchers and thinkers I met while researching my book , and the personal experiments I undertook , approached the matter differently . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insecurity , pessimism and failure , instead of treating them like they 're radioactive ? <p> 2 . " Goal Crazy " might be the most provocative chapter in the book . You could fill a library with all everything that 's been written on achieving personal and professional goals , and yet you say that this relentless focus on goals is misplaced . What 's so bad about setting , working toward , and achieving goals ? <p> There 's a role for goals . But the " overpursuit " of goals leads to all kinds of hazards . One major pitfall is that " you can never change only one thing " and so focusing on a single variable risks distorting many others . ( We probably all know people whove pursued a wealth goal , say , at the expense of their personal relationships , but that 's only the most obvious example . ) Another is that rigid plans for the future mean we do n't  hear when opportunity knocks softly . Research among successful entrepreneurs by Saras Sarasvathy , for example , suggests they choose what she calls " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  behave like gourmet chefs , visualizing a perfect dish and then sourcing the ingredients . They 're more like time-pressed home cooks , checking what 's in the cupboard , then exploring ways to combine the resources at their disposal ideas , materials , people . Then they just start , adjusting their target as they go : " ready , fire , aim " , not " ready , aim , fire . " ( Another tip : choose " process " goals over " outcome " goals . Not " I 'll write a great novel " , but " I 'll do 45 minutes every weekday " . ) <p> 3 . We 've probably all seen the studies showing that people from some of the poorest nations on earth consistently rank higher in happiness than citizens of wealthy countries . In the book , you offer a counterintuitive explanation for why that may be so could you briefly explain ? <p> This is such a fraught topic . I do n't  mean to imply that poverty and disease are somehow unproblematic , simply because there 's a higher incidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you realize when you visit places like the Kenyan township of Kibera outside Nairobi , and study the research evidence , is that people living in extremely fragile conditions do have one advantage . Theyre forced to face the fundamental insecurity of existence . They do n't  have the option of mistakenly believing that the next pay raise , the next promotion or a bigger house , will finally make them happy . Theyre compelled instead to find ways to live with insecurity and to build the strong relationships with family and neighbors that are a crucial ingredient of wellbeing . We mustnt romanticize their situation . But as we 've seen on the US east coast recently , all our lives , in different ways , are suffused with insecurity . Do we really want to embrace a philosophy of happiness based on trying to ignore that ? <p> 4 . At the end of The Antidote , you talk a little about some of the techniques that have been most helpful to you . What continues to stick with you personally from your research ? What could readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even to get started on a more satisfying path ? <p> If you 're feeling daring , do what I did and deliberately embarrass yourself in public a technique adapted from Stoicism that will transform your perspective on plunging into uncertain or scary situations . ( Choose something legal and considerate of others ! I spoke the names of stations on the London Underground out loud . ) Alternatively , pick a project you 've been procrastinating on , choose a useful next action , and this is the critical part *dont* try to stamp out the associated negative feelings of reluctance or fear or uncertainty . Acknowledge them , then act anyway . Another thing I 've turned into a daily habit , albeit haltingly , is meditation . Learning to observe your thoughts and emotions without manipulating them is the opposite of positive thinking : paradoxical though it sounds , getting comfortable with feeling uncomfortable is vastly more powerful than trying to stay positive . <p> I wonder what author and you , Daniel , think about the application of these principles to those of us who are constantly down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even thinking of self acceptance and acceptance of present cirumstances without constantly whining about them would be a great relief . <p> I would direct you to Dr Steve Peters book , The Chimp Paradox which shows us how to manage that part of the mind that panics , sees things in black and white and gets disillusioned very quickly but can also be very helpful . http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=zdsULCgqflE <p> I agree with Bob McNeel , it sounds very much like Barbara Ehrenreichs " Bright-Sided . " Ehrenreich was more focused on her breast cancer battle , the cutesie " pinking " of the movement , and how cancer patients are made to feel they caused their illness through negative thinking such a dangerous and insidious concept . <p> I totally agree that process goals are much better then outcome goals . In Freakanomics they talked about an experiment in Chicago schools about paying for grades . When they gave incentives for getting As and Bs they actually did n't  change that much . But when the incentive was for attendance then not only did attendance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to incentivize for process(attendance) or outcome(grades) . <p> " Learning to observe your thoughts and emotions without manipulating them is the opposite of positive thinking : paradoxical though it sounds , getting comfortable with feeling uncomfortable is vastly more powerful than trying to stay positive . " <p> I agree : observing your thoughts and making peace with where you are ( rather than trying to resist and push them away ) is powerful . <p> One distinction I would make is that positive thinking is not about trying to feel better thinking about the very thing you perceive as negative . But you can make a choice whether or how much you want to entertain and feed the negative train of thinking and then shift your focus to a different topic that is easier to feel good about . <p> Great suggestions . I 'd like to recommend The Therapy of Desire by Martha Nussbaum ( the new edition published in 2009 ) . Professor Nussbaum is the Ernst Freund Distinguished Service Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago , appointed in the Philosophy Department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recommend Cicero on the Emotions : Tusculan Disputations 3 and 4 ( and on a related topic , Stoicism and Emotions ) by Margaret Craver , Professor of Classical Studies at Dartmouth . <p> In fact , there are many good books on Stoicism .

" The more you bring in , the more you make , either way . <p> I love the approach that Chris Nordyke is taking . Thanks for sharing this . <p> Ironically , I think the approach of taking the focus off of sales could potentially result in a lot more sales . The reason is that most customers will likely really appreciate having the focus be on their needs and not on the needs of the salesperson . <p> And if the customers needs are being met , then they are more likely to continue to be a customer and tell others about their positive experiences . <p> I agree with some of the respondents this message while appearing to be forward thinking may be a little misleading . I say this because if products are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting a commission , period ! No one does this work as a volunteer and I suspect this business is no different . Bank employees do n't  get paid commissions but are often rewarded financially and otherwise based on product placement , pressured to place products even . I suspect Daniel , you shared this to show a different sort of motivation but I 'm not sure that is exactly what is going on here . This may be more about marketing than staff motivation . I do n't  know this company and wouldnt dream of assuming they were doing anything other than what is best for the client until proven otherwise . As someone who worked in the commission financial services world for 11 years and now operates a fee-for-advice business ( which does n't  include product sale of any kind ) where I charge for time or plans , if products are being placed there is a financial reward to someone . I do agree with Greg when the focus is taken off sales and re-directed to the purpose , helping the client , more sales are often the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live on the east coast , so you 're probably not familiar with Les Schwab . Les Schwab founded a tire store , which is incredibly successful and noted for their tremendous customer service . Similar to what your insurance guy presents , Schwab Tires pays no commissions , but they have an extraordinary business approach . They share half the profits that any store earns with the people working at the store . That philosophy drives their whole approach . <p> Now , I know nothing about this insurance guy , but given that he s from Corvallis OR , there is no doubt that he knows about and is heavily influenced by Les Schwab . <p> A friend of mine from years ago who still lives and sells cars in the Philly ( Steve Videon ) His Father Frank set this up years ago and I think they still work it this way . They payed the salesmen a salary . One of the only Car Dealers I know of that does this . http : **32;516;TOOLONG <p> Dan , I can speak from direct experience with Chris as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and business insurance with him for a few years . His customer service is up there with Zappos ! And that is not just from Chris but his whole staff . His office is friendly and his staff is efficient , caring and always helpful . <p> I have recently moved from his location but have decided to stay with him just because I know I will not find the same service anywhere . It was a rare find . -John <p> All fair questions/comments . The reality is that the agency got paid different percentages on every policy or product we placed . That 's just the nature of the industry . There is no way for me to remove my agencys " commission " from the equation , but I can at least pay the team differently , hopefully creating a different experience for my clients in the process . <p> Its also worth noting , that you 'll never fully remove a businesss profit motive/incentive . Most business owners cant insulate themselves from this even if they wanted to . If a car dealer pays a salary versus commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push their sales people , as they make more money every time a car is sold . Despite an imperfect system , setting up a commission-free model certainly gets your employees more aligned with the customers interest though , no ? <p> As to whether this was just done for marketing- Yes and no . There 's no doubt I was counting on this to be a differentiator from other agents and companies . I was betting that it would resonate with clients and would set a different tone for our interactions with them . Everything a company does is marketing . Strategically , my prediction was that it would create more confidence in my team , and create more trust with our clients , thus selling more policies . Definitely a marketing equation . <p> As a former Verizon dealer , no , I could n't determine how Verizon comped me , but I could determine how I comped my employees and since they were the front line to customers , yes , it changed their sales methods . In the end , though , it was tough to compete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high margin products and services over customer needs . In the insurance game , I see ads , that if I took them seriously I 'd be going from company to company saving so much money that at one point theyd be paying ME to have insurance . If you do n't  have a staff that will take the time to truly evaluate needs , not savings or best sales margins , the customer is not being served . As John has mentioned , I not only know that Chris has done this as a customer , but also as one that had his wife working there . We both learned a lot about correctly evaluating insurance needs . And although she 's moved on to a different job , our insurance needs are still be handled there . <p> As a Dutch reader I am very suprised by the scepticism in earlier replies . <p> I have worked at an insurrance company that has never in its decades of existance paid any sales commission or bonus to their employees . Nor did they give bonusses to their managers that are worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( recent ) tough times from 9/11 up to the financial crisis , I 'd say the approach works fine enough . Just give the employee an honest monthly wage and your customer some good advice . Theyll figure out they 've been screwed sooner or later anyway . <p> i like it on face value , , , but i also feel it raises more issues than it solves , , , firstly , long term relationships with people are built over time , , not with a sign over a wallthe danger here is telling the clients that each one is special , their frienship is valued , , , however the way they are told , is very impersonal , just leaving a note that is directed at anyone and everyone who reads it.when really that same message can be conveyed with a smile , and a courteous approachother issues with that sign , is that it discredits the employees , as their own personal success is restricted , , therefore the truly successful work elsewhere because they because they can earn moreand let 's face it at the risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not paying commissions , all that does is leave the staff feeling slighted , give me a sales agent on the highest commission any day of the week , , then instead of an employee that will get paid a salary regardless of the clients decision , , , true that is removing an incentive for misconduct , , but its also removing the need to go above and beyond what is expectedword of mouth affects future commissions , but a fixed salary , will remain unaffected , whether the effort is 50 , or 100% <p> This is a really interesting post . Oftentimes staffing companies pretend that they can service all industries , but I recommend going with an insurance employment agency as they understand the laws and regulations . <p> I am the CEO and co-owner of a company ( Rho ) that provides clinical research services to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries as well as the federal government . Not quite two years ago , we eliminated commissions for our sales reps . At the time , there were plenty of people with doubts about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Would sales drop ? Could we recruit new sales reps ? - I am happy to say , that almost two years later , we have had a record year in sales ( we 've been in business for 28 years ) accompanied by record profitability . Intangibly , we have seen an increase in collaboration among sales people and greater cooperation between operations personnel and sales people . - Several other people commented here about whether they still receive financial incentives of some kind . In our case that is definitely true . We are a profit sharing company , so our sales reps , along with all of our employees , receive a profit sharing bonus at the end of the year . However , in this case , they are receiving an incentive for making the company as a whole more successful and over a longer period of time , which benefits all of us. - In terms of hiring , this has n't been a significant hurdle . Interestingly , not only have we been able to find qualified candidates in our job searches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better fit for our company culture . <p> Thanks for the conversation about this , and I look forward to the book . <p> Well its great to see there are some companies like this who are working without commission.But to convince people its really a difficult job for the agent.May be there will be some ways by which one can convince the client to change the policy which will be beneficial for him in future . <p> Dan , Thank you for this posting . The comments by Russ , Andrew and Mark make it clear that this is n't only happening at Chris Nordykes agency , but elsewhere . That it ties so well into Chapter 9 of TSIH is an additional bonus . <p> This is a great topic and I thoroughly enjoyed all comments thus far . Thank you Dan for starting the feed and thank you to all have commented . Coming from a former business owner who now works as an employee for the organization in which purchased my business and within the last month finished Drive book , I consider myself to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no commission . I think the largest factor at play here may be company culture and how an organization has developed its principals . To me a company that hires sales people on salary vs commission says that we have a tried and true product/service that we fully believe in and have helped many clients succeed . Commission tends to take focus away from clients after the sale unless there is a process in place to ensure proper attention . Not impossible but not always implemented . We 've all heard the saying " Theres no I in team " ; commission sometimes causes tunnel vision for individuals and working for greater good of the entire team becomes non-existant . Again , great topic and I know there 's valid points both ways . <p> Imperfect system ? Commission is the only source of revenue for an insurance agency . Not only the only source of profit , but also the sole source of revenue , period . Very simply , without commissions to the agency , there would be no insurance agencies . <p> There is a profound and fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit " is . Profit to most businesses is not an extra and unnecessary amount of money a business " takes " from a customer over and above what is " necessary " . Profit is the only means for a business to expand , hire more employees , purchase better equipment , develop new products or services , offer newer or better products or services to the public , maintain existing staff by rewarding work or creating a better workplace . <p> Simplifying the concept helps sometimes . Imagine you start a home based business and make organic soaps to sell at your local farmers market . You enjoy this . Now imagine selling your soap for the exact amount of your materials ( do n't  even factor in your time ) and not a penny more . How long would you be able to continue making your soaps ? <p> Chris , Profit is important , and I think most successful business owners understand that . My " imperfect " comment was in reference to the complex and product-specific commission structure that insurance companies use to drive sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rewards agencies for selling whatever is in the customers best interest , versus giving tropical vacations , cash bonuses and spifs to the agencies that write the most life insurance , or long term care insurance , etc . <p> Its unlikely this will ever change at the carrier level , which leaves agents and brokers to filter the commission/bonus noise and structure their employees pay in a way that is most motivating and customer-focused . <p> Hi terrific website !

Their lives are sad and comical at the same time giving the novel a bittersweet flavor that reminded me of And Then We Came to the End .

This breads a sense of community and care for one another . This environment breads more little actions of care for others and that leads to higher quality of life for all . <p> Just like when Gladwell argues in Tipping Point , that the approach of NYC transit authority removing graffiti from the trains asap .

Both seem to be at the same end of the spectrum the opposite of negative . One , however , has an action imperative . To be optimistic means to look for the good ; to seek out the optimal solution . It implies that we will DO something to improve a situation . <p> By being more conscious ( and emotionally intelligent ) about all the words we choose , in all our communications ( including signs about picking up after your dog ! ) , we are actively creating the world in which we live = <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign had a backdrop of a poorly maintained lawn and what appeared to be a lot of junk and debris .

The second ( positive and pleasant reminder ) sign appears to sit on a neatly mowed lawn with healthy grass and no visible trash . <p> Photographers choice ? Perhaps the signs are simple reflections of the personalities responsible for both the lawn care and the signs in each case ? Perhaps people can be asked to keep a nice lawn nice but have to be forced not to allow mess to pile onto mess ? <p> Interesting enough I was just mentioning something to my friend about a similar sign .

Polite requests , followed by less polite requests , followed eventually by nasty notes ( similar to the first sign ) ultimately got some results . But of course , those who were good citizens in the first place became more and more offended as the anonymous " kitchen police " escalated . All this to say that perhaps kinder , gentler requests have been ignored . <p> While I 'd like to believe dog owners automatically lead their pets to an appropriate place and pick up after them because its the right thing to do , especially if one places oneself in the other persons shoes ( no pun intended ) , I agree that the sign designed to encourage empathy may be more effective as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who led his large dog directly onto a newly planted tree bed in a beautiful NYC neighborhood to curb his dog and looked at me , uttered profanities to me and proceeded to allow his dog to do his business while I watched . <p> In reality , if asking someone nicely in person to be responsible with their pet did n't  work I do n't  believe that a sign will help . <p> In my work over many years on economic development and poverty reduction , I have found that shock tactics and peer pressure are sometimes necessary and important tools to trigger change especially a change in awareness , attitude and behavior . However , a shift to more positive , optimistic and reinforcing messages and approaches is often necessary to sustain the change . <p> The effectiveness of the signs may be a function of social class and location .

No question that these are harder times than we are used to and that the times are not due to our choices . However , we are a versatile and creative people and perhaps having less of what were used to may mean more creative activities ? <p> I think the idea of a 4 day work week would contribute in a positive way to our lives during the recession . Not only would it allow more time to get work done , job-hunt or take on new tasks , but it would cut down on travel costs and spending that takes place while out to work or even school . I wonder how and if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from college however , as there is much worry in that particular arena . <p> Everyone thinks I am nuts , but I think American society really lost something with the repeal of the Blue Laws . Up until then , we had one day a week where you actually had time for your family . Sure , the grocery store was not open , so you shopped on Saturday . Big deal . People can still decide to make one day a week " sacred " for family time , but there is too may things competing for that time these days . 
@@26895575 @595575/ <h> Dan 's Bookshelf <h> Summer reading Part One <p> Now that we 've made it past the Fourth of July , many of you are assembling your summer reading lists . Because I 'm here to serve , let me offer two suggestions books I recently finished and heartily recommend . <p> The first is The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears by Dinaw Mengestu . Its one of the best novels Ive read in a long time . Set in the rapidly gentrifying neighborhood of- Logan Circle- here in Washington , DC , it tells the story of Sepha Stephanos , an Ethiopian immigrant trying to eke out both a living and a life while running a neighborhood convenience store . <p> Much of the novel hinges on Stephanoss relationships with two sets of characters . One set is his new neighbor Judith , who 's white , and her daughter Naomi , who 's bi-racial . Stephanos grows close to both and , yes , complications ensue . The other relationship is with two other African immigrants Ken the Kenyan and Congo Joe , all of whom met years ago when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Stephanoss listless store . <p> This book had special resonance for me as a Washingtonian.Some of my favorite writers - Edward P. Jones , - George Pelecanos- are those who draw back the curtain on the part of D.C. that has nothing to- do with politics , the White House , or Capitol Hill . The people here who park the cars , ring the cash registers , and drive the taxis and who live in zip codes elite journalists and big-money lobbyists never visit are , to my mind , far more interesting and greater sources of drama than the folks whose lives unfold in the Washington Post . <p> However , the book also follows in the broader tradition of immigrant literature . ( Mengestu himself came to this country as a boy ) . It tells the classic tale of an outsider coming to the U.S. , confronting its contradictions , making his way , and ultimately remaking our notions of what it means to be an American . <p> For all those reasons its a gracefully written , very accessible , and not overly long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your summer reading list . <p> I 'll recommend book number two , a work of nonfiction , on Tuesday. - - - -

As in , the ones you walked into the store wearing . I 'm always annoyed at stores that offer no place for you to put your own clothes except on the dirty floor of the changing room or a teeny-tiny purse holder . <p> actually , the most creative part about this , from a sales perspective , is the " possibly " sign combined with the lack of " no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try on you associate with potentially purchasing , just at varying degrees . Pretty smart and subtle . <p> I think there 's a chance that including the NO WAY sign could actually increase sales . There 's a pile of intriguing research in behavioral economics showing that adding a third option can change the dynamics of how people choose . <p> I think a no way one would help . With only possibly and definitely , all the clothes that I might get will go in the same pile as the ones I hated . If there are only 2 options , it is a pass/fail test . If there are 3 , it makes the possibly pile into something I might consider again . <p> Dan , you might be interested in the blogfest we did a couple of years ago , featuring forgotten spaces like dressing rooms .
