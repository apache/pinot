I 'm not talking about the meaning , I 'm talking about the grammar . In other words , how are these two verbs grammatically different ? <p> We should notice that the first verb , broke , has another word after it . The second verb , cried , does not have another word after it . Generally speaking , we can say that all verbs in English can be divided into two groups--those that must have a word ( or words ) after them and words that do not have to have any word after them . <p> This rule is simplified right now , but we will learn more later . For now , let 's just focus on the simple ideas . <p> Let 's look at the two different kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window . <p> In the first sentence , the word that comes after the verb , window , is the object of the verb . We say that window is the object because it receives the action of the verb . All objects of verbs receive the action of the verb . <p> Here are some more examples of transitive verbs with their objects : <p> I sold some books . <p> I took the bus . <p> I bought a radio . <p> I understood her question . <p> I wrote a letter . <p> When a verb has an object that receives the action of the verb , we say that the verb is transitive . Transitive verbs are more common on the TOEFL than intransitive verbs , but many students get confused about intransitive verbs . <p> Let 's look at the other kind of verb now . <h> Intransitive Verbs <p> My father cried . <p> We can see in this sentence that there is no word after cried . In other words , there is no object for the word , so there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think about it--what could we say ? My father cried something . Is there a noun that we could use after cried ? We could probably think of one or two nouns , like tears , or even , good-bye , but normally , we do not use the verb cry with an object . <p> In this case we say that this verb is intransitive because it does not have an object after it . <p> Here are some more examples of intransitive verbs : <p> I slept . <p> I coughed . <p> The glass fell . <p> My cat ran . <p> The sun rose . <p> We should notice that in each case , the subject is doing the action of the verb and nothing receives the action . <h> Common Test Prep Points <p> It is extremely important to be able to understand whether a verb is transitive or intransitive . <p> For many verbs in class , if your teacher thinks that the verb is hard to understand , we will ask something like this : <p> T : Do we cry or do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond something like this : <p> S : Just cry . <p> In this case , we would say that cry is intransitive . <p> BE CAREFUL ! ! <p> One reason that understanding this point is so important is that it is very easy to become confused about whether a verb is transitive or intransitive . Consider the following example : <p> I went to the store yesterday . <p> Is went transitive or intransitive ? <p> Many people , including native speakers , will tell you that went is transitive since we have many words after went . However : <p> To say that went is transitive would be a BIG mistake ! ! <p> So , what are all those other words after went ? Well , first of all , to the store is a prepositional phrase . Second , yesterday is an adverb . <p> One more thing : just to make life easier , instead of saying transitive and intransitive all the time , we will say vi ( since that 's what most dictionaries say ) if the verb is intransitive and vt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) if the verb is transitive . <p> Trust TestMagic : This is extremely important ! ! We will do some exercises on this point a little bit later . <h> Summary of Transitive and Intransitive Verbs <p> There are some important exceptions to these rules and we will talk about them later . However , for now , we have enough information to do some practice . <h> Practice Transitive and Intransitive Verbs <p> This exercise is relatively simple--just decide whether the verb is transitive or intransitive . In this case , write the answer choice that is more common . Finally , you will notice that several words have been repeated . This is because I want you to remember these words since they are the most common on the TOEFL and they cause the most problems for students .

They want to study by themselves , or to do extra work , and they wonder which books or other materials they should use to study . We have collected the most common questions and answers here . <p> There are basically two parts to studying : understanding the test and practicing . <p> The best way to understand the test is to have somebody show you what the test is like , what to look out for , what to study , how the test works , etc . A good teacher with lots of experience teaching can help you do this . However , for various reasons , many students decide to study on their own . For many students , a good book is enough to help them understand the test . For these people , TestMagic offers the following advice . <p> Choosing a good book is really important . A good book will lead you very carefully through every step and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book will not teach you things that will not be on the test . A good book will explain things in a way that is easy to understand and remember . In short , a good book should " feel " like a private coach , like somebody is talking to you . TestMagic is working on a book like this and you can see some parts of it on this web site . <p> The truth about most books on the market is that they are shooting for the " middle market-- " people who do n't need an 800 on the test , people who have slightly above average ability on the test and are looking to raise their scores 100 points or so , people who do n't want to spend too much time studying , maybe a few weeks or so . <p> The next part of test prep is practicing .

Sometimes you might find that there is some part of the test that you do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seen before , for example , the combination of a hard word and a complex grammatical structure might result in an unanswerable question . You need to know this ! The only way to practice is to use official materials--no company can produce questions like those that ETS produces . Believe TestMagic--it is extremely difficult to make good test questions . Why ? Because ETS spends millions of dollars on making their test questions perfect . Believe us--we make test questions also and it is extremely difficult to make questions just like those on the real GMAT . In short , the best practice materials are those released by ETS . <p> However , there is one drawback to the questions released by ETS . When ETS releases the questions , that means that they can almost never use those questions again . That means that you will almost never see those questions again . Part of the reason for this is that ETS evolves . One year they use certain kinds of questions or topics , the next year they do not . So , if you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , you might very well get an outdated idea of what your test will be like . <h> Short answer : Kaplan . <p> Bad news , folks . We have looked all over the place for the hard problems that you will get on the GMAT if you are scoring high on the test . We have checked all the books , including the ones that are specifically for the math sections of the GMAT and GRE . No dice . Many of our students can get 800s on the math sections and say the same thing--most of the problems in the practice books are just too easy . However , many students find that Kaplan offers the hardest math questions , and they feel satisfied using their products , especially the CD-ROM . <p> Our advice ? Try various math books and do the hardest questions in all the books . You might want to try some older GMAT books , too , if you can find them .

In other words , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essay is going to be about . <p> The person who writes an essay introductoin like this is probably thinking that the reader already knows the essay prompt ( the " question " or topic of the essay ) and does n't think that she needs to restate the topic . <p> For the TOEFL essay , it is most certainly true that the reader of your essay does know what the essay prompt is , but the TOEFL test taker must still introduce the topic of the essay in the introduction . <p> The rule of thumb in English ( our English teachers tell us this over and over ) is that we should write the essay as if the reader had no previous knowledge of the topic we are writing about . This means that you should be sure to restate the essay prompt ( it 's best to paraphrase the prompt , not copy it word for word ) and to explain the things in the essay that the average reader would not know about . <p> If you really do not know how to restate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 4.0 or maybe 5.0 , you could simply copy part of the prompt in your introduction . <p> Let 's look at the simplest way to do this . <p> Imagine that our TOEFL essay topic is something like " do you agree or disagree that learning about the past is not important ? " <p> In a perfect world , you would paraphrase ( restate in your own words ) the essay prompt when you wrote your introduction , something like this : <p> Although many believe that we should live in the present , I strongly believe that the past holds valuable lessons for everybody to learn . <p> First , ... <p> However , for some people , doing this may be difficult , especially if they are still learning English .

" <p> a source of <p> 175 . <p> many communications companies are now able to offer radio and television broadcasts over the Internet . <p> Advanced technology has enabled <p> Magic explanation : This answer choice is wrong for two reasons . First , " enabled " needs an object . Second , even if we have an object for " enabled , " we would end up with two complete sentences with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a big no-no and is a very common mistake . <p> Introducing advanced technology and <p> Magic explanation : This answer choice is wrong because we need another noun to be parallel with " technology . " If we had another noun , for example " new methods of storing data , " then this answer choice would be correct . <p> Because the introduction of advanced technology <p> Magic explanation : This answer choice is wrong because we need a subordinate verb after the subordinating conjunction " because . " <p> With the introduction of advanced technology <p> Level of Difficulty : Medium <p> Magic explanation : First , we should notice that we have a complete main sentence here and that nothing is missing from the sentence as it is written . When nothing is missing from the sentence , we should add something that is both optional and complete . This answer choice is the only one that meets these criteria--it is a prepositional phrase , and prepositional phrases are almost always optional in the sentence . <p> 176 . <p> While it is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night sky . <p> While it a planet mistaken <p> Correction : mistaken for <p> Level of Difficulty : Medium <p> Magic explanation : The correct idiom to use here is " to mistake x for y " ( in the active voice ) , or " x is mistaken for y " ( in the passive voice ) . <p> the night <p> 177 . <p> its area of defense , a fort should be built on an elevation and with some sort of natural feature of the landscape to obstruct direct access to the fort . <p> To better protect <p> Level of Difficulty : Hard <p> Magic explanation : We should use the infinitive of purpose here to explain how or why something is done . <p> Protecting better <p> Magic explanation : If you missed this question , you probably chose this answer . We can not choose this answer choice because " protecting " modifies " fort " in this sentence either as an adjective phrase or an adverbial phrase ( we have some ambiguity in this construction ) . Since the main sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should use the infinitive of purpose , not the participial form . <p> For the better of <p> Magic explanation : The easiest way to explain this one is simply to point out that " better " can not be a noun . <p> It is better for <p> Magic explanation : Again , this answer choice would give us two main clauses with no conjunction between them . <p> 178 . <p> In 2000 William Jefferson Clinton entered his last year officeas President of the United States . <p> In 2000 entered office <p> Correction : of office <p> Level of Difficulty : Medium <p> Magic explanation : The verb " entered " can have only one object . In this case , the object of " entered " is " year , " leaving us with an extra noun , " office .

In other words , we would have to have a complete subordinate clause , something like this : because the Industrial Revolution DID something . <p> 180 . <p> Einstein was able to come up with a theory that has yet to be disproved . <p> Other scientists <p> Magic explanation : This answer choice would give us a double subject , a big no-no on the TOEFL . <p> Similar to other scientists <p> Level of Difficulty : Medium <p> Magic explanation : This is a typical TOEFL question .

@@108557451 @3957451/ <h> ANSWERS to TOEFL Structure : #021-030 <h> All explanations were written by Erin Billy , specifically for TestMagic students . <p> Born Marguerite Johnson in 1928 , author and poet Maya Angelou has received awards numerous for her works , including Grammy Awards in 1994 and 1996 . <p> Born author and poet awards numerous <p> Level of Difficulty : Easy <p> Correction : numerous awards <p> Magic Explanation : This one is simple to explain--we need the adjective before the noun . This one is tricky because in some languages the adjective comes after the noun . In this case , numerous is an adjective and awards is a noun . A simple example of this rule is the phrase little house . <p> Magic Explanation : In English , when an adverb modifies an adjective , the adverb must come before the adjective . A simple example of this rule is the phrase very delicious . In this case , relatively is an adverb , and it modifies the adjective recent . <p> in <p> 023 . <p> One of smallest particles thought to exist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming a hadron . <p> what was the what the those of thethe <p> Level of Difficulty : Medium <p> Magic Explanation : This sentence already has a main subject and main verb , so we do n't need to look at that part of the sentence . We need only look at the first part : <p> One of smallest particles thought to exist <p> In this case , we are only missing the determiner the ; we can not add anything else . We can see a simple example of this pattern in the phrase One of the best ways ... <p> 024 . <p> The first years of one 's education are thought to provide the basic of one 's ability to learn in later years . <p> years <p> Some people think years is wrong because they learn that the word first must modify a singular noun .

When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . to providebasic <p> Level of Difficulty : Medium <p> Correction : basis <p> Magic Explanation : Here , we need a noun , basis . basic is an adjective , so it is wrong . This one is tricky because in some languages ( like Portuguese ) the word for the noun basis is very similar to the English adjective basic . <p> to learn <p> 025 . <p> Most wood will float in water , but if it is , it will sink . <p> dense enough <p> Level of Difficulty : Medium <p> Magic Explanation : The general rule is : <p> adjective + enough <p> or <p> enough + noun <p> In this case , dense is an adjective . <p> so dense that enough dense density <p> 026 . <p> Nationwide elections are held in the United States every four years , primarily choosing public officials for the offices of president and vice-president . <p> held primarilychoosing <p> Level of Difficulty : Difficult <p> Correction : to choose <p> Magic Explanation : In this case , we need to use the infinitive to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this pattern would be the sentence : Music is played in stores to make people happy . <p> offices <p> 027 . <p> are contained in DNA , the complex chemical mixture that determines the hereditary characteristics of an organism . <p> The genes <p> Level of Difficulty : Medium <p> Magic Explanation : We are missing a main subject in this sentence , nothing more . The second part of the sentence , the complex chemical mixture ... is a reduced adjective clause that modifies DNA . <p> The genes that <p> If we choose this answer , we have no main verb . Although the genes <p> If we choose this answer , we have no main verb .

They 're really not as bad as they sound . I remember hearing these words in junior high school and high school and not really understanding what they mean . <p> But some of these concepts are important for GMAT sentence correction and for the TOEFL . <p> First , look at some examples , and see if you can tell the difference already : <p> My sister broke the glass . ( broke is a transitive verb ) <p> My father cried . ( cried is an intransitive verb ) <p> My sister is a doctor . ( is is a linking verb ) <p> Can you figure out the difference between the verbs ( broke , cried , is ) in the above sentences ? I 'm not talking about the meaning , I 'm talking about the grammar . In other words , how are these three verbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verb , broke , has another word after it ( glass ) . The second verb , cried , does not have another word after it . So in one sense , we can say that all verbs in English can be divided into two groups -- those that must have a word ( or words ) after them and words that do not have to have any word after them . <p> The third verb , is , has a noun ( doctor ) after it , but in its grammatical function , it 's different from the noun ( glass ) that comes after broke . Think about it -- in the first sentence , we are saying that my sister broke something , and that thing was the glass . So , glass is receiving the action of broke . In the third sentence , we are saying that my sister is a doctor -- doctor is not receving any action . In fact , doctor and sister are the same thing -- we are actually identifying sister with the word doctor . And the verb is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two nouns ( sister and doctor ) . Verbs that function in this way are called linking verbs . <p> These rules are a bit simplified right now , but we will learn more later . For now , let 's just focus on the simple ideas . And if all this stuff already makes sense to you , you 're in good shape . <p> Let 's look at the three different kinds of verbs in a bit more detail .

@@108557481 @3957481/ <p> I have always considered that general knowledge is the best choice for me and universal learning the perfect means to support the phrase " knowledge for the sake of knowledge itself " . But if I have to choose between the above-mentioned subjects I would definately concentrate on art and literature which I consider fit better my personality . Art and literature have a lot in common in that they require a different , quite often universal approach to the world around us.They concenterate not so much on the black and white aspects of living but on the colourful side of life ; on tints rather than brightness.Maths and science study the form , the physical shape and its laws , but it is art and literature that fulfill this form with that ultimate meaning that only the human soul can sense . And it is the human soul that has so many faces , so many aspects and interpretations to all things.That is why I appreciate the subjectivity of art and literature-the numerous realities they impose are closer to our inner world than the strict powers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to critisize , to accept the form of art but not obey them .

Having in mind the above , I definately support art and literature as a better means for achieving universal knowledge.What is more , while maths and science closely deal with laws , they can not in any way teach us about that " thin red line " separating bad and evil , while art and literature I strongly believe can .

Part of the reason for this is that the current format of the TOEFL , the CBT , has started to put lots of really , really hard listening stuff on it , much harder than the listening on the paper test . <p> Almost all of the students at TestMagic say the same thing : The long talks on the listening part are the hardest part of the TOEFL . <p> We will learn about the Listening Section , why it is so hard , and how we can raise our scores quickly on this part of the test . We will even learn about why this part of the test is not fair , and what TOEFL should do in the future . <p> How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to improve one 's listening is to live in a country in which English is spoken . <p> Ah ! ! This is by far the most common question we hear at TestMagic . <p> The truth is that for many people , the Listening Section is the hardest part of the test to improve on quickly . We all like to study grammar because there are rules that we can memorize , reading , especially on the TOEFL , is often a matter of learning more vocabulary , but listening is a different story . <p> Of course , the best way to improve one 's listening is to practice over time . Most people find that watching television shows or movies in English or listening to songs in English are great ways to improve . If you are fortunate enough to have friends who are native speakers of English , or if you live in a country in which the predominant language is English , then you also have a great advantage . <p> Use TOEFL listening books or listen to American news reports <p> Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do , right ? For example , if you can not live in Australia or Canada , or even come to TestMagic in San Francisco to study . There are many listening books available . I have seen some pretty good ones from Japan and Deborah Phillips ( the author of the Longman series ) always does a good job with her TOEFL material . However , all of the books that I have seen are a little bit easier than the real TOEFL . My students notice it and tell me . If you want something that 's harder than the real TOEFL , you should watch American documentaries or news programs , such as CNN and 60 Minutes . If you are in the United States , you could listen to NPR , or National Public Radio . NPR is my favorite--I listen to it every day ! You can listen to its reports at its web site . Many of its reports are about the same length as those on the TOEFL , and , at least to me , these reports are very interesting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some of my hardest working and most successful students have used is this : They listen to a TOEFL tape and transcribe ( write down everything said on the tape ) it . Then , they compare what they wrote with the script in the back of the book ( most official TOEFL books come with scripts ) . This takes a long , long time , it could take several hours just for one test , but it is a great method because when you compare , you can see the kinds of mistakes that you are making . For example , you might not hear words that are run together , you might miss some important words , or you might misunderstand some very important words . One of my long-term students , for example , thought one of the speakers in the talk was going to a " coffee shop , " but when she read the script , she realized it was actually a " copy shop .

However , most people now know that the CBT TOEFL is not so easy . The short conversations , the ones that had a lot of idioms and other kinds of questions , appear less frequently on the computer TOEFL than they do on the paper test . On the computer TOEFL , we will have a lot more long talks , the " lectures , " which are supposed to simulate what we would hear during a lecture in a class in an American university . These are several minutes long and are very hard for many people to understand . Worse , we are not allowed to take notes while we are listening . Almost everybody agrees : The lectures are the hardest part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test or a memory test ? ? <p> Furthermore , since the talks are very long , it 's sometimes hard to remember what was said in the beginning . Hey , even I have a hard time remembering , and I 'm a native speaker ! If you read enough teaching journals , you will realize that many teachers criticize the TOEFL , saying that it 's more of a memory test than it is a listening test . TOEFL is aware of this , of course , and claims that a person with an average memory will do well on the test . I disagree . I think too much information is presented in a short time , and most people can not remember all of the information that might be tested . <p> No notetaking allowed . <p> The worst part is that we can not take notes while we are listening . I think this is ridiculous . The TOEFL is supposed to measure our ability to do well with English in American colleges , and , as we all know , in all American colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test is not really measuring how well we will do in school , it 's measuring how well we 'll do without a pencil . <p> How many questions are there on the real test ?

( this means that the dog did the action of smelling to the food ) <p> The dog smells nice . ( this means that the dog has a nice smell ) <p> In the first sentence , the verb smell has an intransitive meaning -- to give off a bad odor .

@@108557502 @3957502/ <p> I fully agree with the claim that there is no correlation between success and luck . Moreover , I understand success to refer to ones ability to achieve the predominant part of his goals in his lifetime , which in turn leads to a correlation between success and income since the accomplishment of such a natural goal as to provide a good future for your loved ones demands the means . What is the simplest and most lawful way to earn enough to consider yourself a successful person ? To receive a good education and to find a good job . Both receiving an education and making a career presuppose ones readiness to work hard , and success without hard work is simply not possible for the vast majority of the world 's population .

In my lifetime , I have never met a person who could graduate from a college without working hard . <p> Secondly , it is impossible to make a career if one is indolent and lacking knowledge , at least in developed countries . Luck plays no role in achieving this success . Even if someone was unbelievably lucky enough to become a manager not being qualified enough , he will be asked to resign in the near future because of his inability due to lack of knowledge and experience to make right decisions . For instance , I used to work for a very small company owned by a friend . This company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankruptcy was wrong strategies and decisions made by the owner .

And his chances to earn that money will remarkably increase if he could graduate from a college and make a career . All of these things are simply not possible without hard work .

@@108557508 @3957508/ <p> There 's an old " rule " in English that says that infinitives should never be separated--the two parts of an infinitive should always be kept together . I ( Erin Billy ) use the word rule in quotes because this admonition is pretty much now considered outdated and overly proscriptive by most people who study and enjoy the English language and grammar , at least that used in the United States . <p> But more on that in a minute . First , it is important to understand what an infinitive is . Be sure to visit this page if you 're not sure what an infinitive is : <h> Examples of split infinitives <p> Notice how the to part of the infinitive is separated from the base form of the verb by another word .

In other words , nothing comes between the to and the base form . <p> Traditional grammar rules and the most formal grammar rules require that we not split infinitives ; however , more modern and less formal American English grammar permits split infinitives when they sound better . <h> Why you need to learn about split infinitives for the GMAT , SAT , and TOEFL tests <p> Split infinitives occasionally show up on the GMAT , SAT , and TOEFL tests . Many test takers may have learned at some point that split infinitives are always wrong , and may therefore overlook an answer that will be considered correct on the particular test . So , it is important to know that a correct answer on these tests may include a split infinitive . <h> Discussion of split infinitives <p> The debate over whether split infinitives should be allowed in English is well documented and has been discussed ad nauseam . <p> My intention here is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rather to simply report the trends on the various ETS tests . ETS is the current creator of the content of the GMAT , SAT , and TOEFL tests and ultimately decides what is acceptable on the tests it creates . In other words , they decide whether or not you get that extra point on your admissions test . Their ruling could mean the difference between a 680 and 700 on the GMAT or a 1390 and 1400 on the SAT ! <p> In general , it is acceptable to split an infinitive when it sounds okay to do so . <p> I know that this explanation is not very satisfying for some people ( particularly those who love grammar rules ) , but without resorting to exceedingly difficult or needlessly complicated explanations that only a linguist could enjoy or understand , this is probably the best explanation of when it is acceptable to split an infinitive . <p> The classic example of an infinitive that sounds best when split , and sounds awkward when it is not split , comes from the voice-over heard during the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise . Its five-year mission--to boldly go where no man has gone before . <p> ( Note that the somewhat sexist use of the word man was changed to one in the later iterations of the classic series . ) <p> If we were to try to keep the infinitive together , we 'd end up with something like this : <p> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise . Its five-year mission--to go boldly where no man has gone before . <p> This construction clearly lacks the nice fluid feel of the original , although it would probably be the second-best way to phrase the sentence . <p> *These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise . Its five-year mission--boldly to go where no man has gone before. * <p> This one just sounds terrible , and would n't be acceptable in Standard American English . <p> So in this example , we really have no choice but to split the infinitive . <p> Now here 's an example of when not to split an infinitive : <p> *TestMagic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center without identification. * <p> Although many native speakers of English would make such an utterance , the construction is frowned upon by most grammarians , perhaps only because the sentence could be corrected so easily : <p> TestMagic clearly told Lucise not to go to the GMAT test center without identification .

And during your test , you will receive a mix of all three . <p> When you start the test , the computer test 's algorithm will give you one or two medium-difficulty questions . If you get these right , the computer will start giving you harder questions , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the computer will " adapt , " and give you easier questions . <p> An analogy for adaptive testing would be lifting weights at the gym . Imagine you 're working out for the first time with a trainer who does n't know your level--she might give you a 10-kilo weight to lift . If that 's too heavy , she 'll give you a lighter one ; if it 's too light , she 'll give you a heavier one . As your trainer continues to work out with you , she learns your ability , and adjusts your workout accordingly . Your test is just the same--as you answer questions , the computer " learns " your level and gives you questions that it decides are at your level . <p> This approach is designed to make the adaptive test shorter and more accurate than the paper test ( which must include a full range of easy , medium , and difficult questions ) , since the computer does n't waste time by giving you questions that are either above or below your level . <p> A side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer questions are harder than the questions on the paper test .

Margaret answered the first ten correctly , but missed the last ten ; Garys performance was the other way around--he missed the first ten , but got the last ten correct .

Some of the better known indoor games are board games like chess , while the more popular outdoor games include many sports like soccer , badminton , and tennis . <p> I feel that games play an essential role in the development of a healthy human being . An example of an indoor game which I think is excellent is chess . Chess is a game enjoyed by many adults today because of the challenge it presents one 's mind in his " intelligence ' to defeat his opponent .

While many adults today are finding it difficult to include games in their leisure , it is important to realize the benefits that are accompanied by activities such as playing games .

@@108557521 @3957521/ <p> The TOEFL is a test that shows your level of English . Basically , the university wants to know that you know enough English to understand your courses and do well in school . Almost every university in the United States requires a certain TOEFL score . For example , if you want to go to a great school , like Harvard or Stanford , you need a really TOEFL high score , like 600 . But , if you do n't care about the school , you can go to an easier school . Many of these schools only require a TOEFL score of about 450 . <p> Your TOEFL score is valid for only two years . In other words , two years after you take your TOEFL , your score will be deleted from the official TOEFL database and they will not send you another report of your score . If you still have a copy of your original score , you can ask the university whether they will accept it , but most universities will not accept a copy from you ; they require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the paper TOEFL is 677 . The highest score on the computer TOEFL is 300 . Most people now still use the paper TOEFL scores , even though most students take the computer TOEFL . <p> The score that you need depends on the university that you want to go to ; you will need to contact the university to find out . In general , however , the score requirements range from 133 to 250 ( CBT scoring ) or 450 to 600 ( paper scoring ) . <p> Some universities will tell you that they do n't have a minimum requirement ; usually these universities are the best ones , like Stanford or Harvard . However , even though they do n't have a " requirement , " most of the people who go to these universities have TOEFL scores from 267 to 300 .

In general , better universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores . Some schools require no TOEFL score , but , be careful ! These schools are not good schools ! <p> After you take your test , you will get a range of your score . For example , you might see something like this : 207-270 . Your final score depends on your essay score . Each point on the essay will raise your final score about ten points . So , for example , if you get a 1.0 on your essay , your final score would be 217 . Or , if you get a 5.0 on your essay , your final score would be about 260 . <p> This is usually the first question that people ask . It is extremely difficult to say--each person is different . Some people learn languages very quickly , others need more time . Learning a new language is very similar to learning any other skill , like ballet dancing or painting--some people learn very quickly because they have a natural ability in that area , others need more time . <p> However , in general , most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . <p> The TOEFL is getting harder and harder all the time .

For example , if you are studying for the TOEFL , you should read Newsweek or Time instead of reading Batman comic books ! Similarly , watching documentaries about wildlife or space is much more helpful than seeing Hollywood action movies . <p> It costs about US $110 to take the computerized TOEFL .

This is one reason to type our essays instead of handwriting them . <p> Most people agree : the paper TOEFL is much easier than the CBT TOEFL . For example , the listening on the CBT TOEFL is much harder than the listening on the paper TOEFL and the CBT TOEFL has an essay that you have to write . <p> The Institutional TOEFL is the TOEFL that is given by a place so that they can measure the English level of the people who take the test .

You will have to ask the school that you want to attend to find out whether they will accept the paper TOEFL or not . If schools accept the paper TOEFL , you will have to find a place to take the paper TOEFL . The paper TOEFL is called the " institutional TOEFL " in the United States because it is not accepted at every place in the world . <p> The easy answer is this : you should type your TOEFL essay if you can !

@@108557532 @3957532/ <p> Every man needs a friend , comrade , in one word a person who can understand and help to decide many difficult situations , in which every of us can appear . But it is n't the question , the question is what is better ! To say the truth it is not so simple a question , because it depends of a person . For example I am a social-animal and I get depressed if I stay alone for two long , especially on weekend , but my pal is a loner , he does n't  like a noisy crowd , he prefers not to socialize , but to stay alone , read , watch TV . There are many kinds of people and sometimes it is very difficult to make friends because some people are afraid of being disappointed after having some incidents like treachery , deception . These people stop simply to believe people , they stop even to believe in friendship . For example a friend of mine was so disappointed of her close friend that she fall in despair and it was very difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We often make a mistake calling all t ! he people that we know the friends , because it is n't easy to find a person who will be your friend for ever .

I think that before to become a friend you must prove that you can be a real friend and always help to your friend out . I am always for the friendship between everybody , because it will make our world better and I advise to follow a very wise commandment : love your neighbor in the same way as you love yourself .

@@108557540 @3957540/ <h> Subscribe <h> Relative pronouns <p> A relative pronoun is a word that functions both as a conjunction and as a pronoun , such as that or which . Because it functions as a conjunction , it can join a main clause and a subordinate clause ; because it functions as a pronoun , it also functions as one of the nouns needed in the subordinate clause . It is important to note that some people refer to clauses that are " marked " with a relative pronoun not as subordinate clauses but as relative clauses . Because most of the grammar that we deal with on TestMagic is relatively simple ( at least compared with some other grammar that does not come up in standardized tests ) , we do not really need to make a differentiation between subordinate clauses and relative clauses . <p> Let 's look at an example to make things clear : <p> I can see the car that is next to you . <p> This sentence has two clauses--a main clause ( I can see the car ) and a subordinate clause ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word that is the conjunction needed to join the main clause and the subordinate clause .

Look at the following sentence : <p> I know that you are smart . <p> Notice that after the word that , there is a full sentence and therefore no noun is missing . In this case , the word that functions only as a conjunction , not as a pronoun.

In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make in a year , not in one month . <p> 5 . <p> part-time <p> part-time means we do not work full-time . Usually , full-time means something like 35 to 40 hours per week .

Beside clean drinkable water and fresh air , an ideal community should be quiet . If the factory can not maintain this situation to the community , it will not last long . A factory that is too noisy or pollutes too much will eventually be relocated to a new area . <p> On the other hand , a factory could bring a lot of benefits to the community .

The town 's residents can take a public bus to go shopping or go to work . As a result , air pollution and fuel consumption might be reduced . <p> Most important , a factory 's establishment will bring up a lot of employment opportunities for the community . A factory need experts from various fields . The residents can take just a few minutes to go to the factory to work . So , the local residents can get great benefits from this factory . <p> Generally speaking , I agree with the plan to build a factory near my community . If the factory can be managed successfully , the factory and local residents can have mutual benefit .

As the human brain developed , so has progress been achieved , in almost all fields known to man . The cultural progress over the ages , have made humans better and made this world , a better place to live in . Similarly , scientific progress has been effective in eradicating diseases , providing better food crops , facilitating transportation etc .

Here progress is being applied for the society 's good . <p> This paragraph seems like a topic sentence and should be included in another paragraph . <p> The products from the same progress in the various fields , when in wrong hands , wreak havoc in the same society that they are supposed to make better . <p> Again , this paragraph is a topic sentence and might better be included with the following paragraph . <p> Sophisticated arms &amp; explosives in the hands of terrorists &amp; children , science of human cloning in the hands of scientists , crop control technologies in the hands of corporations etc. , are some of the examples of how progress can go wrong . Think of how much better the world would be , without nuclear and biological weapons , without mutated food grains et al . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maimed for life , if there had been no land mines ? After witnessing the destructive use the Dynamite could be put to , Alfred Nobel himself repented his own creation of Dynamite so much that he set up the Nobel prize , to be awarded to people who work for the betterment of the human society . <p> The ideas of this paragraph are good , but they could be better organized for smoother transitions . The example of the invention of dynamite is a good example , but the writer should explain how dynamite was considered progress in the first place . <p> Therefore , it is my strong contention that progress is only good when it is put to the right use , for the betterment and upliftment of the individual and the society , on a whole . Progress put to any ulterior uses should be outrightly condemned . <p> There are some language errors here , specifically the words upliftment and outrightly .

@@108557569 @3957569/ <h> What would you do if you had some free land ? <p> The world is becoming increasingly smaller and smaller . The worlds population is now at six billion . The worlds cities are getting larger and larger . At least two cities , Mexico City and Sao Paulo have almost 30 million inhabitants . In this context , one could say that a gift of land is the greatest gift of all . Land is perhaps the most permanent thing in the world . Unlike diamonds , which really have little value in and of themselves , land actually has great value . Unlike televisions and cars , land can not be destroyedif you remove land , there is still more land under it . In this context , I will discuss what I would do were I given some land as a gift . It will be necessary , however , to discuss four things first : First , it is necessary to establish the size of the land . Second , we need to know where the land is . Third , the topography of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the location is fundamental . <p> For the purposes of this essay , I will assume that I have received a rather large parcel of land ( it is a gift , right ? ! ) in a temperate climate with four seasons . I will assume that the land is fairly flat . Most importantly , I will assume that this land is mine and that I have control over the land , i.e. , that no other government controls the land . Having grown up in a rather poor family , I think I would be quite excited about receiving some land . I have never owned anything of any great value and to own some land would be a wonderful thing for me . For a long time , it has been a dream of mine to be able to build a beautiful house for my mother . My mother is still living in poverty and it saddens me to think of her living in that situation . She often does not have enough money to use the heat in the wintertime and can not afford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give her the gift of a house and a happy place to live for the rest of her life . Since we lived in a country with very cold winters , my family often felt very cold . I would love to bring my mother to a warm place to spend the rest of her days . <p> However , I would not devote all of the land to houses for my family . I would use most of the land to develop a business . In my case , doing this would be very important since I grew up poor . I would need to ensure that I would have a source of income and a way to sustain the activities on the land . An efficient way to do this would be to develop the land in some way suitable to the land . In this case , I would use the land to develop a language and confidence training camp . It has long been my dream to build a perfect language learning centera place where people could go to learn a language , to immerse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have fun while doing so . In conclusion , I would like to make one more point . I must admit that I feel somewhat guilty about the idea of accepting such a gift of land . There is a part of me that is somewhat idealistic and would like to think that the world is a beautiful place and that all humans should live together peacefully . From this viewpoint , I would say that no one can own land . As an American Indian once said , " Own the land ? You might as well own the air or the sky ! " However , this idea is inconsistent with the world today . Being more realistic , I would do what I detailed above .

To raise her score , the author should develop the third paragraph and the conclusion . <p> It can not be doubted that our eating style has encountered a revolutionary change in the last few decades . It is the change in the type of food that has had the greatest influence . Not only have the recipes of certain food types have been altered , but also absolutely new ones have been created .

It can not be neglected that modern cooking facilities play a dramatic role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a spoiler of our lives . Their argument focuses on two main points . First , many newly emerged types of food have not the essence of a " complete meal " as defined by nutritionists . To add to the problem , these food types are often served alone . In fact , there are many medical reports warning people from depending upon such fast meals in their food . Other reports indicate a high potential of malnutrition among those who are " addicted " to the common duet of burgers and cola . <p> Second , the advantage of gathering family members around a meal at home is lost . Fast prepared food types are usually eaten outside home . With the absence of regular family meetings , relationships are likely to be weaker . <p> Others think that fast prepared food types do improve our style of life . This opinion comes especially from busy people , working wives , and younger people . They believe that we have many things in life more important than eating . Time spent on food preparation is considered wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of their families ' souls not just stomachs . Family relationships will get stronger . Business men and women will have more time to concentrate on their business without worrying about food arrangements .

Otherwise , the time saved in food preparation can lead to longer times of headache or even of staying in hospitals suffering from malnutrition .

@@108557574 @3957574/ <h> Subscribe <h> Solution to GMAT Sentence Correction Question #001 <p> First , here is the question : <h> Answer and explantion <p> A : A is the best answer . <p> I ( Erin Billy ) did a bit of research on this one to make sure that I was creating something that could appear on the GMAT in the future . I hope you find the question and this explanation helpful . The primary grammar focus here is actually a simple one--the use of the " idiom " with a view to . We say with a view to when we are talking about a goal . For example , I could say I bought a dictionary with a view to improving my vocabulary . Notice that we should not say *I bought a dictionary with a view to improve my vocabulary . <p> This idiom requires the use of a noun ( for example , improving , which is a gerund , which is one kind of noun ) after the prepositionto , so any correct answer will have some sort of a noun as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiom with a view to . In the question at hand , the noun is separating , which is also a gerund . With this grammar point in mind , we must choose A. Remember , every credited ( i.e. , correct ) GMAT sentence correction response ( i.e. , answer ) will contain no grammar mistakes . If you missed this question , it 's quite likely that you had n't heard of this idiom before . GMAT sometimes uses uncommon idioms on the test , so the most common lists that you will find will probably not cover all the idioms you could see on the GMAT . <p> I also made a point of using an idiom that ended in the preposition to because people often miss these questions when to needs to be followed by the gerund rather than the bare infinitive . For example , the idiom commit X to Y becomes much more confusing in passive voice : I am commited to helping you . Is this right ? Or is it *I am commited to help you ? This is a very common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the former is " more grammatical , " as GMAT might say . <p> I should also point out that this question , the way I 've written it , is a bit unusual . Usually on the GMAT the credited response does not contain the only version of the correct language . In other words , this question is unusual in that the only place that the correct grammar appears ( with a view to separating ... ) is in the credited response . This typically occurs only in questions that test lesser-known grammar points . I believe that this idiom is not terribly common , which is why I chose to construct the question this way . <p> Let 's take a look at a few others to see why they should not be credited responses . <p> B : Uncredited . Do n't change the intended meaning of A ! This is an important difference in meaning between with a view to ( this talks about a goal ) and ( this talks about how something is done ) . Choosing B would change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . This answer choice also uses separating X from Y ( which implies that the two things are already mixed together and one needs to be removed from the other ) instead of the original intended meaning separating X and Y ( which does not necessarily mean that the two are already somehow mixed ) . This is a somewhat minor point , and I 'm not sure that GMAT would base an entire answer on this grammar point alone , but it can be used as a backup reason to eliminate B. The other answer choices that contain separating X from Y should also be uncredited . <p> C : Uncredited . See the explanation above about why the bare infinitive separate is not credited . <p> D : Uncredited . Again , see the explanation above about the difference between separating X from Y and separating X and Y. There is really nothing else wrong with C , and it would be a fine answer but for this one little problem . I considered creating some pronoun confusion here , but I thought that some may already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may remember is irregular and therefore may become confused about whether it 's singular or plural ( it 's singular ) . I thought that that was enough of a challenge for this answer choice , and I wanted to make this answer choice very attractive . So , they unambiguously refers to web pages , the only plural noun before they . <p> E : Uncredited . This is unnecessarily wordy ; the combination of PREPOSITION ( because of ) + NOUN ( the need ) + VERBAL ( to separate ) is usually wrong on the GMAT . See above for the same problem with separate from/and . <p> Red herrings : GMAT often throws in variances in language that are n't important to choosing the correct answer . I recall using two red herrings here . First , the difference between help something do something and help someone to do something . They mean the same and in this question , either would be acceptable . Second , a web page and web pages--again , either is fine in this question .

An absolute phrase is a modifier ( quite often a participle ) , or a modifier and a few other words , that attaches to a sentence or a noun , with no conjunction . An absolute phrase can not contain a finite verb . <p> Absolute phrases usually consist of a noun and a modifier that modifies this noun , NOT another noun in the sentence . <p> Absolute phrases are optional in sentences , i.e. , they can be removed without damaging the grammatical integrity of the sentence . Since absolute phrases are optional in the sentence , they are often set off from the sentence with commas or , less often , with dashes . We normally explain absolute phrases by saying that they modify entire sentences , rather than one word . This is an important concept , since many similar phrases that we work with modify other words .

Although science and math seems to have more tangible effect on satisfying our needs related to body than art and literature . Art and literature still play the main role in satisfying needs related to our souls . Life without literature and art will be very boring and this will have also its bad effect on people 's productivity in fields like science and math . Also , many inventions or scientific acheivments were only stimulated by an idea mentioned in a novel or presented in a painting or drawing .

That 's because these are the questions that TestMagic students actually asked in class for that particular question . <h> New Word <h> Explanations <p> 1 . <p> subsidized <p> We use this word when we want to say that the price of something is not the " true " price--that somebody else , like the government , is paying part of the cost so that the person does not have to pay so much money . For example , it is very common for the government to subsidize the cost of college education in the United States . <p> In this case , this word means that the student does not pay the full cost of the housing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government or the university in the United States . <p> 2 . <p> graduatestudents <p> Graduatestudents are students who have finished their undergraduate degrees and are continuing their educations either as Master 's candidates or Ph.D . candidates . Sometimes students are confused by these words because in some other countries , these terms are different . For example , in Portuguese , we say a " post-graduate student . " <p> In other words : <p> a US undergraduatestudent = a graduate students elsewhere <p> a US graduatestudent = a post-graduate student elsewhere <p> 3 . <p> qualify <p> If we qualify for something , then we meet the requirements for something . For example , in order to receive a scholarship , I might have to show that I have a 3.5 or better GPA and that I do not receive support from my parents . If those two things are true about me , then I say that I qualify . <p> 4 . <p> annualincome <p> Remember , annual means yearly and income refers to the money you earn or receive . In the US , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , not in one month . <p> 5 . <p> part-time <p> part-time means we do not work full-time . Usually , full-time means something like 35 to 40 hours per week . Part-time is something like less than 35 hours per week . <p> 6 . <p> researchassistant ( RA ) <p> A researchassistant is someone who helps a professor do some research . These people usually receive a small stipend ( like a salary ) for their work , but it 's not usually very much . <p> 7 . <p> that'snoproblem ! <p> We can say this when we easily meet some requirements . <p> 8 . <p> Notnecessarily . <p> We use this expression a lot . This means that " it might not be true .

B <p> " I think my wife and I may qualify , since she 's still in graduate school " <p> The woman tells the man that only married graduate students can live in the low-cost housing .

@@108557599 @3957599/ <p> This essay has nice organization and good development . The author has some fairly deep ideas about this topic and conveys them well . <p> Obviously , the first teachers we have in our lives in most cases are our parents . They teach us to walk , to speak , and to have good manners before we reach " the real world . " More than even the professional teachers that we have in school , parents are generally the most involved in the development and education of children . <p> Almost for sure our parents are the best teachers at the beginning of our lives , which actually corresponds to the parents ' role in nature . Parents are most committed and involved in teaching their children ; they have a kind of instinct to sacrifice a part of themselves for the betterment of their children . They love us and have great patience while passing down their knowledge to us . They wish us a success and thus will not teach us bad things . And of course , implicit learning occurs when children unconsciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior . <p> During the second stage of child development , adolescence , parents can still be in the best position to offer advice even though the children might not accept it . In this case , perhaps the child 's friends would be the best teachers . Adolescents are notoriously rebellious in many cultures and may automatically reject any advice from their parents . My first marriage for instance , was solely a matter of doing the opposite when my parents tried to intrude in offering their advice . So in such matters , parents should be much more flexible and be rather the partners with their children . So we can see that being a teacher of growing child become more and more complicated case as the time passes and many parents are simply not able to meet the increased demands . <p> On the other hand , I would say that parents are not professional teachers and they tend to be very biased by their love of their children . So wishing good things and an easy life may prevent children from maturation . In any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , while good teaching should be based on different attitudes . Thus , when children go to school and have a great diversity of teachers , they learn much more than their parents could probably give them . Furthermore , once our parents get older , they become more conservative and can not always be objective in regard to modern trends and fashions . Thus we need to take their advice with caution during that period . However , some kind of intuition which I believe shared between relatives about what everybody needs and great love which exists in a families still makes our parents very good teachers and advisers at any time . <p> In conclusion , while parents are not the ideal teachers , and well-rounded children will generally need a great diversity of teachers in their lives in order to have a more accurate view of the world , parents are generally the most committed of all teachers and have the greatest emotional investment in their children and their future . <p> Failure to restate the topic is one of the most common errors that TestMagic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start like this : " I agree with this point ... " We need to say something like this : " I agree that having food that is easy to prepare has improved our lives . " <p> Very few people stated that parents are very important because children have so much contact with them in the first years of their lives . Most psychologists agree that these years are fundamental to the emotional and mental growth of the child .

@@108557652 @3957652/ <p> I disagree wholeheartedly that learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present . In fact , the definition of learning includes the idea of an accumulation of experiences from the past . Learning can only take place if we make an association between things that have happened in the past or between something in the past and something that we predict will happen in the future . All knowledge that we acquire as we grow is from the past ? language , customs , academic subjects , and so on . While it may be helpful sometimes to be able to overlook previous knowledge in order to avoid the constraint conformity , the vast majority of knowledge that we learn is a huge boost ? imagine if each of us had to discover by ourselves that 2 + 2 = 4 !

The ancient Greeks developed geometry , which helped other European scientists analyze the solar system , which in turn gave us a new understanding of our place in the universe .

For example , at one time , leading thinkers in Europe thought that the Earth was at the center of the universe and those who disagreed were persecuted as heretics , even Copernicus , who we now know was correct about his heliocentric model of the Solar System . However , scientists were eventually able to break from the past and accept the new model of the universe . <p> In short , learning from and analyzing the past has enormous value for us and life as we know it on Earth today would not be possible without the benefit of thousands of years of history and accumulated knowledge .

@@108557699 @3957699/ <p> It is a very dangerous thing to say that basic literacy skills are more important now than they have ever been in the past . While a strong argument can be made in favor of this idea , making such an argument would imply that reading and writing were somehow less important in the past . While there is a grain of truth to the argument that literacy was not fundamental to the daily existence of most people in the pre-Industrial Revolution period , rationalizing such a lack of need for education in such a way is the first step to withholding education from certain groups , a great social crime that has led to the disempowerment of disadvantage groups all over the world throughout history . However , if we can keep in mind that education is a basic human right , then we can discuss the strengths of the proposition that literacy is more important now than it has ever been before . <p> It is true that in the past the majority of people all over the world made their livelihood from agricultural activities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no literacy skills . In some senses , we could argue that literacy skills were less important in the agricultural age than they are now , but to do so would be to forget that literacy also reflects an active mind and that people have always needed to engage in activities of the mind . For example , even though a farmer might have labored all day in her corn field , she may enjoy reading the latest Jane Austen novel when arrived at home . We can see in this example that while literacy was not directly related to this laborer 's livelihood , literacy was important to her quality of life . <p> However , we could make a good argument that literacy is more important now that it was in the past . As we all know , the world is experiencing a revolution that may turn out to be more important than the Industrial Revolution . We are now entering the Information Age , an age in which information and knowledge have more value than the ability to build machines , create " stuff , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gemstones . Nowadays , accurate information may be worth more than the most expensive Rolls-Royce or the biggest diamond . The perfect example of this increasing dominance is the explosive rise in the popularity of the Internet--the Internet offers the world countless bytes of information twenty-four hours a day , seven days a week , 365 days a year . Companies all over the world , but principally in the United States , are rushing to stake their claim in cyberspace and stiff competition among companies has resulted . In order to gain dominance , these companies must have the best-skilled workers , an advanced understanding of computer systems , and good intuition about what will happen in the future . All of these abilities to compete in the global marketplace stem directly from literacy skills and those without these skills will be stuck in the service , agricultural , and heavy industry fields . <p> In short , we can see that people in the past who were lacking in literacy skills essentially had more company than those lacking these skills have today and could still earn their livelihood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the global marketplace and because of the emergence of the Information Age , we could make the argument that literacy is fundamental to professional success nowadays .

@@108557700 @3957700/ <p> It seems like the world is becoming smaller and smaller , almost by the minute . When I was a child , I had never met anybody from outside my hometown , much less somebody from another country . However , nowadays I routinely interact with people from all over the world . I might discuss a topic with my classmates from Iran , Korea , Brazil , or Palestine ; buy computer parts from the shop run by Chinese ; have lunch at a Mexican restaurant ; or buy Russian pastries at the cafT near my house . In these experiences I can see the product of a world in which borders are falling and people are free to move about as they wish . There is nothing more invigorating for me than being a part of this emerging ? global village. ? <p> I have now lived in three different countries , Argentina , France , and the United States and am convinced that I am a better person for it .

We may lose one thing when we leave a country , but we always gain something else in its place . <p> So , the greatest benefit of having met so many people from all over the world has been learning that each person and each culture has a different yet valid way of seeing the world . I can not say that Argentines have a monopoly on how to view the world ; nor can I say that the American system of doing things is best . I can only say that from my experience each system works for each culture and that each one is a valid way of seeing the world . <p> Perhaps this point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and technology and falling political and trade barriers . As people from all over the world migrate more freely in search of better lives , they will necessarily have to learn to be tolerant of different worldviews .

By accepting cultures different from our own , we learn more of the broad range of the human experience and we are richer people for seeing beauty and truth in its many forms .

I hold my bag in my hand as if it were a weapon . After the whole house has been declared ? clear , ? I start to breathe normally again and a smile appears on my face as I realize , once again , how a simple movie seen at the cinema a week earlier can modify my actions . <p> Sometimes I wonder if I should watch TV , with all its shows that make me wonder whether I exercise enough , whether I am slim enough , or whether I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really concerned about their mental health ? ? ? Not to mention the hundreds of commercials that try to make me believe I need a water purifier to remain alive since the water I am currently drinking is heavily polluted ! And countless are the times when I have heard people talking by quotations learned from movies We need to watch shows and films to know what to say , how to be , how to act . We are so addicted to all this that it almost seems like we can not think on our own . <p> I can not help thinking about what happened to me some days ago , an example that clearly shows what kind of power TV has over people . My husband and I were in a restaurant when I heard my young neighbor pronouncing violent words in a low angry voice . Surprised , I turned to better understand the situation and I saw that he was holding a fake military device and was acting as if he were filming a war movie . I am sure that if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie , I would have recognized what he was saying as a quotation . Now , I wonder if he uses such a language also with his friends and with his parents , if he is aggressive , and if so , whether his attitude has really nothing to do with what he watches on TV . <p> That same evening on the way home I saw two cars stopped one next to the other at a traffic light and as soon as the light turned green they started racing , in the middle of town . In this case not even a major knowledge of movies and TV programs would have helped me : there are just to many of them on the market showing the exact same thing : people racing with cars . <p> I am sure that everybody , if asked , could easily list many other examples of how TV and movies can modify our behavior and therefore our life but , I wonder , if we will always be able to draw the line between a TV show and real life , between what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really need and are and believe .

@@108557768 @3957768/ <p> Television is undoubtedly one of the most powerful means of communication in the history of humankind , rivaled only by such other forms of communication as the Internet , the telephone , movies , and , of course , simple , low-tech speech . Television , with its wide availability and rich media with image and sound , is difficult to ignore and even seductive in its appeal . Television is as much a part of our lives as are our meals , work , or school ; studies consistently show that the average American child spends almost as much time watching television as she does in school . Furthermore , because television is so rich in its media , it often requires our full attention or is more attraction to us than are our daily lives . Naturally , the more time one spends watching television , the less time she has with her family and friends . Thus , we can clearly see why some have claimed that television has been harmful for communication among family and friends . However , I believe that , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has hardly " destroyed " communication among family and friends for most people , although for some , this may be true . <p> Most people much prefer spending time with their families and friends to spending time watching television . Television is of course an important part of many people 's lives , but most people would gladly choose family and friends over television were they given the choice . Furthermore , most educated people are aware of the deleterious effects of too much television and either avoid excessive time watching television , or actually do not enjoy it . I , for example , after a long day at work , would much rather spend time talking with my wife and playing with my children than I would watching some unrealistic portrayal of life on television . For me and my family , our time together is precious and beautiful , and could never be replaced or hurt by television . <p> Furthermore , the effect of television is simply not so great that it could be said to have " destroyed " communication among family and friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries has decreased in recent years , it might be tempting to blame this problem on television since its rise roughly coincided with the decrease in time we spend with our families . However , I believe this situation is more likely due to increased pressures relating from work , school , and the economy . In my case , for example , I find that my pressures from work are so great that I must often sacrifice time at home so that I can meet the challenges of running my own business . Many of my friends are in similar situations--my best friend , for example , has just finished law school , which took about sixty hours a week of his time . In a word , people nowadays have very little time for anything , but television is not the cause--it is increased desire to succeed . <p> In some situations , however , television has surely contributed to a decrease in communication among family members . In my childhood in the countryside , I often saw parents and children watching television for hours on end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that television was a way to escape from their sad , miserable existence . However , even in this case , I would say that television merely contributed to the bad situation , but did not cause it ; were television not existent , surely these people would have found other escapes , alcohol or gambling , for example . In other words , people always find a way to do what they want to do . <p> In short , I do not believe that television has destroyed or even harmed interpersonal communication among most people . Most people realize that television is merely a temporary diversion and do not use it to replace interpersonal communication . I believe that the damage attributed to television is greatly exaggerated and that such damage is most likely attributable to other more powerful social factors .

@@108557784 @3957784/ <h> Why They 're Confusing <p> These questions are confusing mainly because they introduce two or three elements to think of . In other words , the overall meaning of the statement is dependent on evaluating one thing in relation to another . The trickiest ones are the ones that use a negative such as not in the sentence . But do n't worry , if you have a hard time with these questions , it means simply that you are normal--the human brain , no matter what language it is familiar with , is not wired to process negatives and double negatives quickly . <p> Let 's look at a " progression " of statements to put these ideas into context . I will use the simulated TOEFL question about Carl , and how he feels today : <p> Statement : I feel very good today . <p> Meaning : I feel very good today . <p> Discussion : Easy , right ? Right ! This is a very normal sentence for us , for our brains , and for our language . <p> Discussion : Still easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days--the mood for today is better than that of yesterday . So far , so good , right ? <p> Statement : Today I could feel better . <p> Meaning : I could feel better today . Therefore , today my mood is not perfect , since there is still some room for improvement . <p> Discussion : Getting a little bit harder now , but if you understand the sentence " I could feel better " , then you 're almost there ! Remember your modals--could is often used to express the idea that you have the ability to do something , even if you have n't done it . <p> Statement : Today I could not feel better . <p> Meaning : Today I feel perfect . <p> Discussion:There is no more room for improvement . Having a better mood is not possible . Therefore , I can say that today my mood is perfect . Therefore , I could not feel better today . <h> TestMagic Explanation <p> The key here is to realize that when we hear something like " I could not feel better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we are saying that we are already at a limit--either the minimum or the maximum . So , if I say that I could not feel better , I 'm feeling " perfect , " ( okay , that 's not really possible in the real world , but we 're talking about language here ) . And if I 'm sick with the flu , I just lost my job , and my dog just bit me , I can say " I could not feel worse , " meaning that I 'm already at the limit . Remember , if you 're all the way at the bottom , you ca n't get any lower . And if you 're already at the top , you ca n't get any higher !

The second paragraph talks about the value of hard work and the third paragraph shows how success can lead to complacence . <p> No , I do not agree with the notion that progress is always a good thing . There is no doubt that progress is something everyone wants but this does n't necessarily mean that it is always good . In my opinion progress can do as much harm as it can do good . It all depends on the way someone takes his progress . <p> For instance , if a hard working person , who has been no stranger to struggle and failure , achieves progress , he understands that the progress he got is due to his perseverance . He realized the fact that progress can be made by working hard . So he will be encouraged to work even harder and make even more progress . In this case , progress has made a good impact on the person 's life . <p> Now let 's visualize another case . Suppose another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything easy in his life also achieves progress . This is rather unlikely but we can not rule out the possibility . Now this progress can have adverse effect on his mentality .

When the failure does come the man may realize his mistake , but by then it might have become too late . So , this man has been spoilt by his initial progress . <p> Now these are only two examples and there are many more people with different attitudes towards life and hence will be affected differently by progress .

Another type of bird , the horned lark , will dig a hole in the ground to stay warm . Another bird , the ptarmigan , will dig a hole in the snow to stay warm . However , even though these birds can stay warm by doing these things , other birds are able to stay even warmer by staying together in groups . Several types of birds do this . For example , wrens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are types of birds that stay together at night in order to stay warm . <p> 6th stc <p> Skin contact helps birds stay warm . <p> One reason that birds are able to stay warmer when they stay together is that when their skin touches , less heat is lost to the colder air around them . <p> 7th stc <p> Here are some facts about staying warm with skin contact . <p> For example , research has shown that one type of bird , the kinglet , can reduce heat loss by 25% if two of them are together , and they can reduce heat loss by 33% if three of them are together . <h> Second Paragraph <p> 1st stc <p> Staying together has more benefits--birds can share information . <p> There is another benefit to staying together--if all the birds stay together , they can give one another more information . <p> 2nd stc <p> For example , birds look for food every day . <p> For example , groups of birds leave their nests during the day to look for food . <p> 3rd stc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . <p> When these birds come back at night , some of them have found food to eat , but others have not . <p> 4th stc <p> The next day , after looking for food , the birds tend to follow the " lucky " birds ( the ones that found food ) . <p> Scientists have seen that , on the next day , when the birds have to leave again to find food , the birds that did not find enough food on the previous day tend to follow the birds that did find food on the previous day . <p> 5th stc <p> We can see more evidence of the relationship between eating and staying together in two other types of birds that are similar . <p> There are two other types of birds that are related , the common kestrel and the lesser kestrel . These two types of birds are related , but they have different nesting habits and different eating habits . <p> 6th stc <p> One type of bird hunts animals , the other type of bird looks for insects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tends to hunt vertebrate animals ( animals that have spines ) in a small area that they are familiar with . The lesser kestrel , on the other hand , hunts for insects over a wide area . <p> 7th stc <p> The first type of bird hunts alone and sleeps alone ; the second type hunts together and sleeps together . <p> The first bird ( the one that likes to hunt animals ) , the common kestrel , sleeps alone and hunts alone . In contrast , the lesser kestrel sleeps and hunts together with other birds . Some people think that the lesser kestrel hunts with other birds so that it can learn from the other birds where the insects are . <h> Third Paragraph <p> 1st stc <p> Finally , sleeping together helps protect the birds . <p> The last reason that birds stay together is that some birds that are not sleeping can send a signal to the other birds if they are attacked . <p> 2nd stc <p> However , in some ways , sleeping together can be more dangerous . <p> However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are some disadvantages to staying together . For example , if a predator ( hunter ) sees so many birds together in one place , it will be more likely to attack them . Furthermore , birds that stay together on the ground are more easily attacked than are birds that sleep in trees . <p> 3rd stc <p> Even birds in trees can be attacked . <p> However , even birds that sleep in trees can be attacked by other predatory birds . <p> 4th stc <p> Finally , birds at the edges of the group can be attacked more easily . <p> Finally , the birds that are at the edges of the group ( not at the center ) are more vulnerable to attack than are the birds at the center since they are the first ones that predators will find .

@@108557895 @3957895/ <p> Starts off strong , but does not show that progress is bad ; shows only that progress is good . <p> Some people think that progress is always a good thing . I do n't agree with this point of view . In my opinion progress is only a good thing under certain circumstances , not always . A progress may encourage people and may make people become more confident . In this case , it 's a good thing . A progress may also give some guy a feeling that he 's so good , then he just becomes arrogant and stops making efforts . If this happens , a progress may not be a good thing . <p> Almost all of us went to schools . I 'll take a student as an example . If a student has been working very hard but he keeps receiving not so good scores , he may become diffident and lose his courage . It 'll be a disaster for someone if he does n't have his confidence and courage , which everybody will need to face some challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school or later at career without confidence and courage .

What does the progress reflect ? His past efforts , helps from other teachers and classmates , etc . The progress only reflects the past , not the future .

In another word , he 'll lose his future successes . <p> In conclusion , it is my opinion that progress is sometimes a good thing , but it may also turn out to be a loss if it 's not treated properly .

@@108557910 @3957910/ <h> What is the most important plant in your country ? <p> I have written this essay as if I were from Korea so that my students would be able to imitate the essay better . I 'm not really from Korea , though--I was born in Washington , D.C. , the capital of the US ! ! <p> Plants are vital to the survival of all life on Earth--plants transform the light of the sun into energy that is usable to other life on Earth . Without plants , animals would not be able to use the energy of the Sun that reaches the Earth . The removal of one plant from the ecosystem can cause many unforeseen changes , sometimes irreversibly damaging an ecosystem . However , some plants are more important than others , either for biological or cultural reasons . In my country , Korea , I would say that the grass that produces rice has come to be the most important plant , not just because rice is a staple food , but also for other cultural reasons . <p> Virtually every Korean eats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , had rice at breakfast , lunch , and dinner yesterday . For most Koreans , rice is an integral part of a meal , as expected in a meal as ink is to a pen or wheels are to a car--a meal without rice is not a meal . In fact , if I have dinner with my American friends and do not eat rice , I actually feel hungry even if I have filled myself with potatoes or other food while eating with them . Many of my friends have made similar comments to me . So , I believe that rice is as much a part of our daily lives as work or talking on the telephone is . <p> However , rice is much more than just a staple food to most Koreans--it represents the very sustenance of much of our culture . Our history teachers tell us that the development of rice as an agricultural product was largely responsible for the advancement of Korean culture--since rice was portable and had a long storage time , people had more freedom to move and were less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rice has come to be considered the perfect food , so ingrained is it in the minds of many Koreans , and many Asians for that matter , as food that we often say " have you had your rice " instead of saying " have you had your meal . " In fact , I have made this translation error many times while I have been in the United States . I have wanted to ask my American friends whether they have eaten , and I ask , " Have you eaten your rice ? " Naturally , they often respond " no , " leading to much miscommunication . For me , then , rice is more than just food--it is the very sustenance of most Koreans . <p> In short , rice is by far the most important plant in Korea . Were it removed from Korean society , Korea would change drastically , perhaps even have a famine much like the Irish Potato Famine of the 1800 's . Rice is the very lifeblood of Korea .
