Thanks for helping make this blog possible ! <p> I love sleeping in a comfortable bed with soft sheets and a cozy comforter , but if there is one thing I can not stand , it is when you put on a fitted sheet and it does n't  , well , fit . We have a memory foam mattress , and this particular one happens to be a bit thinner than most mattresses today . This causes a problem in that almost any fitted sheet we put on the bed winds up being loose with wrinkles that , to me , feel like mountains ( the Princess and the Pea Syndrome ) . <p> I must have my fitted sheets tight and firm . Each night we pull it taut hoping it will stay somewhat tight , and within minutes I can feel it slipping around a bit and the wrinkle-mountains forming . At this time we can not replace the mattress , nor am I going to go and buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up being too large anyway . Thankfully , I found the solution when I was recently given the opportunity to try a unique and innovative product to make your loose fitted sheet fit firmly , the Original BedBand . <h> What is the Original BedBand ? <p> Basically , the Original BedBand is a sturdy elastic band with clips on both ends that you attach to the corners of your fitted sheet which , in turn , effectively pulls in the slack causing the sheet to fit firm and flat . While there are other similar products out there , The Original BedBands use high quality elastic cord , durable nickel plated clamps , built-in fabric protectors and push button cord locks . <p> Each BedBand measures approximately 12 ? from end to end and will stretch to almost 18 ? . They will work on all types of mattresses including pillow tops , and will even work on standard and pillow top futons ! The clamps found on each end of the band are easy to open and close , and since they have plastic protectors over the gripper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Using the cord lock buttons , you can quickly adjust the bands to either add more tension by pushing the button and pulling the cord , or to release tension by pushing the button and releasing some cord . Either way , the cord locks make it easy to pull the sheet as tight as you prefer . <h> How the Original BedBands Work <p> Installation is not very hard once you get the hang of it . You start by placing the sheet on the bed as normal . Open the clamps on both ends of the bands and attach them to the sheet on all four corners . I found it works best by placing them 5 to 8 ? from the corners center . You adjust the amount of tension by pressing the cord lock button and pulling the cord towards you . Once you get it to the desired tension , release the cord lock button . Repeat this on all four corners until the sheet is fitted the way you like . <p> If you need to lift the mattress to get the sheet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to furniture , it is suggested to install the bands before placing the sheet on the bed . In this scenario you will want to spread the band clamps farther apart , and be sure to move the cord stop to the side of the sheet corner that you will be able to reach the easiest and adjust the tension . Once the BedBands are attached , place the sheet on the bed and pull the bands around the corner of the mattress this way you can tighten them from the side of the bed without having to lift the mattress . <p> To remove the BedBands just press the button on the cord lock while pulling the cord towards you to release . Then unhook the clamps and they are off . <h> Review of the Original BedBand <p> I was so excited that the minute they arrived , I went directly back to the bedroom to install . Since this was my first time , I have to admit it took me awhile not to get them on all four corners of the sheet , but to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound up going from corner to corner to corner , being completely unorganized about it . The second time I applied them , I had a better idea of exactly where to place them and how much tension to apply on each side . That time it was much easier and much quicker ! The Original BedBands did exactly as advertised and made the fitted sheet fit tightly , with no wrinkles . <p> Both my husband and I do a lot of tossing and turning throughout the night , so I was pleased to see that the next morning , the sheet was still firmly attached to the mattress . It was n't perfectly flat and firm , but it was not loose and full of wrinkles either . It fit just the way it was meant to . <p> The Original BedBand not only works great on sheets that are larger than the mattress , but they also work wonders on sheets that have lost their elasticity . You can even turn a flat sheet into your fitted sheet by using the bands to secure it ! Plus there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original use . Use them on the futon , on air mattresses , RV , trailer and camper beds . Use them to secure your grill cover , furniture covers , tablecloths , pet bedding , tarps for outdoor equipment , boat and car seat covers , wheelchairs , and so much more ! <p> The Original BedBands come four to a pack , and are available in two colors , black and white . You can purchase them directly through the BedBand website , as well as on Amazon.com . The price is a steal , too , especially considering the options : sleep uncomfortably with your fitted sheet pulling off the mattress each time you turn , buy new sheets or buy a new bed . Make your fitted sheet live up to its name with the Original BedBands . <h> You Are Also Going To Love : <p> Studies have shown that if you really like this post , you will also love the following articles . I have pulled them together for you right here ! <p> Great idea ! I always buy king sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra width on the flat sheet . The fitted sheets are always too big , so we have to tuck , it gets loose , well you get the idea ! 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

@@29514733 @3214733/ <h> Shark Rocket Complete with DuoClean Technology A Review <p> Between a husband working in construction , a stepson , and our pets , keeping our floors clean is a daily chore . Since we have mostly hardwoods with area rugs scattered throughout , I spend a lot of time sweeping , and then more time vacuuming . And I am not one that likes to sweep , especially since its hard to get every little dirt particle into a dustpan . Luckily , the Shark Rocket Complete with DuoClean Technology vacuum , works on both types of floors ( and much more ) , so now cleaning is a breeze ! <p> The Shark Rocket Complete with DuoClean Technology is uniquely designed to clean-up all types of dirt and particles , including small crumbs , large messes , and even stuck-on goop . It has twice the power of the original Rocket , and with dual brush rolls for triple particle cleaning , it works great on every surface whether its hardwood floors , tile floors , or plush carpeting . In fact , since it works as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can clean just about anything and everything with this lightweight vacuum . I 'm talking ceiling fans , window sills , drapes , upholstery and much more . Heck , I 've even used it to clean my car ! <h> The Duo " in Shark Rocket Complete Duo <p> So what exactly does " dual brush rolls for triple particle cleaning " mean ? Basically , the vacuum has two brushes , a soft brush and a bristle brush . On hard floors , the soft brush works to remove stuck on dust , fine dust and large particles , while the bristle brush pushes the particles up into a high-velocity suction channel . On carpets , the soft brushroll pulls in large particles on high piles , while the second , deep-cleaning bristle brush removes deeply embedded dirt . I love how I can move straight from my area rugs to my floors without having to change any settings , too . <p> Other awesome features of the Shark Rocket Complete with DuoClean Technology Vacuum include : <p> brightly illuminating LED Lights on the hand vac and the nozzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swivel Steering <p> Easy to Empty Dust Cup <p> Lightweight <p> Detachable handle <h> Accessories <p> The Shark Rocket Complete with DuoCleanG Technology ( HV380 series ) vacuums all come with several handy accessories . However , the exact accessories you get depend on the HV380 series model you have , although all accessories can be purchased separately . <p> My particular model , the Shark Rocket Complete TruePet- with DuoCleanG Technology ( HV382 ) , comes with a dusting brush , a 12-inch duster crevice tool , an upholstery tool , an Under Appliance Wand , a TruePet- Mini Motorized Brush , a wall mount , an on-board tool clip and an accessory bag . Attachments can hook easily onto the tool clip , and extras can be stored in the accessory bag ( available with some models ) so you can carry them with you as clean . Even better , the on-board attachments are positioned so that they stay out of the way while you clean . <h> Easy to Assemble <p> Thanks to the quick set-up guide instructions with pictures , I had my Rocket assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , the hardest thing about the set up was mounting the wall bracket if you choose to hang the Rocket . And once it is hung on the bracket , it takes up very little room which I love ! <p> Once together , the very first thing I noticed was how light it is . At a mere 8 pounds , its the lightest vacuum Ive ever used . The second thing I noticed is the length of the cord " more than 30 feet " which is much longer than many uprights . This saves me from having to unplug and plug-in every time I move to another part of the house . <h> Lots of Power in a Lightweight Vacuum <p> Once I turned it on , I was quickly impressed . The power this little vacuum puts out was very noticeable ! Running it across the area rug in our living room , I was very happy . I did n't  have to push hard at all , it pretty much did it by itself . By the time I finished the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's an amazing machine , easy to handle and very effective on both my hard floors ( wood and tile ) and my carpets . And the LED lights make it easy to see what is on the floor . <p> Thanks to the Swivel Head , it literally turns on a dime , allowing me to get in and around places that there is no possible way to get with a full-sized upright . I was able to easily get under the coffee table , in between the sofa and the end tables , around all the cords running from my computer and our table lamps . I also got under the kitchen table , in between all of the chairs , and even under the edges of the bottom cabinets . <h> Easy to Empty <p> The first time I dumped the large-capacity Dust Cup , I was shocked at how much dirt it had collected . I thought my former vacuum had been doing a good job apparently not . The dust canister separates from the vacuum with the push of a button , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty it into an old grocery bag , tie the bag shut and put it in the trash . <p> I emptied that Dust Cup quite a few more times because once I realized just how versatile this vacuum is , I went on a cleaning spree ! Seriously , the Shark Rocket Complete with DuoClean Technology is like one of my stepsons Transformers . It easily converts from a lightweight upright stick vac into a powerful handheld mini-vac that 's ideal for stairs and furniture , for dusting hard surfaces such as tables , for cleaning up spills ( non-liquid ) , and so much more . <p> And those attachments I mentioned above ? They attach easily and are incredibly handy , enabling me to vacuum the couch and chairs , the curtains , the air vents , and even under the stove and refrigerator . I was vacuuming all sorts of hard-to-reach places , and even in the corners and other spots that I 'd never dreamed of being able to vacuum . Its so lightweight , I even went after my ceiling fans and mini-blinds . You name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rocket Complete with DuoClean Technology ! <h> True Pet- Upholstery Tool ( HV382 ) <p> One of my favorite attachments is the True Pet- upholstery tool ( HV382 only ) . This little mini motorized brush attachment quickly and easily picks up the cat fur off our furniture and carpets . It works so much better than non-motorized tools . I was cleaning off our chairs , the sofa and even the cat tree . Oh , and for you fellow cat lovers , the Rocket Complete Duo does wonders with those little pieces of litter that tend to get tracked out around the box ! <h> Easy-to-Clean Rollers <p> Something else I really love about this vacuum is that both brush rollers are incredibly easy to take off , clean , and replace . I cant stand when hair , threads , or strings get wrapped around the brush rollers and you have to either sit there and unwind them by hand ( yucky ) , or grab a screwdriver or some other tool and take the rollers off . With the Shark Rocket Duo , all I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily access the brush , snap it out , clean off the hair and dirt , snap it back in and snap the lid closed . It literally took me maybe 5 minutes from start to finish to take out the brush , clean it and put it back . Shark even includes a handy little brush cleaner that has a ripper on one end that makes removing hair , strings and other things that get wrapped around the brushes much easier . <h> Any Drawbacks ? <p> As far as loudness , the Shark Rocket Complete Duo is not overly loud . You can tell a definite increase when you switch between power level 1 ( floors and area rugs ) and level 2 ( deep pile ) , but it is no way deafening or any louder than you 'd expect . <p> The only thing I noticed that is going to take a bit of getting used to is that the majority of the weight on this vacuum is up top . This means that I cant just lock it and leave it standing up on its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up against something or lay it down if I need to stop vacuuming for a minute . However , the versatility and effectiveness of the Shark Rocket really outweigh this . <h> Take Your Chores and Cut Them in Half <p> My absolute favorite thing about the Shark Rocket Complete with DuoClean Technology is that this vacuum takes so many chores and cuts them in half . Instead of having to sweep , Swiffer , and then vacuum , I can just use my Shark Rocket Complete . It saves me time , energy and money . <p> If you 're looking for a versatile and affordable vacuum cleaner that deep cleans better than other vacuums I 've used , the Shark Rocket Complete with DuoClean technology is a fantastic option . I think you 'll be quite impressed by this machine 's versatility , pick-up , surface adaptability and general ease-of-use . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Following the instructions in the included Stone Wave 5 Minute Recipe book , I cracked two eggs into the cooker , and made sure to whisk them completely ( the more you whisk , the fluffier the omelette ) . I then finely sliced some mushrooms , onions , ham , salt and pepper and mixed it together .

@@29514739 @3214739/ <h> The Lid Pocket + A Slow Cooker Pot Roast Recipe 130178 @qwx330178 <p> Slow cookers are definitely one of my favorite ways to cook . What could be easier than throwing a bunch of ingredients into a pot , covering it and letting it cook all day while you do what needs to be done . And the flavor of long-time , slow cooked meat.ummmmm ! In fact , I love my slow cooker so much , I try to make a meal in it at least once a week . This week , I opted for a tender , juicy pot roast , based on a recipe I found a few years back on The Pioneer Woman and it was delicious ! You can find the recipe below ! <p> The only complaint I have about using a slow cooker , is the mess it makes when you remove the HOT lid and all that water comes pouring off all over your counter and possibly all over you . Plus , since many of the slow cooker meals I prepare do well with a stir or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set that hot lid or having to hold it in one hand so now I either have more of a mess to clean or have only one hand free to stir and season . But then I discovered the Lid Pocket . <p> Created specifically for slow cookers , the Lid Pocket is exactly what its name implies a pocket that hooks onto the side of your slow cooker in which you can place the lid . This way , not only is the lid off your counter and within easy reach , but all that excess water drips down into the Lid Pocket instead of on the counter . Then , once you replace the lid on the cooker , you can pour the water out into the sink . Easy peasy ! <p> The Lid Pocket is designed to fit the majority of 3 qt. and larger slow cookers , both round and oval . In order to fit correctly , the narrowest part of the slow cookers rim should be less than .75 ? in width . It will not , however , work with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply hook it over the lip of your slow cooker . That 's it ! Of course , you do have to remove it once you close the lid on the slow cooker , otherwise your lid will not close all the way , but this extra step is well worth having both hands free to stir or season , and no wet , messy counter top to clean ! Plus , once you are done cooking , the Lid Pocket stores right inside your slow cooker ! <p> The Lid Pocket has made using my slow cooker even more enjoyable ! The only complaint if you can even call it that is once attached with the entire weight of the lid resting in it , it seems to stretch/bend a bit . But my guess is this is part of the design to keep it from breaking , and so far I have had no problems with it not holding the lid securely or breaking . In summary , I love it ! For right around $10 , you can get one to use in your home directly through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of cooking a deliciously tender , juicy pot roast is choosing the meat . Although a bit more expensive , I prefer to use a chuck roast with plenty of marbling . That marbling is what makes the roast so moist , tender and full of flavor ! 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

The kids are out of school , the weather is gorgeous , and we are so ready to get out-of-town and enjoy ourselves ! If you 're dreaming of the perfect vacation , but are worried about your budget , do n't  be ! You can still have the vacation of your dreams without breaking the bank . Here are seven simple ways you can save on summer travel from where you stay to the gas you put in the car . <h> 1 . Plan Your Trip Ahead of Time <p> Planning ahead not only makes things easier , it can also save you plenty of money . Having a clear idea of where you 're going and how you 're getting there , means less stress and a lower likelihood of extra expenses . Additionally , the earlier you make your reservations , the lower your rates will be . <p> When selecting a destination , narrow it down to a list of potential destinations based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most popular destinations as those places are practically guaranteed to be more expensive . If you 're wanting to hit the beach , consider staying in a smaller town as opposed to the one that everyone goes to . Not only will you get better prices by avoiding that tourist trap , you 'll avoid the crowds as well . <p> If you ca n't plan ahead , its still possible to get some great deals ! Look for last-minute getaway deals on travel sites such as Groupon Getaways and Living Social Escapes . Save on room expenses by searching major hotel chain websites for sales and special offers . And do n't  forget to look at websites that specialize in access to last minute trips , such as Last Minute Travel . <h> 2 . Make a Realistic Budget and Stick to It <p> One of the best ways to save on summer travel is by setting aside your funds ahead of time . Not only do you set aside stress , but you lower the chances of spending more than you should . Set a clear target price range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you include travel , lodging , food , admission prices and even a bit for souvenirs . Once that goal is set , you 'll feel more comfortable in locating and purchasing your vacation quickly . <h> 3 . Pick the Right Accommodations <p> Where you stay can play a big part when trying to save on summer travel . While hotels are the most obvious choice , there are plenty other options to consider . Stay with family or friends who live in the area . Or look into renting a condo or house . Websites such as Airbnb.com , VRBO.com and HomeAway.com often offer low rates on apartment , condo and house rentals worldwide . <p> If you do choose to get a hotel room , go online and compare several hotels to try to find the best price . Again , use those online deal sites to find discounts and deals . And if you have a little flexibility in your plans , consider booking at the last minute . Just like airlines , hotels will try to fill all rooms " even if that means heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the last minute you could snag a great deal . <h> 4 . Get a Room with A Kitchenette or Where Kids Eat Free <p> Food can add up to be one of the biggest expenses while on vacation . Luckily there are plenty of ways to save starting from the minute you hit the road . Avoid on-the-road food costs and save time by bringing your own non-perishable snacks , sandwiches and drinks so you do n't spend money on fast food . Staying at a place where they offer free breakfast as well as reserving a room with a kitchenette can also save you hundreds . Simply pick up some basic groceries and prepare simple meals and snacks in your own space . And when you do go out to eat , look for online deals and for restaurants where kids eat for free . <h> 5 . Consider Driving Instead of Flying <p> Depending on your destination , driving your own car can be a great way to save on summer travel . Summer is considered a peak travel time which means air fare is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , you 'll also avoid the cost of having to rent a car or pay for public transportation once you arrive at your destination . And if you can find special offers and other ways to save on gas " see number 7 in this list " you can save even more overall . <p> Just make sure you have a reliable and safe car that gets good gas mileage and has had its regular summer maintenance . And even if you do n't have a car , renting an economy car at $30-$50 a day could still be a cost-saver over the cost of flying . <h> 6 . Search for Discounts and Deals in Every Step of Your Vacation <p> My absolute favorite way to save on summer travel is by taking advantage on deals and discounts . Online deal sites can not only help you save money while planning your vacation , they can also be priceless when it comes to finding deals once you arrive at your destination . <p> You can find some amazing money-saving offers on everything from car rentals to hotel rooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Groupon , LivingSocial and Restaurant.com for online promotional codes and coupons on food , entertainment and more . And do n't  forget that Ebates.com offers cash back from dozens of travel merchants , with cash back on everything from hotels to cruises to complete vacation packages . <h> 7 . Use Gift Cards Instead of Credit Cards <p> Using gift cards instead of credit cards for summer travel has several benefits . First of all , there is no additional interest to pay when you stick with gift cards , or cash . Secondly , its safer . No need to worry about your cash being stolen while you are in the water . Third , it makes it easier to set a budget and stick with it . Plus , its easier to keep up with exactly what you are spending . And many gift cards never expire , so you can use them for all sorts of things including grocery shopping , dining out , date night , paying bills , or even as gifts for grads , Dads , birthdays , and anniversaries . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

They all need to spend a certain amount of energy , of course , depending on different breeds . But there are some that need to spend a lot more energy that others . If you have yourself something like a Miniature Dachshund or a Springer Spaniel , then you 're soon finding out that super energetic dogs can really live up to the fluffy ball of energy comparisons .

First , however , you have to be able to get control of your dog at a command . Training them properly is essential . But it 's not just about commands , either .

First of all , dogs like to use their teeth to try and bite into and rip up stuff . If you do n't want that happening to your furniture , you need to get them toys but toys that can actually handle the stress . Can indestructible dog toys really be so tough and durable ? If you 're willing to buy them based on those qualities rather than aesthetic of cheapness , then yes . Learning how much your specific breed of dog needs walked is also essential . Without the kind of walkies they need , dogs spend their energy more destructively . Mostly by biting up all your furniture . <p> Give them something to do <p> Dogs are smart animals .

It 's like they almost read your mind when they sense your emotion . If you are calm and kindly affectionate , dogs learn that . If you 're angry and high tension , dogs learn that , too . The same goes for you if you 're manic and always energetic . Do n't start behaviors in your dog that you can not handle . This is especially pertinent with greetings and departures .

The older stain took a second round , but was completely removed as well . <p> Once removed , I used a damp sponge to rinse the area , then left it to air dry . Now that it is completely dry , you cant even tell where the stains were ! <p> Since then I have also used Genesis 950 to clean the kitchen counters , stove and sink , as well as everything in our bathroom .

In keeping with this promise , I 've been looking at a lot of health-related sites and products , and in doing so I came across a company called Be Fit , Live Fit whose goal is to share their love for health , fitness and life with as many people as possible ; and who makes some beautiful bamboo cutting boards ! <p> In addition to their main site and their health and fitness blog , Be Fit , Live Fit also has an expanding line of brands under the name BFLF brands which includes Graphic T-Shirts and Just Bamboo . I , of course , love all things bamboo not only because of their durability and natural beauty , but also because bamboo is one of the most green materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Set , I fell in love ! <p> Just Bamboo Cutting Board Set <p> Those of you who read this blog often know that I love all sorts of kitchen tools , gadgets and gizmos especially when they are made of bamboo . I have everything from a bamboo dinnerware set to bamboo serving spoons and now I have a set of bamboo cutting boards ! <p> Made from premium bamboo , Just Bamboos cutting boards are FDA-approved , non-toxic and , of course , eco-friendly . Each set comes with not one , but three separate lightweight cutting boards ; each of which is a different size , making them practical and convenient ! The largest board measures 13 ? by 9.5 ? , the medium board measures 11 ? by 8.5 ? , and the smallest measures 8 ? by 6 ? . They are all around 3/8 ? thick . Now I not only have a cutting board for all different size jobs , but I also no longer have to stop in the middle of meal prep to wash the board when switching between cutting meats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boards <p> Bamboo cutting boards have several benefits aside from their beautiful appearance . For example , did you know that bamboo is naturally antimicrobial , making them very resistant to bacteria ? Plus , it is hard enough to prevent those deep , bacteria-breeding knife grooves that you get with other wood and plastic cutting boards , yet it is not so hard as to dull your knives . Bamboo is also not as porous as other wood so it will not swell or shrink , nor will it not warp , split or splinter , as long as you follow the simple care instructions . <p> Caring for Your Bamboo Cutting Boards <p> Speaking of care , it is recommended that you season your boards at least 3 times before use with either a coconut oil or food-safe mineral oil . After that , you just use warm water and a mild detergent to clean , making sure to dry the board completely once done . Never put your bamboo cutting boards in the dishwasher ! To extend the life of the board , simply repeat the seasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a dry appearance . <p> My Verdict of Just Bamboo Cutting Boards <p> I have been using my boards for a couple of weeks now , and so far I am quite pleased . They not only work great , but they look nice , too , with their warm , honey color . I have even used the largest one for serving foods several times . I even like the way they smell a fresh , woodsy scent . The only thing I wish was different , was that they had placed something on the back of the boards to keep them from sliding on the counter . However , a few of those small , round rubber dots stuck on the back side of the board easily and inexpensively solved that issue ! <p> If you are looking for an eco-friendly , beautiful cutting board , look no further than Be Fit , Live Fit and the Just Bamboo Cutting Board Set . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

@@29514764 @3214764/ <h> Comfort Revolution Hydraluxe Cooling Pillow Review <p> This post contains affiliate links . Thanks for making this blog possible ! <p> As I mentioned in my previous post , I love a comfy bed , and another bedding item that really affects how well I sleep is the pillow . When it comes to finding the perfect pillow , there are all types of things to consider such as the type of fill feather , foam , down , memory foam , gel the level of support firm , soft , medium , and even the style contour pillow , neck pillow , bed pillow , and so on . This can make finding your ideal pillow quite the challenge . Having been in a car accident which injured my neck , I need a pillow that gives support , but I want one that is not so firm that it feels flat and hard , nor do I want it to be so soft and fluffy that my head is elevated to where I am practically sitting up in bed . And if that is n't picky enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get overly hot . I can not tell you how many times I flip my pillow over throughout the night , always seeking the coolest spot . So when Comfort Revolution offered me the opportunity to review their amazing Hydraluxe Cooling Pillow , I was all over it ! <p> Comfort Revolution is well-known for their unique and innovative bedding products . You may be familiar with those egg crate foam mattress pads and the memory foam mattress pads the founder of Comfort Revolution was the one who first created those items for retail , so it stands to reason that these people know what they are doing when it comes to comfortable bedding products for a good nights sleep ! They make all kinds of pillows , mattresses , mattress toppers , mattress pads and more . <p> One of their most recent creative innovations is their Hydraluxe Gel technology which features a layer of cooling gel over their unique memory foam to provide a cool and comfortable sleep experience . They took this technology and created the Hydraluxe Cooling Pillow . In 2011 , an independent study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooler than other sample pillows tested and there were many types of pillows tested . It also remained cooler than the rest for a longer amount of time throughout the night . <p> I received the Cool Cerulean Bubbles Hydraluxe Bed Pillow and as soon as it arrived , I could not wait to lay my head down on it and sleep . The first thing I noticed was the weight it is much heavier than I was expecting it to be . The second thing I noticed was the smell . Thankfully I saw the part that said these pillows will have a smell when you first open them and that the fumes are non-toxic or otherwise harmful . Following instructions , I removed the pillow from its extra-soft mesh case , and let it air out for a couple of days before I used it . <p> Finally the day ( night ) came where I took the pillow into our room and climbed into bed . As soon as my head hit the pillow it sank gently down into it and within a few minutes I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was going to be more firm than I preferred , but I stuck with it . I could already tell it was providing great support for my head and neck , and after a few days of use , it softened up a bit more to where I now love it ! It really does stay much cooler than other types of pillows I have used , and I am no longer waking up and flipping my pillow over and over all night long . I also notice a marked difference in how comfortable I am and how well I sleep . <p> The only issue I have is that I tend to sleep on my back more often than I do my side , so I probably should have gotten the contour pillow . I do plan on getting one of the contour pillows one day , and will give my husband this one since he sleeps more often on his side , and because we often wind up taking turns using this one since it is so comfy ! <p> The Hydraluxe Cooling Pillow is available in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your choice of pattern for the layer of gel such as bubbles or waves . There are also several colors from which you can choose including Frosted Pink , Cool Cerulean Blue ( aff. link ) , Glacier Green and Icy Violet . All of the pillows come in standard size , which measures about 16 ? x 24 ? x 5 ? . However , according to the website , more sizes are coming out eventually . The premium mesh cover that comes with the pillow is silky soft , and can easily be removed and washed . The Hydraluxe Cooling Pillow will fit in a standard size pillow case if you choose , but this will cut down on the amount of coolness you can feel unless is it a very thin case . <p> You can order the Hydraluxe Cooling Pillow online at stores such as Amazon and the Comfort revolution website , as well as at many stores offline . I actually saw them yesterday at Bed , Bath &amp; Beyond ! here 's some great news , now you can get the Hydraluxe technology in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epitome of comfort ! <p> Be sure to connect with Comfort Revolution on Facebook and Twitter for the latest products and promotions ! 130178 @qwx330178 <p> I bought one of these around July , and it works very well . I lost the instructions that came with the pillow , and I swear I remember them saying something about if its not cold enough then but it in the freezer during the day and take it out at night before you go to bed . I keep on having to flip the pillow at night because it is n't cold enough . I was just wondering if you can put it in the freezer or not . I am not that impressed with this pillow anymore , it does n't  get very cold anymore . <p> I got the hydraluxe air and after a couple of months it has started developing small quarter size ball . It is getting so many it is getting uncomfortable . I am planning on returning it to Bed Bath and Byond . I havent had it 3 mos. yet . <p> I saw one at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cool when I hugged the sample . So I did buy it and first sleep night it did have a little strange smell to it laying on it and was a little bit to big and puffy but I thought it would push down after awhile . I loved that really cool feeling slept great ya ! I found my pillow . After a couple months it did soften up some not so puffy which is good however , I am a little disappointed that its not that cool anymore it is cool but after sleeping on it for awhile I have to flip it over this is a disappointment have anyone heard that this could happen to this pillow . It was n't cheep and do you think that this could be a defect ? Should I contact that company that made them or just wing it and see if I can return and get another one from bed bath and beyond where I got it from ? Plus it did get a little lumpy but still comfy and a little cool for awhile 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

All opinions are mine alone . #BIGSeason #BigLots #CollectiveBias <p> The holiday season is one of the busiest times of the year and one of the most expensive . Between holiday shopping , decorating the home , school programs , class parties , office parties and all the other seasonal activities , there 's hardly any time left to prepare to for your own holiday gathering ! And if you are anything like me , you want your holiday party to be something special . One that creates special memories for your children and everyone else you love . <p> Growing up we would celebrate many of the major Jewish holidays at several different relatives homes . One in particular is the source of some of my fondest holiday memories . While we werent really related to this family , we were so close that I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins . There were many years where wed gather to celebrate Hanukkah together . We 'd bundle up in our jackets , hurry to the car , and race to beat the sunset so we could all light the candles together . I can still remember the rush of warm air filled with delectable aromas that would greet us as they opened the door . The house would be decked out in twinkling blue lights , with silver and blue Star of David ornaments , colorful dreidels and other symbols of the holiday on display throughout the rooms . The table would be set with her best china and crystal . But most of all I remember the laughter , the joy and the happiness of being with those we love and of the season . <p> These memories are so special to me , that I want to recreate the same for my family . And since we celebrate both Hanukkah and Christmas , I get two chances to do so ! When my husband and I first got married , I did n't  have a lot of what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Lots to get what we lacked . I was able to stock up on decorations , table linens , glass ware , bake ware , and all the other items needed to set a gorgeous table and prepare a delicious meal . That 's also the year I realized that Big Lots carries a large variety of food items , too , including a full selection of baking ingredients such as flour , sugar , nuts and decorating candies . <p> This year since Hanukkah fell a few weeks ahead of Christmas , I went to Big Lots to grab a few more things to create a lovely Hanukkah table setting . While I still have much of what we bought a few years ago , I go there each year to get wrapping paper and ribbon , extra lights , and any other holiday items I may need . They always have such a great selection and the best deals ! Of course the styles and assortment will vary from store to store , but you 're sure to find something that you 'll love ! <p> I found some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both of which will look amazing with my china ! And when I came across this cool glass vase , I knew that with a few blue and silver ornaments and some flowers , itd make a great centerpiece . <p> Since I was on a DIY decor kick , I also picked up some candles and ribbon . Once home , with the help of a little hot glue , I 'd have my own pair of decorative candles to go on either side of the vase ! <p> In addition to decorating , each Hanukkah I like to make some type of special Hanukkah cookie . This year I knew exactly what I wanted to bake : Hanukkah Pi+ata Cookies ! So while at Big Lots I made sure to grab some flour and sugar , and a bottle of blue and white snowflake decorating sprinkles . I also picked up a new set of cookie sheets , a glass mixing bowl , a set of cooling racks and this cute spatula that I just had to have ! Did n't  the cookies come out cute ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Holiday Pi+ata Cookies ? Although I made mine in the shape of Stars of David for Hanukkah , you can make them in any shape you 'd like . In fact , I plan on making them again for Christmas , but this time in the shape of Christmas tree ornaments ! And while they taste delicious , what really makes them special is the candy surprise inside . <p> Hanukkah Pinata Cookies <p> These pi+ata cookies may seem difficult to make , but they really are n't  ! Just a few things to keep in mind before you start . First of all , be sure to use a no spread sugar cookie dough recipe . You want the cookies to be as close in size as possible . For pi+ata cookies you will need three individual cookies , one for the top , one for the middle which will have a cut out center for the candy , and one for the top . Keep this in mind when you make your dough so you will have enough . <p> Heres What To Do : <p> Begin by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the printable recipe box below . Once the cookie dough is made , go ahead and roll it out . To make this easier and less messy I lay a piece of wax or parchment paper down , put a ball of dough on it , place another sheet on top of the dough , then press it out into a circle shape with my fingers . I then roll it out to about 1/4 ? thickness . Using parchment paper also prevents that extra flour from getting in the dough ! <p> As you finish rolling out each dough ball , place the entire thing , cookie dough and paper , on a cookie tray and pop it in the refrigerator for at least half an hour . By the time you are finished rolling out all of the dough , the first sheet you put in will be ready to be cut . Remember , you 'll need 3 cookies for each pi+ata cookie . <p> Now , using a small square cookie cutter or a knife , cut the centers out of 1/3 of the cookies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave at least 1/4 ? all the way around . Refrigerate the cookies for another 30 minutes this helps keep the dough from spreading too much . <p> Meanwhile , preheat the oven to 375- . Once the cookies are chilled , bake them one tray at a time for 11-14 minutes until the edges just begin to brown . Remove from the oven , and then allow the cookies to cool completely . <p> Set the cookies in the order you are going to assemble them on your baking sheet or cooling rack . One at a time , pipe a thin line of frosting along the outside edge of the cookies without the cutout . <p> Next press one of the cookies with the center cut out on top of the cookie you just frosted . <p> Now fill the opening with small candies like this <p> and then pipe a thin line of frosting around the outside edge . <p> Top it with another plain cookie , and allow them to sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes . This will give the frosting time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once the thirty minutes has passed , spread a thin layer of frosting over the very top of the cookies <p> then decorate any way you 'd like using sprinkles and candies . After that , all that 's left is to enjoy ! <p> Now that was n't too hard , was it ? ! here 's the handy , dandy printable to help make holiday planning a bit simpler . <p> Holiday Pinata Cookies <p> 2015-12-15 10:30:12 <p> A fun and delicious way to make holiday cookies ! Everyone will love the surprise inside ! <p> Mix the flour , salt , and baking powder together in a bowl and set aside . <p> Cream the butter and sugar until it is light and fluffy . <p> Add eggs , vanilla and almond extract , mixing until well combined . <p> Add the dry ingredients a bit at a time and stir until just combined . <p> Once the cookie dough is made , go ahead and roll it out . <p> To make this easier - and less messy - lay a piece of wax or parchment paper down , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of the dough , then press it out into a circle shape with your fingers .

Show your patriotism with this whimsical Patriotic Cupcake Liner Wreath that can be made in just a few simple steps . <h> Patriotic Cupcake Liner Wreath Tutorial <p> Ever since I 've been on Pinterest , those cute DIY wreaths I keep seeing have been on my mind . Ive been wanting to make one of my own for months now , but it was n't until I was organizing my crafts materials yesterday that I came across everything I would need to make my own DIY Patriotic Cupcake Liner wreath . And with the Fourth of July just a week away , I had the perfect reason ( excuse ) to make one ! <p> This being my first attempt I was n't exactly sure how it would come out , but much to my surprise , I think I did okay . And the best part ? It only took the better part of an hour ! A lot of the supplies you need you most likely already have at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used came as a set from Oriental Trading Co. , and I just pulled the stars off of the picks . As for the wreath , I cut one out from some super thick cardboard we had leftover from our move . I cut out a 14 ? ring , and used 11 of the patriotic cupcake liners , and 3 white jumbo liners I had on hand . The exact amount of liners you will need will depend on the size wreath ring you have . <p> So , are you ready to see how to make this 4th of July Cupcake Liner Wreath ? <p> Amazon also has a great selection of similar cupcake liners ( aff. link ) and toothpicks . <p> Instructions : <p> 1 . Begin by painting the wreath white . The cardboard I used to make mine was already white so I did n't  have to do any painting . Let the wreath dry completely . <p> 2 . Once the paint is dry , flip the wreath ring over to add the twine that will be used to hang the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two lines going through the middle of the wreath , and attach the twine using glue and tape . Let dry , then flip back to the front side . <p> 3 . Next , gently flatten each of the cupcake liners with your hand , then spread them out on the wreath to make sure you have the exact amount of liners you need . Next , using the scissors , make cuts spaced out all the way around each cupcake liner going from the outside in , and stopping at the inner ring . Once cut the liners will sort of resemble a flower . <p> 4 . Now add one of the self stick rhinestones in the very middle of each of the cupcake liners . <p> 5 . The next step is to glue a patriotic cupcake liner on 3 of the white Jumbo cupcake liners , then set them to the side to dry . <p> 6 . Now , before you start gluing the liners to the wreath , arrange them in the pattern you want to make sure you have enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the ring beginning with the 3 Jumbo ones . Add a small dab of glue to the back and press each one in its place on the ring . <p> 7 . Once the large ones are in place , glue the remaining cupcake liners in their place on the ring , letting them overlap just the smallest amount . Tip : if using hot glue or craft glue , a small dab is really all you need . If you add too much , it could soak through the cupcake liners or look lumpy . <p> 8 . Once all of the cupcake liners are glued to the wreath , you can add the stars to the twine in the middle . To do this simply add some glue to the back side of each star , attach it to the twine in your chosen pattern , and let dry completely . <p> 9 . Now all that is left is to add a loop of twine at the top for hanging , and you are done ! <p> I hope you enjoy this cupcake liner wreath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy and safe 4th of July ! <p> What kind of 4th of July crafts have you made ? <p> Like this craft ?

To you , the idea of giving notepads , pens , or books may not seem like a gift you 'd enjoy getting , but I can tell you from experience that for the newer teacher who has n't  has the time to build up her collection of supplies , this can be a wonderful gift ! Teachers wind up spending a lot of their own money buying supplies and materials , especially with budget cuts in education being so common these days . There are plenty of adorable ways to present these type gifts that will show you and your child actually put a lot of thought into it ! <p> In summary , do n't  spend a lot of time and money you may not have , give a gift that comes from the heart and really shows how much you appreciate what that teacher has done for your child . And be sure to remember any teacher aides , as well ! <p> Below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tag quotes , that are all low-cost and easy for your child and you to make ; gifts that Teacher is sure to love ! <p> 1 . How Fortunate Was I ! <p> This gift is a great idea if you know your childs teacher enjoys Chinese food . Grab a gift card from a Chinese restaurant along with several fortune cookies . Put the cookies and the gift card together in some cute packaging , and attach a tag that says : I Was So Very Fortunate to Have You as My Teacher ! <p> 2 . Such a Gas ! <p> Another cute gift card idea , this one is great for summer time , especially with the rising cost of gas . Purchase a gift card to a gas station and place it in a decorative holder . Maybe even purchase a toy car and tape it to that be creative ! Add a gift tag that reads : Hope Your Summer Is a Gas ! OR You Always Go The Extra Mile ! <p> 3 . A Sharp Idea ! <p> Going along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear container that a pack of colored Sharpie markers will fit into . Then tie it off with a ribbon , adding a tag that says : You Are A Sharpie ! <p> 4 . What It Mint To Me <p> This simple , yet fun gift is the perfect way to tell your teacher how much she meant to your child . <p> Take a pretty jar and fill it with three different types of mint candy . Arrange in layers , and add a pretty ribbon . Attach a gift tag with the following poem , or even just one of the individual lines . Find more detailed instructions here . <p> Thanks for your commit- " mint " to helping me learn . <p> Thank you for your encourag- " mint " to do my best . <p> Thank you for your involv- " mint " in my life , <p> Thank you for the invest- " mint " of your time . <p> Thanks for making each day an enjoy- " mint " , <p> and for creating an environ- " mint " for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> has really " mint " a lot to me . <p> 5 . Down to a Tea <p> If your childs teacher enjoys tea , this is a great gift for him or her ! Find a cute , reusable travel mug ( better yet , find one your child can decorate ) and fill it with packs of gourmet tea . Or put together a box filled with several different flavors . Attach a tag that says : Youve Got Teaching Down to a Tea ! <p> 6 . Owl Time ! <p> This is a great idea for students that have multiple teachers , or if you want to give a small something to all teachers involved in your child ; s education such as the coach , art teacher , music teacher , etc . Take some clear plastic treat bags and fill with candy . At the top of the bag , add an owls face made from construction paper , then attach a tag that reads : Owl Miss You ! OR Thanks for Making Me Wiser ! I Hope Your Summers a Hoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your teacher how sweet she is by filling a pretty glass jar with M&amp;Ms . Tie with a colorful ribbon and attach a gift tag with the following poem . Skittles could work as well ! <p> Mrs. Teachers name is a Sweetie ! <p> Green is for the inspiration you gave to me each day , Blue is for your patience in showing me the way , Orange is for your warmth and your caring style , Yellow is for the way you could always make me smile , Red is for my life that you touched this year , You 're a very special teacher , like this jar-that 's clear ! <p> Thank you so much , Student Name <p> 8 . A Fresh Idea ! <p> For this cute gift all you need is a cute glass or plastic container , some ribbon and several types of mints . Fill the jar with the mints , add a ribbon for decoration , and add a tag with either : You Were Mint to Teach ! OR the following poem : ( you can also just use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your commit- " mint " to helping me learn , <p> Thanks for your encourag- " mint " to do my best . <p> Thank you for your involv- " mint " in my life , <p> Thank you for the invest- " mint " of your time . <p> Thanks for making each day an enjoy- " mint " , and for creating an environ- " mint " for me to learn and grow . <p> Everything you 've done this year , <p> has really " mint " a lot to me ! <p> 9 . Grow and Learn <p> This is a great idea for teachers with a green thumb . Find a small ceramic pot and have your child decorate it . Include a couple of packs of seeds and add this adorable free printable Thank You For Helping Me Grow ! sign from Sippy Cup Mom . OR , stick the sign in a full sized plant ! <p> Following is a recipe for homemade bath salts that is very easy to make and quite inexpensive . I use lavender in mine , but you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some examples include Eucalyptus and Vanilla , peppermint and Orange , Rosemary , Lemon and even Honey Almond . <p> What You Need : <p> a glass jar with lid ( I used an 8 ounce jar for this recipe , adjust as needed ) <p> ribbon <p> 1 cup Epsom Salt <p> 3 to 4 drops Lavender Essential Oil <p> 1 tbsp . Baking Soda this is optional , but I have heard it can help alleviate minor skin irritations <p> 1 drop purple food coloring also optional , it will add a bit of color to the salts <p> funnel <p> What You Do : <p> 1 . Add the Epsom salt and baking soda ( if using ) into a glass bowl . <p> 2 . Add your essential oil and food coloring ( if using ) . <p> 3 . Mix together for several minutes ( at least until the color is evenly distributed ) . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

This year I have lots of fun crafts and treats planned , the first of which I think you will love ! Since my Halloween candy-filled ornaments were such a huge hit , I took inspiration from them to make these adorable Thanksgiving Turkey treats ! <p> Filled with candy , these Thanksgiving Turkey treats are perfect for classroom parties , the kids table , or you could even add a name card and use them as place holders at your Thanksgiving feast ! <p> Like some of my other crafts , I used my Cricut Explore to make these turkeys . However , if you do n't  have a die cutting machine , no problem ! All you need is some cardstock and scissors , a feather template ( or you can trace your kids hands ! ) , and you are good to go ! If you DO have a Cricut , you can use my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary items , just click them in the above list . I have links embedded in each to make things easier on you !

Swirl it around inside , rinse and place upside down on a rack to dry. * <p> Now fill the ornament with Reeses Pieces- , and replace the cap . <p> Using a cutting machine such as the Cricut or Silhouette ( or even pre-made stencils ) , to create the feathers from cardstock . If you have a Cricut machine , you can use this Thanksgiving Turkey Treats feathers file . <p> Next , glue the feathers together like in the picture above . Then using hot glue , attach the feathers to the back of the ornament . <p> For the head , cut out a circle measuring 1.4 by 1.4 inches from brown cardstock . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waddle ( I used sort of an elongated tear drop design ) from red cardstock . <p> Now glue the wiggly eyes , the beak and the waddle on to the circle you cut for the head . Then hot glue the head onto the front of the silver cap of the ornament . <p> Now all that is left is to make the legs . You 'll need 6 ( six inch long ) pipe cleaners for each turkey , three per leg . Starting about one and a half inches up from the bottom end of the three pipe cleaners , begin twisting them together . Continue twisting until you reach the top . Next , spread out the bottom part ( the part that is not twisted together ) of the pipe cleaners to form the toes , and then make a 90- bend so the feet are pointing upward . <p> Using hot glue , attach each leg to the bottom edge of the ornament , making sure that at least one-and-a half inches of excess pipe cleaner is sticking out the back side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your turkey up . Attach the other leg the same way . <p> And there you have it .

Use the social sharing buttons below the post title to share with friends and family ! <p> *Many ornaments are marked not for use with food . These particular ones were not marked at all . Although I am not sure how much , if any , types of chemical would leach into the candy , it is something you may want to consider . I have seen similar , food safe ones on Amazon . 130174 @qwx330174 <h> Comments <p> Is it safe to use the plastic ornaments with food . This idea and so many I 've seen with food in ornaments look super cute . The ornament boxes often say " not for use with food " . I saw an adorable hot chocolate idea to use with ornaments that I want to do but not sure what type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't  get sick from the chemicals in the plastic or the fact that they were made in China . <p> Hi Pam ! These particular ones are not marked as being either safe or not . Although I still made sure to wash them really well before adding the candy . However , you can find ones that are food safe . I have seen some food safe ones on Amazon , although I 've only seen round , not the disc shape . They also open up from the middle , so they have a seam as opposed to an ornament cap . I still think they would work for the hot cocoa ones you have seen though ! Now , were I to make these for an actual class party , or to give as treats at Thanksgiving , I would get the others that are for sure food safe . Although I have wondered that for something like this , where the candy will only be in there for a day or two , how much chemicals , if any , would leach into it .

Your loved ones will be delighted to receive a gift that has been thoughtfully selected . It is also important to follow etiquette rules when you are choosing a gift to send . Here are some helpful suggestions to help you choose a wedding gift and ensure that it will be warmly received . <h> Follow Traditions <p> Try to send your wedding gift in advance of the wedding . If you are not able to send the gift prior to the wedding , then you may be able to leave it at a gift table at the reception . Gifts are typically not brought to the actual wedding , but many receptions often have areas where wedding presents and envelopes containing monetary gifts can be left . If you order a gift online , then you may be able to have it sent directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridal showers or similar events that will offer you a chance to gift the couple with your selection . If you attend both the shower and the wedding , then traditional etiquette rules state that you should provide a gift for each occasion . While some people feel that sending a gift up to a year after the wedding is appropriate , you should avoid a delay in sending a gift . <h> Consider the Registry <p> If the couple has created a gift registry , then you may want to spend a bit of time looking it over . You are not obligated to buy from the registry , but you can still use the registry to gain insight into the desired tastes of the newlyweds . For example , you may find an exquisite item that you feel the new couple would fall in love with . A quick glance over the wedding gift registry can help you decide which color or style would be best suited for the recipients . If you have a close relationship with the couple , then many of the registry selections may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to consider a gift that has special meaning to the couple . Think about special activities or hobbies that the couple enjoys and use that as inspiration to choose a personable gift . For example , Sweet Baskets offers you the chance to order gift baskets for wedding parties that may suit the tastes of the newlyweds perfectly . <h> Spend Appropriately <p> It can be difficult to determine how much money you should spend on a wedding gift . Many people feel obligated to spend an extravagant amount if the wedding is at an elegant venue . A popular myth alludes to the fact that a guest should be certain to spend at least the amount of the dinner that is being provided to each guest . A full dinner at most wedding venues can be incredibly expensive , but you should not feel obligated to spend more on a gift than you are comfortable with . When you are deciding how much money to spend on a gift , simply consider your relationship with the couple . <h> Consider Group Gifting <p> If you want to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may want to consider joining together with friends or other wedding guests to do so . Groups of guests can combine their money to purchase an outdoor grill or expensive kitchen appliance . Newlyweds will appreciate receiving these larger items . If you do not find an item that you would like to gift the couple with , then you may consider offering a gift card . While gift cards are not as personable , they will certainly be appreciated . <p> Weddings are a happy occasion , and selecting a gift should be a fun part of the celebration . Whether you choose to shop from a gift registry or make your own selection , the happy couple will appreciate your thoughtfulness . Getting married is a wonderful beginning to a new chapter , and selecting a special wedding gift is a way to express your gratitude to the people in your life . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

And when you have children playing indoors and large groups of people often times things wind up broken . Instead of throwing them away , try one of the many Loctite adhesives . They have a product for almost anything you need to fix , and I had the opportunity to find out for myself just how well they work when I received a couple of their items to try . <p> Locitite is well-known for their consumer and industrial adhesives . They make all kinds of adhesives for every job large or small from Super Glue to Construction Adhesive . I was sent two different types of Super Glue , a gel and a liquid , and would n't you know that within days of it being shipped , I broke a vase I inherited from my dad ! On the bright side , I now had the ideal situation to test Loctite Super Glue . <p> Loctite Ultra Gel Control Super Glue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leather , paper and plastics , Loctite Ultra Gel Control Super Glue is strong and durable and made to resist impact , shock , vibration , weather and temperature change . This adhesive is the one you want to apply on items that get everyday use or are subject to harsh conditions . It is water and weather proof , so it is ideal for outside items such as gardening tools , flower pots , metal car parts , wiper blades , toys and more . A tiny amount is all you need to form a secure , long-lasting bond . One thing I love about this adhesive is that since it is a gel , you have more time to align the pieces before the glue sets permanently , plus it does drip or run down the sides onto your fingers ! <p> Loctite Ultra Liquid Control Super Glue <p> Loctite Ultra Liquid Control Super Glue is ideal for variety of porous and non-porous surfaces such as metal , glass , wood , leather , paper , ceramic , rubber , plastics and more . It dries fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes to create a strong , durable bond . The glue is tough enough to withstand everyday use , and is resistant to moisture , most chemicals and freezing temperatures . Plus , it is dishwasher safe , making this formula perfect for fixing broken dishes , bowls , cups and fine china . It is a liquid formula , so you need to have the pieces aligned and ready to go . <p> My Opinion of Loctite <p> Both formulas come in uniquely designed , side-squeeze bottles that are made to give you even more control for precise application . Other brands of Super Glue come in those teeny tiny bottles on which you can barely get a grip which makes applying the glue hard and messy . Loctites bottles are larger so you have more to hold on to , and shaped so that they " fit " your hand and prevent your fingers from being glued together . The sides of the bottles have ridges for both a non-slip grip and a way to control how much glue comes out . <p> To apply the glue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glue you need . The long necks on the bottles make it east to apply to hard to reach spots , and the tiny holes make it easy to apply the smallest amount of glue . The caps are designed to be secure and air-tight to help extend the life and the formula of the glue . <p> I chose to use the liquid formula on the vase , and it worked great ! I just applied a thin line of glue along the broken edge and placed the two edges together . I held it together applying light pressure for about 20 seconds , and it was as good as new ! <p> Loctite products are available both online and off . You can find them at your local mass merchandiser , hardware stores , craft stores and even some grocery stores and drug stores . If you want to search for a location near you , use the location finder on the Loctite website . And while you are there , be sure to check out their vast selection of other products including all types if adhesives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always have things getting broken ( &amp; what seems like a million little ziploc bags of broken figurines ) , so this glue would be perfect ! Not to mention the fact that I really love the bottle it comes in . <p> Do not buy this product ! The " Ultra Liquid Control " is anything but . The nozzle on my first bottle broke off . Then , with the second bottle , all I wanted was one or two drops on my Navy Veteran insignia . It spurted out all over my fingers . I used Goof Off to remove it , save your time and money and buy another brand . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Ones that contain mostly or only natural ingredients are the ones I find work the best . And while I have tried several great cleansers , moisturizers and scrubs , I had n't  had much luck finding a mask that would n't irritate my skin . Until I tried 7th Heaven face masks . <p> 7th Heaven , previously known as Montagne Jeunesse , makes a variety of affordable and effective skin care treatments sold in individual sachets . Why the name change ? Well this year ( 2015 ) marked the big 3-0 for Montagne Jeunesse . As a way to celebrate , they changed the name to 7th Heaven based on feedback from their supporters and fans . Along with the name change , 7th Heaven have also given their masks a makeover , as well as added all natural spring water to their list of natural ingredients . Aside from that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from plant and mineral sources , with minimal processing . Their products are also vegetarian-certified , never tested on animals , and many are even suitable for vegans . <p> **UPDATE** As of 2016 , the categories of masks are now called Mud , Peel Off , Self Heat , Exfoliating , Fabric Serum Infused , and Fabric Clay Infused . <h> 7th Heaven Face Masks Review : Argan Oil Mud and Tea Tree Peel-Off <p> So far I 've tried the Tea Tree Peel Off and the Argan Oil Mud masks , and I 'd be hard pressed to pick my favorite as they both work great ! <p> Part of the Mud mask line , the Argan Oil Mud mask is ideal for combination and oily skin . Moroccan Argan Oil and antioxidant rich Acai Berries work together to deeply cleanse pores , balance oils and bring tired , dull skin back to life . Simply cleanse your face as usual , apply the mask , relax for about 15 minutes , then rinse with warm water . <p> The first thing I noticed when I opened the single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scent . The mud mask itself has a nice creamy consistency and there is enough in the sachet to spread an even layer over my entire face and still have enough left for a second treatment . The mud mask began drying rather quickly , and was completely dry within 11 minutes . Once I rinsed , my skin looked so clean and fresh , and it felt very soft and supple without any over-drying ! Ive been using this particular mud mask for about 4 weeks now , and I still love the way it leaves my skin looking and feeling ! <p> The second 7th Heaven face mask Ive been using for a little over a month now is the Tea Tree Peel-Off mask . This super-soothing peel-off mask uses Tea Tree , Witch Hazel &amp; Canadian Willowherb to de-stress and soothe your skin while purging your pores of dirt , oil and other impurities . It is ideal for all skin types including oily , normal and combination , and works very well at targeting combination skin in the T-Zone and other problem areas . <p> Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great scent , too !

They 're not " all natural " at least , the one I found ( a manuka honey peel-off ) had artificial ingredients . That does n't  necessarily make it bad , but you should read the ingredients before you believe anything they say . Natural things can be bad for you , too nightshade and poison ivy , for example . Most beauty products make up pseudoscience and technobabble , so you should n't just believe what 's on the packet . The best and most affordable to clean your face is with warm water . <p> I really enjoyed reading the package , the grammatical errors and made-up terms ( " flower nutrients " , for example ) were hilarious . <p> Hi Human ! I totally agree that there are some ingredients in there that are not 100% all natural which is why I felt it best to show the pics of the ingredients and not mention the exact words 100% all natural . Unfortunately , you make a good point about not believing everything you read . However , for me , compared to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the lesser of the evils ! = <p> Only in the sense that they sent product to try ( I think my disclosure image is at the bottom ) . As always , I only give my honest opinion , and if a product is no good , I will mention that ( and have before in some of my other reviews ) . = 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

As of 12/12/15 , I have updated all links . = <p> SIDE NOTE : Many readers and I have not been able to find a working US website . If you need to get in touch with them about your product , I 'd suggest going through the contact form that is on the Australian website I link to in the post . Also , I hate that some of the people commenting here seem to be having issues with their product . As an update on mine , I am 2 weeks shy of having been using it for 2 years , and I have had no issues other than having to figure out how it worked do to poor instructions . I have added another paragraph below with some very basic use instructions that I hope help out ! Happy reading ! <p> If you , like me , live in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to find space for all of your small appliances such as your microwave , coffee maker , steamer , slow cooker and so on is a literal nightmare ! And if you have little time for cooking due to work , kids and caring for the home , then finding an appliance that saves time while still making delicious food is like a blessing ! So when I was offered the opportunity to review the 6-in-1 Multi-Cooker by New Wave Kitchen Appliances , I was hoping that many of my counter space issues , as well as some time issues , could be solved ! <p> New to the US , New Wave Appliances is an Australian-based company who for 8 years now has been making best-selling modern appliances that use the latest technology to help you cook healthy meals easier and faster . Their innovative 6-in-1 Multi-Cooker is only one example of their innovative products . The Multi-Cooker is actually a Slow Cooker , Pressure Cooker , Deep Fryer , Soup//Rice Maker , Steam Cooker and a Saute/Browner , all in one convenient cooking appliance . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , but after using each function several times , I am in love ! <p> The 6-in-1 Multi-Cooker has a modern design with a digital control panel and a sleek , black finish that looks great with any color scheme . It has a 6 liter capacity , and features 2 different pressure levels ( high and low ) , a pre-set timer , a digital timer with countdown function and a Keep Warm function that automatically switches on once it is finished cooking . It comes with a removable , non-stick inner bowl , a wire frying basket , a steam rack and a even a cheap measuring cup and ladle . But one of the best parts is , it takes up no more counter space than your average sized slow cooker ! <p> Browning this function is ideal for starting for starting your recipes when sauteing , browning or shallow frying is required . For example , when making chili , you can saute your veggies and brown the meat , then when ready , add the remaining ingredients and set it to slow cook throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of my favorite functions and there are literally hundreds of different recipes you can easily throw together , set the timer and leave it be while you go about your business around the house . I love that it has a delayed timing start of up to 9.5 hours , a slow cooking time of up to 9.5 hours and will automatically switch to a Keep Warm function once cooking is completed . <p> Rice Cooker this function is perfect for cooking steamed rice and risotto , as well as soups and broths . I love how easy it is to make steamed rice like you can get at Chinese restaurants ! Just add the rice , the water and set to cook for about 7 minutes and you get perfectly steamed rice every time ! <p> Steam Cooker another favorite setting , this is perfect for making steamed veggies and so much more . All you have to do is set the proper amount of time , then add your desired liquid , your steam rack and your favorite food , and press the start button . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lid , and is easy to set with the twist of the knob . <p> Pressure Cooking This was actually my first experience with using a pressure cooker , and it was much easier than I thought . A handy guide for First Timers is included inside the Users Manual that tells you the best meats for pressure cooking and shows the recommended pressure setting and the cooking times . <p> Maxi Cooking or Deep Fryer the absolutely best way to make crispy , homemade french fries and true Southern Fried Chicken ! The unit comes with a wire basket with handle , so you just place the basket in the unit , fill the unit to the correct level with your oil , then press the Maxi Cook button . <p> As I mentioned above , a Users Guide is included with the Multi-Cooker that features instructions for each individual function , along with handy tips for first time users . Unfortunately , the Users Guide is not very detailed in certain areas and leaves a lot to be figured out . Because of this , and some reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use : <p> to turn the machine one , simply plug it in . The entire panel should light up blue , and you will here a beep . <p> use the MultiFunction button to select between Saute/Brown , Slow Cook , Rice and Steam . Which ever function you choose will be illuminated , although you have to look close to see it as the rest of the panel is illuminated , too , which can make it hard to see which function is selected . <p> once you have your cooking method selected , adjust the cooking time in minutes by pressing the + and buttons <p> hit the Start/Cancel button one time to start or twice to cancel . <p> to use it as a pressure cooker , close the lid , turn the pressure valve on top to sealed , select either the High Pressure button or the Low Pressure Button . Adjust your time using the +arrow button , then hit start . While the machine is warming up , the first double-digit marquee will flash on the screen . Once it reaches the correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cooking time will begin to count down . Once cooking is finished , release the pressure by turning the valve to exhaust . <p> *Pressure Limiting Valve this valve is designed to sit loosely on the lid of your 6 in 1 appliance . It will rotate 360 degrees and will not lock into place when placed into position . The valve will tighten during the cooking process and then once the pressure is released from cooking will return to a loose valve fitting. * <p> *Remember it is recommended that you use one of the other functions first ( e.g. Brown to start off your recipe ) which will allow the Multi-Cooker to heat the food throughout and will speed up the pressure cooking time . <p> to use the MaxiCook function , select the button and hit start . <p> The unit also comes with a small recipe book that has some simple and delicious recipes ! <p> I love the versatility and convenience of this 6-in-1 Multi-Cooker . I can cook hundreds of delicious meals with just a few quick steps and the simple push of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand my cooking expertise and try things I have not been able to before . And I love that it takes up no more than just a few inches of counter space ! <p> To order your 6-in-1 Multi-Cooker , visit the New Wave Appliances website where you can find this as well as many other innovative small kitchen appliances . It is also available at select Target and Walmart stores across the nation , as well as on Amazon ( affiliate link ) . And be sure to connect with New Wave Appliances on both Facebook for the latest products , tips , recipes , promotions and more ! 130178 @qwx330178 <p> That IS really handy ! We have a small apartment , and not much space for appliances . I wish I 'd known something like this existed when I first moved out on my own . I 've already spent money on a rice maker/steamer and slow cooker . This is actually a great price for everything that you 're getting . If you bought these individually youd spend hundreds more ! <p> The instruction booklet is NOT clear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows instruction for the 5 in 1 . Like many others it does not show how to use the pre timer function and trying to put this lid on it " frustrating " to say the least . Where can I get a manual for the 6 in 1 ? <p> Hi , mine came with the appropriate book although it is not very clear . Have you tried searching on Google for the pdf of the booklet ? I know I have lost many instruction booklets before , and when I search for the product name with the words " instruction manual " in the search terms . it will pull up the booklet you can read or print . If you can not find it that way , I 'd contact the company . I hope this helps ! ! <p> Hi Mandy ! Thanks for the new links ( a bit late on my part sorry ! ) ! I went to swap the links out , but neither of these are working anymore either . I did find a new one , but once again it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US , please let us know and I 'll make sure to change them . Thanks again ! <p> Hi Kevin , Yes , I noticed that as well . Unfortunately , I 've also looked around but can not find another working US website either . If you need to get in touch with them , there is a contact tab on the website I have listed in the post . Hopefully that will work for you . Have a great day ! Alaina <p> My 6 in 1 cooker wont work .. just gives E4 message &amp; NuWave has n't  offered a replacement or any other solution ! They only replied I needed to Register my Appliance which I did but still no solution to this PROBLEM ! .. not impressed ! ! ! ! ! <p> Hi CD Colburn . I am truly sorry to hear they are not helping . I am disappointed in what I am hearing about their customer service , and wish there was something I could do . I 'd be very irritated as well . Did you talk with them on the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is located in Australia , but have not had luck finding a phone number for the US unless they update the one on their site . I hope you get this resolved , and thank you for letting my readers know . <p> As CD Coburn , my cooker will not work anymore with the same E4 message . I did not fill out the warranty because I did n't  think it would fail after only four months . I 'm just outside the return of three months to the store where I purchased it . Any recommendations ? <p> Hi Stanley , I was not impressed with the instruction manual at all . I tinkered with mine until I figured it out . The best way I know to describe it to you is that you need to squeeze the non-user end of the handle together until you can pop it into the slots on the side of the basket . I hope that helps somewhat . <p> Hi Janice ! My apologies as I had not realized New Wave had changed their website URL . The links have now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact form that you can use . Here is the link : http : **26;28;TOOLONG I hope you are able to get yours working ! I had trouble at first figuring out how mine worked as the directions were not the best , but I still love my multi-cooker ! Enjoy ! Alaina <p> Unfortunately these have terrible ratings , very inconsistent . It either works great or gives you tons of problems . I got one myself , used once ( all was great ) but 2nd time around got an error code E4 and nothing would happen after this , cant use it . Over the 1 yr warranty period , no receipt and tons of ppl all over the web having same issues with error code . Sadly , waste of $$ really wanted to like it . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

@@29514786 @3214786/ <h> Bell Lifestyle Products Review Sound Sleep No. 23 <p> Are you one of those people who have trouble sleeping ? Either falling asleep or staying asleep ? I am . I can not even begin to tell you how many nights I lay awake reading until the wee hours of the morning waiting for sleep to come . And once I am lucky to doze off , I wake right back up within an hour or two , and begin the whole routine again . And while there are plenty of prescription and over-the-counter sleep aids , I do not want to use a non-natural product to help me sleep , especially since so many are habit-forming and leave you feeling groggy in the morning . As a blogger for NaturallySavvy.com , I was recently offered the opportunity to try an herbal sleep remedy made by Bell Lifestyle Products , being that it is an all-natural product , I decided to give it a try . <p> Bell is well-known for their all-natural , herbal blends . Formed in 1996 , they now offer over 50 herbal products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent a bottle of their Sound Sleep #23 ( formerly known as Snoring and Sleep Apnea Eze ) which is one of their Top 10 Best Selling products . Sound Sleep #23 is a blend of a naturally occurring chemical in the body and soothing , sedating natural herbs , each of which has its own relaxing , sleep-inducing effect . <h> How Bell Sound Sleep #23 Works <p> Sound Sleep #23 starts with melatonin which is a chemical that originates in the pineal gland near the center of the brain , and has been shown to help induce sleep faster , promote deeper sleepand promote a more refreshed , alert state of mind upon awakening . Melatonin is most actively produced in darkness and its production is significantly reduced in light . Research and studies suggest that there is a strong correlation between melatonin production and the bodys circadian sleep rhythm . <p> Chamomile : has been shown to promote tranquility , support a calm , relaxed mood at bedtime , benefit sleep patterns and enhance daytime functioning . <p> Passion flower : has long been used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better sleep in adults who suffer from occasional interrupted sleep patterns . <p> Skullcap : used by Native Americans to enhance relaxation , skullcap has been shown to be calming and promote restful , refreshing and rejuvenating sleep . <p> Valerian : Valerian root has been known for thousands of years as a calming herb . Researchers suggest that its soothing and calming properties can help improve sleep quality , especially in menopausal women . <p> MSM : Methylsulfonylmethane ( MSM ) is an organic sulfur that has been shown to help promote faster recovery from physical fatigue . It was included in this formula to help you wake up easily and leave grogginess behind quickly . <h> My Review of Bell Sound Sleep #23 <p> Let me begin by saying that I was extremely skeptical about this product . Not only about its ability to help me fall asleep and stay asleep , but also its claim that I would wake up in the morning without feeling drugged or groggy . <p> I began taking Sound Sleep #23 around 4 weeks ago . As suggested , I began by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . The capsules are not terribly large , maybe about 5/8 ? in length , and are quite easy to swallow . However , when you open the bottle , be prepared for a very strong , and not very pleasant , scent ! Following the included sleep instructions , I did my best not to lie on my back which can promote snoring and aggravate sleep apnea , but instead slept on my side . Since my usual habit is to get in bed and immediately start reading , I had to make myself leave my book alone and lay there . Without the book I was fully expecting to lay there for quite a while , listening to the thoughts in my head and my husbands occasional snores and snorts . To my surprise , I hardly remember falling asleep ! According to my husband , I was out within 15 minutes ; that is pretty close to amazing ! He also mentioned that there was no snoring on my part as he claims there usually is once I do finally sleep however , I am positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ! Men , honestly ! Geesh ! <p> When my alarm went off the next morning , I was shocked to realize I had actually slept through the night ! And better yet , once I got up and got moving , there was no groggy or drugged feeling at all . Bell Sound Sleep #23 actually worked ! Being the skeptic I am , I wanted to use it again the next night just to be sure I was n't experiencing an anomaly ! Sure enough , a restful nights sleep occurred again that night , and the next and the next . After a few days I cut down to 2 capsules and found they still worked great ! Even my husband has used them with the same positive results . <p> Where You Can Find Bell Sound Sleep #23 <p> Bell products are sold both online and off .

For the longest time I did n't  bother with making my own smoothies because I am the only one in our home that drinks them . Since I only need to make enough for one person , using my regular blender is inconvenient . Not only is it a hassle to use and clean , but it makes too much for just one person .

While we are slowly remodeling , we have yet to get to the closets , and they need help ! Most of them are a pretty good size and nice and bright , but the one in our hallway is just way too dark . Hardly any light gets into it even with the hall light on . My solution ? A Mini LED Motion Sensor Light from Freetoo- . <p> Designed to illuminate closets , hallways , cabinets , and more , this motion-activated , little LED light is the perfect size for any small space that needs some extra light . Measuring just 2.75 inches tall , 1.49 inches wide , and 1.29 inches from front to back , it is lightweight and very easy to hang . It comes with everything you need to easily mount it including a plastic , clip-on harness and 3 different options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape , and magnetic tape . <p> Equipped with a " highly sensitive " sensor , this bright little light will turn on when it detects any movement , and will remain lit for 10 seconds before turning itself back off . And if you want to use it as a regular light that you switch on manually , there is a switch on the very top which gives you that option . This switch is actually a very handy feature as you can easily remove the light from its mounting bracket and carry it around with you to use as a flashlight . <p> The light is powered by 3 AAA batteries which you will need to buy , and according to the manufacturer , in motion sensing mode , the light can be used for close to 200 days with an average lighting of 10 times per day . Of course , this will also depend on the quality of battery you use . <p> Despite its small size , this motion activated light puts out a surprising amount of extra bright white light ! I can clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I love how it lights up the moment I open the door . Another handy feature I really like is that when in motion sensing mode , it only lights up when motion is detected and it is dark . If you place it in a bright room and walk past it , it will not come on . This is perfect for saving battery life ! <p> There are a variety of ways to use this handy little light around the house ! Use it in the hallway or in the bathroom as a nightlight , place it in the stairway , the basement , under the cabinets , in the pantry or even inside the freezer ! Anywhere you need some bright light , this mountable LED light does the job perfectly . <p> The Freetoo Mini Sensor Light can be purchased for just $8.95 on Amazon . You can also get a 3 pack for right around $20 . I plan on getting several more , as they are very handy and very well made ! I actually like this little light much better than some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within weeks , but have to be re-hung every few weeks or so as well !

Begin adding the images . I used the files listed above . For Frankenstein , I unattached the image and used his hair , scar , mouth and eyes only . Make sure you resize the images to fit your specific containers . Most of mine were between 2 ? and 3 ? in width . <p> Once your design is ready to be cut , place your vinyl on the mat , set your machine to Vinyl , and hit Go . Sit back and relax while it does its thing . <p> Once everything is cut , carefully remove the vinyl from the mat . Then , slowly peel off all excess vinyl surrounding the design you will not need . Use the weeding tool to remove any remaining vinyl you do not need . <p> Now cut a piece of transfer tape to size . Peel the backing off of the transfer tape and apply the grid-side over each design . <p> Next , peel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprinted onto the transfer tape . Now all that 's left to do is add the images to the container . <p> Once finished , fill each container with the Celebration by Frey and Sixlets candy .

@@29514799 @3214799/ <h> OurPact : iOS App for Managing Your Childs Screen Time <p> This is a sponsored post on behalf of **25;83;TOOLONG and ParentsWare . Regardless , all opinions are my own . <h> OurPact Managing Your Childs Screen Time <p> Thanks to advances in technology there is a world of learning right at our childrens fingertips . While this can be a wonderful thing , it can also be frustrating especially to parents who are wanting their children to benefit from all technology offers , yet at the same time learn to balance the amount of time they spend using that technology . The OurPact app can help you when it comes to managing your childs screen time . <p> With OurPact , you can manage your entire familys device usage under one simple platform . All you have to do is set up an individual profile for each of your children . In addition , if your child has multiple devices such as an iPhone and iPad , you can manage each one as long as you set up each device up under a different name . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since OurPact is a free app , you just download it on your device from the iTunes store then set up your profile . Once your name and password is set , the app will ask you to visit pair.ourpact.com in Safari from the iOS device you want to control in order to pair the devices . <p> From there all it takes is the simple push of a button to sync your device with your childs . Once they are paired you can go in and begin creating schedules and blocks . <p> Using OurPact <p> OurPact provides two types of blocks : manual and scheduled . With a scheduled block , you can create a schedule to restrict app and internet usage on your childs device during any given time frame . You have the ability to name the schedule , set both the start and end times , and select the days of the week ( and/or weekend ) you want the block enforced . You can also set up as many schedules as you like . For example , we have one set up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family time , and yet another at bedtime . <p> When you enable a block , OurPact blocks all third-party apps and most native apps . This means that apps such as Facebook , Instagram and SnapChat will be blocked , as well as Safari and any apps your child has downloaded from the App Store or iTunes . As you can see in the picture below , all apps are accessible during the times your child is allowed to use them . <p> However , when a block is in effect , the apps will no longer show up on your childs devices screen , therefore effectively blocking them from using those apps until the scheduled block ends . <p> The second type of block OurPact allows you to use is a manual block . With manual you can block or unblock at a touch of a button instead of having to alter the entire schedule . For example , if your childs usage is scheduled to be blocked during school hours , but its a school holiday , just tap the " Grant Access " tab on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you prefer . Likewise , if during a scheduled unblocked time you want to block access , simply tap the " Block Access " tab from the Family screen and set the amount of time you prefer . In both cases , once that time is over , the app will automatically revert back to the original schedule . <p> One of my favorite features next to the ability to schedule , of course is the fact that I can see at all times if my childs device is managed and working properly . If for some reason it is not , I will immediately get a warning message in the app letting me know to reconnect my childs devices . <p> My Verdict <p> Personally I love this app ! Not only is it easy to set up , it is easy to use . You can just set up your preferred schedules , and then let it do its thing . While I do n't  want to deny my child any opportunity to learn , nor do I want him to spend all of his time with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to limit the amount of time he spends on his device , while also helping him learn to moderate his own habits . Just like everything else , technology needs to be used in moderation , and OurPact is a great tool for helping parents teach their children that . <p> The OurPact app requires iOS 7.0 or later , and is compatible with iPhone , iPad , and iPod touch . Although it is not currently available for Android , the developers are working on an Android version . Download the app for free after all what do you have to lose ? Its all about managing your childs screen time . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

@@29514803 @3214803/ 130178 @qwx330178 <p> For several years now I have been exploring the world of essential oils , and their many uses . Now they are quickly gaining popularity as more people learn about them and come to respect them for their natural qualities and their versatility . If you are not familiar with essential oils , they are the extremely potent oils that are extracted from plant leaves , flowers , stems , roots and even bark.They can be used for everything from cleaning your house to dealing with physical ailments . Traditionally there are three primary methods of using oils : aromatically , topically , or taken internally . No matter how you use them , you always need to be sure that you are using high quality , therapeutic grade , pure essential oils , and that you always follow all instructions and warnings . <h> High Quality Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils <p> The majority of the essential oils that are on the market today are produced solely for their aromatic quality , and are not of high enough quality to be used on your skin or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreational aromatherapy , you will more than likely be disappointed . What you want to find and use are oils that are of therapeutic grade . These are oils that are without getting too technical both pure ( containing only the volatile aromatic compounds of the plant ) and potent ( having the same chemical composition from batch to batch ) . A lot also depends on how the plants are grown and how the oils are removed from the plants . I recommend doing some research about therapeutic grade oils before you begin . <h> Uses for Essential Oils <p> As I mentioned above , essential oils have a variety of uses . Many people like to use them aromatically , meaning for their scents . Every oil has its own unique scent and can have amazing effects on moods and atmospheres in a room . For example , lavender is highly popular for its calming properties , while lemongrass is used to combat mental fatigue . <p> Essential oils can also be used for many things around the home including cleaning and disinfecting , first aid and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using essential oils in their own homemade cleaning products . And why not ? Essential oils are natural , non-toxic and are not harmful to the environment , animals or humans as are their manufactured counterparts . Tea Tree Oil is one of the most popular oils to use in cleaning because of its antimicrobial properties , as are peppermint and lemon for their clean , fresh scents and cleaning powers . <p> You can also find many bath and beauty products that include essential oils both for their scent and for their natural healing properties . doTERRAs Essential Skin Care line is one such example . This family of skin care products uses the natural power of essential oils along with the latest in skin care technology to keep your skin looking and feeling healthy , and to target the visible signs of aging . The line includes everything from cleansers to scrubs to pore reducing toner . <p> My personal favorite is the doTERRA Essential Skin Care Facial Cleanser which uses the Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade- essential oils of Peppermint and Melaleuca . Peppermint has a clean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar menthol . Melaleuca , also known as Tea Tree Oil , is popular for its regenerative and cleansing properties when applied to skin . These oils , along with vegetable extracts , work to gently , yet thoroughly cleanse and remove impurities , leaving your skin looking and feeling clean and healthy . <p> There is so much I love about this cleanser . From its thick , rich consistency , to its invigorating scent . I have very sensitive skin , and at first I was worried that the cleanser would irritate my face . I need not have worried . I have been using it twice a day for several weeks now , and my skin looks wonderful ! I only need to use a small amount to get my skin squeaky clean , and I love how easily it rinses off , leaving my skin clean and incredibly soft . Plus I love that it does not dry my skin out like other cleansers have . <h> Tips to Remember About Essential Oils <p> While essential oils are a wonderful alternative to many man-made products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First of all , essential oils are very concentrated and very potent ; they should always be diluted when using . Just remember that a little bit will go a long way . Secondly , always make sure you do your research before using essential oils as they are extremely powerful and some are not recommended in certain circumstances ( such as while pregnant ) . Most important of all , essential oils are in no way intended to treat or cure serious medical condition , nor are they meant to replace a doctors advice . 130174 @qwx330174 130182 @qwx330182 130181 @qwx330181 <h> Comments <p> Hi Ryannedanielle !

I pray for my friends and I pray for my loved ones , and I even pray for those I do not know whose story I 've heard or read . So many times I 'll hear about the needs or special requests of family or friends . Or I 'll turn on the news to learn about another tragedy , or see the requests for prayers on social media . And everyday I send those prayers , and do my best to remember them again through out the week . <p> Yet even with the best of intentions my life gets busy , and there have been times that Ive been forgetful in remembering to offer those prayers again . But God tells us to pray continuously . That 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Berry , these bowls provide a beautiful reminder to take a few moments and offer those prayers . <h> The Story Behind PrayerBowls <p> A few years ago , Karen found herself extremely sick . She also found herself the recipient of the prayers of family , friends , and even strangers . One day , Angie , a lady whom she had never met , told her that she had been praying for her daily for a year . She would keep a prayer bowl on her table and each day she would ask the Lord 's blessing on the people who were in need at that time . Karen loved this idea so much she decided to create a distinctive prayer bowl for herself and a few others . And PrayerBowls were born . <p> How PrayerBowls Work <p> If you are not familiar with the concept behind a prayer bowl , its simply a way to remind yourself of those you need to lift up in prayer . Just place your prayer bowl where you sit daily , and jot down the names of those whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Place those papers in the bowl . Then , each day , either alone or with your family , go through the papers in the bowl and lift up those in need to the Lord . <p> PrayerBowls are made of porcelain and are available in two beautiful designs , Angie or Celeste . Each one comes with a bundle of prayer cards , and is packaged in a pretty and sturdy case that ties securely shut with a ribbon . <p> When I first saw the Celeste Bowl , I knew it would make the perfect Mothers Day gift for my sister . A relatively recent convert to Christianity , her faith is exceedingly strong and inspiring . The Celeste bowl features a beautiful , intricate gold cross right in the very center of the white porcelain plate . Gold scallops decorate the edges of the plate , and five hand-applied Swarovski crystals emphasize the plates elegance . In a graceful scrip around the delicate edges of the plate is the following verse from Romans 12:12 : Rejoicing in hope , patient in tribulation , continuing steadfast in prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! In fact , I like it so much , that I plan on ordering one for myself as well . <h> Free PrayerBowl App <p> In addition to having a physical prayer bowl to help remind you , there is also the added bonus of a virtual prayer bowl available through the PrayerBowls app . Since most of us are never too far from our cell phones , the PrayerBowls app makes our prayer lists easily accessible and available whenever and wherever we have a little time . The app can also be set up to send you prayer reminders so you do n't  have to worry about forgetting . Plus , the app also offers you the ability to create and join prayer groups . Its the perfect app to have in todays busy world . Currently , the app is only available for iPhone and iPad ; hopefully they will be working on an Android version soon . <p> Helping Others <p> While one of the most powerful effects of prayer is helping others , when you buy one of the PrayerBowls , you are also helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold , $1 is donated to Mary Lees House a center for child protection and advocacy . <p> PrayerBowls would make a beautiful gift for your friends , family and even yourself .

This allows them to keep them in one of the dog urns for ashes that are now available . So they can be respected and remember in the home of their family . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Even if you avoid private school , you 'll still have to shell out on supplies such as uniforms , books , stationery and bags . However , these need n't be too costly if you shop in the right places . Here are a few tips that could help school you into saving more money . <p> Hand-me-downs can be a great way of saving money on uniforms and school equipment . Even if your kids do n't have older siblings , there may be a cousin or older sibling of a friend that no longer needs their books or uniform . Recycling these items will save you a lot of money . Whilst you should n't skimp out on threadbare clothes and broken equipment , your school supplies do n't need to be in mint condition " many parents will be doing the same . <p> Second hand stores <p> You 'll find many stores selling second-hand clothing and equipment at a bargain price throughout the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Preloved . Whilst these may be ideal for getting you the correct size or specs , you should be aware of scammers . Always ask a seller to provide photos and any other information about the condition to avoid getting a shabby rucksack or textbook with missing pages . <p> Facebook 's local buy and sell pages can be a gold mine for cheap school equipment . As with online sites , you should be careful , although you will be able to meet the seller in person and inspect the item first before committing to a sale ( unlike good ordered online ) . You may need to be invited to these pages by an existing member . Alternatively , you can simply post out to all your Facebook friends and see if anyone is able to help . <p> Coupons and vouchers <p> Look out for vouchers and coupons that may help you to save money on school supplies . Newspapers can sometimes offer cut-out vouchers to use in certain shops . You may also be able to find vouchers online for specific stores such as Walmart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for the perk of vouchers , look for free coupons and vouchers where you can . <p> Take advantage of freebies <p> You may be able to obtain some school equipment for free , depending on your income . Students can sometimes be eligible for free laptops . There are also charities such as Giving World Online that collect donated items to give to schools and families who need it . Signing up to such schemes and charities may have you forking out much less ( do n't immediately assume you might not eligible either " you should always enquire into it just in case ) . You should also take advantage of imbursements that may allow you a certain amount of extra spendings a week for school . If meals are n't free , weigh up whether it 's cheaper to stick to the school lunch system or make packed lunches . You may be able to get coupons and vouchers for this too . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

The plan is to update it a bit and then list it ; although we may decide to buy it ourselves . In the meantime , our goal is to make it look as nice and modern as possible without doing any major overhauls or spending lots of money . So far we 've ripped out the old carpets and installed hardwoods throughout the entire house , and we 've begun painting the rooms ; but we have n't done much to the three rooms that need help the most : the master bath , hall bath and kitchen . Today I 'm going to share with you the first part of our master bathroom remodel on a budget . <p> If you 've ever been in a 1960s ranch then you know that the bathrooms were far from luxurious . The majority were small , and many were covered in hideous pink or green tile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Add in the matching sink , toilet and tub and you 're looking at the stuff nightmares are made of ! Of course there are some that were done in colors you can actually work with without having to gut the entire room .

Since the master bath needed the least amount of work , we decided to start there beginning with installing a new sink and vanity . <h> No Sink , No Storage , No Good ! <p> Over the years , previous owners had tried to update the room , adding several layers of paint , hanging a wall cabinet , and installing those 1980s cut-plastic handles that are supposed to look like crystal on the sink . Nobody bothered adding a vanity though , so the only storage in the room was the ugly , plastic wall cabinet . The tiny sink was simply attached to the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the time we moved in it was missing the cold faucet and the drain was being held open by a wire coat hanger ! <p> But wait , it gets worse ! The only light in the room was a single un-shaded lightbulb above the sink and on its base was the only electrical outlet in the bathroom . So basically the bathroom was pretty much useless , and was crying out for help ! Wanting/needing to spend as little as possible , we decided to invest in a small vanity , add a nice , modern faucet , swap out the hideous wall cabinet for something a lot nicer , add an electrical outlet , and paint the walls a pretty color . <p> The Delta LindenG is a two handle , centerset faucet with a sleek , clean design that works well no matter your style . <p> Stylish flares and unexpected curves of the LindenG Bath Collection exude friendliness , and even a bit of whimsy . <p> It features WaterSense certification which means it promotes water conservation , and DIAMOND Seal Technology to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matching drain assembly is included as well . Plus , for peace of mind , it comes with a Lifetime Faucet and Finish Warranty . <h> Faucet Installation <p> Installing the faucet was actually a lot easier than I 'd expected . Almost everything we needed came with the faucet except a few basic tools and some waterproof silicone . The entire installation took maybe an hour . <p> I absolutely love our new sink and vanity , and the faucet pulls it all together perfectly ! I smile every time I 'm in the room now . Its nice to finally be able to use our master bath ! <p> The Delta LindenG faucet has a great modern look , and I love the finish . Cleaning shiny chrome is a pain , but the Brilliance- Stainless finish is clean and modern . Even better , it does n't  show every single finger and hand print . The finish also works really well with the pulls on the vanity and the light fixture we 've selected . <p> Its amazing how much difference adding a small vanity and new faucet can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Now , our next step in the master bathroom remodel is to paint , remove the inset soap dish and toothbrush holder , add an electrical outlet and replace the light fixture ! Make sure you check back in the coming weeks for the posts ! <p> And of course , if we do decide to buy , I plan on removing the tile from the walls , perhaps adding some beadboard in its place , re-doing the floor , and completely renovating the stuck-in-the-60s shower stall . But for now , I 'm happy with the way our budget bathroom remodel is coming along ! 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Its hard for me not to worry when things happen , although I know that stressing and worrying wo n't help . With stress being the number one proxy killer , it is not a healthy way to live . So over the years I have made a point of finding things that will help me deal with the stress in a healthy , non-prescription way . Activities such as deep breathing , yoga , going on a walk , talking it out they all help , but sometimes I am not where I can easily do this . Then I learned about Pinch Me . <p> Having seen first-hand the toll that stress and tension takes on the body and mind , clinical hypnotherapist Nancy Rothner set out to find a holistic , non-prescription , drug free stress relief supplement that could be used in a pinch . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned about the proven scientific methodology of color and scent as they relate to relaxation and created Pinch Me Therapy Dough a pliable , soothingly colored scented dough that one can knead , smash and squeeze as a way to help reduce the amount of stress they are feeling . <p> Scent science has shown that our minds recall scents and that those scents evoke emotions . When a pleasant scent is recognized positive feelings are triggered , your heart rate slows , blood pressure drops and your body begins to relax . Pinch Me Therapy Dough is infused with high-quality , scented oils that are known for their soothing , calming qualities . <p> Color how color relates to the body and mind has also been studied extensively . Different colors have been shown to evoke different moods and feelings . Pinch Me Therapy Doughs color palette was professionally designed to calm and soothe with each soft and subtle hue . <p> Texture gently kneading the soft-feeling putty provides a release for tense muscles , while the steady applied pressure on the hands relaxes you as well . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prompts your mind to focus on relaxation instead . <p> Pinch Me is available in several colors and scents , the putty comes in a small , portable tin so anytime you begin feeling stressed out your putty is right there with you . Simply pull it out of the tin and begin kneading it in your hand . The soft , pliable texture , gentle color and soothing scent all work together to relax you and bring you back to center . When you are finished , just drop it back in the container , twist the lid on securely and put it away until the next time . <p> With six amazing formulas to choose from , you 're sure to find one that 's just perfect for you . My personal favorite is Spa a soft , feminine scent with just a hint of relaxing lavender . With its soft consistency , the perfect amount of pliability and the soothing , non-overpowering scent it emits when kneading , I can literally feel the stress melt away . Once done , the scent lingers to continue to help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Earth and For Men . I can not wait to try them all ! <p> Each container of Pinch Me is designed to last for hundred of uses .

@@29514817 @3214817/ <h> The Ultimate Guide to Owning a Horse <p> Horse ownership is a huge commitment . While many people dream of having their own horse , many do n't understand the enormous responsibility that goes with it . In this guide , we 're going to take a look at everything you will need for your equine pet . Make sure you give it a read before making your decision . <p> Horses need a lot of outdoor space to keep in shape and stay healthy but they need an indoor retreat , too . Your will need a grassy field to use as a paddock , which you should fence off securely , just in case your equine friend decides to wander off . If you do n't have a lot of space on your land , you could opt to keep your horse at a livery . There are many different types of arrangement that you can make , depending on how much responsibility you want for yourself . For example , you could have the livery take care of your horse 's daily needs , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be anything up to and around -400 per week , depending on the services you use . <p> CompanyOne major problem that comes with buying a horse is that one is not often enough . Horses are herd animals by nature and crave company . If you purchase a horse and keep them alone , it can have a dramatic effect on them . They are easily depressed , and once their moods start to drop , it can have grave consequences for their health . So , unless you intend to buy two horses , I would suggest that you use a livery . Your horse will have a much better life there with other horses and animals . <p> Choose a livery , and you will have a ready-made shelter . However , if you are keeping horses in your field , you are going to have to arrange something . When horses spend too long in a field , it can have a detrimental effect on their health . They can put on weight , and can be exposed to many conditions such as laminitis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stable that can protect them from the elements . The cost can vary , and the cheapest method is to build your own . <p> FoodHorses need to eat a lot of food and tend to prefer it in little amounts , often . As a rough guide , you can expect to spend around -20-25 on bags of baileys , the same on high fibre cubes , and a few bundles of hay . You 'll also want to consider something like Topspec Calmer if your horse suffers from anxiety issues . Overall , you can easily spend over -100 per month on feed alone . <p> Stable equipmentYour barn needs a lot of equipment to keep it clean . If you let things slip , it will affect your horse 's health . You will need pitchforks and shovels for mucking out , a broom , and lots of buckets and containers for food and water . If you want to save some money , look into the second-hand market . Make sure you have a wheelbarrow , too . A lot of the clearing up you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and your back . Bales of hay are also recommended horses will use them to eat and sleep on . However , there are also rubber floor mats that you can pick up for around -30 if you want a more permanent solution . Finally , do n't forget a horse coat . Your equine friend will need one during the colder winter months . <p> Grooming equipmentHorses need a lot of looking after to stay healthy , and a large part of that comes from their grooming . You will need a broad range of beauty ' products such as a body brush , a comb for their mane , and a hoof pick . A halter and rope are going to be handy for leading them out to clean . If you have your horse shoed , you will need to have regular checkups anything from once every four to six weeks is typical . Also , do n't forget about internal grooming . Horses can have serious problems with worms , so make sure they are having tests on a regular basis . They may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wormer or something similar . These type of medicines come in gel or tablet form , so settle on something your horse feels comfortable with . <p> TransportTraveling with any pet can be awkward , but even more so when it 's bigger than you . You will need to invest in some equipment so that you can transport your horse . Even if you do n't envisage taking it for a ride , you have to prepare for any eventuality . A horse trailer can cost anything from -2,000 upwards , although you may find something cheaper second-hand . If you are planning on moving your horse a lot , then it might be wise to invest in a proper horse box . They are more expensive than trailers , but will provide a far higher level of comfort for your horse . <p> Riding gearFor most people , there is little point in owning a horse unless you plan on riding it . With this in mind , you are going to need to stock up on plenty of equipment for your horse and yourself . Make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go beneath it . You 'll also need a girth and cinch , a Martingale strap , some stirrups and a bridle . Most importantly , though , you will need a reliable set of reins to make sure you can control your horse . You will need a good pair of riding boots and a pair of comfortable breeches . You could get away with wearing regular trousers or jeans if pushed , but you can expect some discomfort . A riding hat is essential to protect against head injuries from falls , and it might be a good idea to get a body protector , too . <p> Ok , so that 's all we have for you today . As you can see , there are plenty of costs involved and a lot of equipment to buy . Of course , we have n't even taken into account one of the other expenses your time . Unless you are intending to place your horse into a livery , looking after it will take up a lot of your time . However , if you have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least two is a wonderful experience . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

The solution is safe for clear coat , paint and more so no worries about it damaging your paint job or trim . <p> After a few sprays and wipes with a soft cloth , my windows were sparkling clean ! I was able to easily remove dirt , pollen , road grime and even smashed bugs from the outside of my windows without having to scrub very hard . It even removed fingerprints , streaks and nicotine from the inside of the windows . All without any streaking . I love this stuff ! <h> 303 Automotive Products Interior and Exterior Protectant <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick springtime shower to end ( of course it would rain after I washed the car ) , it was time to tackle the inside . We love to ride with the windows down when the temperature is comfortable , but this allows all kinds of dirt and dust to accumulate inside the car all over the dash , the stereo , the door and everywhere else . In fact , it was so bad I was almost too embarrassed to post the picture below ! But I went ahead so you could see the difference ! So after using a Swiffer cloth and small vacuum to remove the dirt and dust , I could n't wait to see how well the 303 Interior and Exterior Protectant would work ! <p> The 303 Interior and Exterior Protectant is ideal for bringing back that showroom shine to the interior of your car and the exterior trim ! It helps keep surfaces looking newer and lasting longer by helping to repel dust , lint and staining . It also provides UV protection to keep your dash and other parts from cracking and fading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rubber surfaces , and it comes in either a spray or wipe version . <p> Now Ive used several different brands of protectants over the years , and each one has left a greasy or oily film that I 've had to wipe and wipe and wipe to remove . So honestly , I was pretty much expecting the same result from this one . I was wrong . I used both the spray version and the wipes and neither one left any type of film . Instead the surfaces I wiped looked brighter , shinier and much cleaner ! I simply wiped the surface down , went back over it with a soft cloth to remove any excess , and that was it . You can tell the difference in the picture below ! Oh and did I mention that he 303 Protectant also has a very pleasant scent ? ! <h> 303 Automotive Products Speed Cleaner <p> Next up was the 303 Speed Cleaner .

It produces a high gloss shine without any streaking on fiberglass , paint , clear coat , plastics , metals and glass . <p> Although I had just washed the car , there were still several tiny spots of dirt on top of the hood and roof of the car from tree sap . I 'm sure you know how hard that stuff is to remove . And if you leave it on , it will cause damage to both your clear coat and your paint . Well I figured these remaining sap spots would be a perfect test for this product . Amazingly , all it took was a light misting and a few swipes of a dry , soft cloth and that sap was gone ! I kid you not . It was as easy as pie ! I also used it to remove bug guts from the headlights and the front sides of the door mirrors !

Obviously , nearly everyone has to think about cost when they choose a family home . But even with a budget , you could still have a lot of choice for the size of your family home . If you change the location , the type of property , and how many rooms there are , you can see some significant price differences . In my experience , everyone has different opinions on how big their house needs to be . It can vary from country to country , as well as between families . If you 're not sure how big your house should be , I have some tips to help you decide . <p> For most families , the most important thing about the size of their house is the number of bedrooms . The biggest question is whether your kids get a room each . If they share , how long can they do so before they need their own room ? Opposite gender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So if you 're choosing a new home , you have to consider when your kids will need bedrooms of their own . Are you willing to move again in a few years when you might need an extra bedroom ? Or is it possible to split a room in two ? <p> Extra Space <p> Aside from bedrooms , you might want extra space for a variety of purposes . For example , you might be after a spare room that you can turn into a playroom . On the other hand , you could keep it to yourself for anything from a sewing room to an office . Alternatively , it could just become a guest room . There are other spaces in the house you might want , such as a basement or attic . Both of these spaces can be converted into something else , from a granny flat to a home cinema . <p> Of course , you want to make sure you spend plenty of time together as a family too . When you 're looking at family spaces , its the size and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while others like open-plan layouts . Its not always easy to find what you 're looking for straight away .

They will be able to show you properties with the type of living space you 're looking for . <p> Outdoors <p> Outdoor space can be important too when you have a family . Kids and pets both need space to run around . And perhaps you enjoy gardening or just sitting outside in the summer . Just how much space you really need is a question you need to answer . Some families are happy with a small patio and lawn . Others want some land around their house for more privacy and freedom . Speak to your estate agent about what you want . <p> Every family has different needs and budgets . Think about how much space you need in a house and can afford to live comfortably . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

@@29514830 @3214830/ <h> 6 Common Causes of Car Fires <p> If you have ever witnessed a car fire , you know it can be a scary site . Thick black smoke billows , orange flames spew , and fire trucks and police surround the site . Odds are you wo n't ever have to deal with a fire involving your own vehicle , especially if you take it in for regular check-ups and fix anything that needs repairing . However , it can be helpful to know the common causes for car fires for you and your passengers safety . Below are some of the top causes of car fires . <p> 1 ) Car Crashes : one of the most obvious causes of car fires are car crashes . Although most cars crumple zones are designed so the sheet metal absorbs the impact around dangerous areas such as the engine , fuel tank and battery , a hard enough hit can still possibly cause fluid leaks and spillage , as well as heat and smoke creating ideal conditions for a fire . <p> 2 ) Flaws in the Design : Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires . Notice I say contribute as a design flaw in a vehicle usually is n't going to cause a car fire on its own . They can , however , create conditions that are perfect for a fire , and sometimes even create conditions in which an eventual fire is inevitable . <p> 3 ) Poor Maintenance : While lack of maintenance is not going to directly cause your car to catch fire , in general , your car can be a lot more dangerous and can indirectly lead to a vicious fire . For example : frayed wiring can lead to a spark which can ignite flammable fluids such as oil or gasoline . Keeping up with repairs and performing regular maintenance can all help you avoid conditions that can lead to a vehicular fire . <p> 4 ) Electrical System Failure : another very common source of car fires , a cars electrical wiring runs throughout the entire car ; a stray , unnoticed frayed wire could wreak havoc . In addition , standard car batteries are also capable of causing plenty of trouble . A batterys charging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine bay , and the electrical current the battery provides ( along with faulty or loose wiring ) can then produce sparks which can quickly ignite leaked vapors or a fluid drip . Again , routine maintenance plays a big role in this . <p> 5 ) Overheating : Many people wonder is a cars engine overheating can cause the car to catch fire . While the engine overheating alone is unlikely to cause your car to burst into flame , what can happen is the engine overheating and making internal fluids rise to dangerous temperatures and begin to spill out of their designated areas . When this happens , the fluids drizzle and spurt onto the exhaust system and other super hot parts , where they can ignite and spread . <p> 6 ) Fuel Leaks : One of the most common causes of car fires are caused by a fuel leak . Any number of factors can cause a fuel leak , but at the same time , they can also arise on their own . Whatever causes it , a fuel system leak is really dangerous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7.2 degrees Celsius ) or above can quickly catch fire from a simple spark , and gasoline that reaches 495 degrees Fahrenheit ( 257.2 degrees Celsius ) will ignite by itself . This makes it easy to imagine how fuel dripping onto hot metal and plastic parts can cause a fire . If you ever smell gas in or around your car , find and fix the leak immediately ! Of course , as we have mentioned before , proper maintenance can go a long way in preventing a fuel system fire . <p> When it comes right down to it , the most important thing to remember is that once a vehicle is on fire , it really does n't  matter what caused it . The only thing that does matter is that you get out fast and get as far away from the car as possible . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176 
@@29514832 @3214832/ <h> Bowflex Boost Band Fitness Tracker Bracelet Review <p> In todays fitness market , the hottest new gadget seems to be the fitness bands which you wear on you wrist and it tracks your fitness activity levels . Last month , when Bowflex introduced their version of these bands , The Bowflex BoostG , I had the opportunity to to try it out for myself . <p> Bowflex , made by Nautilus , has long been the top name when it comes to home gym equipment . The brand is well-known for making exercise equipment that allows the user to get the full gym experience at home , performing dozens of exercises in short amounts of time . That , along with the fact that much of their equipment is portable and small enough to fit in a spare room , has made them a favorite with those who do not like going to a public gym . <p> The Bowflex BoostG is a 24-hour fitness monitoring band that tracks your activities throughout the day and into the night . Designed for people of all fitness levels , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals , offers insights to empower you to make positive change and even tracks your sleeping patterns . It will calculate your steps , distance traveled , calories , overall activity patterns and how well you sleep . It also comes with a companion iOS app which using Bluetooth- Smart technology allows you to sync data to your iPhone , iPod Touch or iPad ( 4S and higher ) and keeps you accountable to your fitness goals . <p> The Boost Band is basically a lightweight , black wristband with a sliver clasp that you wear all day and all night . It is made of a very soft , medical-grade silicone , measures around 9 ? long and 3/4 of an inch wide , and weighs less than an ounce . While it is waterproof up to 1 meter which will keep it safe in the rain or shower , but it is not recommended to wear while swimming . <p> The Boost Band also features a small button that lights up when you press it and tracks your fitness activity levels while showing how close you are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day it will be red , then it will turn yellow when you 're halfway to your daily goals , and green when you 've finally achieved them . Your daily goals are set using the free iPhone app and includes a step goal ( for example , 10,000 steps ) , a calorie-burning goal ( 500 ) and a distance goal ( five miles ) . Throughout the day , you can check your progress toward these goals by pressing and holding the button on your Bowflex BoostG for 5 seconds until the blue light blinks , and then opening your app to view your activity . Although it comes with default numbers , you can personalize them to your goals . <p> When I first used the Bowflex BoostG , it took close to two hours to fully charge using the included USB charger . On the underside of the band are two connection points , and you simply match these points to the ones on the included USB battery charger , then attach the USB cord to the port on your device . According to Bowflex , the battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , it lasted almost 15 days . <p> Once it had a full charge , I then installed the free software from the app store . Setting up the app was not very difficult as it takes you through a tutorial showing you exactly what to do . When you set up your User Profile you enter information such as your gender , date of birth , height and weight . <p> Next you are taken to the main Activity screen where you see your profile picture , date and time of the last sync , the battery life and information about your most recent activity level such as number of steps , calories burned , and distance walked/run . If you turn your mobile device to landscape mode while viewing this data you will be able to see a graph view of your activity . <p> Touching the gear-shaped icon on the bottom right will take you to the Settings screen where you can adjust all of your activity goals and where you can enter your typical wake up time for weekdays and weekends . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take your phone out of sleep mode after you have put the bracelet in sleep mode for the night . <p> From the main Activity screen you can get to the Sleep Activity screen by simply swiping the screen to the right . Here you will see how long you spent in bed , how many minutes it took you to fall asleep and how many minutes you actually slept . Again , if you turn your screen to landscape mode , you will see this information in graph form . Being able to see how much you slept and how much you tossed and turned is a great way to see if how you are feeling during the day has anything to do with you sleep or lack thereof the night before . <p> My Verdict of the Bowflex BoostG Fitness Band <p> For $49.95 , the Bowflex BoostG is a very affordable , though basic , fitness band option . I say basic because unlike other fitness bands , the Bowflex BoostGis not a heart rate monitor or GPS . All of the information gathered is basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you move your arm and the information you put in the app such as height and weight . It is not taking into account the type of exercise you are doing , nor does it have an accelerometer . Then there is the fact that much of the data both tracked and that you input into the app is not saved . So if you want to remember your goals from a week ago , you need to write them down or find some other way to keep track . The same goes for the data regarding your sleep . Finally , my last qualm , it is only available for iOS users , although an Android app should be available by the end of the year . As far as Windows platform users , who knows ! <p> Overall I do really like the Bowflex BoostG . Not only is it a durable , reliable product made by a trusted company whose only business is fitness , but for less than $50 , it is extremely affordable and a great option for those of us who ca n't or wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great way to see exactly how active you are , and I find that watching the activity monitoring light is a great motivator to making yourself get up and get moving I keep wanting to get to the green faster and faster ! And if you need a little boost in the form of support from family and friends , the Boost Band app has Facebook and Twitter functionality built-in , making it easy to share your progress ! <p> Currently the Bowflex BoostG is only supports iOS devices 4s and higher . You can get the free app software through the App Store . You can purchase the Bowflex Boost fitness band directly through the Bowflex Boost website , as well as through Amazon.com , and many other online and offline stores .

@@29514840 @3214840/ <h> pur-Absorb Iron Supplement : When Less is More 130178 @qwx330178 <p> One of the most important factors in retaining good health is making sure your body is getting the vitamins and minerals it needs . When your body does not get enough vitamins and minerals , all types of health problems can occur , many of which can be quite serious . One such deficiency that is especially predominant , particularly in women who are of child-bearing age or pregnant , is an iron deficiency . Did you know that according to a 2011 US Department of Heath and Human Services report , an estimated 3 million Americans remain iron deficient ! And according to World Health Organization statistics , anemia , predominantly due to iron deficiency , affects approximately two billion people worldwide ! <p> Iron is a mineral the body uses to create the protein hemoglobin , a component of red blood cells that is responsible for carrying oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body . Iron also helps your muscle cells store and use oxygen , and it is important in helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body functions such as digestion . Iron is essential for supporting a healthy immune system , as well as playing a key role in both energy release and increased cognitive function for sustained concentration . <p> Low levels of iron can lead to anemia which causes weight loss , fatigue , headaches , dizziness and abdominal pain . Low iron can also cause a general lack of energy and a decrease in the ability to concentrate . On the other hand , too much iron is extremely unsafe and can cause nausea , vomiting , headache , dizziness , liver failure , low blood pressure , shortness of breath and even death . <p> There are many foods that are naturally rich in iron and can provide you with the RDA of iron without having to take supplements . Foods such as fish , lean red meat , poultry , dried fruits , lentils , beans , tofu , eggs , grains , green vegetables and iron-fortified cereals or breads are all full of iron . However in some cases , despite the amount of iron one consumes in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is where supplements may come into play . Before you even consider taking an iron supplement , be sure to consult your doctor as only he or she can tell you if your iron levels are off . <p> For people who have been diagnosed by their doctor with low iron , there are tons of supplements out there to consider . As a woman with low iron levels , I am familiar with just exactly how many iron supplements there are ! It can really get confusing when it comes to trying to pick out the best one . However , a few weeks ago , as a blogger for NaturallySavvy.com , I was offered the opportunity to try pur-Absorb Iron , an all-natural , liquid iron supplement . Since I am not a fan of swallowing pills and many of the supplements I have tried are pills big enough for a horse , I was all for trying a liquid supplement . <p> pur-Absorb Iron is an iron-rich water that comes in individual , single-use , easy-to-open packets . One packet a day is all you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a high absorption rate , the body can get all of the iron it needs from a lower dose . The majority of conventional iron supplement tablets have a low absorption rate , which really means you are taking a higher dose because the average person only absorbs a small amount . The iron that was unable to be absorbed is excreted leading to uncomfortable side effects such as constipation , stomach irritation and headaches . Since pur-Absorb has that high absorption rate , those side effects as far less likely . <p> I have been taking pur-Absorb Iron supplement for several weeks now . The first time I tried it , I took it directly from the pouch , and while the taste was by no means terrible , I did have a definite metallic-like taste left in my mouth . Ever since then , I make sure to pour the contents of the packet into a glass and add some water or some type of juice with a high level of Vitamin C ( the Vitamin C is known to help iron absorption ) , which tastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the juice at all . I have not had any problems with side effects either . <p> I really like that pur-Absorb is a liquid supplement . For me , it is much easier to take , and its high absorption rate is good for my body . The individual packets are very convenient and easy to use , just open , pour and that 's it ! They are also the perfect size to put in my purse or bag if I travel or forget to take my dose one morning and remember while away from home . I also like that it is all-natural , coming directly from naturally occurring iron-rich spring water in Snowdonia , North Wales , a source that has been used by people around the world for years as a natural iron supplement . The water is collected , filtered for bacteria and packaged ; at no point is anything else added nor is the waters natural composition compromised . <p> pur-Absorb is available at many drugstores , grocery stores , health stores and other location across the nation . To find a store near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pur-Absorb website . <p> Did you notice any teeth staining ? I prefer liquid vitamins since the absorption into your body is better , but the last multivitamin I had that contained iron stained my teeth which my dentist said was a result of the iron . If this one does n't  cause that problem , I would love to use it ! <p> I knew that iron was extremely important to get enough of , but wow does low iron cause a lot of health issues ! I take a multivitamin everyday as well as vitamin D and calcium supplements . I think I will look into if my multivitamin is giving me enough iron or if I should be getting more . <p> Hi terrif ? c website !

As a soap that has been around for over 130 years , parents know it is a trusted brand that not only gets you clean , but it is very affordable as well . I grew up loving Ivorys fresh , clean scent , and how it left my skin squeaky clean and soft . As an adult , I still occasionally use Ivory , but more often use the soap my husband uses as a way to save money . <p> Over the years , the Ivory product line has not only changed the packaging , but extended to include not only bar soaps , but also Body Wash , Hand Soap and now , a Two-in-One Hair and Body Wash . As a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivorys Two-in-One Hair and Body Wash for free in the latest VoxBox . After using it for over two weeks now , I clearly remember why I used to love using Ivory . <p> I love saving money and time as much as the next person , and I can definitely see how using a two-in-one hair and body product would do just that , but I never really cared for using one for several reasons . First of all , it never seemed right to me that a product that was made for skin care should be used on hair . Secondly , since I have naturally curly hair which tends to be on the dry side , using both a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner has always worked best . Lastly , when I find a soap , shampoo and conditioner that I like quite well , I tend to stick with it . However , after using Ivory Two-in-One Hair and Body Wash , my opinion has definitely changed ! <p> Like all Ivory products the Two-in-One Hair and Body Wash is free of dyes and heavy perfumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flip-up lid that allows you to pour out the thick , creamy soap in just the amount you need . It comes in two different scents , Refreshing and Energizing ; I tried the Refreshing scent and found it to be a light , clean scent . I also discovered that a little bit goes a long way both as a shampoo and a body soap ! <p> As a shampoo I loved how Ivory lathered up into a rich , thick foam that thoroughly cleaned my hair and rinsed out easily . I was fully expecting it to dry out my hair to the point where I could feel it even in the shower , but in reality , it did not dry it out too bad . However since my hair does need a lot of conditioning , the second time I used it , I followed up with my usual conditioner . The result ? Clean , shiny and manageable hair that was not dried out and frizzy ! <p> As a body wash , Ivory worked as well as it always has ! It takes just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it worked better when using a loofah or pouf instead of a regular washcloth ) that leaves you squeaky clean . Many soaps tend to leave my skin dry and itchy to where I always have to use lotion after bathing , but with Ivory I was able to shower , dry off and skip the lotion altogether . My skin was clean , soft and lightly scented . <p> The only complaint I have , is that it took a few minutes of rinsing to feel like I got all of the soap off , and as I bathed and rinsed , the tub got more slippery than it usually does . Aside from that , I was very happy with my experience using Ivory Two-in-One Hair and Body Wash , and will continue to use Ivory in the future ! <p> The benefits of using Ivory Two-in-One Hair and Body Wash go beyond getting clean . Ivory is a wonderful way to save money since it is a very affordable brand to begin with , and you get 50% more in Ivorys bottles than you do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use Two-in-One hair and Body Wash , you save even more money since there is no need to buy shampoo .

After graduating the Makeup Studio of Milano , he got his start working with Italian designers such as Gianni Versace , Armani , and Dolce and Garbanna . He went on to work with super models like Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell , served as contributing beauty editor at Elle magazine and as Spokesperson and Master Artist and Product Consultant for Estee Lauder , Revlon and Elizabeth Arden . It was in the mid 90s when , after becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of rich , vibrant color , he began mixing his own cosmetics , and just a short while later , started Vincent Longo cosmetics . <p> Having never tried any of his cosmetics , I was super excited when I received several items to try including Creme Gel Eyeliner , Lip/Cheek Gel Stain , Lipstick and the Dew Drop Radiant Blush . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products is the packaging , and I can honestly say that Vincent Longo has this part down pack . Each item came in its own glossy black packaging with teal green writing , giving the entire package a modern and sleek look . Of course my absolute favorite is what comes inside that packaging ! <p> The first thing I noticed about this demi-matte blush was its unique multi-color composition . Instead of it being one solid color like I am used to , the Dew Drop Peach Temple blush is a combination of an antique rose and a dusty rose , together with a soft bronze . It also has a subtle hint of glimmer to helps give your complexion a dewy appearance . I love the way all of the colors blend together to give my complexion a healthy , radiant glow ! <p> This paraben-free , gluten-free and oil-free formula is one of Vincent Longos star products . Ideal for use as a cheek stain or lip stain , it can be layered on for long-lasting , natural looking color . I love how you can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or keep adding layers until you get full coverage . For an oil-free formula , I was actually surprised at how easy it was to blend , just be sure to do it as soon as you apply because it does dry quickly . The stain looks completely natural and does n't  dry out my skin , or get those creases in it like other stains I have tried . Plus , it is waterproof , kiss-proof , hypoallergenic and cruelty-free . <p> This classic , full coverage lipstick contains essential oils , vitamin E and aloe vera to keep lips moisturized and silky smooth . It also contains lip firming and anti-aging ingredients to help protect and plump lips , along with beeswax for long-lasting color . The first things I noticed about this lipstick was its deep , rich color and its creamy consistency . It glides on silky-smooth , and the color really does last for hours .

By the end of the week , we are all struck down with a horrid cold . While I do not like being sick , I absolutely can not stand being congested , especially when it gets to the point where blowing your nose has zero effect . There is nothing worse than lying in bed at night trying to sleep with your sinuses so stuffed up your head feels like it weighs a ton , your only hope for survival to breathe through your mouth . Every time I get this way , there is one thing in my cold-fighting arsenal I always turn to a humidifier . <p> As adults we all know how hard it is for us to fall asleep when feeling terrible , and as parents we know its even harder for our little ones . That 's where a humidifier like the Vicks Sweet Dreams Cool Mist Humidifier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this adorable humidifier combines the congestion relief and comforting power of a cool mist humidifier with soothing , colorful images to help ease your little one into a peaceful , dream-filled sleep . And if that is n't neat enough , you also have the ability to add aromatherapy by placing Vicks Scent Pads into a specially designed compartment , filling the room with long-lasting , soothing vapors . <p> The Vicks Sweet Dreams Cool Mist Humidifier is filter-free and features a huge 1 gallon tank which holds enough water to last up to 24 hours . It quietly releases ultra-fine cool mist into the air providing much-needed comfort and relief all night ( and day ) long . You can easily adjust the level of humidity by using the knob on the front of the machine , and once empty , it will automatically shut off . <p> While the cool mist works to help ease cold and flu symptoms , the Sweet Dreams projector turns your childs bedroom ceiling into an animal-filled safari , a star-filled sky , or an underwater adventure <p> . Each theme features three images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child from the uncomfortable symptoms of being sick . When you want to change themes , simply slide the projector switch to the dream theme icon of your choice . Another neat feature is that the projector is independently controlled and can run without the mist so it can be used whenever your children want to spark their imaginations . <p> As I mentioned above , the Vicks Sweet Dreams Cool Mist Humidifier also provides you with the option to use aromatherapy . There is a small compartment on the side of the humidifier where you can add a Vicks VapoPad scented pad so that it releases a gentle soothing scent for your little one . Up to two pads can be inserted at once , and you get around 8 hours of use per pad . The VapoPads are available in two scents , Rosemary &amp; Lavender ( for 3+ months ) and Menthol ( for 36+ months ) ; plus , one free pad comes with the unit so you can give it a try . And although I have yet to try this myself , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few drops on a similar type pad . <p> Remember my telling you how both my husband and I were sick a few weeks ago ? Well we took advantage of that time to try out this humidifier for ourselves , and it worked wonderfully ! Filling it up was a cinch as the tank easily comes off and has two handles for convenient carrying . From there you just unscrew the tank cap and fill it with water . <p> Once we turned it on , I was surprised at how incredibly quiet it really was . Lots of soothing , cooling mist was released into the air , and with the addition of a menthol Vapopad , we were both breathing much easier within minutes . And , yes , we could n't resist turning on the projector and checking out the images all of which were colorful and clear ! <p> Did you know that humidifiers have many benefits other than relieving the effects of a cold ? <p> Prevention : during the cold winter months , the air inside your home becomes much drier due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air outside . This dryness causes static electricity and dry , itchy skin . It also causes irritated throat and nasal passages which makes you more vulnerable to illness . My stepson has even had bloody noses caused by the super dry air ! Humidifiers add much-needed moisture back into the air you breathe , helping you to fight off colds and easing the discomfort of overly dry air . <p> Reduces the survival of viruses : maintaining a humidity level between 40-60 per cent can actually reduce the survival of viruses . This means there is less opportunity for them to spread to the other members of your family , keeping them healthy . <p> Relief from cough and congestion : Humidifier can help ease coughs and blocked nasal passages , allowing you to get a good night 's sleep and get back to health quicker . <p> The Vicks Sweet Dreams Cool MistHumdifier comes in pink or blue and provides a wonderfully soothing and enchanting bedtime environment for your children . <p> Hi Anna , There is a special little door on the side where you would insert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential oil to a small cotton pad and using it . There is a picture of the door in the post . I have not noticed it making it any harder to clean , and it definitely does not damage the product . Of course as with all humidifiers , you always want to clean it on a regular basis . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

For several years afterwards I was constantly searching for something that would help alleviate the pain . I went through hours and hours of physical therapy , constantly applied hot and cold compresses , took hot baths , tried yoga and , unfortunately , went through the whole spiel of taking muscle relaxers and pain pills which resulted in addiction . Since taking pain pills for the rest of my life was not a viable or healthy option , I knew I had to find something that would work . Finally , a physical therapist suggested I try a TENS unit , and it turned out to be the most effective solution I have found !

Omron offers two different TENS units , the latest being the one I received , the Pain Relief Pro . <p> A TENS unit ( Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation ) is thought to work by disrupting the pain cycle by delivering a different , non-painful sensation to the skin around the pain site , therefore changing the way we feel pain from that area . It is also thought that depending on the frequency the unit delivers , the electrical stimulation can trigger the body to release those natural painkillers known as endorphins which help promote an overall feeling of well-being . Many people find that a TENS unit will give them temporary relief from stiff , achy or sore muscles and joint pain .

@@29514855 @3214855/ <h> Wymans Blueberries and a Very Berry Blueberry Muffin Recipe <p> Mmmmm blueberries ! Ever since I was a child I have loved blueberries whether I ate them by themselves or in blueberry pancakes , muffins , smoothies , or pie ! While I almost always prefer fresh blueberries , I recently had the opportunity to try frozen blueberries by Wymans of Maine and was quite surprised at how fresh and delicious they tasted ! <p> Wymans of Maine has been growing and marketing wild blueberries and other fruits since 1874 . With over a hundred years of experience , they have perfected the science of freezing fresh fruit , especially blueberries . Their premium fruit is fresh frozen right at harvest when the flavor and healthy goodness are at their peak . Not only is Wymans frozen fruit all natural , with no sugar added , but it is just as nutritious as fresh fruit ! <p> As I mentioned above , I was very impressed with the delicious , fresh taste of Wymans blueberries .

And since the bag is resealable , I know they will stay fresh longer . Better yet , I love the fact that I can get the fruits I love year round regardless of the season . <p> Wymans fresh frozen fruits can be found at your local grocery . In addition to blueberries they also offer strawberries , red raspberries , mango chunks , as well as mixed blends such as Triple Berry Blend , Mixed Berries , and Blueberries , Strawberries and Mango Chunks . <p> Below is a recipe for homemade blueberry muffins that I originally found on Allrecipes by a lady named Colleen ( To Die For Blueberry Muffins ) .

@@29514857 @3214857/ <h> The Form-Fit Pillow Buckwheat Hull and Foam Pillow <h> The Form-Fit Pillow : Naturally Cool and Comfortable with Adjustable Support <p> When I lay my head down at night , I not only want to be comfortable , I also want and need to have the proper support for my head and neck . A car accident in my mid-20s left me with neck and shoulder pain that can easily be made worse without the proper support when sleeping . For years now I have been trying to find the perfect pillow one that is soft and comfortable , yet supportive and preferably remains cool to the touch . For some reason I havent had much luck . Then I heard about the Form-Fit Pillow . <p> Carrying the title of the Highest Rated Pillow on Amazon ( 110 reviews , 4.9 rating ) , the Form-Fit Pillowis unlike any pillow you have tried before . Instead of using down , memory foam , or foam , this innovative pillow uses a blend of clean , all natural buckwheat hulls and soft foam for the filling . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the hard outer shells of the seeds of buckwheat grain . These hulls are strong , aromatic and do not retain or reflect heat . They are ( and have been for years ) very popular throughout Asia , where they are used in everything from furniture to pillows . While the thought of using these hulls in a pillow may seem a bit odd at first , these pillows are actually quite popular for several reasons . <p> First of all , buckwheat hulls do n't  compress , instead they conformto your shape , providing comfort and support for your cervical spine and neck . They will hold whatever shape your prefer , and are naturally cool , dry and breathable . In addition , they are naturally anti-microbial , and are a great non-allergenic alternative for many who suffer from allergies . The makers of the Form-Fit Pillow have also mixed in pieces of foam with the buckwheat hulls , adding softness and loft , and making this unique pillow even more comfortable . <p> Adjusting the Form-Fit Pillow <p> The Form-Fit Pillow arrived over-stuffed , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use to remove as much of the filling as you prefer . The pillows three-layer , quilted cover is made from natural , unbleached cotton muslin , and can be machine-washed as needed . The cover is very well-made , and has a large zippered opening to make adding and removing the filling fast and easy . If the pillow is too full for your comfort level , simply unzip the case and use the cup to remove however much filling you want . Of course , the more filling you remove , the less firm the pillow will be . Place the excess into the provided plastic bag , and put it away until you need it again . Finding the perfect level is definitely a process of trial and error , one that took me several days . However , once you find the amount that works for you , it is totally worth it . <p> When I first opened the zipper , I was surprised at the way the filling looked and felt it was definitely not what I was expecting . The buckwheat hulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they can get everywhere if you are not careful ! I actually placed the pillow inside the box it came in before scooping the filling out in order to avoid any spills . There is more than enough filling included , so you wont have to worry about not having enough or your pillow going flat . <p> Using the Form Fit Pillow <p> Once you have the pillow filled to your liking , its up to you if you want to put it inside a pillowcase . Although the cover it comes with is nice and soft , it is designed to fit any standard size pillowcase . To set the pillow , simply shake the filling down to the sleeping edge ( the one without the zipper ) , lay it flat- and then find your most comfortable position for sleep . You can adjust the pillow to any position whether you sleep on your side , back or even on your stomach by simply pushing on it to adjust the filling to the shape you prefer . <p> When it comes to care , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure that you remove all of the filling before washing , and then follow the instructions on the label . Once it is clean and dry , you simply refill it and you are good to go ! <p> My Opinion of the Form-Fit Pillow <p> As soon as I had my Form-Fit Pillow ready to use , I have to admit I developed several doubts . First of all I had noticed the crinkly sound the hulls made when I was removing some of the filling , and when moving the pillow around . I was worried about it bothering me as I changed sleeping positions throughout the night . Secondly , although I love the idea of being able to adjust it to my comfort level by adding or removing filling , I just could n't imagine how this hull-and-foam filled pillow could be soft and comfortable . In addition , although the hulls are light , the sheer amount of them made the pillow semi-heavy , and I have always preferred a light pillow . This Form-Fit Pillow was definitely unlike any other pillow I had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try in my search for comfort and support . <p> I have now been sleeping on this pillow for a little over 3 weeks , and as far as my above concerns , I neednt have worried . At first it took me a couple of nights to get used to this pillow . Not only was finding the right amount of fill a process of trial and error , but getting used to sleeping on pillow filled with something other than foam or feathers also took some time . After those first few nights though , I have been sleeping comfortably . The noise I had originally noticed turned out to not be a factor at all especially since it only occurs when adjusting the pillow . As far as comfort , it is a lot more comfortable than I could have ever imagined it to be . It really does conform and hold whatever shape/position you push it into , and it provides plenty of support . I cant even begin to tell you how nice it is to wake up in the morning without any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to experience . My husband even mentioned that I am not tossing and turning as much as I used to . As far as allergies , neither my husband nor I suffer from them , so I can not give an opinion about the pillows non-allergenic properties . <p> Its no surprise to me as why this pillow is the top ranked pillow on Amazon ! Its soft , supportive , comfortable , clean and cool ; and it even retains the position you push it into ! If you are looking for a new pillow that will help you sleep more comfortably , then I definitely recommend giving the Form-Fit Pillow a try ! <p> Purchasing the Form-Fit Pillow <p> The Form-Fit Pillow can be purchased directly through Amazon.com . It is priced at $59.99 , and carries a 10-year warranty . While its price of $59.99 may sound a bit steep for a pillow , the comfort and support it provides is well worth it .

If this is the pump seal , this can easily be replaced . Leaks and drips around the pipes could be a sign of corrosion . In this case , call out a boiler engineer to replace the pipes . <h> Strange Noises <p> Can you hear gurgling , banging , or whistling ? This usually means that there is air in the system .

And for those without AC , trying to cool the cars inside down can be quite the challenge . Ever those that have AC can find it hard to keep it cool , especially since its a well-known fact that running your AC consumes more energy and fuel ; and with the price of gas slowly rising back up , saving fuel and money is on everybodys mind . <p> You could try to deal with this by unrolling the windows , but this actually creates drag , which in turn increases your fuel usage . So it seems that the most fuel-efficient way to drive your car is with the windows up and the AC off , but this does nothing to cool down the inferno that is your car . So what is the best way to stay cool in your car when the temps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your car below ! <p> 1 . Time your departureThe best way to beat the heat is to stay off the road during the hottest hours of the day . Of course , its not very practical to put off your work or errands until things cool down , but you can at least try to schedule things around known rush hours whenever possible . After all , not much is worse than being stuck in gridlock when you are roasting in your car ! <p> 2 . Carry Water Bottles Get ahead of the game and grab a few bottles of chilled water before you head out . These will help you cool off , and can even be used as a makeshift ice pack if needed ! I put a few bottles in my freezer to get them extra cold a short while before heading out , so that they stay cool for the majority of the ride . <p> 3 . Protect Against the Scorching Heat When ParkedWe can all relate to the misery of getting in a car that has been parked in the scorching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot to touch , and you can hardly breath due to the heat . There 's no way you 're staying cool once you climb in . Before you climb in , open all the doors for a couple of minutes to let some of the hot air out . Glass windows actually insulate heat inside , so its important to get the hot air out . Better yet , allow hot air to escape by leaving the windows slightly open while parked . Just a crack the width of your finger can help vent your car . <p> This is also where a reflective windshield cover can really come in handy ! These shiny barriers reflect the sunlight from entering your car and help keep it from getting to egg frying temperatures while it sits in the parking lot especially one that offers no shade ! It also helps to park with your windshield facing away from the sun . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

However , that 's not true at all . In fact . It 's far more important to get a good night of sleep for your health . By getting a full night of rest and relaxation your body can heal from the stresses of the stay . You might also need to think about how stressed you are through the day because sleep can help with that too . You might be dealing with several issues when you go to sleep . Get a good night of rest and when you wake up you might have the answers to all your problems and issues . The question is then how do you ensure you get a good nights sleep as a full-time parent . Well do n't worry I 've got some great ideas . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's filling before you go to sleep . Weirdly a lot of people are kept from getting a good night of sleep simply because once they hit the hay they get hungry . Their stomach rumbles all night until they give in and go get a snack . That snack is often filled with sugar , and it wakes them up . Thus the cycle continues . By getting a warm drink you 'll soothe your body and give it the food it needs to get through the night . <h> Exercise <p> You can think about exercising for roughly thirty minutes before bed . This will ensure that you are tired when you hit the pillow and hopefully that you can get to sleep straight away . Although , it 's not guaranteed and it can have the opposite effect . By exercising you can give yourself a fresh shot of energy that keeps you awake for longer . That 's why you need to have a period of rest after exercising . Leave about an hour between exercise and sleep . It 's during this time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pillow Talk <p> You may want to think about getting a new pillow for your bed . As they often say , the simplest answer tends to be the best . In this case , that means making sure that you are as comfortable as possible in bed . The best contour pillow will give your back , neck and head the exact level of support that you need . It will ensure that you are n't kept up because you ca n't find the right position . <h> Writing It Down <p> You might want to keep a diary before bed . Here , you can write down any issues that you had through the day . This will stop them running on through your mind , keeping you awake all through the night . It 's another common reason why some people do n't get the level of sleep they need . By writing problems down , you are subconsciously telling yourself that you have dealt with the problem . Therefore , you do n't need to spend all night thinking about it . <p> I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of sleep that you definitely deserve . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

But while at best bad habits can be a little annoying , at worst they could be damaging your health or even slowly killing you . Sometimes we know the things we 're doing are n't great for our health , but others are n't so obvious ( you might even think you 're being healthy ! ) Here are a few daily habits that could be slowly killing you- some might surprise you ! <h> Not Getting Enough Sleep <p> We all know how not getting enough sleep in the short term can feel pretty brutal . Your head is fuzzy , you feel irritable , emotional , you 're drowsy , forgetful and have no concentration whatsoever . Being sleep deprived can lead to accidental injury and even death , whether it 's an auto accident or a mistake being made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keep depriving your body of sleep , and you will set yourself up for a whole host of problems . High blood pressure , heart attack , stroke and mood disorders such as depression can all occur . Tiredness also affects our hunger hormones it can make you hungrier than usual and also , so you do n't feel full as quickly . Over a prolonged period this could lead to weight gain , obesity , and diseases relating to this such as diabetes . Staying up late could be out of habit , perhaps you 're so used to going to bed late , getting up exhausted and fuelling yourself with coffee and energy drinks through the day that it 's become normal ' to you . Maybe you do n't organize your time well , meaning you 're running around until late doing jobs that should have been tackled earlier . You might feel tired all day but then get into bed and accidentally wake your brain up by watching tv or playing games on your phone making it hard to drift off . Either way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once and for all . As lack of sleep impacts your health and quality of life dramatically . <h> Drinking Alcohol <p> Drinking alcohol is widely socially accepted . We meet up with friends for a drink at the weekends or join our partner for a glass of wine in the evening . No one probably blinks an eye at you cracking open a cold drink after work . For this reason , it can be easy to slip into alcoholism without even realizing . One beverage can lead to two , and before you know it you feel uneasy about the idea of skipping those drinks . You do n't have to be getting blind raving drunk every night to be an alcoholic , in fact , you can be consuming a relatively small amount . The issue arises when you become dependent on this alcohol . It 's important to seek help early since when you 're hooked , you could find that you start increasing the amount you drink to get the same effect and a minor problem turns into a much larger one . The Recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so do n't bury your head in the sand or feel like you 're too ashamed to open up . Seeking help is extremely brave and rather than being judged you will be helped . Other problems with drink can include binge drinking . Do you find yourself drinking to oblivion every time there 's a party or alcohol involved ? Not only does getting blind drunk increase your risk of accidental death and injury , but you 're also likely to engage in more risky behaviors . You might not touch alcohol at all during the week , or even for weeks/ months at a time . But if you ca n't control yourself when you do have it , this is of course a huge problem . Counseling might be able to help you get to the bottom of why you do this . Do you have problems recognizing your limits ? Perhaps anxiety means you drink for added confidence at social events . <h> Watching TV <p> Yeah , that 's right , even something as seemingly safe as watching TV could be one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that people who sit too much every day are at an increased risk of diabetes , heart disease , cancer and shorter life spans . So whether you spend too much time watching tv in the evenings , playing computer games or even reading- make sure you limit the time you 're sat on your backside and get up and moving as much as possible . If you work a sedentary job , you could ask to have a standing desk installed . Instead of getting home and flaking out on the sofa , sign up for some active hobbies that you can go out and do instead . Hit the gym with friends , sign up for a sport or just make the most of the weather while it 's still nice and go on a walk or bike ride with the family . While relaxing and putting your feet up is important , if you spend most of the day sat down it makes sense to be as active as you can for the rest of the time . <h> Drinking Tap Water <p> We 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more refreshing than a cold glass of H20 from the tap ? Of course , the information about drinking more water still stands , it helps to replenish your body of lost fluids , helps your brain and other organs work more efficiently , keeps skin clear and is generally great for every cell in your body . But water right from the tap can contain all kinds of hidden nasties that you 've probably never given a second thought to . Viruses , bacteria , parasites , arsenic , plastics and heavy metals are all regularly found during testing of tap water . Metals like lead are highly toxic and can actually build up in your system , it 's thought to enter the water through old pipes . Babies , unborn babies , and young children are at particular risk although it 's of course dangerous to everyone and is something that should be avoided . You can ensure you 're drinking safer water simply by filtering it . If you fill a filter jug and pop it in the fridge , you always have cold , clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your kitchen tap . <p> Eating Non-Organic Fruit and Veg <p> You would n't think that buying fresh fruit and veggies would be considered one of those bad habits . After all , what could be healthier than a recipe made with fresh fruit or a delicious vegetable on your plate- right ? While fresh produce is incredibly important and should be eaten in abundance , it 's always worth buying organic for some products . This is because the herbicides , pesticides and other chemicals non- organic produce is sprayed with can still remain even after washing . These chemicals have been linked to birth defects , cancers , ADHD , Alzheimer 's disease and more . A good rule of thumb is anything you eat the skin of you should buy organic- so things like tomatoes , apples , grapes , peaches and more . If you remove the skin before eating , like with bananas , oranges , melons , butternut squash , pineapples etc you 're fine to buy non-organic . This is because you do n't eat the part that has come in contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy organic , but it 's well worth the cost if it means avoiding potentially harmful and deadly illnesses . If you find a good local farmer 's market or other organic market , you 'll be able to stock up without it costing the earth . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Jackpot Candles . <p> Jackpot Candles are 100% natural soy wax candles that are hand poured right here in the USA . They come in a rainbow of colors and scents , and inside every candle is a piece of jewelry valued between $15 and $5000 . Now I know what you are thinking , another candle with jewelry in it ? Well it is , and it is n't , because with Jackpot Candles you not only get to choose your scent , you also get to choose the type jewelry you want whether you prefer earrings , rings ( sizes 6,7,8,9 ) or necklaces ! In addition , Jackpot Candles also makes it easy to find out the value of your jewelry without ever having to leave your home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will burn anywhere from 80 to 100 hours . They come in a heavy glass jar with an airtight lid , and once the candle is used up you can wash the jar and re-use it for all sorts of things . It takes anywhere from 3 to 6 hours to burn the candle down to where the pouch is exposed . Once you see it , extinguish the flame , let it cool down for just a few moments , then use a pair of tweezers to remove the pouch . Your new jewelry is securely wrapped in both plastic bags and foil , and once you open the package you will also find a tiny tag with a code on it . To find out the value , go to the Jackpot Candles website where you will see a tab for their appraisal page . Once there enter the code , and in just seconds you can find out the exact value of your jewelry . <p> Choosing a scent was the hardest part as there are several different options . I finally decided on Lilac which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floral scent with hints of lavender . When you first remove the lid the scent is quite strong , but it tends to be a bit less potent once it is burning . Within an hour my den was smelling heavenly , and the candle was burning steadily and cleanly ( just one of many reasons I love soy wax candles ! ) . Several hours later I was able to see the foil pouch , and minutes later I had it out of the candle . <p> One thing about soy wax is it is very slippery so be prepared to get it all over your fingers when opening the packaging ; although it easily washes off . I was pleased to see how well the jewelry was wrapped , and although the wax had worked its way into the foil , it had not made it into either of the plastic bags . Seconds later , I had the earrings out , and was online checking their value . Here they are ! <p> Although they are far from $5000 , these $20 fashion earrings are perfect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to enjoy ! <p> In addition to jewelry candles , Jackpot Candles also offers Jewelry Tart Wax Melts ! Like the candles , the tarts are available in several delicious scents , and each package of 6 tarts comes with a jewelry surprise . <p> Give her a gift shell always remember this Valentines Day or any other day from Jackpot Candles ! 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

@@29514874 @3214874/ <h> Kitchen Organization with YouCopia <p> Living in an older house has its benefits , but it also has a lot of drawbacks . Especially when it comes to the kitchen . While my kitchen is not small , the way it was designed leaves a lot to be desired . There 's a lot of wasted space , especially when it comes to kitchen storage . I love to cook and bake , but with the lack of storage space , I 've had to learn to be creative . YouCopia offers all sorts of great kitchen organizers that have helped me make the best of my kitchen storage . ( Pssstdont miss our YouCopia giveaway at the bottom of this post ! ) . <h> YouCopia Spice Liner ( 6 pack ) <p> A few years back , when we were still living in an apartment , I had even less storage than I do now . One of my biggest pet peeves was not having a good way to store my spices . The YouCopia Spice Stack gave me a wonderful way to access those spices without having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bottle I needed . And while I still use that spice rack , I have even more spices now . To make it worse , I only have 1 cabinet that I can dedicate for all the rest of spices . And its a cabinet that I really need to use for other things . I needed more spice storage bad , and the YouCopia Spice Liner worked perfectly ! <p> To help make up for the lack of storage and counter space , I bought one of those rolling kitchen carts that has both cabinet space and a drawer . Unfortunately , that drawer is so shallow I can hardly put anything in it . However , it is the perfect size , width and depth for spice jars ! Using the YouCopia Spice Liners , I now have plenty of space for my spices . The Spice Liner is not one single mat . Instead you get six individual , non-slip foam strips that work to keep each bottle in its place . Designed to fit standard kitchen drawers , each strip measures approximately 2.5 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in diameter . You do n't  need any tools , glue or sticky strips to install . Simply lay them out in your drawer , add the spices , and that 's it . Using all six strips , I can put 24 spice bottles in that one drawer , helping to free up another cabinet for my other kitchen tools ! <h> YouCopia Spice Steps <p> Another bad storage issue in my kitchen is the pantry cabinet . While I am thrilled to actually have a pantry ( I did n't  have one in our apartment ) , like the rest of the kitchen , it is poorly designed . The shelves are so large and deep , I have to dig around and pull stuff out to access what I need . So I decided to use the YouCopia Spice Steps for pantry organization . The Spice Steps are exactly what their name suggests : a spice rack with four tiers to help maximize storage . Made of a strong plastic , the Spice Steps can hold up to 24 spice bottles . Each tier is a bit higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact spice I need , quickly and without having to move things around . And to help keep spices even more organized , the Spice Steps come with 96 easy-to-read , pre-printed spice labels and blank labels . <p> With the Spice Steps , there is zero installation required .

I can not tell you how many times I have ordered our cat Sookie a new toy , only to find her loving the box it came in even more ! Unfortunately cardboard boxes are a bit unsightly to leave lying around your home for your cats enjoyment . Now , however , there are Catty Stacks the perfect , eco-friendly solution to your cats love for boxes . Catty Stacks are 100% recycled , modular cardboard cubes that can be stacked together in a variety of ways with the use of metal clips . <p> Made of industrial strength corrugated UltraboardTM , each Catty Stack is able to support up to 20 pounds , making them safe for multiple cat homes . They are available in several colors including Pistachio Green , Sky Blue , Snow White , Tickled Pink and Chocolate Brown the color coming from a vegetable-based ink . They are easier to clean than carpet-covered cat condos , and have no smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for letting the kids color or paint using non-toxic materials as a way to occupy them during the long hot days of summer ! <p> Catty Stacks are pretty easy to assemble once you get the hang of it . Unfortunately , the instructions that come with each cube , are not very detailed or descriptive , but once you figure your first one out , you 'll quickly get the rest done ! Apparently the developers know this because they provide tips and an instructional video on the Catty Stacks site to help ! Unfortunately , I was too stubborn to check it out until I was ready to write this review , but I can see how it will definitely help ! <p> Before you get started , you want to make sure you have a good amount of space to work in , either on a table or on the floor . Each cube begins as two pieces of flat cardboard strapped together , so your first step is to unstrap the two panels and unfold them . <p> Along with the two panels is a box of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use them later to attach multiple cubes together . Once you get both panels unfolded , you 'll notice tabs and hooks on each of the sides . You need to bend all of these down ( towards the inside ) on both panels as they are what you use to attach all of the sides to form the cube . <p> Next you position the panels so the two sides that have the hooks are side by side . Interlock these hooks together so they will be on the inside of the box , the begin folding the sides up and together until you have your cube shape . <p> Lastly , you insert the tabs into the slots that were formed when you bent all the tabs down . Continue until all slots and tabs are together and you have a securely made cube . <p> If you have a larger cat and you are worried about its ability to fit through the holes , do n't  be ! When you look closely around the holes , you will see a perforated line . Using an Xacto knife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes . The side holes measure 6.25 ? in diameter , but can be expanded to 10.5 ? , while the top/bottom climbing holes are around 5.5 ? and can be expanded to 7 ? . Once together , the cubes themselves measure approximately 16 ? in width , 16 ? in diameter and 15 ? in height . <p> Once you have all of your cubes made , you use the metal clips to secure the cubes together , stacking them into multiple levels or whatever form you desire . Catty Stacks innovative design allows for all kinds of unique configurations that you can easily move around to hold your cats interest . Plus they are modular so you can add or replace boxes as you see fit . <p> At first Sookie was n't sure what to make of them . For days she would just walk through the bottom levels never climbing up to an upper level . I made sure to add some old shirts that had my scent , along with some catnip and a few toys into the cubes . Finally , at some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels . Now the Catty Stacks are her favorite place to play , hide and nap . <p> Another awesome thing about Catty Stacks is the price . Other kinds of cat furniture and cat condos can cost over $100 , Catty Stacks cost anywhere from $10.99 ( on sale now ! ) to $14.99 based on color . There is a 2 cube minimum , but why would you only want to order one anyway ? You can order Catty Stacks either directly through the website , or you can find them at your local Petsmart store . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

When you have kids running around the house , it can be a challenge to keep them out of any given room for an extended period of time , however , ensuring they stay away from freshly-cleaned carpet is very important to guarantee your cleaning is n't for naught . Here are the five most important rules to make sure your kids are aware of after you get your carpets cleaned : <p> Stay off the carpet <p> Carpet typically takes between four to eight hours to dry completely , however , it could potentially take even longer than that . It 's important that for at least the first two to four hours , all feet stay off the carpet . Walking around on a newly cleaned carpet will increase the amount of time it takes for the carpet to dry , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that matter , away for as long as possible . If someone does have to go onto the carpet for any reason right after it has been cleaned , just make sure they 're wearing clean , white socks ! <p> No shoes allowed <p> Damp carpet is more likely to pick up dirt from the soles of shoes . You will want to make sure to tell your kids that if they do need to be on the carpet at all after it has been cleaned , they should go barefoot or with only socks on . This is especially important if the soles of their shoes are a dark color , as it 's more likely that these will leave dirt tracks behind . <p> If you 're walking around on carpet that 's still damp , it can be very slippery .

It 's always best to take care of any dirt or spills as soon as they happen , so this is a rule that should always be in place . <p> You should not move furniture back into the area you 've had cleaned until the carpet is completely dry , typically for around 24 hours . While kids may want to hang out in the area ( especially if it 's the playroom or TV room that has been cleaned ) , remind them that they ca n't bring any furniture with them and will have to sit on the floor until you move everything back to its original spot . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

And to make it even more fun , I 'll also show you how to put together an adorable Halloween gift basket that is perfect for coffee lovers , teachers , neighbors and friends . Ready to get started ? <h> DIY Halloween Coffee Mug : Its Spooky How Much I Love My Coffee <p> This DIY Halloween coffee mug is not only cute , its also easy to make . I used my Cricut Explore Air , but if you do n't  have a Cricut or other die cut machine do n't  worry ! You can easily use waterproof craft paint instead . Simply download a few pictures of ghosts , print them on cardstock , then carefully cut them out to use as stencils . here 's how to make this fun DIY Halloween Coffee Mug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mug with rubbing alcohol to remove any grease or dirt . Once it 's clean , try to avoid touching the mug anywhere other than the handle . <p> Next , open up a new project in Cricut Design Space . Begin adding the text in whichever font you 'd like . I used A Frightful Affair for the words Coffee and Spooky , and Annas Fancy Lettering-Hannah for the rest . <p> Do n't  forget to adjust the size of the lettering to fit your mug . Since I used a mug that measures 5.5 ? in height and a little over 3 ? in diameter , my measurements were : <p> the words Spooky and Coffee measure 2.75 ? wide and 0.91 ? tall . <p> the word Its measures 1.07 ? wide and 0.41 ? tall . <p> both How Much and I Love My measure 3 ? wide and 0.41 ? tall . <p> Now add the images of ghosts , making sure to adjust the size as needed . For my mug , the large ghost measures 2.28 ? wide and 2.5 ? tall . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Once your design is ready to be cut , place your vinyl on the mat , make sure your machine is set to Vinyl , and hit Go . Now sit back and let the machine do its thing . <p> Once everything is cut , gently remove the vinyl from the mat . Then , slowly peel off all of the excess vinyl surrounding the design . Use the weeding tool to remove any remaining vinyl you do not need . <p> Once you have finished weeding , cut a piece of transfer tape to size . Peel the backing off of the transfer tape and apply the grid-side over each design . Be sure to smooth over your design a few times to adhere the transfer tape . Tip : I find it easiest to first cover the entire design with one piece of contact paper , and then go back and cut the design into its individual pieces . <p> Next , turn each piece of the design over and gently peel the original backing away from the vinyl leaving the words and images imprinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design ( one at a time ) on the mug where you want it . Go over it a few times using a Cricut spatula or a credit card edge to ensure the vinyl sticks to the mug , and then slowly peel off the transfer tape . Repeat for each piece of the design . <p> And that 's it ! Cute , is n't it ? ! Make sure you wait at least a day before using the mug to give the vinyl time to fully adhere to the mug . <p> Even though the vinyl is supposed to be dishwasher safe , I recommend hand washing the mug so it will last a long time . <h> Hazelnut Mocha Delight Recipe <p> Now that your Halloween coffee mug is finished , how about a delicious coffee recipe to pour in it ? This Hazelnut Mocha Delight coffee recipe is one of my fall favorites . Made with Dunkin Donuts Dark Roast , chocolate syrup , hazelnut syrup , and a few other tasty ingredients , its heaven in a mug ! <h> Heres What You Do <p> Make single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syrup , hazelnut syrup , vanilla and whole milk in a mug . Microwave for 30 seconds Add brewed coffee to the mug , stir to combine Top with whipped cream and chocolate shavings <h> Halloween Gift Basket Idea <p> If you need a creative Halloween treat , why not make a coffee lovers gift basket using the coffee mug ? Simply find a cute basket , line it with Halloween-themed tissue paper , fabric or anything else youd like . Include the coffee mug , a coffee scoop and a bag of Dunkin Donuts Dark Roast or any other tasty flavor ! I added Dunkin Donuts Pumpkin Spice in mine to go along with the Fall/Halloween theme . <h> Dunkin At Home <p> Speaking of Dunkin Donuts , did you know you can enjoy your favorite signature Dunkin Donuts coffee from the comfort of your home ? I 'm talking all of your favorite roasts including Seasonal flavors and even a Bakery Series ! And if you have n't tried the Dunkin Donuts Bakery Series , you are seriously missing out ! There are all sorts of amazing flavors including Cinnamon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caramel Coffee Cake ! Its liquid dessert in a cup ! Dunkin at Home coffees come in both bags and K-cups , and can be found at your favorite grocery . <p> I have never had Dunkin Donuts coffee and I really need to right that wrong . There is n't one near us but there is one in the city our daughter lives in . I 'm putting a stop there on my to-do list right now . I 'd love to try their coffee , I hear good things about it all the time . <p> I tried their coffee when I was on vacation last year . Unfortunately , we do n't  have a store near us either ! I am so happy I can buy it at the grocery it is YUMMY ! It really does taste as good as the ones youd get at their stores ! <p> Adorable ! I love how you dressed up that coffee mug . Where did you get your cricket ? I have looked into one in the past but I did n't  know if I would honestly use it . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heather ! Thank you ! ! I actually got mine via the company as an Ambassador . However , you can get the one I have for a lot less now since the 2nd version came out yesterday ! You can get it via Michaels , Amazon or thru the Cricut site ( I 'd do this , its a bit less expensive ) . I LOVE it very easy to learn and use ! I do n't  use it as much as I should , but they are fun ! Plus , you can give people handmade gifts , make things to sell , etc . As far as the coffee mug , if you use the outdoor vinyl ( there are different kinds of vinyl ) , it is safe in the dishwasher . However , I personally just hand wash mine because I want them to last as long as they can . I 've heard people say they have no issues when using their dishwasher , but I guess its personal preference . Let me know if you get one !

@@29514890 @3214890/ <h> Bamboo Studio : Bamboo Dinnerware Set Stylish and Biodegradable ! 130178 @qwx330178 <p> One of the most popular materials now being used in eco-friendly- and green-living focused households is Bamboo . Today you can find everything from bed sheets to kitchen utensils made from this remarkable renewable resource . - There are several reasons why bamboo is such a popular eco-friendly material . First of all bamboo is the worlds fastest growing plant , growing up to a meter or more per day and reaching maturity within in just 4 to 5 years . - This means it is a very valuable sustainable resource- because unlike trees , bamboo grows fast enough to replace what is used . - Bamboo also requires no pesticides , no insecticides and no fertilizers. - It fights Global Warming by taking in 400% more greenhouse gases , and produces 35% more oxygen than standing trees making it an efficient replenisher of fresh air , and- it is biodegradable ! <p> I recently had the opportunity to review a- set of bamboo dinnerware made by- Bamboo Studio which I have fallen in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handcrafted from the sheaf of the emerging bamboo plant so that no part of the living plant is used . - The set is- completely- reusable , and is- also disposable and 100% biodegradable . Once disposed of the items will biodegrade completely within 4 to 6 months . - Each piece is also strong , durable and leak resistant . <p> The set comes with : <p> four 10 ? dinner plates , <p> four- 8 ? plates , <p> four- 5 ? plates , <p> four 7 ? bowls , <p> four 9 ? boats , and <p> four- flat wear sets each of which- includes a knife , fork and spoon . <p> Once I opened the packaging , - I was immediately struck with a pleasant woodsy scent , and the first thing I noticed about each piece was its- lovely , pale golden color with- slightly darker grains blended in . This coloring is completely natural , - so no harsh chemicals , bleaches or dyes have been used . - On the bottom side is a more pronounced , almost leopard-spotted pattern that complements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was how thin each piece was , but despite this , they are incredibly sturdy , almost like you would imagine a wooden plate to be . - The texture is very pleasant , with a silky smooth surface- that is cool to the touch , and all of the pieces- are also very light weight . <p> So far we have used this set several times and- they have held up extremely well ! - I am quite impressed with the fact that although they are thin , they can hold a fair amount of weight without bending or breaking like paper and styrofoam dinnerware- tends to do ! - Plus , liquids do n't  bleed through like I thought they would . The set looks great with practically every table setting , and although they are disposable , I plan on using them- again and again . To clean all I have to do is- hand wash them using hot , soapy water , then immediately dry them off with a soft cloth . I definitely- advise against soaking the plates or putting them in a dishwasher though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I love the way they look , their durability and the fact that they are eco-friendly . I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for an alternative to paper and styrofoam serveware , or looking to live a more green lifestyle . Be sure to visit the- Bamboo Studio website , where you can find their- entire line of kitchen products perfect for living green . In addition to plates , bowls and flat ware , they also offer serving pieces , utensils , trays , cute childrens dining sets and so much more !

So I decided to create a cute bumblebee party favor that can also be used as decor on your outdoor table to go with a set of tabletop lighted flower candles . These are the perfect accessories to decorate your table for a night time barbecue party , and at the end of the night , the kids can take home their candy-filled bumblebees !

Trim off the extra pipe cleaner . <p> using a half of a pipe cleaner ( or use one of those leftover pieces of pipe cleaner from the legs if it is large enough ) fold into a V shape , then curl the ends around a pencil and hot glue to the front of the bee ( the bottom on the Keeper ) right above where you are going to put the eyes for its antennae . <p> for the wings , cut out your wing shapes from a folded-over piece of plastic ( so you will have two wings ) .

This will allow the wings to stick up . <p> glue two wiggley eyes on the face of the bee right under the V of the antennae <p> use the permanent marker to draw a mouth <p> Your bumblebee is finished ! Allow to dry overnight . If you have folded the legs correctly , your bee will stand on his own .

Those of you who regularly read my posts know that I am slowly , but surely making the move to using products made with all natural ingredients in our home . There is just something about using products with man-made chemicals that no longer sits right with me , especially when it comes to bath and beauty products and my family ! So when Sofi and Liv offered me the opportunity to try their products , I could n't wait to see how well they worked ! <p> Created by the daughter of a talented aesthetician , Sofi and Livis an all natural skin care line made especially for babies and families with sensitive skin .

I immediately fell in love with this shampoo that also doubles as a body wash . As soon as I began washing my hair the bathroom was filled with the incredibly relaxing scent of lavender with a hint of chamomile . Just a small amount provided plenty of cleansing lather which rinsed out easily leaving my hair clean and incredibly soft . When I bathe with soap it always dries my skin leaving me clean , but itchy . So after every shower I have to apply some type of lotion to ease the dryness .

I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one while gently cleaning their delicate skin . <p> The Sofi and Liv Lavender Chamomile Calming Lotion for baby and family is my personal favorite .

The lotion has the perfect consistency , not too thick , yet not so thin as to be watery . Like the shampoo/body wash , a little bit goes a long way . I love how it absorbs quickly , leaving my skin silky soft and hydrated without any greasy residue . <p> Specially formulated just for Mom are the Ylang Ylang Calming Shampoo and Body Wash and the Calming Body Lotion . Like the Lavender Chamomile blends , the Ylang Ylang is made with all natural ingredients that are both calming and hydrating .

The Liv and Sofi rinsed off quickly and completely , leaving my skin clean , soft and hydrated and my mind and muscles soothed . <p> I find myself using the Sofi and Liv Ylang Ylang Calming Lotion frequently throughout the day . I love the calming scent of Ylang Ylang , and my hands and skin have never felt so soft .

Since my stepson has been out of the diaper phase for years , I have been using it to treat the itchy , dry skin on my arms and legs ( thanks a lot Winter ! ) , cracked heels , rough patches on elbows , and on the occasional scrape and scratch . I love that it is not greasy or waxy feeling at all , but instead has an incredibly smooth , almost powder-like feel to it that absorbs quickly and leaves skin silky soft .

But I had reached the point to where I had gotten tired of not knowing what my next step should be to reach what I desire . I had also gotten to the point where I felt lost . I figured speaking with a life coach could only make things better . And I was right . <p> The big day had finally arrived .

However , as soon as I logged into my session and my Life Reimagined life coach popped up on my screen , I was quickly and skillfully put at ease . <p> She began the session by explaining what life coaching is , how it differs from counseling , and what I could expect to get out of our session .

However , after she challenged me to really think about and tell her why I had made the selections I 'd made , things began to become much clearer .

Make sure to get the top edge and outer sides of the pan as well , wrapping the fabric around , pulling tight and smoothing into place . <p> Now that the front is done , its time for the corners and the back . Flip the pan over , and trim away any excess fabric on bottom . Coat the bottom of the pan with spray adhesive , and then smooth the fabric in place .

Instead of quickly typing two-handed , I am reduced to doing a single-handed pick and peck dance ! So when I was offered the opportunity to review a Lumsing wireless keyboard , I could n't wait to see if my problem was solved ! <p> Lumsing specializes in external batteries and wireless keyboards . Having had one of their power banks , I had a feeling that this keyboard would be well made . The Lumsing Ultrathin Wireless Keyboard Ultra-Slim Bluetooth 3.0 is a powerful wireless input device that works great with any Bluetooth-capable device including iPhones and iPads , tablets such as the Google Nexus , Samsung Galaxy , ASUS MeMOPad Vivotab , the Microsoft Surface Pro RT and many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extras , extremely reactive and compatible across the Android , IOS and Windows operating systems . <p> One of my favorite things about this keyboard is its size . At 9.45 long , 5.11 wide and a mere 0.18 thick , it is the perfect size for carrying to class or work , yet it is still large enough to provide a comfortable working surface . I no longer have to squint my eyes or bend forward to make sure I am hitting the correct key , and I can actually type with both hands ! I was really surprised at how thin this keyboard is , thinner than even a pen ! But do n't  let its small size fool you its powerful , rechargeable lithium battery is capable of lasting up to 100+ working hours before needing to be recharged , and it has a life of 3+ years which is awesome for a wireless keyboard ! <p> The Lumsing Ultrathin Wireless Keyboard features almost every aspect of a traditional keyboard and also has fluorescence on the keys for use in low light environments or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the alternate function key , F1 through F12 , Ctrl+Alt+Del , Cap Locks , PageUp/Down and more . Depending on which system you are using , there are several dedicated keys too , such as the four main Android keys , a Windows key and even music/video hotkeys to give you fast access to your favorite music or video playlist . In fact , inside the included manual are tables for the Android , Windows and IOS systems that shows you which keys are dedicated to which functions . Although the default mode is for Android systems , switching between platforms is as easy as simultaneously pressing the Fn key and W for Windows or the Fn key and E for IOS . This is perfect for people who have several different items across various platforms such as myself with a Windows computer , an Android keyboard and an iPhone . <p> I love that the keys are practically whisper quiet when pressed , and the fact that they are secure without any wriggling around or looseness , further goes to show that this is a high quality keyboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite impressive almost instantaneous ! Typing is fast and very accurate , and its so much better than using a finger or stylus on the touchscreen . Did I mention that this keyboard is also waterproof and dust-proof ? Plus , it comes with a power saving mode where it will enter sleep mode after being idle for 15 minutes ! <p> Pairing is a cinch and involves turning the keyboard on and pressing the Bluetooth connect button next to the On/Off switch . Then do a search for new devices on the device you are wanting to pair to the keyboard , and select Bluetooth 3.0 Keyboard once it 's discovered . A code will then be displayed on the pairing device which you type into the keyboard , and then press Enter . That 's it , done . Although I can not find where it says how many devices the keyboard can be paired to , I have it paired with three of mine and so far so good . <p> Overall I am quite impressed with this wireless keyboard ! I love using it with my iPhone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier and faster than trying to type on those tiny touch screen buttons ! The only thing I wish they would have though of was adding something on the backside so the keyboard would not slide around on tables and other slick surfaces . Of course , this is in no way a deal breaker as you can buy cases for these keyboards or even add something yourself . In summary , if you are looking for a wireless keyboard that you can comfortably see and use , yet one that is small enough to take wherever you go , I definitely recommend the Lumsing Ultrathin Wireless Keyboard ! <p> The Lumsing Ultrathin Wireless Keyboard is available through Amazon at a crazy-affordable price !

Second , they contain all-day moisturizers and Vitamins A , C and E which help to soothe and protect the skin while it gets back to normal after scratching . <p> We have used both creams several times for everything from minor scrapes to mosquito bites , and they are living up to their name . When my husband and I got eaten alive by mosquitos while grilling out the other night , we immediately applied the Intensive Relief to each bite and within seconds the itch was gone .

In the US , on average ten percent of couples who are trying to conceive struggle . This means that for every 300 couples that get pregnant within a year , there will be 30 couples that struggle to conceive . The good news is that for most couples with fertility problems , the issue can be resolved in one way or another . <p> If you 're struggling to get pregnant , you 're probably wondering what 's causing the problem . This depends , as there are a whole range of reasons why couples struggle to get pregnant . With that in mind , to give you a better idea of why most couples struggle to get pregnant and how to deal with the problem , below is a list of the most common reasons for fertility issues . <h> Common causes of fertility problems in men : <p> Varicocele is one reason why men struggle with fertility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testicles are too large , impacting the shape and health of the sperm . <p> Another cause of problems is when a man is making too few sperm or none at all . <p> Then there 's the fact that some sperm are n't the right shape and because of this struggle to move properly . This makes conception an issue . In this instance , and when men are making too few sperm , IVF specialists recommend considering IVF , because it offers the best chance of conceiving . <p> Some health conditions can also cause infertility in men , such as cystic fibrosis , for instance . Other times , an injury can impact a man 's ability to make healthy sperm . <p> Then there are lifestyle factors to take into account .

This means that men that drink a lot of alcohol , are overweight , take drugs , smoke , work in a toxic environment , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men who take a lot of hot baths are also at risk of problems with their sperm . The good news is that by changing their lifestyle , a lot of men are able to create healthy sperm , boosting their fertility . <h> Common causes of fertility problems in women : <p> Studies have shown that when it comes to problems with female fertility , the most common cause is due to ovulation issues . Without ovulation , there 's no egg to be fertilized , and so , no chance of a baby being conceived . <p> One of the main causes of problems with ovulation is Polycystic Ovary Syndrome , a problem caused by a hormone imbalance that prevents normal ovulation . <p> Another common cause of a problem with ovulation is Primary Ovarian Insufficiency . This is when the ovaries stop working as they should before the menopause occurs but is n't linked to early menopause . <p> Other causes of female fertility problems include blocked fallopian tubes , normally caused by Pelvic Inflammatory Disease or Endometriosis . Problems with the uterus can also impact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tissue . <p> Just like men , a womans ability to get pregnant is also impacted by her lifestyle choices , and also , her age . Men tend to be fertile from their mid-teens to their senior years , whereas women tend to lose their ability to have a child in their 50s when the menopause starts . As for lifestyle factors , the most common things that impact a woman 's ability to get pregnant include smoking , drinking large amounts of alcohol , stress , poor diet , and by being over or under weight . The good news is that by making lifestyle changes , most women can improve their fertility levels . <p> So , there you have it , the most common reasons that couples struggle to get pregnant . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

To me , its a feeling of absolute freedom , all the way down the mountain . <p> Like all skiers , I understand the importance of having the proper equipment , and one of the most essential pieces are the goggles . A proper pair of goggles not only work to keep the wind and snow out of your eyes , they also provide protection from the damaging UVA and UVB rays of the sun , as well as tree branches , twigs and other hazards . In addition , goggles help with visibility , and shading you from the morning sun and reducing the afternoon glare off the snow . <p> While the goggles definitely do their job on the way down , it is that time between runs and on the way back up that they really bother me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lift the goggles off my eyes , raise them up and let them rest on the brow of my helmet . Unfortunately though , they never seem to stay there . Instead they slowly start to inch up the curve of the helmet until they quickly snap off , dangling off the back of my helmet ! Sound familiar ? If so , you have got to check out the StingRay ! <h> About the StingRay <p> Created by StingRay Sport Products , the StingRay is an innovative solution to a common problem facing skiers , snowboarders and other winter sport enthusiasts ; a problem that the makers of the StingRay call the " Goggle Snap " . The Goggle Snap is what happens when you place your goggles on the brow of your helmet only to have them creep upwards until they snap off the back , hanging out of easy reach and leaving your expensive goggles vulnerable to scratches , melted snow pooling inside the lens and possibly even being lost . <p> Now , thanks to the StingRay , reaching up only to find your goggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The small , triangular-shaped StingRay easily attaches to your helmet where it acts as a stopper to prevent your goggles from moving any further back . It uses a unique adhesive strip that not only works with any helmet , but will hold the StingRay securely in place in wet weather and in temperatures as low as -40 degrees Fahrenheit ! See the StingRay in action below ! <h> Installing the Stingray <p> Attaching the StingRay to your helmet is simple and fast , and does not require any special tools or measuring . You begin by wiping down the bridge of your helmet with a bit of rubbing alcohol in order to ensure the very best adhesion . Once finished , place your goggles on the helmet as you would in between runs . Next , remove the protective backing from the StingRay and place it on the helmet ( at the bridge of the goggles ) , but do not press down quite yet . Make any adjustments to the positioning you may need , and then , once you are sure you have it exactly where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 20 seconds . That 's it ! <p> The makers of the StingRay estimate that it will stay in place for the industry life of your helmet , about 2 to 5 years . If for some reason you want to remove the StingRay , you can peel it off beginning from the tail and moving towards the front . Then , if there is any adhesive left , you can remove it with an adhesive remover . <h> Purchasing the Stingray <p> Say goodbye to the Goggle Snap and get your StingRay before you head out to hit the slopes ! For less than $15 you can order your Stingray in either black , blue or grey directly from the website , or on Amazon.com. 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

It can take a long time to get over it . Moving on can be hard at first . Many people who go through a breakup do n't even want to move on . It can be a long and complicated process to accept the loss of the relationship as well as the other person that was part of it . But we all have to start somewhere . <p> As soon as the words have come out of your mouth , you may deeply regret having done it . You 've said it 's over . Hearing those words makes the situation so real . And then you see their face and their reaction says it all . The relationship has ended . All that 's left is for one of you to leave , and for you both to say goodbye . <p> Whether there are tears at that moment or not , there certainly will be soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge change like a breakup happens . There are many reasons for breaking up a relationship . That means your tears may be of sadness , or relief that it 's all over now . The crying period may take just a few minutes , or it may last for days . It is good for us to cry , so try not to rush things . <p> Crying releases hormones and chemical changes in the body and brain that help us to relax and feel better . It will help you to sleep better . Sleep is the best way to let the mind process the things that have happened . It helps you gain a better perspective of where you are right now . Emotionally , you may be fragile . But with a little rest , you 'll feel less raw in no time . <p> There is often more than one reason for a breakup . It wo n't be down to just one thing . Instead , an accumulation of problems or incidents will add up to be the cause of you both going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you want different things . Perhaps you just want things to be a different way and the other person is n't able to offer that . <p> This time of year can be very tough to be single . Valentines is always such a romantic day . It 's difficult to spend it alone at any time , but immediately after a breakup can make it much tougher . However , it is at this time of year that you can think about how important romance and company is to you . Where are your priorities in a relationship ? <p> Many of us miss the physical intimacy a relationship provides . We 're social creatures . Physical touch like cuddles , kisses , and hand holding are reassuring , comforting , and pleasant . Deeper relationships often provide other physical intimacies . They offer a far more intense bonding between you both . It 's easy to miss this too . But do you miss the intimacies or the person you 've split from ? It 's important to consider this carefully . <p> It is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship . You may be thinking about how to get your ex boyfriend back . If you feel your breakup was hasty and ill-thought out , then chances are you will have a chance to get back to him . If you are certain that a mistake has been made in splitting up , then working on your approach to making amends can be a good idea . <p> Of course , some relationships come to an end for good reason . When you realize you 're not meant to be , then it can be easier to make a clean break and move on . Moving on may be a long-winded process . Very few people can jump into another committed relationship within just a few days of a breakup . But that does n't mean you ca n't enjoy the company of other people during this time . <p> Most people acknowledge that they need some time alone . This is important before getting involved in another relationship . During this period , it can be a good idea to spend some quality time getting to know yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they all require sacrifices . You may have seen less of your friends , or even given up hobbies and interests to make time for your partner . This in itself can be a reason for a breakup . So get back into your favorite activities , and meet up with your mates . <p> What have you really missed while you 've been in your relationship ? And what dreams , aspirations and goals did you put on hold while you pursued your relationship ? These are the things to address now . Many people throw themselves into exercise programs or an extensive social life . This can be a good thing while you are dipping your toe into life as a single person again . <p> Living arrangements can be quite tricky to sort out when a relationship breaks down . If you lived together , one of you would have to move out . Finding somewhere new to live needs to be a priority so you can get your life back in order . Choose something cheap and cheerful , and move everything out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolonged goodbye with the person you are splitting from . And it helps you get back your own life as quickly as possible . <p> Life is also more expensive when you are single . Why not try and get a roommate to help share the bills ? And heading back home to your parents should n't be something you are ashamed to do , but rather something you are strong enough to face . They will help take the pressure off financially , as well as domestically . This gives you the time and support you need to get back on your feet . <p> It 's important not to seek a substitute when you have decided to end a relationship . Instead , seek enrichment in your life . If they ended things , it 's easy to feel sorry for yourself . Thoughts that you were n't good enough in some way do you no favors . Instead , accept this was n't the right relationship for either of you . True love will arrive when the time is right for you to be just you . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

@@29514921 @3214921/ <h> The Art of Gifting <h> Giving the Perfect Gift <p> Giving a gift is about more than exchanging material goods " it is one of the ways that we show love and respect for the people in our lives . Therefore , when you give a gift , it is important to put some thought and attention into choosing the perfect present . Doing so will send a message that you wish the recipient nothing but good things . Whereas , sending the wrong gift can be disappointing or extremely insulting , depending on how wrong you get it ! <p> Unfortunately , whether buying from Mother 's Day , Christmas or a birthday , it can be difficult to get it right . If you do n't want to find yourself scrambling around for the right gift until inspiration hits and miserably missing the mark , here are some tips that will ensure you always give the perfect gift : <h> Pay Attention <p> The key to choosing the perfect gift for anyone of any age for any occasion is to pay attention . Only by observing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you ever hope to pick out the perfect gift that they will love . <p> There may be an endless number of gifts to choose from , but unless you know the likes and dislikes of the recipient , you will struggle to pick out the right thing ; the thing that makes them jump up and down with glee , and that is what you want to do . <h> Gift by Personality <p> It is important to consider the personality of the person you are giving to if you want to avoid an awkward exchange of gifts . For example , your sister may be into fashion , but she 's not the showy type . So , buying her an outrageous outfit with a designer label probably would n't go down well , whereas the gift of a classic Chanel piece would likely be a big hit . Tailor the gift not only to the interests but the personality , and you ca n't fail to be one of the best gift-givers in your circle . <h> Consider the Occasion <p> There are many cool things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion before you go ahead and purchase them . For example , the gift of a funky welcome mat may go down well as a housewarming gift , but it 's unlikely to light up your best friend 's face if you present it to her on her 30th birthday . <h> Give a Charity Gift <p> If you know someone who is impossible to buy for , who already seems to have everything they could want , or who is a minimalist by nature , you can still get them something they will treasure . Go for a charity gift , which sees your money used to help animals and people who are not as fortunate as you and your family and all parties will be happy . The key is to find a cause that is close to the participants heart and choose the charity accordingly . So , if your recipient is an animal lover , give to a dog rescue charity , or if they love art , donate to a local museum in their name . <h> Gift by Hobby or Interest <p> Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobby or interest they are passionate about . Perhaps your uncle loves wine , or your brother is mad about football . Use this to your advantage , buy them something niche-related and show them that you have been listening to their impassioned talks and you do get how important wine/football/art is in their life . <h> Be Creative <p> Quirky and unique gifts tend to be particularly well received as they show that you have put a lot of time , care and love into your gift . So , if you have a particular skill that can be used to create a handmade gift , put it to good use , but do so in a way that shows you know your friend or family member inside out by making something related to one of their interests in some way . This could be something as simple as a knitted scarf to something a bit more creative like a painting or a poem . Think about what they would enjoy and get to work . <h> Gift by Star Sign <p> If you have a family member who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the esoteric or unusual , you can almost certainly gain gifting brownie points by buying them something related to their star sign . You can buy all kinds of jewelery , crystals , and clothing that relate to astrological symbols and birthstones and they are particularly good for gifting people on their birthdays . <h> Gift an Adventure <p> Gifting material goods is all good and well , but sometimes you simply ca n't find anything that your friend would appreciate . They already have all the essentials and plenty of non-essentials too , so what do you do ? You think outside the box and buy them the gift of an experience . <p> There are so many adventure activity experiences , from driving a Ferrari around a racetrack to going up in a hot air balloon , that you should have no difficulty finding an adventure gift that everyone in your life will love , and they are almost universally well-received , providing you take into account the recipients likes and dislikes and all of the other points discussed in this guide . For example , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is afraid of heights or a wine tasting event for your friend who you 've only ever seen drinking beer ; think of what they like and find an adventure that matches up to avoid a gifting failure . <h> Gift Yourself <p> If all else fails and you really ca n't think of a suitable gift for your granny or your great uncle , you could consider gifting them your time . Print out coupons promising to do the chores , walk the dogs , accompany them shopping , or anything else you think they might enjoy or need help with and they will be over the moon . Just make sure you honor your coupons , or this great gift will soon turn sour . <h> Make it Meaningful <p> As you can see , there are tons of options when it comes to giving gifts that really show you care , but whatever gifts you want to give , the most important thing you can do is make your purchases meaningful and give them with love ! 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

When it comes to your ride , the sweltering temps can spell trouble . While you can always lessen the chances of mechanical failure through periodic maintenance , take extra care that you have the following six essential summer car care tips done before driving off into the steamy summer sunset . <h> Air-Conditioning System <p> Air-conditioning is a summer essential . If your system has n't  been working properly , nows the time to get it checked before it fails . Have a qualified mechanic check for an issues including leaks . Newer model cars also have cabin air filters to clean the air entering the heating and air conditioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations . <h> Vehicle Cooling System <p> One of the most common summer car issues is overheating . Your cars cooling system is critical to warm weather driving . It not only works to keep your cars engine cool , it also works to protect your engine against corrosion , provide more efficient fuel combustion , and maintain proper oil viscosity . <p> Hot temperatures and low coolant levels will increase the risk of your engine overheating . Check the radiator and hoses for leaks or cracks , and make sure all connections are snug . Squeeze the hoses ( when the engine is cool ) to make sure they feel firm and not overly squishy or soft . <p> Check your coolant level and top it off if needed . You should also check the amount of coolant in the reservoir ; it should be half full . If it is low , add coolant or antifreeze . If the tank is empty , there is a chance you have a leak and should take it to a professional to check . <p> Additionally , it is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other debris that might have accumulated in the fins of the radiator and the air conditioning condenser . <p> Do you know the signs of an overheated engine ? Your temperature gauge will begin rising , warning lights will come on , and steam may even come billowing out from the hood . If you notice any of these signs , pull over to a safe place , turn off the engine , and wait at least a half hour for it to cool down fully before opening the hood . Check your coolant levels , and add more if needed . If you can not determine the problem , call for help , do not try driving again . <h> Check All Fluids <p> Another of the important summer car care tips is to check the oil , brake , power-steering and windshield-washer fluids on a regular basis as these fluids never stop being used and consumed . Top off any low fluids , and make sure you are changing the oil as often as it is recommended for your make and model . <h> Inspect and Replace All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially the air filter . A clogged air filter can cause poor fuel efficiency and even affect your engines power . Additionally , if you have a newer car , remember to check the cabin filtration system filter , too . <h> Brakes <p> Checking your brakes is another important summer car care tip . Warmer temperatures can increase the temperature of your brake system and therefore cause the pads to wear more quickly . In addition , summer weather brings rain and thunderstorms , and wet brakes can be less responsive . Have your brake system checked by a professional . <h> Tires <p> Did you know that your tires are more prone to blowouts in the hot summer months ? This is because we are often driving on a sizzling road with heavier loads for longer periods of time . Tires that are underinflated tires are most at risk since the lack of air pressure puts the tires components under increased strain . However , overinflated tires are more likely to hydroplane in a summer rainstorm . Make it a habit to check your tread check on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tire with Lincolns head facing inward . If you can see the top of Lincolns head , its time for a new set . <h> Battery <p> While batteries can fail any time of year , the change of season is a good time to have it checked . Routine care includes scraping away corrosion from posts and cable connections , cleaning all surfaces , and making sure to re-tighten all connections . If the battery caps are removable , check the fluid level and add filtered water if needed . Finally , have a professional check the batterys charge , or see if it needs replacing . <h> Smelly Ride <p> Okay , so while a smelly car is not exactly a mechanical car care tip , its still something we all have to deal with . As if the discomfort of heat is n't enough , a hot car can also mean a smelly car . Get rid of the stink by taping a dryer sheet onto the air conditioning vents . Then , when your turn on the ac , your car will get a refresher too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets under the passenger seat for maximum deodorizing . Do n't  want to use dryer sheets ? These DIY Car Deodorizers also work great , and they are inexpensive , too ! <p> Hey Atlanta peeps !

@@29514925 @3214925/ <h> 7 Simple Ways to Save on Summer Travel <h> Save on Summer Travel <p> Can you believe Summer is already here ! ? The kids are out of school , the weather is gorgeous , and we are so ready to get out-of-town and enjoy ourselves ! If you 're dreaming of the perfect vacation , but are worried about your budget , do n't  be ! You can still have the vacation of your dreams without breaking the bank . Here are seven simple ways you can save on summer travel from where you stay to the gas you put in the car . <h> 1 . Plan Your Trip Ahead of Time <p> Planning ahead not only makes things easier , it can also save you plenty of money . Having a clear idea of where you 're going and how you 're getting there , means less stress and a lower likelihood of extra expenses . Additionally , the earlier you make your reservations , the lower your rates will be . <p> When selecting a destination , narrow it down to a list of potential destinations based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most popular destinations as those places are practically guaranteed to be more expensive . If you 're wanting to hit the beach , consider staying in a smaller town as opposed to the one that everyone goes to . Not only will you get better prices by avoiding that tourist trap , you 'll avoid the crowds as well . <p> If you ca n't plan ahead , its still possible to get some great deals ! Look for last-minute getaway deals on travel sites such as Groupon Getaways and Living Social Escapes . Save on room expenses by searching major hotel chain websites for sales and special offers . And do n't  forget to look at websites that specialize in access to last minute trips , such as Last Minute Travel . <h> 2 . Make a Realistic Budget and Stick to It <p> One of the best ways to save on summer travel is by setting aside your funds ahead of time . Not only do you set aside stress , but you lower the chances of spending more than you should . Set a clear target price range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you include travel , lodging , food , admission prices and even a bit for souvenirs . Once that goal is set , you 'll feel more comfortable in locating and purchasing your vacation quickly . <h> 3 . Pick the Right Accommodations <p> Where you stay can play a big part when trying to save on summer travel . While hotels are the most obvious choice , there are plenty other options to consider . Stay with family or friends who live in the area . Or look into renting a condo or house . Websites such as Airbnb.com , VRBO.com and HomeAway.com often offer low rates on apartment , condo and house rentals worldwide . <p> If you do choose to get a hotel room , go online and compare several hotels to try to find the best price . Again , use those online deal sites to find discounts and deals . And if you have a little flexibility in your plans , consider booking at the last minute . Just like airlines , hotels will try to fill all rooms " even if that means heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the last minute you could snag a great deal . <h> 4 . Get a Room with A Kitchenette or Where Kids Eat Free <p> Food can add up to be one of the biggest expenses while on vacation . Luckily there are plenty of ways to save starting from the minute you hit the road . Avoid on-the-road food costs and save time by bringing your own non-perishable snacks , sandwiches and drinks so you do n't spend money on fast food . Staying at a place where they offer free breakfast as well as reserving a room with a kitchenette can also save you hundreds . Simply pick up some basic groceries and prepare simple meals and snacks in your own space . And when you do go out to eat , look for online deals and for restaurants where kids eat for free . <h> 5 . Consider Driving Instead of Flying <p> Depending on your destination , driving your own car can be a great way to save on summer travel . Summer is considered a peak travel time which means air fare is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , you 'll also avoid the cost of having to rent a car or pay for public transportation once you arrive at your destination . And if you can find special offers and other ways to save on gas " see number 7 in this list " you can save even more overall . <p> Just make sure you have a reliable and safe car that gets good gas mileage and has had its regular summer maintenance . And even if you do n't have a car , renting an economy car at $30-$50 a day could still be a cost-saver over the cost of flying . <h> 6 . Search for Discounts and Deals in Every Step of Your Vacation <p> My absolute favorite way to save on summer travel is by taking advantage on deals and discounts . Online deal sites can not only help you save money while planning your vacation , they can also be priceless when it comes to finding deals once you arrive at your destination . <p> You can find some amazing money-saving offers on everything from car rentals to hotel rooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Groupon , LivingSocial and Restaurant.com for online promotional codes and coupons on food , entertainment and more . And do n't  forget that Ebates.com offers cash back from dozens of travel merchants , with cash back on everything from hotels to cruises to complete vacation packages . <h> 7 . Use Gift Cards Instead of Credit Cards <p> Using gift cards instead of credit cards for summer travel has several benefits . First of all , there is no additional interest to pay when you stick with gift cards , or cash . Secondly , its safer . No need to worry about your cash being stolen while you are in the water . Third , it makes it easier to set a budget and stick with it . Plus , its easier to keep up with exactly what you are spending .

And finding the time to take that cruise or go on that week-long vacation can be even harder . Which is why when Hotel Indigo Tuscaloosa offered us a weekend away , my husband and I jumped at the chance especially since our 6 year anniversary was that weekend ! <p> Nestled in historic downtown Tuscaloosa , along the southern bank of the Black Warrior River , the Hotel Indigo Tuscaloosa is at the center of it all . The Riverwalk , restaurants , shopping , night clubs and more are all just a short walk or quick drive away . And if you 're in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a skip from Bryant Denny Stadium .

Immediately we were warmly greeted by the lady at the front desk with a big smile , a hug and a heartfelt Happy Anniversary ! Looking around the spacious lobby , I was struck by the spectacular decor . Like all Hotel Indigos , the decor and styling is unique to the locations and cities they 're in . Each boutique hotel takes inspiration from their local neighborhood which is reflected in everything from the decor and styling to the food and drinks they serve . <p> Local artwork hung on the walls , and the warm , rich color pallete gave the lobby a relaxing and welcoming air . Inviting little seating nooks were placed all around . <p> On one side of the lobby is a small grab and go market where you can find all the essentials you could need from energy drinks and coffee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection of local artisan foods and sauces , as well as little travel size necessities too ! <p> On the other side of the lobby is Shoals Kitchen , which serves breakfast and dinner .

You can either enjoy your food at one of their extra comfy tables , or have it delivered to your room . And speaking of rooms , I could n't wait to see ours ! <h> Our Room <p> The Hotel Indigo Tuscaloosa offers a variety of room types and suites , all equipped with the most modern amenities .

And if you want a romantic nighttime stroll alongside the river , the entire area is very well-lit at night . <p> There is also plenty to do in the city of Tuscaloosa . Head on over to shop at the new River Market or the crafters favorite Makers Market . Or check out the Tuscaloosa Museum of Arts , the Alabama Museum of Natural History , Capitol Park , or the University of Alabama . There are also dozens restaurants and shops throughout the town !

We will talk about building muscle , about losing weight , even about mental health . But what about your bones ? No-one can deny that it 's an essential part of a healthy body , but we do n't focus on it as much as we should . What are you doing to protect your bones and why , exactly , does it matter so much that you take care of them ? <p> As we grow older , we naturally lose bone strength and density . If it gets serious enough , it progresses to osteoporosis . That condition means that our bones suffer damage a lot easier which can seriously reduce our mobility as we grow . Keeping bones dense is about nutrition and exercise . Milk is a start but calcium is n't all you need . As AlgaeCal reviews on Supplement Police will tell you , vitamin D , potassium , zinc and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only preventing them from weakening but making them denser . Just like muscles , you can work your bones out , as well . They degrade and regenerate just like muscles and weight-bearing exercises ensure that they grow stronger as they regenerate , providing you 're giving them the nutrients they need . <p> The strength of your joints is just as important as the strength of the bones themselves . Especially if you do heavy impact exercise , missing out on joint care is going to lead to a lot more damage , potentially cause premature arthritis . You need to properly stretch before you exercise to stop joint and ligament damage from becoming a lot more common in exercise . You should also think of exercises that strengthen your joints . For instance , while running can have a negative effect if you overdo it , when done right it has a serious long-term benefit . Runners have been shown to have a significantly reduced risk of osteoarthritis in their knees , for instance . <p> While weight-bearing exercises are good for your bones and not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently wear down at them is your own body weight . There are a plethora of reasons to ensure that you have a healthy BMI and reducing the load on your bones is one of the most important ones . However , losing weight by cutting calories extensively is n't always the answer . It can actually lead to bone loss if you 're reducing your intake of calcium and the other vitamins and minerals mentioned above . Instead , the healthiest way to lose weight is always by doing more exercise . That way you 're not only burning calories but you 're strengthening your bones at the same time . <p> Without giving some consideration to our bones in both our workouts and our diet , we 're going to be feeling some of the most painful effects of age a lot quicker . We 'll be more prone to breakages and fractures , as well as joint pain from arthritis and similar conditions . Do yourself a favor and take care of them while it 's still easy . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

@@29514939 @3214939/ <p> Years ago the recipe book and the recipe box were a staple in almost every kitchen . Today , recipe readers are all the rage . If you love to cook but want an easier way to access , organize and store your favorite recipes , the latest Key Ingredient Recipe Reader HD+ tablet is exactly what you need ! <p> Back in 2013 I reviewed the original Key Ingredient Recipe Reader , which at the time was pretty neat for what it was . However , after trying the latest version , I have to say that the new 10 ? Key Ingredient Recipe Reader HD+ is much , much better ! A vast improvement on the small , somewhat chunky original design with its tiny , 7 ? screen , the Recipe Reader HD+ is thin , sleek , lightweight and powerful with a clear , crisp 10 ? HD touchscreen display . Here are just a few of the specs at a glance : <p> 8-core 2.1Ghz Processor <p> 2GB RAM <p> 16GB Internal Flash Drive SD-card Enabled <p> 2043 x 1536 Pixel 9.73-inch display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 Megapixel front and 13 Megapixel rear quality <p> Runs on Customized Android Amazon App Store <p> FM Radio and more <p> The latest recipe reader in the Key Ingredient line not only enables you to store , organize and search millions of recipes with the touch of a finger , it also does so much more . In fact , it is a full-featured Android-based tablet specifically designed for use in the kitchen . And by specifically designed I mean it comes with a spatter proof , water-resistant and heat-resistant case and touchscreen . So instead of having to risk your more expensive tablet or smartphone around the mess in the kitchen , you can simply mount the Recipe Reader HD+ and access it whenever you need . <p> When you open the box you will find the 10 ? Android tablet , a USB cord , a charging adapter , a pair of earbuds , an optional screen protector , and a User Manual and QuickStart Guide . While the sticker on the screen says to charge for 30 minutes before turning on , the instruction manual said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it safe and go with the 2 hour charging time , and as soon as that time was up and I had it up and running , I was quite impressed . <p> The Technical Stuff <p> The Key Ingredient Recipe Reader HD+ tablet features a 2043 x 1536 pixel super bright touchscreen that is preset to stay awake for 4 hours so you do n't  have to worry about the display cutting out while you are in the middle of following instructions for a recipe . Of course , you can easily adjust this to your own needs . <p> A rear-facing 13 MP camera allows you to take photos of your favorite recipes that you can save in the app thanks to the RecipeSpan service , and there is also a front facing 8MP camera . The power and volume rocker is located along the top right edge of the reader just below the rear-facing camera . And a 3.5mm headphone jack for the included ear buds plugs into the port that is located along the top edge . <p> Along the bottom edge is the left and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charging/data port . Speaking of charging , the tablet comes with a 3.7V 6,000mAh battery , but how long it lasts will of course depend on how you use the tablet . As with any tablet , the graphics , the processor , the speakers , WiFi , Bluetooth , and everything else will effect the batterys charge . I 've had no problems with it lasting up to 8 or 9 hours with light use and stand-by mode , and around 2.5 to 3 hours with moderate to heavy use . Of course , since the tablet was designed to be kept in the kitchen and used as a recipe reader , the battery is more than powerful enough and lasts much longer than typical use would require . Plus , if you are planning on cooking large meals for the holidays or other special occasions , you can always set it up or mount it near a power outlet and use the provided adapter if needed . <p> The Key Ingredient Recipe Reader HD+ also has a removable back cover that allows you to access the microSD slot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the very top towards you with the back facing you and the plastic cover should open easily exposing the two slots shown above . The entire back will not come off , just the top inch or so ( you can see the seam ) . Ive read that the device will take a SIM card , recognize it and work at up to 4G speeds . It also comes with a SIM Toolkit app pre-installed for those that want to add an active SIM . <p> The tablet is running on a customized Android Amazon App Store interface which mean that instead of having access to the Google Play store as you would with a typical Android OS , you instead have access to the Amazon Underground App store . While this may seem strange , it is in no way a deal breaker at least for me as you can install and use other apps from the Amazon app store as you see fit . <p> The Key Ingredient Recipe Reader HD+ also comes with a Tri-Stand that fits conveniently in any nook of your kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from the upper cabinets or on the wall . The weighted reader stand is very stable when standing , and holds the tablet securely in place . You can also rotate the tablet a full 360 degrees while it is secured in the stand . <p> The Key Ingredient Recipe App <p> The Recipe Reader HD+ comes pre-loaded with the Key Ingredient Recipe App which features 1000 amazing recipes already preloaded . However , once you sign up for the free Key Ingredient online cookbook account , you 'll also have access to over 2 million more recipes , the ability to add your own , the ability to sync , and much more ! here 's just a small sampling of the type recipes you can find : <p> Easy chicken recipes <p> Healthy recipes <p> Quick soup recipes <p> Easy Paleo recipes <p> Dessert recipes <p> Snacks and treats <p> Drinks <p> and More ! <p> You can also easily and quickly upload your own recipes that you have stored on your computer or tablet , or recipes from your favorite websites , so you have immediate access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize your favorite recipes either by category , such as main dish , appetizer and dessert , or by key ingredients , such as chicken , fish , meat , pasta , etc . You can also add recipes to your " favorites , save them into cookbooks that you create and name , access them offline , and even share via social media with your friends and family . Whenever you are ready to access one of your cookbooks or " favorites " , just turn your Recipe Reader HD+ on , click on the app , and they will be right there ! <p> While anyone can download the Key Ingredient Recipe App on their device , only this brand new model Recipe Reader gives owners access to exclusive apps and perks including : <p> RecipeSnap ( let 's you take pictures of your recipes using the readers camera , upload them and have them transcribed into a digital format and added to your collection ) , <p> the ability to organize recipes into cookbooks , <p> the ability to save recipes as favorites which can be accessed offline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , <p> and , my personal favorite , Text-to-Speech Recipe Reading , <p> and more ! <p> The Text-to-Speech Recipe Reading happens to be one of my favorites ! Now whenever Im in the middle of making a recipe and I do n't  have the time to keep looking back and forth between what I am doing and the screen , I can have the tablet can read the recipe aloud with the simple touch of a button . The recipes are read nice and slow , and if you miss a step or want to skip ahead , you can move the slider to the part you want to hear . The only drawback is that it is hard to hear the mono-tone , robotic sounding voice when you 've got all of the sounds inherent to a busy kitchen environment , but I 've found an easy way around this : pair the tablet with a Bluetooth speaker ! <p> In addition to all of the handy things the Key Ingredient Recipe app enables you to do , there are also several other pre-loaded apps including the Kitchen Timer app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time . This really comes in handy when cooking a large meal that has different cooking times for each individual recipe . The Conversion app quickly and easily converts common cooking units into other units such as cups into ounces . There 's also an FM radio app so you can listen to your favorite station while cooking . <p> Exactly How Good Is The HD Recipe Reader ? <p> The display is clear and crisp with great resolution , and even the camera offers great resolution and white balance . I also love the size . Size-wise the Recipe Reader HD+ is just about one inch smaller than my iPad , and its large screen is so much brighter and easier to see than the original Recipe Reader . As far as speed , I cant complain at all . The touchscreen is quickly responsive , apps openly and run quickly and smoothly , and even movies and music stream without any lag . In short , I love it ! <p> The current price for the Key Ingredient Recipe Reader HD+ is $199 shipped , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For that price you are not only getting a very capable , full-service tablet , you are also getting your very own " virtual recipe box " !

Wearing shorts and short-sleeved shirts helps , as does wearing that classic summer shoe , the sandal . Sandals are a staple of every womans warm weather wardrobe . They are fun and flirty , and while some may not be practical , they are definitely functional . For me , however , when it comes to summer fashion for feet , one thing is a must comfort ! Those of you who are familiar with this blog know that I have several foot issues , including plantar fasciitis and heel spurs . There are very few brands of shoes I can wear that still feel comfortable after just a few hours . This summer though , I believe I have discovered a shoe that really works for me BZees ! <p> BZees women 's shoes are specifically designed to be stylish and comfortable without being impractical . They come in several great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they all provide great on-the-go style ideal for any activity from running errands to a pleasant walk in the park . <p> What Makes BZees Shoes Different ? <p> BZees shoes are made with molded , low density , EVA soles that have micro-cellular air bubbles trapped within . This enables them to be lightweight , soft and bouncy while providing excellent flexibility and cushioning . <p> In addition , the footbeds of these shoes ( the bottoms ) are made of Free Foam which is a specially blended micro-cellular polymer foam . Its sort of like memory foam , except it does n't  compact and it has great bounce back ability . Add in an " additional viscoelastic memory foam arch support and you get a compressive customized fit that accommodates a wide range of arch heights " translation : BZees Free Foam footbeds are nice and squishy and shape to your foot while wearing them no matter what type of arch you may have ! <p> Last , but not least , the upper part of the shoes are made of a lightweight , elastic-y material which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the right amount of necessary support to enable your feet to move freely and naturally without being restrictive . This also allows the shoe to expand in keys areas where you need it most , while still providing an amazingly comfortable fit and wearing exprience . <p> Add all of this together , and you get an experience that is like , as they say on the Bzees website , " walking on a cloud , weightless , energized and free . " <p> Are BZees Shoes As Comfortable As They Say ? <p> Wanting and needing a new pair of summer sandals , I decided to try a pair of the Bzees Dream Sandal . Their stylish , yet casual appearance caught my eye , and I knew they would work perfectly whether I was wearing shorts or a summery dress . And of course I could n't wait to see if they were as comfortable as they are advertised to be . <p> Once the shoes arrived and I removed them from the box , sure enough the very first thing I noticed was how incredibly light these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightweight they weigh less than six ounces ! The second thing I noticed was how incredibly comfortable they are ! With every step I take my feet are cradled , supported and literally wrapped in comfort . <p> To be honest , at first I was a bit worried that since the shoes are so lightweight , they would n't hold up at all . Plus , since there was no back strap , I feared they would flip and flop too much as I walked . I neednt have worried about either one . You see , in spite of their lightness , these sandals are holding up perfectly . The bottoms are still as soft , comfortable and supportive as the first day I put them on , and the unique uppers do exactly what they are supposed to and hold each shoe securely on my feet while still allowing them to flex comfortably as I walk . <p> After about five weeks , I can honestly say that these sandals are one of the most comfortable pair I have owned of late ! They provide just the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great tread so I do n't  have to worry about slipping or sliding . And I love , love , love the pretty floral design on the insides of the sandals ! <p> BZees Shoes : Easy to Wear and Easy To Wash ? ! <p> Did I mention that Bzees are easy to wash , too ? ! This is because every Bzees shoe is made with wash-friendly materials that allow it to be machine washed in cold water and air-dried without losing their shape and colors or comfort and fit ! I have washed mine once so far , and the colors are just as rich as they were on the day they arrived , and the fit is just as comfortable . <p> Since I 've been wearing my Bzees , several people have stopped to comment on how cute they are and ask if they are really as comfy as they look .

While we relax with our pumpkin spice lattes and enjoy the changing of the leaves , we all know its around the corner . The time of year when you ca n't move for people sneezing , plans being cancelled at the last minute and waking up feeling horrific . Autumn and winter may have their blessings , but they also have their downside and it has a curious side effect also . <p> While regularly grouped together , a cold and the flu are vastly different things . There is a tendency for people to blame a nasty cold on flu , despite the fact they have little in common . The flu is not characterised by the blocked nose and stuffiness of the common cold , but more by exhaustion and fever . <p> So why do we group them ? Why are we marketed to as if they are the same thing ? It could be because of that most irritating of phrases : " just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold ! Its not that bad ! <p> Its worth noting that the people trotting out this lie usually do not have an active cold . They are tapping into memories of past colds , but distance has allowed them to forget . <p> What we refer to as " the cold " is actually a collection of many similar but different viruses . When we have had one , we become immune to it but we can pick up another strain . The only way to have any control on this is to practice good hygiene . <p> Do n't  touch the door handles of bars , restaurants and other public places during cold season . <p> Its tough in winter , but try to ventilate your home with the likes of a 20x20x5 air filter to help clear the air of any lurking nasties . <p> Avoid those you know are unwell , in case errant sneezes send the bug your way . <p> Ah , we have been led to believe a good dose of vitamin C can prevent colds .

There 's no real way you can stop your dog from barking , as they are programmed to bark if they are scared or think you might be in danger . However , something like a bark collar can help you to stop them . <h> Establish Yourself as the Leader <p> As mentioned earlier , you need the dominant energy . This means you have to establish yourself as the pack leader . How do you do this ? You ensure that you always enter the home before your dog .

Getting too excited when greeting your dog can give them emotional problems , and make them believe they come before other family members . This can be hard , but it 's important and will keep your dog happier in the long run ! <h> Praise <p> When your dog does something right , give them lots of praise . It 's ok to go OTT ! Small treats can help with training , but you want to gradually phase them out so they are n't consuming too many . <h> Be Consistent <p> Finally , making sure you are consistent as possible is key to making this work .

No matter who they have to buy for , they manage to nail it every time and make everyone happy ! Then , you have people that , try as they might , can never get the hang of gift buying . <p> If you 're reading this , then I bet you fall into that second category of people . You try your best all the time , but your gifts just never seem to create the excitement you hoped . You 're always buying things you thought were good gifts , but they turn out to be pretty poor ones . <p> Well , no more . This guide has been created to help anyone that has problems buying gifts for their friends &amp; family . I 've provided you with some general tips you can use and apply to any gift-giving scenario . If you want to become the best gift buyer in your family , I suggest you carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts are normally very well appreciated . Typically , this is for one simple reason ; it shows you 've been to a lot of effort . Anyone can buy someone a new t-shirt , but if you go out of your way to get a personalized t-shirt , it shows you 're very thoughtful . <p> You can get personalized gifts for pretty much any member of your family . For babies , you can get little baby grows of pajamas with their names embroidered on them from various sites . Young to teenage children can be giving personalized sports jerseys from any sports store . You can get a personalized wine label at GrogTag to add to a bottle of wine for brothers , husbands , and fathers . You can find a nightgown and slippers that you can personalize for your mother or sister . Regardless of who you 're buying for , there 's always a personalized option at your disposal . <p> You could , and should , extend the personalization to their card too . There are so many sites that offer loads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompaniment to any personalized gift . <h> Homemade Gifts Show Some Heart <p> A lot of people shy away from homemade gifts as they think they 're a bit of a cop out . In reality , a homemade gift shows you have a big heart , and is incredibly thoughtful . You 're giving someone something that you physically spent a lot of time creating just for them . Not only that , but you 're also giving them something unique . There is n't another one of your homemade gifts out there , as you 've personally made it specifically for one person . <p> You have a plethora of homemade gift ideas to choose from as well . Again , many people think homemade gifts revolve around food . This is n't true , although homemade food gifts are a huge winner in my eyes ! You can unlock your creative potential and make anything you want . Different people have different talents , put yours to the test with your creations . If you 've always been good at drawing , why not draw a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family photo and create a painted version of it . If you happen to be good at baking , bake a cake ! The opportunities are endless , you 're bound to find an idea that suits you . <p> There are two other benefits of a homemade gift besides the thoughtfulness . For starters , they 're cheap . If you have everything you need at your disposal already , then they can be free ! They 're a brilliant idea for someone that 's strapped for cash but wants to give out a really thoughtful gift nonetheless . Secondly , they do n't have to be perfect to be appreciated . The fact you 've gone to all this effort is enough to earn appreciation in most people 's eyes . <h> Food Is Always A Safe Option <p> I mentioned that some people think homemade gifts are a cop-out , well , food is probably the biggest cop out ever . However , that does n't mean food gifts are n't brilliant . Find me , someone that does n't appreciate some type of food gift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving them , which makes them a really good gift to give . <p> The beauty of this idea is the sheer choice available to you . You can find food gifts that are perfect for different people and occasions . For example , you can get things like gingerbread men , or Christmas themed food as Christmas presents . Chocolate is always a winner at Easter , and then you have many birthday-themed ideas too . You also have the choice between sweet and savory food gifts too . Again , these are great for different people . Younger family members will probably respond well to sweet treats . Especially if you 're very limited with how many sweets they get regularly . A sweet treat as a gift will be even more special as they 're usually never allowed them . For older family members , you can still go for sweet treats , but they might be open to savory ideas too . Things like gourmet chips or gourmet marmalade are great options . <p> Of course , as stated earlier , you can always make handmade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Food gifts are brilliant as they 're just a good last minute idea . We 've all been in scenarios where we 've forgotten to get a gift and realize the day before . It 's so easy to pop out to the shops and get a box of chocolates or a hamper to give to someone . Also , a food gift can still be a thoughtful gift . You could spend ages trying to hunt down a rare thing one of your family members tried on holiday and loved . Just the fact that you remember what people 's tastes are shows thoughtfulness . Do n't be afraid to buy food gifts , too many people shy away from them as they think they 're not very meaningful . <p> The three ideas I 've given you will help you buy gifts for anyone and any occasion . Each of them shows incredible thoughtfulness , which is one of the key things when buying gifts . The other key thing is that the recipient enjoys the gift and all three ideas ensure this happens too !

Now we are a family of 6 cats , and that daily battle against litter box odor , could easily become a full-fledged war ! Luckily I have a several tricks in my arsenal that keep my house smelling fresh and clean . In fact , many people who come over are surprised to learn that we even have cats . They often comment on how they ca n't smell the cat litter boxes at all . Want to know how I do it ? Check out my six ways to control litter box odor ! <p> This post is sponsored by Fresh Step- and the BlogPaws- Influencer Network . I am being compensated for helping spread the word about Fresh Step- with Febreze- but I only share information I feel is relevant to my readers . Fresh Step and its parent company Clorox- are not responsible for the content of this article . <h> 6 Ways to Control Litter Box Odor <p> 1 . Scoop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cats you have , whether its one or 6 , scooping the litter box at least once a day is the number one way to keep your home from smelling like a cat litter box . Plus , cats really prefer to go in a clean box , and who can blame them ? ! <p> 2 . Replace the litter at least once a week . In addition to scooping daily , changing the litter once a week will work wonders . No matter how many times a day you scoop , you are bound to miss some . And even a tiny bit will get smelly over time . Once a week , dump out the old litter , wash the box with a mild soap and warm water ( avoid toxic cleaners and ammonia-based cleaners ) , dry it completely , and put fresh litter in . <p> 3 . Replace the litter box once a year . While this may sound like its taking things a bit too far , its really not . Over time your cats claws and the scooper make small nicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . These tend to hold odor and are hard to clean . Replacing the box yearly is a sure-fire way of preventing this . And when looking for a new box , make sure it has high sides ( we all know cats have trouble keeping their rear end from hanging over the edge of the box ) and a shiny , protective coating on it in order to keep odors from seeping into the plastic . <p> 4 . Keep the litter box in a well-ventilated area . While it is tempting to hide the litter box in a small , dark , out-of-the way room , its not a good idea . All it does is allow odors to hang around in that small space , and there 's a good chance your kitty will not be too happy about the location . And if kitty is n't happy about where his litter box is located , he may just look for a better place to go ! Keep the litter box in a well-ventilated spot where odors can easily disperse , and there is plenty of space for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and come out . <p> 5 . Proper cat-to-litter box ratio . According to many pet experts , you should have one litter box per cat , plus one extra . Some cats do not like sharing and this rule allows them each to have their own . Plus if one box is in use or too close to the big scary vacuum cleaner monster , there 's another one available . <p> 6 . Use a quality brand of litter . No matter how many litter boxes you have and how clean you keep them , if you do n't  use a good quality litter , then your odor problems are bound to continue . Find a high quality litter that provides odor control , and that your cat likes . <h> Control Litter Box Odor : Fresh Step- with the power of FebrezeG <p> Our fur babies ( and myself ) prefer a clumping litter . In my opinion , scoopable litters are much better at odor control than clay litters , plus they make it easier to keep the litter box clean . Speaking of a quality scoopable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fresh Step- with the Power of FebrezeG ! And since our litter needs just increased , what better time to head to PetSmart and pick up a couple of boxes of the new litter . <p> The new Fresh Step with the power of Febreze offers several features I was excited to try ! First of all , unlike other scented litters that just mask odors , Fresh Step with the power of Febreze actually eliminates odors for 10 days , GUARANTEED ! In addition , ClumpLock- Technology locks in liquid and odor on contact . This not only helps control litter box odor , but it forms tight clumps that do n't  come apart , so scooping is so much easier ! Last , but not least , this new litter is a lower dust formula than their previous formulas , and this means less tracking , clearer air , and cleaner surfaces . <p> There are several different varieties of the new Fresh Step with the power of Febreze , including Lightweight Extreme Cat Litter , Multi-Cat Litter and Extreme Cat Litter . We decided to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box users . <p> Knowing that cats are sensitive to changes in their litter , I gradually added some of the new litter to their old , so that by the time the weekly box change came around , I was able to refill their boxes with the new Fresh Step with the power of Febreze only . Sure enough , there was much less dust than other litters ! <p> The cats have been using their new litter for a couples of weeks now , and not only do they seem to like it , I love it ! When scooping the litter , I no longer have to deal with clumps that break apart into tiny little pieces that slide right through the slots on the scoop ! And as far as the 10 day odor control guarantee , it really does work ! Oh and speaking of odor control , you know how some scented litters have way too much scent ? The new Fresh Step with the power of Febreze is just lightly scented , so the only time I really notice it is right after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a quality litter for your cats , I definitely recommend heading to your local PetSmart and giving the new Fresh Step with the power of Febreze a try !

There have been plenty of popular schemes that allow you to sell your excess solar power to the main grid too . This means you can enjoy an income for your solar panel investment . So what are you going to use all that lovely sunshine for ? <h> Power Your Vehicles <p> Yep , if you charge your electric car , your elektrische scooter , or even your RV battery during a sunny day , you 'll be fully powered for free !

Sadly , you 're still going to need to get some gas to move it off the drive , though . <h> Do Your Laundry <p> Is it really that daft to use a tumble dryer on a sunny day ? Think about all the times you 've collected your washing from the line to find birds had fouled it . And what on earth is that dreadful stench on the air ? Do n't forget pollution can cling to clothing fibers too . Your solar panels could power your tumble dryer as well as the washing machine . Maybe other appliances too ( assuming your circuits can handle the draw . ) A winter 's day may be sunny , but washing wo n't dry on the line for hours . <h> Vacuuming <p> OK , so the panels wo n't actually take care of your housework for you .

They were power-hungry and probably cost you a lot more on your electricity bill than you might think . Go for a rechargeable one and clean up for free . <h> Cook Dinner <p> Seriously , the panels are n't going to serve up a meal ! But , if you cook it in an electric oven , microwave or slow cooker , you wo n't incur any energy costs . Make food while the sun shines ! Electric hobs and electric ovens will draw an enormous amount of energy . This could exceed what you 're generating up on your roof , so check your monitor . Even if you 're not quite breaking even , you could still be reducing the cost of cooking quite substantially . <h> Heat The House <p> Space heaters are a firm favorite on a chilly night . Unfortunately , the sun does n't shine during those wee hours . Still , you can keep one or two rooms nice and toasty before you lose the light with those small portable heaters .

Read on to find out what they are and how best to avoid them . <h> Firefighting <p> The essence of this first tip is that home maintenance should be preemptive where possible . Everyone is organized enough to get a problem fixed once it has happened , especially if it is having a direct effect on our lives . But its always better to try and avoid those problems occurring in the first place . Do this by checking and maintaining the thing in your home every so often . If you do n't  do this , you will constantly be fighting metaphorical fires . These are a cause of stress and can cost a lot more money than just keeping on top of things . <h> Smoke Alarms <p> Now everyone knows the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , they have to be maintained properly to be reliable . However tempted you are to remove the batteries , do n't . This is because you will inevitably neglect to put them back in , and a fire alarm without a battery is about as much use as a chocolate teapot ! <p> Also , few people realize that they can benefit from installing a heat alarm in the kitchen . This helps to minimize false alarms while you are cooking but provides safety as it will sound if there is heat from a fire . <h> Damp <p> Damp is a pervasive problem that many homeowners have to deal with , especially if they live in a wet climate . You can prevent some forms of damp by maintaining your house guttering well . You can also get your windows properly sealed and by using a dehumidifier . <p> However , not all damp can be prevented as some are due to weather events or expose to a humid climate . In these cases , it is more helpful to employ the services of a damp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the damp and perform water damage restoration . They can even apply treatment to help minimize this in the future . <h> Kitchen appliances <p> Apart from defrosting the freezer and cleaning out the oven , we often do not give enough attention to maintenance of the items in our kitchen . Remember that they are high use items , in a hot and greasy atmosphere and so can be very vulnerable to breakdown . <p> Firstly makes sure that you pull your appliance out of their built in positions at least once a year . Clean and vacuum behind them and check for leaks . Remember that kitchen appliances often combine water and electricity so be careful while you are doing this . Pay particular attention to hoovering the fridge and freezer elements . They can get clogged with dust , which can affect how they run . <h> Bathroom <p> While keeping our bathrooms clean and shiny is often at the top of our lists . Other aspects of bathroom maintenance can be forgotten . Once a year makes sure you check your bathroom caulking to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace it . You can get sealant and a caulking gun from a hardware store for a reasonable price . Also , make sure that you check you shower curtain and bath mats for mold and replace if necessary . <h> Air conditioner <p> Another important part of home maintenance is making sure you get your air conditioner serviced at least once a year . While it might seem like an unnecessary expense while you are not using it , that is the best time to get it done . No one wants to wait for up to a week to use the air conditioner once the blistering heat arrives . So make sure you service it in early spring before the hot weather sets in . <h> Pull out furniture <p> I bet that you are pretty good at keeping your home clean and tidy . You probably dust the surfaces every week and vacuum daily . But what would it be like if I pulled out your furniture ? <p> Its important to do this part of home maintenance at least once or twice a year . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind obstacles around you home . We never really think of all that dust and dirt in the room that we just cant see . So to make sure you home is as clean and allergen free as possible . Pull out the bed and sofa and give them a good clean underneath ! 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

As soon as baby Adam came into the world , friends and family started oohing and ahhing and guessing which parent 's features got transferred to him . Regardless of the debate about Adams resemblance with either parent , the one thing everyone agreed on was how adorable he was . But ever since that first day at home , the one thing that has been worrying the new parents is how Adam does n't  sleep well .

Sometimes I think itll take magic to make my skin look the way I want it to . <p> My biggest skin concerns are dark circles under my eyes , a few enlarged pores and a slight redness around the sides on my nose . Magic Minerals new and improved formula claims it can help to correct all of this and more without the need for anything else . I was intrigued by this claim and could n't wait to see how well it really works . <p> About Magic Minerals <p> Created by make up expert Jerome Alexander , Magic Minerals is a mineral powder with foundation , correctors and concealer , all-in-one . Its hypoallergenic formula is fragrance , talc , and irritant free , making it ideal for those with sensitive skin .

With Magic Minerals , there is no worrying about which color matches your skin the best because one shade works for all skin tones . Plus , its ultra-fine formula glides on to give you perfect , even coverage without getting caught in wrinkles , lines and creases . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed without it looking heavy or caked on . <p> My Review of Magic Minerals <p> While I would n't go as far to claim that Magic Minerals magically transformed my skin into flawless , even-toned perfection , it did work pretty well . The dark circles under my eyes were much less noticeable , and the redness around my nose was n't as obvious . Since I am ( thankfully and finally ) blemish-free , I am not able to say how well it works as a concealer for blemishes or acne . I can , however , say it did a good job of covering my light freckles ! <p> The formula really is fragrance free , without any perfume or powdery-like scent , and it is very lightweight . I personally used the sponge to apply , then the brush to get rid of any excess . I was surprised with how silky smooth and lightweight it felt ! In fact , I could hardly even feel that I had any on . Plus , no matter how much I applied , it never appeared caked on or heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to apply several layers to get enough coverage to where the redness around my nose , and the dark circles under my eyes , were not as obvious . So , while this powder did not completely cover the redness or the circles under my eyes , it did do a fabulous job of helping to make them less noticeable . <p> As far as controlling shine , it worked quite well . It completely covered the shine in my T-zone without any dryness , and while it did not last a full 12 hours , I only had to reapply once or twice . Overall , I was quite happy with how well Magic Minerals matched my skin tone , and how it does n't  cake , or look or feel heavy . It did a pretty good job of making my complexion appear more even , although it did not perfect it . <p> Magic Minerals is available in a kit that also includes a professional stubby brush , a blending sponge and a tube of Extending Mascara , all for around $19.99 . <p> The Powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry in your bag , but has a large enough head to make application easy . It has very soft bristles , and so far is holding up well . <p> The Extending Mascara <p> I really like this mascara . With just one swipe I could tell a definite thickening and lengthening in the appearance of my lashes . I love that the bristles on the wand are spaced out enough to help separate the lashes so they do n't  clump together as you apply the mascara . I was also happy to find that it lasted throughout the day without flaking off , and though I wear contacts , it did not irritate my eyes in the least . <p> Where to Purchase Magic Minerals <p> You can purchase Magic Minerals both through the Magic Minerals website , and on Amazon.com . I did see the mineral powder and brush for only $15.99 on Amazon , but in my opinion , the kit is a much better deal . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Between holiday shopping , decorating the home , school programs , class parties , office parties and all the other seasonal activities , there 's hardly any time left to prepare to for your own holiday gathering ! And if you are anything like me , you want your holiday party to be something special . One that creates special memories for your children and everyone else you love . <p> Growing up we would celebrate many of the major Jewish holidays at several different relatives homes . One in particular is the source of some of my fondest holiday memories . While we werent really related to this family , we were so close that I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins . There were many years where wed gather to celebrate Hanukkah together . We 'd bundle up in our jackets , hurry to the car , and race to beat the sunset so we could all light the candles together . I can still remember the rush of warm air filled with delectable aromas that would greet us as they opened the door . The house would be decked out in twinkling blue lights , with silver and blue Star of David ornaments , colorful dreidels and other symbols of the holiday on display throughout the rooms . The table would be set with her best china and crystal . But most of all I remember the laughter , the joy and the happiness of being with those we love and of the season . <p> These memories are so special to me , that I want to recreate the same for my family . And since we celebrate both Hanukkah and Christmas , I get two chances to do so ! When my husband and I first got married , I did n't  have a lot of what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Lots to get what we lacked . I was able to stock up on decorations , table linens , glass ware , bake ware , and all the other items needed to set a gorgeous table and prepare a delicious meal . That 's also the year I realized that Big Lots carries a large variety of food items , too , including a full selection of baking ingredients such as flour , sugar , nuts and decorating candies . <p> This year since Hanukkah fell a few weeks ahead of Christmas , I went to Big Lots to grab a few more things to create a lovely Hanukkah table setting . While I still have much of what we bought a few years ago , I go there each year to get wrapping paper and ribbon , extra lights , and any other holiday items I may need . They always have such a great selection and the best deals ! Of course the styles and assortment will vary from store to store , but you 're sure to find something that you 'll love ! <p> I found some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both of which will look amazing with my china !

Once home , with the help of a little hot glue , I 'd have my own pair of decorative candles to go on either side of the vase ! <p> In addition to decorating , each Hanukkah I like to make some type of special Hanukkah cookie . This year I knew exactly what I wanted to bake : Hanukkah Pi+ata Cookies ! So while at Big Lots I made sure to grab some flour and sugar , and a bottle of blue and white snowflake decorating sprinkles . I also picked up a new set of cookie sheets , a glass mixing bowl , a set of cooling racks and this cute spatula that I just had to have ! Did n't  the cookies come out cute ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Holiday Pi+ata Cookies ? Although I made mine in the shape of Stars of David for Hanukkah , you can make them in any shape you 'd like . In fact , I plan on making them again for Christmas , but this time in the shape of Christmas tree ornaments ! And while they taste delicious , what really makes them special is the candy surprise inside . <p> Hanukkah Pinata Cookies <p> These pi+ata cookies may seem difficult to make , but they really are n't  ! Just a few things to keep in mind before you start . First of all , be sure to use a no spread sugar cookie dough recipe . You want the cookies to be as close in size as possible . For pi+ata cookies you will need three individual cookies , one for the top , one for the middle which will have a cut out center for the candy , and one for the top . Keep this in mind when you make your dough so you will have enough . <p> Heres What To Do : <p> Begin by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the printable recipe box below . Once the cookie dough is made , go ahead and roll it out . To make this easier and less messy I lay a piece of wax or parchment paper down , put a ball of dough on it , place another sheet on top of the dough , then press it out into a circle shape with my fingers . I then roll it out to about 1/4 ? thickness . Using parchment paper also prevents that extra flour from getting in the dough ! <p> As you finish rolling out each dough ball , place the entire thing , cookie dough and paper , on a cookie tray and pop it in the refrigerator for at least half an hour . By the time you are finished rolling out all of the dough , the first sheet you put in will be ready to be cut . Remember , you 'll need 3 cookies for each pi+ata cookie . <p> Now , using a small square cookie cutter or a knife , cut the centers out of 1/3 of the cookies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave at least 1/4 ? all the way around . Refrigerate the cookies for another 30 minutes this helps keep the dough from spreading too much . <p> Meanwhile , preheat the oven to 375- . Once the cookies are chilled , bake them one tray at a time for 11-14 minutes until the edges just begin to brown . Remove from the oven , and then allow the cookies to cool completely . <p> Set the cookies in the order you are going to assemble them on your baking sheet or cooling rack . One at a time , pipe a thin line of frosting along the outside edge of the cookies without the cutout . <p> Next press one of the cookies with the center cut out on top of the cookie you just frosted . <p> Now fill the opening with small candies like this <p> and then pipe a thin line of frosting around the outside edge . <p> Top it with another plain cookie , and allow them to sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes .

@@29514972 @3214972/ <p> With the warmer temperatures and sunny days of Spring and Summer , I 'd much rather spend my time outside than in the kitchen , especially in the kitchen working over a hot stove ! So when the warmer months come around , I tend to look for recipes that are not only quick and easy to make , but also light and refreshing . Since two of my favorite warm weather foods are yogurt and fresh fruit , I figured why not combine the two into a scrumptious summertime treat that not only tastes great , but takes just minutes to make ! And that 's how this amazing Angel Food Strawberry Yogurt Trifle came to be . <p> Now I know what you are thinking , another trifle recipe ? ! How boring . Well , I can assure you that once you take a bite of this creamy and light trifle filled with fresh strawberries , boring will be the furthest word from your mind ! My secret ? Instead of using plain old whipped cream in between the layers , I combine whipped cream and yogurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my favorite yogurts to use is Annie 's Homegrown Organic Whole Milk Yogurt . <p> I 've been a long time fan of Annie 's Homegrown . Not only do I love the taste of their products , but I love their ingredients , too . So when I learned that they were now making organic whole milk yogurt , I knew itd be the perfect yogurt to use in my recipe . Annies Homegrown Organic Whole Milk Organic Yogurts are made with organic milk and organic fruit , and they contain no added sugars , synthetic colors , preservatives , antibiotics , or synthetic hormones . Each 4 oz serving size contains just a mere 100 calories , and is also the perfect size to make my tasty trifle ! <h> Ready to see how to make this Angel Food Strawberry Yogurt Trifle ? <p> Although I used strawberries and strawberry yogurt , you could really use any fruit and yogurt flavor you prefer !

Place them in a bowl , and add a few sprinkles of sugar . Set to the side and let rest for about 10 to 15 minutes . <p> Meanwhile , cut a pre-made Angel Food Cake into small , 1 ? cubes until you have about 3 cups worth . <p> In another bowl , combine one container of Annies Homegrown Organic Whole Milk Strawberry Yogurt with 1/4 cup of Cool Whip . Gently fold it together . This is just to give the yogurt a more fluffy consistency . Be careful not to over-stir it or it will become too creamy . <p> Now all that 's left is to layer the ingredients in a bowl . Start with a layer of Angel Food cake , topped with a layer of diced strawberries , followed by a layer of the yogurt . Repeat one time , and top with a few slices of strawberry for decor . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176 
@@29514973 @3214973/ <h> The Original BedBand : Review Make Your Fitted Sheet Fit <p> This post contains affiliate links . Thanks for helping make this blog possible ! <p> I love sleeping in a comfortable bed with soft sheets and a cozy comforter , but if there is one thing I can not stand , it is when you put on a fitted sheet and it does n't  , well , fit . We have a memory foam mattress , and this particular one happens to be a bit thinner than most mattresses today . This causes a problem in that almost any fitted sheet we put on the bed winds up being loose with wrinkles that , to me , feel like mountains ( the Princess and the Pea Syndrome ) . <p> I must have my fitted sheets tight and firm . Each night we pull it taut hoping it will stay somewhat tight , and within minutes I can feel it slipping around a bit and the wrinkle-mountains forming . At this time we can not replace the mattress , nor am I going to go and buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up being too large anyway . Thankfully , I found the solution when I was recently given the opportunity to try a unique and innovative product to make your loose fitted sheet fit firmly , the Original BedBand . <h> What is the Original BedBand ? <p> Basically , the Original BedBand is a sturdy elastic band with clips on both ends that you attach to the corners of your fitted sheet which , in turn , effectively pulls in the slack causing the sheet to fit firm and flat . While there are other similar products out there , The Original BedBands use high quality elastic cord , durable nickel plated clamps , built-in fabric protectors and push button cord locks . <p> Each BedBand measures approximately 12 ? from end to end and will stretch to almost 18 ? . They will work on all types of mattresses including pillow tops , and will even work on standard and pillow top futons ! The clamps found on each end of the band are easy to open and close , and since they have plastic protectors over the gripper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Using the cord lock buttons , you can quickly adjust the bands to either add more tension by pushing the button and pulling the cord , or to release tension by pushing the button and releasing some cord . Either way , the cord locks make it easy to pull the sheet as tight as you prefer . <h> How the Original BedBands Work <p> Installation is not very hard once you get the hang of it . You start by placing the sheet on the bed as normal . Open the clamps on both ends of the bands and attach them to the sheet on all four corners . I found it works best by placing them 5 to 8 ? from the corners center . You adjust the amount of tension by pressing the cord lock button and pulling the cord towards you . Once you get it to the desired tension , release the cord lock button . Repeat this on all four corners until the sheet is fitted the way you like . <p> If you need to lift the mattress to get the sheet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to furniture , it is suggested to install the bands before placing the sheet on the bed . In this scenario you will want to spread the band clamps farther apart , and be sure to move the cord stop to the side of the sheet corner that you will be able to reach the easiest and adjust the tension . Once the BedBands are attached , place the sheet on the bed and pull the bands around the corner of the mattress this way you can tighten them from the side of the bed without having to lift the mattress . <p> To remove the BedBands just press the button on the cord lock while pulling the cord towards you to release . Then unhook the clamps and they are off . <h> Review of the Original BedBand <p> I was so excited that the minute they arrived , I went directly back to the bedroom to install . Since this was my first time , I have to admit it took me awhile not to get them on all four corners of the sheet , but to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound up going from corner to corner to corner , being completely unorganized about it . The second time I applied them , I had a better idea of exactly where to place them and how much tension to apply on each side . That time it was much easier and much quicker ! The Original BedBands did exactly as advertised and made the fitted sheet fit tightly , with no wrinkles . <p> Both my husband and I do a lot of tossing and turning throughout the night , so I was pleased to see that the next morning , the sheet was still firmly attached to the mattress . It was n't perfectly flat and firm , but it was not loose and full of wrinkles either . It fit just the way it was meant to . <p> The Original BedBand not only works great on sheets that are larger than the mattress , but they also work wonders on sheets that have lost their elasticity . You can even turn a flat sheet into your fitted sheet by using the bands to secure it ! Plus there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original use . Use them on the futon , on air mattresses , RV , trailer and camper beds . Use them to secure your grill cover , furniture covers , tablecloths , pet bedding , tarps for outdoor equipment , boat and car seat covers , wheelchairs , and so much more ! <p> The Original BedBands come four to a pack , and are available in two colors , black and white . You can purchase them directly through the BedBand website , as well as on Amazon.com . The price is a steal , too , especially considering the options : sleep uncomfortably with your fitted sheet pulling off the mattress each time you turn , buy new sheets or buy a new bed . Make your fitted sheet live up to its name with the Original BedBands . <h> You Are Also Going To Love : <p> Studies have shown that if you really like this post , you will also love the following articles . I have pulled them together for you right here ! <p> Great idea ! I always buy king sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra width on the flat sheet .

@@29514974 @3214974/ <p> We have all heard it before , the fact that using olive oil in cooking is a lot more healthy than many other oils . Olive oil is a natural juice , and is the only vegetable oil that can be consumed as it is freshly pressed from the fruit . The health benefits are numerous and due to both its high content of antioxidants and its high content of monounsaturated fatty acids . In fact , no other naturally produced oil has such a large amount of monounsaturated mainly oleic acid as olive oil .

@@29514978 @3214978/ <h> 6 Common Causes of Car Fires <p> If you have ever witnessed a car fire , you know it can be a scary site . Thick black smoke billows , orange flames spew , and fire trucks and police surround the site . Odds are you wo n't ever have to deal with a fire involving your own vehicle , especially if you take it in for regular check-ups and fix anything that needs repairing . However , it can be helpful to know the common causes for car fires for you and your passengers safety . Below are some of the top causes of car fires . <p> 1 ) Car Crashes : one of the most obvious causes of car fires are car crashes . Although most cars crumple zones are designed so the sheet metal absorbs the impact around dangerous areas such as the engine , fuel tank and battery , a hard enough hit can still possibly cause fluid leaks and spillage , as well as heat and smoke creating ideal conditions for a fire . <p> 2 ) Flaws in the Design : Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires . Notice I say contribute as a design flaw in a vehicle usually is n't going to cause a car fire on its own . They can , however , create conditions that are perfect for a fire , and sometimes even create conditions in which an eventual fire is inevitable . <p> 3 ) Poor Maintenance : While lack of maintenance is not going to directly cause your car to catch fire , in general , your car can be a lot more dangerous and can indirectly lead to a vicious fire . For example : frayed wiring can lead to a spark which can ignite flammable fluids such as oil or gasoline . Keeping up with repairs and performing regular maintenance can all help you avoid conditions that can lead to a vehicular fire . <p> 4 ) Electrical System Failure : another very common source of car fires , a cars electrical wiring runs throughout the entire car ; a stray , unnoticed frayed wire could wreak havoc . In addition , standard car batteries are also capable of causing plenty of trouble . A batterys charging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine bay , and the electrical current the battery provides ( along with faulty or loose wiring ) can then produce sparks which can quickly ignite leaked vapors or a fluid drip . Again , routine maintenance plays a big role in this . <p> 5 ) Overheating : Many people wonder is a cars engine overheating can cause the car to catch fire . While the engine overheating alone is unlikely to cause your car to burst into flame , what can happen is the engine overheating and making internal fluids rise to dangerous temperatures and begin to spill out of their designated areas . When this happens , the fluids drizzle and spurt onto the exhaust system and other super hot parts , where they can ignite and spread . <p> 6 ) Fuel Leaks : One of the most common causes of car fires are caused by a fuel leak . Any number of factors can cause a fuel leak , but at the same time , they can also arise on their own . Whatever causes it , a fuel system leak is really dangerous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7.2 degrees Celsius ) or above can quickly catch fire from a simple spark , and gasoline that reaches 495 degrees Fahrenheit ( 257.2 degrees Celsius ) will ignite by itself . This makes it easy to imagine how fuel dripping onto hot metal and plastic parts can cause a fire . If you ever smell gas in or around your car , find and fix the leak immediately ! Of course , as we have mentioned before , proper maintenance can go a long way in preventing a fuel system fire . <p> When it comes right down to it , the most important thing to remember is that once a vehicle is on fire , it really does n't  matter what caused it . The only thing that does matter is that you get out fast and get as far away from the car as possible . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

@@29514986 @3214986/ <h> Therapik Review : Alternative Relief for Insect Bites <p> Although Summer may be officially over , temperatures are still warm enough , especially down in the South for the occasional mosquito bite . In fact , late Summer and Early Fall are when bees and wasps are most active and therefore most likely to sting . Trying to enjoy the woods or clearing out the backyard or even hanging around at the tailgating party on a Saturday afternoon are prime opportunities for these insects to get a bite . While there are plenty of treatment options for insect bite relief running the gauntlet from creams to essential oils , many people are leaning to alternative treatment options , and I recently had the opportunity to review one such item , called Therapik . <p> Therapik is a revolutionary new treatment that uses heat to treat over 20,000 species of insect and sea creature bites and stings . It is based on a simple , proven scientific finding that most insect venom is sensitive to heat . Therapik uses patented technology to deliver heat in the specific temperature range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain caused by insect bites and stings . <p> It is a small , hand-held , lightweight portable device that uses one 9 volt battery to power a small 5 volt electric bulb . To put it simply , since the battery is 9 volts , the bulb is basically over-driven to produce an higher energy output resulting in heat . All you have to do is push and hold the button to activate the bulb , and lightly place the opening against the bite . <p> Do n't  worry about burns from the bulb because it is set back 2 mm inside the housing . That opening is covered by a mesh screen ( also recessed to avoid burning ) which helps to avoid pushing any stinger that may have been left behind further into the skin . This means treatment can be started to neutralize the pain before even removing the stinger . <p> Apply the heat to the sting for as long as it is bearable the average application time is around 30 seconds . Keep in mind , the heat is produced only as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heat is no longer produced . You can reapply Therapik as often as needed until relief is obtained . Therapik treatment will be most effective if it can be applied as soon as possible after the bite . <p> I recently had the chance to test Therapik when I was outside playing with some potted plants . I did n't  notice the line of fire ants streaming only a few inches away from my sandal-clad feet , and sure enough within maybe 3 minutes I felt the first sting . I quickly knocked the rest off , and reached for the Therapik which I had brought outside in my little garden tool tote . I will go ahead and mention here that I was extremely skeptical about Therapik working ; not so much on mosquito bites as I have used heat to treat those before , but from painful stings . Long story short , I laid the opening against the bite , pushed and held the button for as long as I could bear it , and to my surprise , after one more treatment , the pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against my skin , I felt a gradual warming that quickly became hot not burn your skin hot but hot . I was able to stand it for the thirty seconds , and probably could have gone one or two more , before I released the button . I waited about 10 seconds before applying it again . No red marks were left from the heat , only from the ant bite . But that bite did not hurt anymore , nor did it start itching later . <p> As twisted as this will sound , I am quite curious to see how it would work on a bee sting , but hopefully I , nor anyone else in my family , will never have to find out ! Remember , Therapik does not replace treatment for allergic reactions ; if you are allergic to any insect sting or bite , seek immediate medical attention . Therapik will NOT work on spiders , scorpions and snake bites . <p> Approved by the FDA , Therapik guarantees that it will relieve the pain and itching associated with insect stings and bites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating conditions . You can find Therapick directly through the Therapik website , as well as through Amazon.com and many other online sites . You can also find it at WalMart and other local retailers . Prices vary , but through the Therapik website you can get it for $12.95 . A great price for a natural , drug-free way to get relief from the itching and pain resulting from insect bites and more . <p> For more information , visit http : //www.therapik.com/ , and be sure to connect with them on Facebook and Twitter for even more information , promotions and more ! 130178 @qwx330178 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

@@29514994 @3214994/ <h> Ten A+ End of the Year Teacher Gift Ideas <h> Easy DIY Teacher Gift Ideas and a Lavender Bath Salts Recipe <p> Can you believe the school year is almost over ? Here in Birmingham , school gets out for summer in about 10 days . While you are busy getting everything from school finalized and preparing summer plans , have you taken a moment to consider what to do as a thank you gift for your childs teacher ? As a former teacher myself , the teacher gifts that always meant the most were the ones that cost the least amount of money . The ones that I could tell came from the heart . This included everything from simple homemade gifts the child either made themselves or helped with , to a sincere , heartfelt Thank You note written by the child . <p> If you feel you really want to buy something , consider a gift card to either a store that carries items you know the teacher enjoys eg : book store , craft store , etc. or to a store that provides necessities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , consider giving a gift of teaching supplies or items for the teachers classroom such as books for the class library . To you , the idea of giving notepads , pens , or books may not seem like a gift you 'd enjoy getting , but I can tell you from experience that for the newer teacher who has n't  has the time to build up her collection of supplies , this can be a wonderful gift ! Teachers wind up spending a lot of their own money buying supplies and materials , especially with budget cuts in education being so common these days . There are plenty of adorable ways to present these type gifts that will show you and your child actually put a lot of thought into it ! <p> In summary , do n't  spend a lot of time and money you may not have , give a gift that comes from the heart and really shows how much you appreciate what that teacher has done for your child . And be sure to remember any teacher aides , as well ! <p> Below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tag quotes , that are all low-cost and easy for your child and you to make ; gifts that Teacher is sure to love ! <p> 1 . How Fortunate Was I ! <p> This gift is a great idea if you know your childs teacher enjoys Chinese food . Grab a gift card from a Chinese restaurant along with several fortune cookies . Put the cookies and the gift card together in some cute packaging , and attach a tag that says : I Was So Very Fortunate to Have You as My Teacher ! <p> 2 . Such a Gas ! <p> Another cute gift card idea , this one is great for summer time , especially with the rising cost of gas . Purchase a gift card to a gas station and place it in a decorative holder . Maybe even purchase a toy car and tape it to that be creative ! Add a gift tag that reads : Hope Your Summer Is a Gas ! OR You Always Go The Extra Mile ! <p> 3 . A Sharp Idea ! <p> Going along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear container that a pack of colored Sharpie markers will fit into . Then tie it off with a ribbon , adding a tag that says : You Are A Sharpie ! <p> 4 . What It Mint To Me <p> This simple , yet fun gift is the perfect way to tell your teacher how much she meant to your child . <p> Take a pretty jar and fill it with three different types of mint candy . Arrange in layers , and add a pretty ribbon . Attach a gift tag with the following poem , or even just one of the individual lines . Find more detailed instructions here . <p> Thanks for your commit- " mint " to helping me learn . <p> Thank you for your encourag- " mint " to do my best . <p> Thank you for your involv- " mint " in my life , <p> Thank you for the invest- " mint " of your time . <p> Thanks for making each day an enjoy- " mint " , <p> and for creating an environ- " mint " for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> has really " mint " a lot to me . <p> 5 . Down to a Tea <p> If your childs teacher enjoys tea , this is a great gift for him or her ! Find a cute , reusable travel mug ( better yet , find one your child can decorate ) and fill it with packs of gourmet tea . Or put together a box filled with several different flavors .

@@29515000 @3215000/ <h> The Cookie Thing Picture Perfect Cookies Everytime <h> Review and Sugar Cookie Recipe <p> I love baking , and right around the holidays is when I bake the most . One of my favorite things to make is home-made sugar cookies using a recipe that was passed down through my family . Each year I strive to make them look as beautiful as those that you see in the pictures of a magazine , but I can never seem to do it . Instead , they come out lumpy , uneven in thickness , and the surfaces are never smooth . So when I was offered the opportunity to try a new , innovative baking tool called The Cookie Thing , I could n't wait to start baking ! <p> The Cookie Thing consists of a roller and several sets of smoothly sanded wooden boards that are cut to a specific thickness . When used together they help you make perfectly even , rolled out dough . Instead of you having to measure the thickness of the dough , the boards do it for you . Just choose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start rolling ; you will get perfectly rolled dough each and every time ! After walking through the instructions one time , I quickly got the hang of it , and now I can not even imagine rolling out dough without it ! <p> The first thing you want to do is make your cookie dough . I have included my recipe below if you 'd like to try it , and at the end of the post is a printer-friendly version . <p> InstructionsIn a large bowl , cream together the butter and sugar until smooth.Beat in eggs and vanilla extract.Next , stir in flour , baking powder and salt , mixing until completely blended.Cover and chill for at least one hour . <p> Using The Cookie ThingOnce you are ready , place a piece of waxed paper on a flat surface , and scoop out about 1 to 2 cups of the dough onto the paper . Then take another sheet of wax paper and place it on top of the ball of dough , and using your fingers , gently press the ball into a circle about 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select the two Cookie Thing measuring boards that corresponds with how thick you want your cookie dough . I chose to use the 1/4 ? thick boards since these cookies taste best big and puffy . Now , take the two Cookie Thing measuring boards and place them vertically on either side of the dough , leaving about 1 1/2 ? to 2 ? space between the edge of the dough and the board . You want to be close enough to where both ends of the roller can rest on each board , but not so close so that as you roll the dough it gets smushed into the boards . <p> Once the boards are positioned , place the roller with its ends resting on the boards directly in the middle of your dough , pressing down to be sure the roller sits flat on the boards . You are now ready to begin rolling . Placing one hand on each end of the roller , start rolling forward from the middle to the top of the dough , then bring it back . Continue until the dough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be amazed to see that the dough is perfectly even in thickness all over ! <p> Now , place the dough , still inside both pieces of wax paper , on a cookie sheet and put it back into the refrigerator for about an hour . Once the hour has passed , you are ready to cut out the desired shapes and bake your cookies . <p> Cutting and Baking Your Cookies <p> Be sure to lightly flour the surface on which you are going to place the dough . The easiest way to do this is to remove one of your dough packs from the fridge at a time and peel off the top piece of wax paper . Next , flip the dough over so it is on top of the floured surface , peel off the other piece of wax paper , and you are all ready to begin cutting out your shapes . here 's a helpful tip : be sure to flour your cookie cutters as well and they will come out of the dough much easier ! <p> To bake , preheat the oven to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 8 minutes or until edges begin to brown.Cool completely before decorating . <p> That 's it , easy as pie ! And speaking of pie , The Cookie Thing can be used for all types of baking including pies , tarts , muffins , breadbasically anything for which you need rolled dough ! <p> My Verdict <p> I absolutely love my Cookie Thing ! I am by no means a professional baker , but using the Cookie Thing makes it look as though I am . Once you get the hang of it , it is incredibly easy to use , and your cookies come out uniform in size and evenly baked . Plus , it cuts the rolling time in half ! Before The Cookie Thing , I would never have felt confident about trying to make a homemade pie , now I can not wait to get started ! <p> The Cookie Thing is available in two sizes : The Cookie Thing and the Little Cookie Thing . Both are made of solid maple wood , and are a beautiful blond color . They are perfectly smooth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight . The original-sized Cookie Thing comes with four different-sized sets of measuring boards and a roller .

All opinions are mine alone . #ShareFunshine #CollectiveBias <p> Summer officially begins in two days ! I do n't  know about you , but I 've already been out enjoying the longer days , sunshine and warmer weather ! To me , Summer is all about being outdoors , having fun with friends and family , and eating good food at BBQs and group gatherings ! Speaking of good food , just wait until you try this delicious cake that 's made with everybodys favorite candy-coated chocolates , M&amp;Ms- ! <p> Most of the time less is more , but when making this delectable M&amp;Ms- Beach Ball Cake , the opposite is true ! You are going to need a lot of M&amp;Ms- to cover the entire cake , and I found that the XXL bags are the perfect size . In fact , these 56 ounce bags are big enough to last you all summer long just think of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the perfect size for summer parties and gatherings , too ! <p> Ready to see how to make this M&amp;Ms- Beach Ball Cake ? <p> Before you get started , you are going to need 2 half sphere pans . I used the Wilton Sports Ball tin ( aff link ) , but regular stainless steel prep bowls work just as well . Just make sure the bowls are oven safe . Please note , the Wilton ball pans only make a 6 ? cake that 's small , but would be enough for a small party ( I 'm guessing you could get enough pieces for 10-12 kids ) because it is 2 six inch cakes put together . = <p> First you will need to prepare the molds by greasing and flouring . Once the pans are ready , begin making the cake , following the instructions on the box . Although you need to use both boxes , you will have some batter left over . I had enough to make a another small sheet cake ( another use for all those tasty M&amp;Ms- ) ! <p> Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3/4 of the way full ( the cakes need to rise to the rim and over a little bit ) . Place both pans in the oven on top of a cookie sheet and bake at 325- for anywhere from 35 to 50 minutes , or until a wooden skewer inserted in the middle of each mold comes out clean . Keep in mind these will take longer to bake than a regular sheet cake . <p> Once the cakes are finished , leave them in the molds until they have completely cooled . I chose to refrigerate mine overnight , although you do not have to . When the cakes are cool , and before you remove them from the tins , use a serrated knife to slice the tops off each half so that they are even with the rims of the molds . You should now have two perfect halves of a perfect ball . <p> Gently remove the cakes from the tins . Lay them both flat side down . Now take one of the halves , and cut off a little part of the dome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rest on . <p> This is a good time , if you have one , to place your cake board on a cake turntable ( I actually used a Lazy Susan ) . Spread a little bit of buttercream frosting on the cake board , take the half that you just trimmed and position it on top of the buttercream , trimmed side down . This will act as a glue to hold the cake in place . <p> Now spread a layer of buttercream on the top of the half you just placed on the cake board . Do n't  go crazy with it , but add enough so it will effectively hold the two halves together . I also chose to insert three wooden dowels to act as extra support , making sure they were cut to the needed length before inserting them . Now gently position the other half of the cake on top , and carefully press them together until a sphere is formed . <p> Once you have the sphere assembled , take some frosting and give the entire cake a thin crumb coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works to hold in most of the crumbs so you will have a nice , smooth surface to frost . After applying the thin crumb coat , place the cake in the refrigerator for about 45 minutes so the frosting will set . <p> When your crumb coat is nice and firm , add another layer of buttercream all around the cake , making sure it is thick enough to hold the candies . Now the fun partadding the M&amp;Ms- ! This is also the part that will take the longest and the most patience ! I used the M&amp;Ms- Original for the entire cake , and then used the M&amp;Ms- Peanut for the water around the cake . <p> Begin by making a small circle on the top of the ball with whatever color M&amp;Ms- you choose ( I actually used some white candies I had leftover from Valentines Day ) . Next , place six toothpicks , equal distance apart , around the outside of the circle . Then , using another toothpick , draw a gently curved line in the icing running from each toothpick down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark each section makes it much easier to get the proper design ) . Once the guide lines are drawn , remove the toothpicks . <p> Begin adding the colored M&amp;Ms- . At first I tried filling in one color at a time ( like in the above picture ) , but I soon realized that was not going to work . Instead , the best way to do it is to start at the top of the cake and add one row at a time , working your way around the circumference of the cake , switching colors as you go . So in other words , if you begin the row with red , when you get to the next section , switch to the next color , and so on all the way around the cake . Continue in that fashion until the entire cake is finished . <p> Once the cake is completely covered , the last step is to add the " water " around the cake . Use the blue M&amp;Ms- Peanut for this , and fill in any holes with the blue M&amp;Ms- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the cake board , so the M&amp;Ms will remain in place instead of rolling all around . <p> Once the water is finished , place the cake in the refrigerator for a few hours or even overnight so the frosting and candy will set . Then cut , serve and enjoy ! <p> So there you have it a fun and delicious M&amp;Ms- Beach Ball Cake that is perfect for get-togethers , birthday parties , bbqs and all sorts of summertime fun ! <p> You can find the XXL bags of M&amp;Ms- on the candy aisle at your local Sams Club . Choose from M&amp;Ms- Original , M&amp;Ms- Crispy , and M&amp;Ms- Peanut varieties , or grab all three !

As far as cutting , well that was interesting to say the least . LOL ! We started to cut into it just like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to work out too well . So we wound up slicing a bit off the top to locate the dowels , removed those and then separated the cake back into 2 half spheres . We then laid each half on a large plate , and cut it into slices from there . I 'm sure there is an easier way , but this being my first time to make a sphere cake the entire process was a learning experience .

I pray for my friends and I pray for my loved ones , and I even pray for those I do not know whose story I 've heard or read . So many times I 'll hear about the needs or special requests of family or friends . Or I 'll turn on the news to learn about another tragedy , or see the requests for prayers on social media . And everyday I send those prayers , and do my best to remember them again through out the week . <p> Yet even with the best of intentions my life gets busy , and there have been times that Ive been forgetful in remembering to offer those prayers again . But God tells us to pray continuously . That 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Berry , these bowls provide a beautiful reminder to take a few moments and offer those prayers . <h> The Story Behind PrayerBowls <p> A few years ago , Karen found herself extremely sick . She also found herself the recipient of the prayers of family , friends , and even strangers . One day , Angie , a lady whom she had never met , told her that she had been praying for her daily for a year . She would keep a prayer bowl on her table and each day she would ask the Lord 's blessing on the people who were in need at that time . Karen loved this idea so much she decided to create a distinctive prayer bowl for herself and a few others . And PrayerBowls were born . <p> How PrayerBowls Work <p> If you are not familiar with the concept behind a prayer bowl , its simply a way to remind yourself of those you need to lift up in prayer . Just place your prayer bowl where you sit daily , and jot down the names of those whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Place those papers in the bowl . Then , each day , either alone or with your family , go through the papers in the bowl and lift up those in need to the Lord . <p> PrayerBowls are made of porcelain and are available in two beautiful designs , Angie or Celeste . Each one comes with a bundle of prayer cards , and is packaged in a pretty and sturdy case that ties securely shut with a ribbon . <p> When I first saw the Celeste Bowl , I knew it would make the perfect Mothers Day gift for my sister . A relatively recent convert to Christianity , her faith is exceedingly strong and inspiring . The Celeste bowl features a beautiful , intricate gold cross right in the very center of the white porcelain plate . Gold scallops decorate the edges of the plate , and five hand-applied Swarovski crystals emphasize the plates elegance . In a graceful scrip around the delicate edges of the plate is the following verse from Romans 12:12 : Rejoicing in hope , patient in tribulation , continuing steadfast in prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! In fact , I like it so much , that I plan on ordering one for myself as well . <h> Free PrayerBowl App <p> In addition to having a physical prayer bowl to help remind you , there is also the added bonus of a virtual prayer bowl available through the PrayerBowls app . Since most of us are never too far from our cell phones , the PrayerBowls app makes our prayer lists easily accessible and available whenever and wherever we have a little time . The app can also be set up to send you prayer reminders so you do n't  have to worry about forgetting . Plus , the app also offers you the ability to create and join prayer groups . Its the perfect app to have in todays busy world . Currently , the app is only available for iPhone and iPad ; hopefully they will be working on an Android version soon . <p> Helping Others <p> While one of the most powerful effects of prayer is helping others , when you buy one of the PrayerBowls , you are also helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold , $1 is donated to Mary Lees House a center for child protection and advocacy . <p> PrayerBowls would make a beautiful gift for your friends , family and even yourself .

@@29515019 @3215019/ <h> 6 Simple Ways to Cut Down on Cat Litter Tracking #FreshStepFebreze <p> Love your cat , but hate cat litter all over the house ? Check out these 6 simple ways to cut down on cat litter tracking . <p> As a cat lover I have very few complaints . However , I do have a couple of pet peeves . One of the biggest of which and one of the most common complaints cat owners have is that no matter where you keep the litter box , cat litter still winds up getting tracked all over the house ! My cats make an olympic sport of digging and burying . And despite the fact that I sometimes wonder if they are looking for buried treasure or just trying to find a shortcut to China , I know they can not help the litter sticking to their paws . So instead of getting mad , I use some of the following simple ways to cut down on cat litter tracking . <h> 6 Simple Ways to Cut Down on Cat Litter Tracking <h> 1 . Choose the Best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market today , but which one is best depends on your cat . For cats that love to dig deep , then the best choice may be either a covered box or a high-sided box . However , some cats wont even consider using a covered box . And if you have an older arthritic cat or a small kitten , then a high sided box is not the best option . Extra large litter boxes can give your kitty plenty of room to dig , while litter boxes with built-in pads can help trap the litter as your cat exits . Top-entry litter boxes work well to eliminate the scatter problem as well as the tracking issue , as can simply putting a regular sized litter box inside a larger box , a kiddie pool or even an unused shower stall . Again , the key here is to find what works best for your cat . <h> 2 . Do n't  Overfill <p> For some reason , some people feel the need to fill the litter box almost to the rim . Why , I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaner longer . Nor is it necessary . If anything , it adds to the mess outside the box and costs a lot of money in wasted litter . Filling the box will two to three inches of cat litter is plenty . <h> 3 . Add a Tracking Mat <p> Placing a tracking mat in front of the litter box is another effective way to control scatter and tracking . The mat will help remove excess litter left on your cats paws , and it reduces the amount of litter that gets tracked through your house . While you can purchase rubber or plastic litter mats at most stores that sell pet products , you can save some money by using other items . I personally use an old yoga mat and it works great ! Not only is it comfy on our cats paws , the grippy nature of the mat helps any hitchhiking litter stay where it belongs . If you do n't  have an old yoga mat , there are plenty of other options . Welcome mats , bath mats ( with deep pile ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbery shelf liner with the holes in it will all work to capture much of that excess litter . Whichever you choose , make sure it is a large enough piece to surround the litter box on all sides . <h> 4 . Keep a Handheld Vacuum or Broom Nearby <p> Another of the simple ways to cut down on cat litter tracking is to keep on top of the scattered litter that is right around the box . This will help keep it from spreading . I have a small handheld vacuum and a broom and dustpan in a closet nearby . Make a point to either sweep or vacuum the excess litter several times a day and you will have much less of a problem . <h> 5 . Scoop Daily <p> Scooping out the litter box on a regular basis does a lot more than just keep it from stinking , it also helps prevent litter scatter . When the litter box is dirty , your cat is going to have to dig and scratch and search for a clean spot to go . Litter will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then your cat will do a lot less digging and scratching . And do n't  forget to clean and sanitize the litter box itself on a regular basis to get rid of odor-causing bacteria ! <h> 6 . Reconsider the Litter <p> It is a well-known fact that some cat litters track more than others . I personally have found that many of the lightweight litters tend to track much more than heavier ones . Of course , cats can be very picky about the type litter they use , so just make sure you find one your cat likes and stick with it . <p> My cats prefer Fresh Step- with the power of FebrezeG . Not only is it a bit heavier than some of the other scoopable litters Ive tried ( less tracking ! ) , it also does an amazing job of controlling odor . You see , unlike other odor control litters , Fresh Step with Febreze Freshness actually works to eliminate odors instead of just masking them . Plus , with ClumpLock- Technology , both liquid and odor get locked in on contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , Fresh Step with the power of Febreze works so well , it comes with a 10-day odor control guarantee ! Our litter box is practically #unsmellable ! <p> The next time you are at your local PetSmart , pick up some Fresh Step with the Power of Febreze and see how well it works for you ! Need to find a store near you ? Use the handy PetSmart store locator ! <p> Although there is no way to keep 100% of that litter in the box where it belongs , using any one or a combination of these simple ways to cut down on cat litter tracking will definitely help reduce the amount of litter scatter and tracking in your home .

@@29515035 @3215035/ <h> Bamboo Studio : Bamboo Dinnerware Set Stylish and Biodegradable ! 130178 @qwx330178 <p> One of the most popular materials now being used in eco-friendly- and green-living focused households is Bamboo . Today you can find everything from bed sheets to kitchen utensils made from this remarkable renewable resource . - There are several reasons why bamboo is such a popular eco-friendly material . First of all bamboo is the worlds fastest growing plant , growing up to a meter or more per day and reaching maturity within in just 4 to 5 years . - This means it is a very valuable sustainable resource- because unlike trees , bamboo grows fast enough to replace what is used . - Bamboo also requires no pesticides , no insecticides and no fertilizers. - It fights Global Warming by taking in 400% more greenhouse gases , and produces 35% more oxygen than standing trees making it an efficient replenisher of fresh air , and- it is biodegradable ! <p> I recently had the opportunity to review a- set of bamboo dinnerware made by- Bamboo Studio which I have fallen in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handcrafted from the sheaf of the emerging bamboo plant so that no part of the living plant is used . - The set is- completely- reusable , and is- also disposable and 100% biodegradable . Once disposed of the items will biodegrade completely within 4 to 6 months . - Each piece is also strong , durable and leak resistant . <p> The set comes with : <p> four 10 ? dinner plates , <p> four- 8 ? plates , <p> four- 5 ? plates , <p> four 7 ? bowls , <p> four 9 ? boats , and <p> four- flat wear sets each of which- includes a knife , fork and spoon . <p> Once I opened the packaging , - I was immediately struck with a pleasant woodsy scent , and the first thing I noticed about each piece was its- lovely , pale golden color with- slightly darker grains blended in . This coloring is completely natural , - so no harsh chemicals , bleaches or dyes have been used . - On the bottom side is a more pronounced , almost leopard-spotted pattern that complements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was how thin each piece was , but despite this , they are incredibly sturdy , almost like you would imagine a wooden plate to be . - The texture is very pleasant , with a silky smooth surface- that is cool to the touch , and all of the pieces- are also very light weight . <p> So far we have used this set several times and- they have held up extremely well ! - I am quite impressed with the fact that although they are thin , they can hold a fair amount of weight without bending or breaking like paper and styrofoam dinnerware- tends to do ! - Plus , liquids do n't  bleed through like I thought they would . The set looks great with practically every table setting , and although they are disposable , I plan on using them- again and again . To clean all I have to do is- hand wash them using hot , soapy water , then immediately dry them off with a soft cloth . I definitely- advise against soaking the plates or putting them in a dishwasher though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I love the way they look , their durability and the fact that they are eco-friendly . I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for an alternative to paper and styrofoam serveware , or looking to live a more green lifestyle . Be sure to visit the- Bamboo Studio website , where you can find their- entire line of kitchen products perfect for living green . In addition to plates , bowls and flat ware , they also offer serving pieces , utensils , trays , cute childrens dining sets and so much more !

I have everything from a bamboo dinnerware set to bamboo serving spoons and now I have a set of bamboo cutting boards ! <p> Made from premium bamboo , Just Bamboos cutting boards are FDA-approved , non-toxic and , of course , eco-friendly . Each set comes with not one , but three separate lightweight cutting boards ; each of which is a different size , making them practical and convenient ! The largest board measures 13 ? by 9.5 ? , the medium board measures 11 ? by 8.5 ? , and the smallest measures 8 ? by 6 ? . They are all around 3/8 ? thick . Now I not only have a cutting board for all different size jobs , but I also no longer have to stop in the middle of meal prep to wash the board when switching between cutting meats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boards <p> Bamboo cutting boards have several benefits aside from their beautiful appearance . For example , did you know that bamboo is naturally antimicrobial , making them very resistant to bacteria ? Plus , it is hard enough to prevent those deep , bacteria-breeding knife grooves that you get with other wood and plastic cutting boards , yet it is not so hard as to dull your knives . Bamboo is also not as porous as other wood so it will not swell or shrink , nor will it not warp , split or splinter , as long as you follow the simple care instructions . <p> Caring for Your Bamboo Cutting Boards <p> Speaking of care , it is recommended that you season your boards at least 3 times before use with either a coconut oil or food-safe mineral oil . After that , you just use warm water and a mild detergent to clean , making sure to dry the board completely once done . Never put your bamboo cutting boards in the dishwasher ! To extend the life of the board , simply repeat the seasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a dry appearance . <p> My Verdict of Just Bamboo Cutting Boards <p> I have been using my boards for a couple of weeks now , and so far I am quite pleased . They not only work great , but they look nice , too , with their warm , honey color . I have even used the largest one for serving foods several times . I even like the way they smell a fresh , woodsy scent . The only thing I wish was different , was that they had placed something on the back of the boards to keep them from sliding on the counter . However , a few of those small , round rubber dots stuck on the back side of the board easily and inexpensively solved that issue ! <p> If you are looking for an eco-friendly , beautiful cutting board , look no further than Be Fit , Live Fit and the Just Bamboo Cutting Board Set . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Luckily , living in Alabama , I have easy access to all kinds of fresh fruit and seafood directly from Florida ! So far this season I 've made these amazing Mini Blueberry Pies , as well as my familys favorite Caramel and Nut Dipped Strawberry treats ! And each recipe was made with Fresh From Florida fruit . <p> As I 've mentioned before , Fresh From Florida and the Florida Department of Agriculture are working together to promote locally grown Florida produce and fresh seafood . Fresh From Florida fruits , vegetables and seafood are harvested at the peak of the season , which means better tasting and more nutritious foods for your family to enjoy . From local farms to our kitchen tables , Fresh From Florida and the Florida Department of Agriculture guarantees fresh and delicious food that makes every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit I recently made a fantastic Blueberry Cobbler ! Loosely based on 2 different cobbler recipes one I found years ago in a magazine , and the other a friend shared its truly the best cobbler Ive ever had ! Its also the perfect dessert for a family cook-out or picnic . And the Fresh From Florida blueberries make this blueberry cobbler too delicious to pass up . <h> here 's How to Make Homemade Blueberry Cobbler <h> Preparation <p> Before you get started , place an oven rack in lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375-F . Lightly butter a round quiche or pie plate ( 10 inch ) or a 2 or 2.5 quart baking dish . I personally like to use my 2.5 quart Good Cook rectangle ceramic dish . <h> For The Blueberry Filling <p> Begin by placing the blueberries into the prepared baking dish . In a small bowl , combine the sugar and lemon zest . Tip : work the zest into the sugar with your fingers . This will release all of those yummy essential oils and give you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until thoroughly combined . Next , sprinkle this mixture evenly over the berries in the prepared baking dish and toss gently . Make sure the mixture is evenly distributed over the fruit . You do n't  want any mounding in any one place . Now set the mixture to the side . <h> For The Topping <p> In a medium bowl , combine the flour , sugar , baking powder and salt with a wisk until well combined . <p> Next , using a pastry blender , two knives , or a food processor , cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles a coarse meal with pea-sized pieces of butter . <p> Now , in a small bowl , whisk the vanilla into the lightly beaten egg using a fork . With the fork , slowly add the beaten egg and vanilla to flour mixture until moistened and a dough starts to form . <p> Continue tossing and blending gently with your fingertips until it is well combined . Take care not to overwork the dough ! You want the dough to look like crumbles see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too powdery , add a little more egg ( not a whole one though ) . <h> Assemble the Cobbler <p> Now sprinkle the crumble topping evenly over the blueberries . Follow this with a sprinkling of sugar and grated nutmeg for some extra YUM ! <h> Bake the Cobbler <p> Bake in the preheated oven until the topping is golden brown and the filling is cooked all the way through . This usually takes about 40 to 45 minutes . Tip : prevent over-browning of topping by cover with a sheet of aluminum foil after 25 minutes of baking . Once it is done baking , remove the foil and place it on a wire rack to cool . <p> Serve the blueberry cobbler warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or with fresh whipped cream ! And enjoy ! <p> Does n't  it look amazing ?

@@29515050 @3215050/ <h> Mini LED Motion Sensor Light A Little Light That 's Super Bright <p> About a year ago we moved into an older 1960s home we are renting from our brother-in-law before we decide whether or not to buy . While we are slowly remodeling , we have yet to get to the closets , and they need help ! Most of them are a pretty good size and nice and bright , but the one in our hallway is just way too dark . Hardly any light gets into it even with the hall light on . My solution ? A Mini LED Motion Sensor Light from Freetoo- . <p> Designed to illuminate closets , hallways , cabinets , and more , this motion-activated , little LED light is the perfect size for any small space that needs some extra light . Measuring just 2.75 inches tall , 1.49 inches wide , and 1.29 inches from front to back , it is lightweight and very easy to hang . It comes with everything you need to easily mount it including a plastic , clip-on harness and 3 different options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape , and magnetic tape . <p> Equipped with a " highly sensitive " sensor , this bright little light will turn on when it detects any movement , and will remain lit for 10 seconds before turning itself back off . And if you want to use it as a regular light that you switch on manually , there is a switch on the very top which gives you that option . This switch is actually a very handy feature as you can easily remove the light from its mounting bracket and carry it around with you to use as a flashlight . <p> The light is powered by 3 AAA batteries which you will need to buy , and according to the manufacturer , in motion sensing mode , the light can be used for close to 200 days with an average lighting of 10 times per day . Of course , this will also depend on the quality of battery you use . <p> Despite its small size , this motion activated light puts out a surprising amount of extra bright white light ! I can clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I love how it lights up the moment I open the door . Another handy feature I really like is that when in motion sensing mode , it only lights up when motion is detected and it is dark . If you place it in a bright room and walk past it , it will not come on . This is perfect for saving battery life ! <p> There are a variety of ways to use this handy little light around the house ! Use it in the hallway or in the bathroom as a nightlight , place it in the stairway , the basement , under the cabinets , in the pantry or even inside the freezer ! Anywhere you need some bright light , this mountable LED light does the job perfectly . <p> The Freetoo Mini Sensor Light can be purchased for just $8.95 on Amazon . You can also get a 3 pack for right around $20 . I plan on getting several more , as they are very handy and very well made !

@@29515051 @3215051/ <h> Omron Pain Relief Pro TENS Unit Review Drug-Free Pain Relief <p> Over ten years ago I was involved in a car accident that has left me with chronic neck and upper back pain . For several years afterwards I was constantly searching for something that would help alleviate the pain . I went through hours and hours of physical therapy , constantly applied hot and cold compresses , took hot baths , tried yoga and , unfortunately , went through the whole spiel of taking muscle relaxers and pain pills which resulted in addiction . Since taking pain pills for the rest of my life was not a viable or healthy option , I knew I had to find something that would work . Finally , a physical therapist suggested I try a TENS unit , and it turned out to be the most effective solution I have found ! And now , thanks to Omron , I have one I can use at home whenever I need ! <p> Omron Healthcare is a leader in manufacturing medical equipment for health monitoring and therapy for use in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure monitors , electronic fever thermometers , respiratory therapy devices , step counters , and several professional medical devices all made to help you be in your best health . Omron offers two different TENS units , the latest being the one I received , the Pain Relief Pro . <p> A TENS unit ( Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation ) is thought to work by disrupting the pain cycle by delivering a different , non-painful sensation to the skin around the pain site , therefore changing the way we feel pain from that area . It is also thought that depending on the frequency the unit delivers , the electrical stimulation can trigger the body to release those natural painkillers known as endorphins which help promote an overall feeling of well-being . Many people find that a TENS unit will give them temporary relief from stiff , achy or sore muscles and joint pain . Best yet , there are zero side effects , you do not need a prescription and TENS units are FDA cleared . <p> The Pain Relief Pro is reliable , affordable and very easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit , the electrode cords , 2 large-sized , self-adhesive pain relief pads , a handy pad holder , a clip so you can easily attach the unit to your belt or waistband , a convenient carrying pouch , 2 AAA batteries , an instruction manual , a quick start guide and pad placement guide . Close to the size of a smartphone , the Pain Relief Pro is so small and lightweight that you can take it wherever you need to go easily concealing it under your top or jacket . <p> The unit features an LED screen and comes with eight pre-set modes so you can customize it to your exact type of pain . These include five settings for pain in the Arm , Lower Back , Leg , Foot and Joints and three modes for relaxing your muscles : Tap , Knead and Rub . There are also a total of ten levels of intensity which allows you to further customize your therapy and provides the exact amount of relief you need . <p> Ever since I received the Pain Relief Pro , managing my pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonders , especially on those days where the pain is greater . It takes around 15 to 20 minutes of use for me to receive relief that lasts for a good while . I like that it has so many preset modes , and the fact that the pads are a larger size than others which to me is more effective . I also like the handy pad holder which keeps the pads from bending or getting messed up while not in use . Overall , I definitely recommend Omrons Pain Relief Pro . <p> If you are looking to find a way to achieve a higher quality of life while suffering from chronic pain without the use of addicting narcotics , talk to your doctor about how electrotherapy products may work for you ! 130178 @qwx330178 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

@@29515058 @3215058/ <h> The Stork OTC The Next Step in Our Trying to Conceive Journey <p> Although I am already in my 40s , my hope for being able to have a child has not faded . If anything , it has become stronger . When I married my husband in 2012 , we began right away trying to conceive . One and a half years later , we were at the doctor to see what was preventing us from getting pregnant . It was a bit of a shock to hear that there was nothing in particular going on . It was just a matter of time , patience and determination waiting for the stork to arrive . <p> For the next three years , we embarked on an emotional monthly roller coaster ride of tracking ovulation , taking my temperature , holding our breath and praying . Each month , my hopes would peak , only to come spiraling down , in a sharp stab of disappointment . I watched as friends and family married , and became pregnant seemingly without trying . Even my older sister had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to conceive is painful . Having to smile , congratulate and be happy for the new mothers was a twisted mess of soul-wrenching feelings . Each month it was becoming more and more apparent , that we would most likely need help from doctors . Unfortunately , there is no way we could afford fertility treatments , especially since most insurance companies do not cover them . That was when I realized there was something else we could try , the Stork OTC . <p> The Stork OTC is an innovative home conception device designed to increase your chances of getting pregnant without any shots , scans , procedures or prescriptions . It uses the concept of cervical insemination to help assist the sperm in getting closer to an egg , in hopes to fertilize it . <p> Although the practice of cervical cap insemination has been around since the 1950s , you usually have to have a prescription . Many are difficult and uncomfortable to use . As the first-ever home conception assistance device to receive FDA over-the-counter clearance , the Stork OTC makes the entire process more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works . <p> The Stork OTC consists of a " Conceptical " ( a cervical cap inside a condom-like sheath ) and a tampon-like applicator . Used at home during ovulation , the cervical cap is used to collect the semen , which is then placed directly outside the cervix using the applicator . The cervical cap can be left in place for up to six hours , therefore giving viable sperm an even better chance of reaching the egg . <p> By being so close to the cervix , the sperm are able to bypass common barriers , and be put exactly where they need to go . This can not only help with natural barriers such as sperm not moving beyond the cervical mucus layer , it can also be useful for couples experiencing male-factor infertility ( such as low sperm count or impaired motility ) . <h> My Stork OTC Experience <p> Keeping in mind that the Stork is best-used during a womans three most fertile days , I made sure to continue tracking my ovulation and maximized our chances by using it along with an ovulation-predictor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit I was quite nervous . Knowing that the Stork OTC is a single-use device , I wanted to make sure I did n't  mess up in any way . So before getting started , my husband and I once again watched the short , detailed instruction videos on the Stork OTC website , and re-read the instructions that came with the device . The videos are broken down into each individual step , so they are a huge help . <p> Without getting into graphic details that I am positive you do n't  want to know about , my husband and I did have success in using the Stork OTC . It was not painful or overly uncomfortable . My advice to you is to watch the videos and read the instructions before you use it . Be extra careful , take your time when prepping the applicator for use , and relax . And speaking of relaxing , by being able to use the Stork OTC in the privacy of our own home , I was able to keep some of the intimacy that comes with trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to being in a doctors office and involving others in the process . <p> We wont know for another week or so if we conceived , but I will be sure to update you . If you 'd like , say a prayer for us , and keep your fingers crossed . If you are also trying to conceive , let me know in the comments below , and I will do the same for you ! <p> While the Stork OTC may not be the answer for everyone , for those of us struggling with fertility issues , it gives us another option to try before moving on to more invasive and expensive procedures . You can find the Stork OTC at select Walgreens and CVS , as well as through different online stores . I found mine at Walgreens , in a glass display case located next to the ovulation kits on the family planning aisle . <p> To find a store near you , visit the Stork OTC website .

Below are a few steps that you can follow to ensure your home is safe , and that you get it back to living conditions as quickly as possible . <p> The first thing that you should do is ensure that everyone living in your home is safe .

If your home floods , be sure to know what your plan covers , and what it does n't  . This will help you to figure out what costs are going to be covered , and what you will need to pay from your pocket . You should also take pictures of everything that was damaged right away , so that you can have some proof for the insurance companies , should you need it . <p> Save Any Valuables You Can <p> If your home is safe to be in , then the next thing you should focus on is saving any valuables that you can .

If there is only a small amount of water , you can try vacuuming it with a wet-dry vacuum , or simply allowing the room to air dry over time . For the times when there is more than an inch or two of water covering the ground , you will need more drastic measures .

And if you can find special offers and other ways to save on gas " see number 7 in this list " you can save even more overall . <p> Just make sure you have a reliable and safe car that gets good gas mileage and has had its regular summer maintenance . And even if you do n't have a car , renting an economy car at $30-$50 a day could still be a cost-saver over the cost of flying . <h> 6 . Search for Discounts and Deals in Every Step of Your Vacation <p> My absolute favorite way to save on summer travel is by taking advantage on deals and discounts . Online deal sites can not only help you save money while planning your vacation , they can also be priceless when it comes to finding deals once you arrive at your destination . <p> You can find some amazing money-saving offers on everything from car rentals to hotel rooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Groupon , LivingSocial and Restaurant.com for online promotional codes and coupons on food , entertainment and more . And do n't  forget that Ebates.com offers cash back from dozens of travel merchants , with cash back on everything from hotels to cruises to complete vacation packages . <h> 7 . Use Gift Cards Instead of Credit Cards <p> Using gift cards instead of credit cards for summer travel has several benefits . First of all , there is no additional interest to pay when you stick with gift cards , or cash . Secondly , its safer . No need to worry about your cash being stolen while you are in the water . Third , it makes it easier to set a budget and stick with it . Plus , its easier to keep up with exactly what you are spending . And many gift cards never expire , so you can use them for all sorts of things including grocery shopping , dining out , date night , paying bills , or even as gifts for grads , Dads , birthdays , and anniversaries . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

This year the weather has been so nice that we decided to get a head start and celebrate Mothers Day with a huge BBQ . Knowing the day was supposed to be hot , and that there were quite a few of people invited , I stopped by our local Sams Club to pick up a 32 count case of Coca Cola . After all , nothing beats an ice-cold Coke on a hot day except sharing one with friends and family ! <p> I actually lucked out when I found 35 count cases right in back of the store alongside the other Coca-Cola products . And to make it even better , the Sam 's Club packs have names like Friend " , Adventurer , Superstar and Better Half emblazoned right on the cans and that gave me a great idea ! Since it was Mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and family there , I came up with a creative way to #ShareItForward with a Coke this summer by making these cute little tags telling everyone how delighted I am that they 're my friends ! <p> Now I want to Share It Forward with you by showing you how to make these adorable tags ! They are extremely easy to make , all you have to do is download and print the FREE printable tags , then attach them to the Coca Cola cans using metal rimmed gift tags and some colorful twine . From there you hand them out and watch the smiles appear ! <p> To make these adorable Im Soda-lighted You 're My Friend Coke cans you will need : your favorite flavor of Coca-Cola in 12 ounce cans , black and white string or twine , a pack of round metal rimmed tags , 2 ? round printable labels , black and white straws , and a pair of scissors . <p> First , download and print the free gift tags on the 2 ? round label paper . Attach each sticker label to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hole punch or the tip of the scissors to punch the hole through the sticker ( the tags already have a hole in them ) . <p> Next , take a length of twine and tie it around the rim of the can , knotting it securely . Make sure you cut a long enough piece where you can tie it around the can , then around the straw and add the tag ! <p> Now , take one of the straws and tie it to the can using the twine . <p> Then thread one of the tags onto the twine , finish it off with a bow , and you are done ! Easy peasy ! <p> Now that you see how fun it is to Share it Forward , head out to your local Sams Club and pick up a case for your upcoming event ! <p> Do n't miss the Sam 's Club Demo coming to all Sam 's Club locations on May 17th between 11AM to 4 PM .

They make great gifts for pretty much anyone on your list , and there are so many different types you are sure to find one for everyone . I recently had the opportunity to review two beautiful candles from one of my favorite shops Yankee Candle . <p> Yankee Candle is literally " Americas Best Loved Candle " . With hundreds of scents , colors and styles from which to choose , what is there not to like ? Pick from thousands of candles in different style jars , or choose votive candles , taper candles , pillar candles or tea lights . Yankee Candle also makes several flameless fragrance options such as Wax Melts , scented plug-ins , room sprays and scented beads . Plus they have a wonderful selection of beautiful candle holders , trays and other accessories . <p> One of my favorite Yankee Candle collections is the Pure Radiance line which has a distinctive design and some amazing fragrances . These candles have a contemporary design made to complement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vases , and are made with a smooth wax blend that gives the candles a decorative , luxurious look . They are available in several sizes and tons of scents . <p> The first one I chose was the Pure Radiance Medium Crackling LumiWick Vase Candle in the Stargaze scent . This is a beautiful lavender colored candle inside an elegant-looking , wavy glass jar . The Stargaze scent is a warm combination of cedar , amber and musk . This wick is what 's known as a LumiWick , but this one is made of natural wood and has an extra-wide flame that burns with a soft , radiant glow , and crackles just like a wood-burning fireplace . This candle will burn anywhere from 45 to 65 hours . <p> The second candle I choose was the Pure Radiance Medium Cotton Wick Vase Candle in Lavender Chiffon . Another beautiful , lavender colored candle , this one comes in a smooth glass jar vase and is very traditional looking . Lavender Chiffon has the silky-smooth , lush and relaxing scent of a bouquet of lavender . This candle also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton and burns with a wide flame that gives off a warm , steady glow . This candle will burn anywhere from 45 to 60 hours . <p> Both candles quickly fill your home with their wonderful scent , and look so pretty lit . They burn clean without any black smoke as long as you keep the wick trimmed within the recommended length . And when you are done burning the candle , they both come with a lid that fits firmly and looks pretty . <p> You can find each of these candles and many more at Yankee Candles both online and at a store near you . And with Christmas right around the corner , they are having some amazing sales where you can save big ! These candles would make great gifts for the office gift exchange , for the babysitter , teacher , coworker and even as a hostess gift . Plus , they are prefect for filling your home with warmth and seasonal scents ! So what are you waiting for ?

The place we relax together as a family and the place we find time for ourselves after the kids have gone to bed . They are the heart of our homes so they should as be as warm , cozy and inviting as they can possibly be . Here are our top nine super simple tricks to help your revamp your living room into the shape to ensure they are as wonderful and warm as your deserve . <p> Starting with your floors and the textiles and textures beneath your feet is a good place to get the ball rolling . Dingy and stained carpets are a big no-no when revamping living rooms and should be the first thing we deal with . With kids running in and out in dirty shoes and dogs lolling around on our carpets it 's no wonder they are one of the hardest things in our home to keep clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace your carpets with new ones , hire a professional carpet cleaning company to get rid of any unsightly stains and bring your carpets to their former glory . Alternatively you may want to consider being done with carpets once and for all . Many homeowners are unaware that some carpets are hiding beautiful hardwood floors , which can look incredibly attractive and modern and are , of course , much easier to maintain . So look under your carpets and see what you have to work with under there . <p> If you have wooden floors in your living room then adding warm rug textiles is very important in order to make the room feel cozy and warm . Consider either one oversized central rug or mixing and matching different colors and textures for an eclectic look . <p> Lighting <p> Good lighting is essential to make your living room look welcoming , cozy and relaxing . Strong and garish overhead lighting is not conducive to calm evenings so look at how you can create soothing and calming lighting with a selection of lamps . Little cabinet lamps mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful and zen-esque vibe for you to unwind in at the end of the day . <p> Lighting a few candles at the end of the day will also make your living room feel romantic and relaxed so speckling them around your living room ( out of the childrens reach , of course ) will instantly help you unravel after a long day at work or running around after the kids . If you struggle to relax in the evening , consider lighting lavender scented candles as lavender is known for aiding quality sleep . <p> Treat Your Living Room to a Lick of Paint <p> It 's difficult to know the areas of our living rooms that need a little TLC when we spend every day in them . But maybe that niggling feeling that your living room just does n't look is best is from something as simple as old or faded paint work . By re-painting your living room , you can instantly breathe new life into this space and give it that much needed face-lift . <p> If you prefer neutral colors then look at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best bring out the existing colors in this room . Maybe you feel a little bold and fancy painting one wall a bold or bright color ? Play around a little with different color palettes and contrasts before you commit to actually getting the paint brushes out . <p> Speaking of paint brushes , if you are considering revamping your paint work , then look at getting a paint spray machine , with a company like http : //www.toolnerds.com/ that will get the job done in under half time time . They are well worth the investment , and as they 're pretty good fun , it may even inspire you to turn your new found painting skills to other rooms in the house too . <p> Bring the Outdoors Indoor <p> Decorating your living room with fresh flowers and interesting plants is a top way to bring a fresh and natural feel into your living space . Fresh flowers promise that all important pop of color and will fill your living room with a beautiful floral fragrance . Plants that can offer a more long-term decorative element can really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calming , organic and attractive layer to the overall look of this room . <p> Books can sometimes get wrongly shoved into the clutter ' category when looking at organizing our homes . However , this could n't be further from the truth . When organised properly books can create interesting displays and can add personality and depth to a room . <p> Books put together in interesting styles , laid out at different angles and in different corners of a living room , or placed eclectically on bookshelves can be a really simple way to fill empty corners or neglected areas of your living room . Mixing books with interesting ornaments , candles and photos can instantly turn your living into a chic and interesting space . <p> Cushions &amp; Blankets <p> Cushions and blankets surely have to be the most important items when looking to make our living rooms cosy and welcoming . Cushions and blankets can be used to add color , vibrancy , texture and warmth to a room so do n't be afraid to play with many different types of colors , styles and textiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your sofa . <p> Rearrange Furniture <p> Again it comes back to that niggling feeling , that our livings could look better , but we just do n't know how , or where to start . Maybe you are completely satisfied with the furniture and decoration of your living room but there is just something missing . So why not play around a little with the layout of this room and see if you ca n't improve on the flow and feel of the space . <p> Moving your sofa so that it faces the fireplace or moving your desk so that you can look out over the garden may be just the little tweaks that your living room needs . <p> De-Clutter <p> This is one of those easier said than done ' issues as it 's so easy to get attached to the items that we have in our different living spaces . However transferring some items from the living room and placing elsewhere in the house may free up some space to do something slightly more interesting with . Likewise looking around the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the fire hearth or look perfect on your living room shelf can also make movements towards creating your ideal living room . <p> Get the Sewing Kit Out <p> Sometimes just knowing that we have made something by our own fair hand can make it very special and comforting . So why not look around your living room and see if there 's anything you can create yourself . Making your own cushion covers is super simple and is a really cheap and cheerful way to inject your individual style and personality into your living room . <p> On a slightly larger scale look at the fabric on your sofa and consider whether it could benefit from being upholstered . Reupholstering existing furniture is a fantastic way to revamp your living room on the cheap . So look at the different options available for upholstering your sofas and armchairs and consider what new colors you 'd like to inject into your living room . Then research local upholstery companies in your area that you can contact and talk through your ideas . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Regardless of the occasion , you want to make sure you buy a gift that hell love . This post will give you a few great ideas so you can really impress him ! Here are 8 great gifts your husband will love ! <p> 1 . A Concert Ticket <p> If your husband enjoys going to concerts , buy him a ticket so he can see a band he really likes . Better yet , buy him tickets to a band he has n't seen before to introduce him to something new . He 'll love it , especially if you go along and enjoy yourself with him . Even if you do n't end up liking the band , you will have made some great memories together . <p> 2 . A Spotify Subscription <p> Another perfect gift for music lovers ; a Spotify subscription . Buying CDs and even tracks on iTunes is becoming obsolete , as it 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music this way . If your husband loves listening to music but does n't want any hassle , this is the gift to give . <p> 3 . A Delicious Meal <p> You could cook your husband a delicious meal yourself , or take him out for one . Make him feel special men like that too from time to time ! <p> Most men are hedonists , so they 'll love an experience day . There are many experience days to choose from , so it depends on your husband 's personality . If he loves horror films , he might enjoy spending the day fighting off crowds of zombies . If he likes an adrenaline rush , maybe he 'd prefer to jump out of a plane . <p> 5 . A Watch <p> All men should have a reliable watch that they can wear with everything and look polished .

Choose a watch that suits his personality , style , and the clothes he wears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great gift , as it can do so much . It 's like buying multiple gifts in one ! It doubles up as a computer , e-reader , and you can even make music on them . All you need to do is download the appropriate apps and you can do pretty much anything . <p> 7 . A Book <p> If your husband is the intellectual type , treat him to a book you think he will enjoy . Do some research if you do n't know of one . Sites like Goodreads give great book recommendations . A book is a great gift for any occasion , whether it 's Valentine 's day or just because ! <p> 8 . A Wallet <p> All men should have a wallet that they can rely on . It 's usually better to invest in something like this , as cheap wallets can fall apart quickly .

Similar to the delicious Festa di Carrabba Seasonal Menu sampling we attended several weeks back , this time it was a sampling from their new menu featuring Carrabbas Italian Values over 15 incredible items for $15 or less ! <p> How Carrabbas Came to Be <p> In 1986 , two Sicilian boys from Texas with a love of cooking and eating founded Carrabbas Italian Grill . Unlike many other restaurants , at Carrabbas every meal is hand-made from scratch , using only the best fresh produce , herbs , seafood , and meats all delivered daily . You will not find any processed or pre-packaged foods in these kitchens , and one taste is all you will need to know this for a fact ! Whatever meal you order , whether its made with the rope grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy , it will be made with the best ! <p> Carrabbas Italian Values <p> Carrabbas has always had an extensive menu with many delicious dishes , and now they have revamped the menu , adding several brand new items as well as bringing back some old favorites . The new menu featuring Carrabbas Italian Values , includes over new 15 items for $15 or less ! From appetizers to entrees to deserts , you can have a wonderful housemade meal without breaking the bank ! Keep in mind , the photographs you are about to see show samplings , not the full size you will get when you order ! <p> Carrabbas New Menu Sampling <p> Once we sat down , our waiter took our drink order and set down the one thing that makes any Italian meal complete , a basket of warm bread with a side bowl of a special spice blend covered in Olive Oil . Be careful though ! This is so good , you have to watch that you do n't  fill up before your meal arrives ! <p> After we were served the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Carrabbas all-time favorite appetizers known as Arancini . From there we were served several other tasty entrees then finished with dessert . So sit back , and start thinking about which of these you want to try the next time you head out to eat at Carrabbas ! <p> Arancini bites of Italian Fennel Sausage , risotto , red bell peppers and romano cheese are mixed together , hand-breaded and cooked to golden , crispy perfection . Served with a bowl of warm , housemade marina with just a hint of spice . Together with the marinara , the taste is beyond incredible . <p> Mahi Wulfe let me begin by saying I do not like fish . After trying it once as a child , I never again felt the urge . However , when the Mahi Wulfe was placed in front of me , I decided to give it a try . I am so glad I did !

Its then topped with a port wine fig sauce that will make your mouth water just from its aroma ! <p> For dessert was something that can only be described as little bites of heaven ! <p> Mini Cannoli a classic Italian dessert , Carrabbas Mini Cannolis are a true treat ! A crisp , mini pastry shell is stuffed with a sweet ricotta and chocolate chip filling , then topped with a drizzle of chocolate syrup and a sprinkling of powdered sugar . Each bite literally melts in your mouth , leaving you wanting more ! <p> My Verdict <p> Carrabbas has done it again !

While the heat and humidity make things uncomfortable for us outside , getting into a car that has been parked in hot weather can feel like being roasted alive . Use the following tips and tricks to help keep your car cool and comfy during the sweltering southern summers . <h> Park in Covered Parking or a Shady Area <p> Whenever possible , park your car in a covered area , garage or even the shade shady . Even if you have to walk a bit further its well worth it in order to return to a cooler car . <p> Another trick is to attempt to park facing away from the sun so that most of the sunlight will go into the back of your car . <h> Interior Feel Like An Inferno ? <p> One tried and true method for keeping your cars interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one up every time you exit your car for more than just a few minutes . Keep it even cooler by putting a sunshade in your rear window as well . <p> Once in your car , cool down more quickly by driving with the windows rolled down and the air conditioner cranked up . This will quickly force out the hot air and allow the cool air to circulate . After a few minutes , you 'll be ready to roll up the windows . <h> Too Hot To Touch ? <p> Use a fabric or upholstered dash cover to help make your cars interior more comfortable . If you do n't  have to touch hit surfaces , you wo n't feel as overwhelmed by the heat . Plus , as an added bonus , a dash cover also help protect your dashboard and interior from sun damage including cracking and fading . <p> For those with vinyl or leather seats , toss blankets over them . Then , when you return to the car , you can simply toss them in the trunk . <p> Another idea is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crystal infused seat covers come in all sorts of shapes , sizes and colors , and are a much better option than sitting on hot and sticky seats . <h> Scorching Hot Steering Wheel ? <p> Speaking of too hot to touch , how many times have you gotten in your car and grabbed the steering wheel only to burn your hands ? Prevent this by turning the wheel 180 degrees before getting out of the car . That way , the side you touch is in the shade while you 're out and about . Another option would be to cover your steering wheel with a hand towel . <h> No AC ? <p> If your car does n't  have air conditioning or if it needs an extra boost , try a solar-powered car fan . These small fans can be mounted on an open window , working to expel hot air from the car while creating constant air circulation . Just keep in mind that if you have tinted windows , its likely they will interfere with the fans function . <h> Keep Windows Slightly Cracked <p> While you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can help a lot to leave them slightly cracked . Even a tiny crack can help ventilation and keep your car cooler . Just be sure to double check that you cant fit your arm through the crack . <h> Invest in a Remote Starter <p> Remote starters will allow you to start your car before you enter with the simple push of a button . Your AC will be blasting away , cooling your car down quickly before you jump in . Shop around online to get an idea of options that will fit your budget . <p> While these tips are great for keeping the interior of your car cool , remember that regular , seasonal maintenance can help lower the odds of mechanical trouble . Before you hit the road for your summer vacation , schedule an appointment with a certified mechanic at Akins Dodge Jeep Chrysler in Winder , Georgia . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

@@29515090 @3215090/ <h> Palmolive Soft Touch Dishwashing Liquid : Tough Only on Dirty Dishes <p> I have to be honest here and say that washing dishes is not exactly my favorite chore . For years now , well actually ever since I was a child and my chore was to do the dinner dishes , I have used the Palmolive brand of dishwashing liquid . I have grown to love how well and easily it cleans the dishes without drying out my hands , instead leaving them soft and moisturized . The few times I have tried another brand , my hands wind up dry and itchy , and I have to slather on the lotion . Recently , I had the opportunity to try a new Palmolive formula made specifically for hand care called Ultra Palmolive Soft Touch . <p> Most everyone is familiar with Palmolive , and those who use it know how well it cuts through grease and grime while leaving your hands soft and clean . Ultra Palmolive is just as tough on dirty dishes and gentle on hands , yet it is super-concentrated so you only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the original Ultra Palmolive line by adding ingredients that are known to keep skin soft and moisturized . This new formula , Ultra Palmolive Soft Touch , is available in three different formulas , Vitamin E , Coconut Butter and Aloe . <p> Ultra Palmolive Soft Touch with Vitamin E was designed to be soft on hands while leaving dishes squeaky clean . It has a pleasant , almost floral scent , and is perfect for people with normal skin that want their hands left smooth and soft . <p> Ultra Palmolive Soft Touch with Coconut Butter is even more mild or gentle on your hands and conditions them to leave a silky , smooth feel . It has a light tropical scent with a hint of coconut . <p> Ultra Palmolive Soft Touch with Aloe has been tested by a dermatologist and is perfect for those with sensitive and/or dry skin . Its scent is also light and pleasant with just a hint of aloe . <p> I have tried all three formulas and noticed quite a difference in how my hands felt after washing the dishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any hint of dryness . <p> As I mentioned above , with any Ultra Palmolive formula you only need to add a few drops to your sponge or sinkful of water to get plenty of thick , foamy bubbles with a pleasant scent . Like all Palmolive dishwashing liquid formulas , Soft Touch easily cuts through grease and baked-on grime , and leaves your dishes sparkling clean . I highly recommend Ultra Palmolive Soft Touch to anyone who wants extremely clean dishes and soft hands ! <p> Ultra Palmolive Soft Touch can be found at many stores both online and off . Many local groceries , drugstores and mass merchandisers carry it . Online , you can find it on sites such as Amazon.com , walmart.com , drugstore.com and many more . 130178 @qwx330178 <p> I hate washing dishes too ( thank god for dishwashers ! ! ) .

Oh , and that V-cut you see in the bottom of my board is completely optional . <p> Sisal rope is really the best option for scratching posts as it is tough and durable . However , it can be pretty rough on your hands , so if you have work gloves or gardening gloves , you may want to use them . I did n't  , and by the time I finished wrapping the board , my hands were covered in tiny scratches . Lesson learned . Ready to see how to make it ? <h> DIY Scratching Post for Traveling with Cats <h> Here 's What You Need : <p> a piece of wood mine measures 1/2 ? x 6 ? x 24 ? and was bought precut sisal rope I bought a 100 ft bundle and had a bit left overleather cord to make the loop for hanging , or use some of the leftover sisal rope wood glue gardening gloves ( optional ) <h> Heres What You Do : <p> Begin by drilling two small holes near the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the hanging cord . Sand and smooth any rough edges . <p> Start at one end of the board ( about 4 ? to 6 ? from the bottom or top ) and wrap the sisal around the board , gluing it in place as you go . I started with just one turn , glued it , and then waited for the glue to dry . Once the first one was dry , I did one more full coil , glued it , and waited for it to dry as well . Wood glue is VERY strong once it is dry , but it does take a bit of time to dry . So this project will go a bit slow , at least at first . <p> Once the first few coils are dry , check to make sure they are holding well . If they are , you can go ahead and wrap and glue the rest of the board all in one go without having to wait for each individual coil to dry . I was able to do mine this way and it went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to keep tension on the rope and press the new coils firmly against the old ones to keep them compacted as you glue . Once you are finished wrapping the board , let the glue to dry for about one hour . <p> To make the loop for hanging , cut a 12 or longer strand of leather cord or sisal rope and tie a knot at one end . How long you cut really depends on where you are planning to hang it . Thread the cord through the right hole from front to back , then back through the left hole to the front . Tie a knot at the other end of the cord to secure . And there you have it a cat scratcher that you can take with you wherever you go ! <h> Tips on Traveling With Cats <p> Speaking of traveling with cats , always make sure you bring plenty of toys , food , snacks and water .

Although I received free product and promotional consideration , all opinions are my own . <p> If you have ever had a Urinary Tract Infection ( UTI ) then you know that they are no fun . Not only are they annoying and uncomfortable , they can also be quite painful . While UTIs are quite common , affecting more than 7 million individuals a year , if you are a female , then unfortunately , you are more susceptible than a man . In fact , statistically speaking , one in three women will experience their first UTI by age 25 , and 50% of us will experience a UTI at some point in our lifetime ! Meanwhile , only about 12% of men will experience a UTI . Not very fair , is it ? ! <h> What Triggers a Urinary Tract Infection <p> UTIs in women can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sexual activity , certain birth control methods , pregnancy and complications in the urinary tract . That 's just to name a few . But did you know that the changes in our body due to perimenopause and menopause can also lead to UTIs as well ? <p> Yep , you read that right ! UTIs are actually very common among perimenopausal or menopausal women , with more than half ( 53% ) of women over 55 experiencing recurring UTIs ( at least three UTIs over 12 months ) . That is 3 more than I care to experience ! <h> Urinary Tract Infections and Menopause <p> Most women entering perimenopause or menopause are already aware of the physical changes to expect in their bodies . Hot flashes , night sweats , mood swings and missed periods are among the most obvious and common . However , many are surprised to also experience Urinary Tract Infections . Why are we more susceptible at this time in our lives ? Its because a decrease in our estrogen production leads to changes in the urinary tract that make it more vulnerable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drop in " good bacteria " levels allows " bad bacteria " to grow more easily resulting in a UTI . <h> Symptoms of a Urinary Tract Infection <p> By this time in a womans life , many have already experienced a UTI .

Activities such as deep breathing , yoga , going on a walk , talking it out they all help , but sometimes I am not where I can easily do this . Then I learned about Pinch Me . <p> Having seen first-hand the toll that stress and tension takes on the body and mind , clinical hypnotherapist Nancy Rothner set out to find a holistic , non-prescription , drug free stress relief supplement that could be used in a pinch . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned about the proven scientific methodology of color and scent as they relate to relaxation and created Pinch Me Therapy Dough a pliable , soothingly colored scented dough that one can knead , smash and squeeze as a way to help reduce the amount of stress they are feeling . <p> Scent science has shown that our minds recall scents and that those scents evoke emotions .

When you are finished , just drop it back in the container , twist the lid on securely and put it away until the next time . <p> With six amazing formulas to choose from , you 're sure to find one that 's just perfect for you . My personal favorite is Spa a soft , feminine scent with just a hint of relaxing lavender .

With sweltering summers in recent years , air conditioning has become almost a necessity , but it is n't necessary to tough it out by using only a fan in the name of saving energy and money on your electricity bills . Energy efficient air conditioners are making the prospect of cooling your home during the dog days of summer more affordable and feasible . While fans can provide a backup , there is no need to cut back on comfortable air conditioning . Below are several tips to keeping your home cool in the summer the frugal way ! <p> Do the MathBefore purchasing an air conditioner , it is n't enough to just calculate the cost of the unit itself or what it will add to your bills in a typical month , you also need to figure out the total annual cost of running your air conditioning . You will need to look at the units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect . Air conditioners with higher energy ratings have superior efficiency to other models , in some cases , well into the double digits . If you already have a unit that is over a decade old , it is also a good idea to replace it as newer models are dramatically more energy efficient . <p> You also need to think about what kind of air conditioner is best for your circumstances . While you may be wary of spending money for a central unit , if you have a home larger than two rooms , it is worthwhile to invest in a central air conditioning system that will cool the entire home . <p> Proper Maintenance Saves EnergyKeeping your unit in excellent repair at all times will help keep it working efficiently and save you money . If you do notice a problem with your air conditioner , make sure you contact a professional that provides ac repair services as soon as possible . Letting problems continue compromises efficiency and is a huge money drain . Also , paying attention to details like keeping the air conditioner filters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb is to check your filters on a monthly bases to make sure they are free of lint and debris so they work properly . <p> Another way to save money on cooling is by preventing the cold air your unit generates from flying out the window . Keep your windows closed and draw the shutters during the day in order to prevent cool air from escaping . If you enjoy sunlight , sit on the patio or go outside . Letting sunlight enter the house creates hot spots that can eat up cool air and force your air conditioner to work harder . In addition , make sure your thermostat and air conditioner controls are safe from small hands . Children consider remote controls as toys , but it is no laughing matter if they are making your air conditioner work overtime . <p> It 's Cool to Save <p> Supplementing your air conditioning with the use of an electric fan is another way to help you use energy more efficiently . In addition , using a programmable thermostat to control the temperature of your home when you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs .

There is a small upfront investment but I would also recommend using a portable air conditioner to just cool the room(s) you use most .

Ever since I was a child I have loved blueberries whether I ate them by themselves or in blueberry pancakes , muffins , smoothies , or pie ! While I almost always prefer fresh blueberries , I recently had the opportunity to try frozen blueberries by Wymans of Maine and was quite surprised at how fresh and delicious they tasted ! <p> Wymans of Maine has been growing and marketing wild blueberries and other fruits since 1874 . With over a hundred years of experience , they have perfected the science of freezing fresh fruit , especially blueberries . Their premium fruit is fresh frozen right at harvest when the flavor and healthy goodness are at their peak . Not only is Wymans frozen fruit all natural , with no sugar added , but it is just as nutritious as fresh fruit ! <p> As I mentioned above , I was very impressed with the delicious , fresh taste of Wymans blueberries .

And since the bag is resealable , I know they will stay fresh longer . Better yet , I love the fact that I can get the fruits I love year round regardless of the season . <p> Wymans fresh frozen fruits can be found at your local grocery . In addition to blueberries they also offer strawberries , red raspberries , mango chunks , as well as mixed blends such as Triple Berry Blend , Mixed Berries , and Blueberries , Strawberries and Mango Chunks . <p> Below is a recipe for homemade blueberry muffins that I originally found on Allrecipes by a lady named Colleen ( To Die For Blueberry Muffins ) .

Every new parent- knows all about latching and the importance of helping their baby develop this instinct not only for breast and bottle feeding , but also for- teaching a baby to take food off a spoon . Every parent- also knows how frustrating and messy feedings can be once you have started the transition from liquids to more solid nutrients. - However , there is something out there that can actually make this transition much easier , something that was- designed- by parents for parents , and that something is called Spuni . <p> Spuni is a new and innovative- baby spoon that was specifically designed to promote the latching instinct and make feedings easier . - If you have ever stopped and really looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are nothing more than tiny replicas of adult spoons . Although they are smaller in size , - their shape is still much like their larger version which is actually too wide and too deep for a babys mouth especially for a baby beginning the transition from liquids to solids . - As a result the baby is rarely able to get to the food at the back of these spoons and that is where most of the- mess comes from . The Spuni was designed with a unique tulip-shaped profile that not only fits a babys mouth , but actually- triggers the latching instinct causing the- baby to latch onto , and suck and swallow the food from the spoon. - Baby is able to get a more manageable portion- from the spoon , and - in turn , this creates less waste and makes feeding sessions less frustrating for both parent and baby . <p> Not only was Spuni developed with the most beneficial shape , it was also made with- only the best and safest materials available . The designers ( parents just like you and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or silicone in order to avoid any possible - issues with allergies . Instead , based on input gathered from professionals in several fields , they decided to make the Spuni- using medical grade TPE , the same stuff used in pacifiers and baby bottle nipples .

For a just bit more , and for a more natural feeling , Spuni is also available in a- custom-made , hand finished Dark Maple wood . - Did I mention you can also get a Spuni made from sterling Silver ?

We played with them for well over an hour , building all sorts of buildings , make believe animals , dinosaurs and more !

Unlike other similar products , the ClickBlock are quite sturdy , not flimsy and bendable .

There were a few pieces that were a bit more difficult to get to balance , or fit together , the way we wanted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially like how there are so many different 3D and 2D geometric shapes , as opposed to just a few common ones such as squares , rectangles and triangles . Having a variety like this really increases the type of things kids can build . <p> All ClickBlock components are made from PA-free polycarbonate plastic that will not crack or break , and they are 3cm or larger , making it pretty hard for a young child to swallow . However , most of the sets are recommended for 6 years and up as some parts such as the bonus graphic cards that came with ours are small enough to swallow . <p> Although there are some similar toys out there , ClickBlock far surpasses them in that they have a much stronger design and can support a much larger vertical load . You can tell as soon as you touch them that they are quite sturdy and durable .

A little dose of real estate wisdom can be useful before you can enjoy an exciting housewarming party . Becoming a homeowner is a great journey , so here are the top 5 pieces of advice that experienced home-buyers would give to their younger selves . <h> #1 . Start With An Open Mind <p> First of all , start with an open mind . This might sound a little odd , but most inexperienced home-buyers reject locations without having visited the town . Make your research in situ and do n't follow the advice of people who know the area . If you are to live there , you need to build your opinion .

Get The Right Mortgage For Your Needs <p> It is most likely that your mortgage will be your first big loan .

First mortgages are especially important because they are often based on a low credit score or none at all , which is pretty normal if you have n't been working for a very long time . So the best thing to do is to use a mortgage calculator to visualize what it means to be repaying a loan month after month . You may not want to take a too long-term engagement , but you need to make sure at the same time that you will be able to repay with ease and without creating any debt . <h> #3 . Always Read The Little Lines Of Your House Cover <p> As this is your first house , it will also be your first building insurance . House insurances are particularly important to protect your belongings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burglary , fire , natural disaster , etc . If you have never owned a house before , it may be difficult to think of everything that could happen .

Do n't hesitate to read carefully your agreement before signing in . It 's worth asking a solicitor to read it for you too . <h> #4 . Take Your Time To Visit <p> Take your time when you are choosing a house . Whether you are after a big home , , or a cozy little apartment , you should always make sure to visit the place a handful of times . Additionally , it 's helpful to ask a specialist to run a house inspection for you , so that you can be aware of any issue that you could have missed . <h> #5 .

Take a look at the following ways to protect your home from harm . <h> Package Thieves <p> With the ease of delivery services such as Amazon , Wayfair , Peapod , and most all other stores , plenty of homeowners rely on goods being delivered right to their door .

The majority of which happen to children . Unfortunately , with stats like that , you would think a rear view camera would be a standard piece of equipment on every car , but its not . At least not yet . On March 31st , 2014 , the U.S. Department of Transportation finalized standards that require all vehicles under 10,000 pounds to have rear view cameras by May 2018 . <h> Why Get a Rear View Camera ? <p> Rear view cameras provide drivers with both added convenience and improved safety . From a convenience standpoint , these cameras make both reversing and getting out of a tight spot much easier . For larger vehicles this is especially useful since it can be harder to see behind you when backing up . From a safety standpoint , the benefit is priceless , protecting both children and pets from harm in the all too common back-over accident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it definitely helps by giving drivers another eye behind their vehicles . <h> How to Choose a Rear View Camera <p> If your car does not already have a rear view camera , consider installing one .

It seems like it was just a short while back that Daniel first came to live with us . At the time , he was just six years old . Now , he is 13 and already going to middle school ! The tween years came on so quickly ! While the tween and teen years can be some of the most exciting years of a childs life , they can also be some of the hardest . Our children are walking the line between childhood and the teenage years . Being pulled in two directions at once . Caught between the urge to enjoy childhood just a little while longer , while longing to finally be grown up . Then there is the increasing difficulty of schoolwork , and the pressure to fit in with their peers . As parents we need to show our support now more than ever . Which is just one of several reasons why I wrote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he is . <h> A Letter to My Tween <p> Dear Daniel , <p> Wow . Thirteen years old and in seventh grade already ! Where has the time gone ? When you first came to live us you were an adorable six year old boy . You always hear people say how fast children grow , but even as a teacher I never realized how true that was until you came in our lives . And though you are not my biological son , I love you as if you are . <p> For the last seven years I have gotten to watch as you grew from an inquisitive child into the young adult you are quickly becoming . I am amazed at how much you have grown , emotionally , intelligently and physically . And I can not wait to see what you will become . Today I wanted to write you a letter to let you know how truly amazing I think you are , and why I am so proud to call you my son . <p> 1 . You Are Kind and Courteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I remember the first time we went shopping as a family . It was the day after we got back in town from picking you up in Virginia . We were walking from our car to go inside the store , following an elderly lady . Right when we got to the sidewalk , you darted ahead of us , went running around the lady to get to the door . At first I thought you were just being a kid , running ahead of your parents to get inside first . Instead you stopped at the door , opened it , and then stood aside to hold it open for the lady . A six-year-old child holding the door for a lady ! And that was just one time of many that Ive seen your inherent kindness and respect . <p> 2 . You Love to Make People Smile and Laugh <p> You have got to be one of the funniest kids I have ever known . The jokes you make , the quirky things you say and the silly things you do . And to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smile make it even better ! <p> 3 . You Are Brave and Courageous <p> When you see something you want to do , you do it , even if it is out of your comfort zone . Jumping off the high dive . Driving a dirt bike for the very first time . Break dancing and singing in front of a hundred strangers at a karaoke club at the beach . <p> 4 . You Are Confident in Yourself and Supportive of Others <p> I cant even begin to count the number of times you have faced a new challenge without backing down . Whether its studying for a hard test or trying out for a team sport , you never doubt yourself and the word fail never seems to cross your mind . You believe in yourself and you do n't  let fear rule you . I 've also seen you support and encourage your friends and your family in all that they do . <p> 5 . Because You Are Who You Are <p> One of the biggest challenges tweens and teens face is believing in themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard age for both boys and girls . That 's why I always want you to remember that you , Daniel , are one of a kind . You are handsome , funny , smart , talented and kind . You are amazing . Never change who you are . <p> Your Dad and I Love You , <p> Alaina <h> More Changes Than These <p> So much growth occurs during the tween years especially when it comes to appetites ! The bigger Daniel grows , the bigger his appetite gets ! Last week while shopping for groceries I came across the new Yoplait Go Big . Designed with tweens and teens in mind , these bigger-sized pouches hold just the right amount of yogurt for Daniels growing appetite . Even better , they contain real fruit with no artificial colors , or high fructose corn syrup . They are also gluten-free , and taste great ! <p> Yoplait Go Big come in 8 count variety packs and are currently available in two different flavor combinations Strawberry/MixedBerry and Peach Mango/Cherry .

However , with over 7,000 camps , how do you know which one to pick ? When it comes to choosing the right summer camp , using the following tips can help ensure you and your child pick the summer camp theyll love ! <h> Do n't Want To ! <p> The first thing to note is that not all children enjoy summer camps , especially those who are super close their families , are n't fond of sports , and hate traveling long distances . One of the best ways to see if your child would enjoy a residential camp is by signing them up for a day one , or activity led local program . This way , not only to they have the chance to make new friends , play with different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come 4 pm they can go home again ! <h> Do Your Homework <p> Finding the right camp is n't a case of driving your child to any program that looks vaguely nature based , paying the fees then dropping them off and waving goodbye without a second thought . Every camp set-up is different , and it 's important you speak to the leaders , counselors and even the other kids to get a feel for what they 're about and how they communicate with families of prospective campers . For instance , you would n't feel comfortable leaving your child with someone who could n't be bothered to return a simple phone call or email , would you ? <h> Have A Checklist <p> When looking around observe what the atmosphere 's like because if kids look like they 're on their best behavior somethings off . It 's great to be polite , friendly and helpful but you still want to see some life , spark , and spirit in them even if that means staff dealing with impromptu water fights , kids whining about snacks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere . Remember , experience counts so camps that have been family run for decades may be better for first-time guests . <p> What are the camp 's core values and beliefs ? A christian retreat center summer camp will be very different to say one that embraces meditation , personal journaling , and Tibetan drum circles . Do they focus on the arts ? Sports ? Nature-based activities ? A good camp will feel like a community , so take some time out to chat with the kids and if their complaints go beyond early bedtimes it 's not the right place . Staff should be friendly and open about their qualifications , references and what makes them a good camp staffer . Lastly , how often are campers allowed to call or email home ? What happens if your child falls sick , or worse suffers an injury ? <h> Let Your Child Choose <p> Find one that matches what your son or daughter 's interested in for example , kids who love acting will fit right in at theater camp .

However , that 's not true at all . In fact . It 's far more important to get a good night of sleep for your health . By getting a full night of rest and relaxation your body can heal from the stresses of the stay . You might also need to think about how stressed you are through the day because sleep can help with that too . You might be dealing with several issues when you go to sleep . Get a good night of rest and when you wake up you might have the answers to all your problems and issues . The question is then how do you ensure you get a good nights sleep as a full-time parent . Well do n't worry I 've got some great ideas . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's filling before you go to sleep . Weirdly a lot of people are kept from getting a good night of sleep simply because once they hit the hay they get hungry . Their stomach rumbles all night until they give in and go get a snack . That snack is often filled with sugar , and it wakes them up . Thus the cycle continues . By getting a warm drink you 'll soothe your body and give it the food it needs to get through the night . <h> Exercise <p> You can think about exercising for roughly thirty minutes before bed . This will ensure that you are tired when you hit the pillow and hopefully that you can get to sleep straight away . Although , it 's not guaranteed and it can have the opposite effect . By exercising you can give yourself a fresh shot of energy that keeps you awake for longer . That 's why you need to have a period of rest after exercising . Leave about an hour between exercise and sleep . It 's during this time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pillow Talk <p> You may want to think about getting a new pillow for your bed . As they often say , the simplest answer tends to be the best . In this case , that means making sure that you are as comfortable as possible in bed . The best contour pillow will give your back , neck and head the exact level of support that you need . It will ensure that you are n't kept up because you ca n't find the right position . <h> Writing It Down <p> You might want to keep a diary before bed . Here , you can write down any issues that you had through the day . This will stop them running on through your mind , keeping you awake all through the night . It 's another common reason why some people do n't get the level of sleep they need . By writing problems down , you are subconsciously telling yourself that you have dealt with the problem . Therefore , you do n't need to spend all night thinking about it . <p> I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of sleep that you definitely deserve . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Sometimes , we can all be guilty of letting things so somewhat over the winter and new year period . Coming around after that can come as quite a shock . That 's why the Spring is a traditional time for self-renewal . The truth is , anyone could benefit from making a few changes to their lifestyle . No matter how active and healthy a life you lead , there is always something more you could be doing . And while it does n't pay to over-stress about it , it 's worth thinking about every once in awhile . There is always plenty of opportunity for enacting positive change in your life . However , the problem arises when we do n't know exactly what to change . It might be that you feel that a change of some kind is necessary , but you do n't know what . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Help is at hand . In this post , we are going to look at some of the simple changes you can make to give your health a spring boost . You will probably discover that you can regain control of your health with these simple changes , and that living healthily can be easier than you think . <p> If you are like most people , your diet can be a point of real contention . A lot of us have some deeply rooted issues which dictate to a large degree our behaviour around food . In the worst case scenario , the result of this can be a poor diet with no seemingly obvious way out of the mess . However , the truth is that there is always something which can be done . Changing the way you approach your diet might be the most important change you enact this year . So what are some of the principles you should be trying to integrate ? <p> As we all know , a proper diet is one which is varied . By that , we mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food types . But you do n't necessarily just want to eat an equal amount of , say , eggs and meat , do you ? If you want to give your health a bit of a boost this year , there are certain dietary factors you should be considering . For example , make sure that you start packing your meals full of fresh fruit and vegetables . It ca n't be overstated just how important these are for your health . Fresh fruit and veg are packed full of a huge range of different nutrients and minerals . They also decrease your likelihood of contracting cardiovascular disease , heart disease and diabetes . <p> The easiest way to get fruit and veg into your diet is to find a way to incorporate it into every meal . With a little imagination , this can be achieved quite easily . <p> Another large part of looking after your diet is watching the kinds of fat which you eat . If you constantly allow yourself to consume saturated fats , then you will soon notice the difference on the scales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those nasty diseases will rocket skyward again . So it is important that you watch not just how much fat enter your body , but what kinds of fat . Try and get as much unsaturated and monounsaturated as you can . This way , your body has a chance to process all the bad stuff and it wo n't be left hanging ! <p> With a little focus , eating right can be easy and simple and even a joy . For more on the subject , visit www.eatright.org/ <p> We all know how important it is to get a decent amount of exercise in but how many of us actually achieve that goal ? In our chaotic modern lives , it can be difficult to find the time or the energy to get in as much exercise as we would like . But the truth is , it is much easier than you think to exercise the right amount . Finding the time is only a matter of changing a few things around . We need to take back control of our lives . If your daily routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exercise , then it is time to change your routine . Even if you work a seventy hour week , there are things you can do to make that time . The truth is , a change of this scale has to come from an internal change . Without that personal transformation , you will lack the impetus to get up and do what it is that needs doing . That 's why I am going to try and convince you , now , of the importance of getting in a decent amount of exercise . <p> Your heart is a vital piece of machinery in that body of yours and it needs looking after . Without your ticker , there is not much you can do to carry on . The good news is that looking after the most important organ in the body is quite a simple affair . All it takes is a little exercise to keep the heart healthy . And I do mean a little the professional medical advice on exercise is that you should get 120 minutes of it every three to four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I think you will agree that everyone can manage to find the time and the effort for that small amount of exercise . And what are the benefits of doing so ? <p> Regular exercise keeps the heart pumping at optimal rate . This , in turn , makes it much less likely that you will ever hear a doctor tell you you have cardiovascular disease or heart disease . It also reduces your likelihood of becoming diabetic . It also encourages your nerves to remain open , helps stop any clogging ever occurring , and increases your lung capacity . But it 's not just your organs that benefit from regular exercise . Your muscles have more oxygen in them , so they can move around more easily . Your bones , too , will have a longer life from being used more frequently . Lastly , when you exercise , the rush of endorphins and serotonin causes a natural high which you just ca n't get any other way . Exercise makes you feel good , makes you look good , and is good .

Are you looking after your teeth as well as you could ? <p> We all know the recommended advice when it comes to tooth care . Brushing twice a day , as well as using mouthwash , can be easy enough to follow for most of our lives . But how often do we stop to consider just how important our dental health is ? It 's not just about wanting to keep a healthy smile having good dental health has many benefits beyond what you might expect .

We often think in dualistic terms and separate out the different functions . But a holistic approach to one 's health is very often the way forward . The fact is , your body affects the state of your mind , and vice versa . That 's why it is so important to take good care of your mental health , as well as your physical body .

As global warming impacts our environment , plant-flowering times have changed leading to a massive decline in bee colonies . This could have major impacts on our food production . It has been going on for years now , and the bee population continues to decline . Back in 2011 , a young boy by the name of Henry Miller learned about Colony Collapse Disorder from a beekeeper , and decided that he wanted to do something to help . So for his birthday he asked for a beehive and began selling raw honey by the side of the road as a way to earn money for saving the bees ( and his familys farm ) . Then he added spices and Henrys Humdingers was born ! Today these butt-kicking condiments are sold in over 300 stores across 31 states ! <p> Made of raw honey and spices , Henrys Humdingers come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad , a fiery blend of honey , Habanero and lime . Naughty Nana is a hot spicy ginger , pepper and honey blend . Grumpy Grandpa is a tasty concoction of raw honey , red pepper and garlic . Phoebes Fireball is a unique sweet and spicy mix of chipotle chile , cinnamon and raw honey . <p> Raw honey is actually quite good for you . Not only is it naturally sweet , but it is fat-free , cholesterol free and low-calorie ! However , since Henrys Humdingers are made with raw honey , over time it will crystallize . This does not mean it has gone bad , it is just something honey will do . Honey actually lasts a long time , in fact , the jars I received are good until 2019 ! All you have to do to get it back to its original gooey goodness is warm up the jar in a pan of warm water . <p> Henrys Humdingers can be used for all sorts of delicious recipes .

You will need to make sure that you set aside a few hours to complete this project . This one is only suitable for DIY gurus , so make sure that you have skills before you begin . Here is to make a chic office chair from an old car seat . <p> Step 1 : Rescue an old car seat from a junkyardFirst of all , you need to lay your hands on a car seat .

If you head to any junkyard in the country , you should find that there is an old seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing what you can find at junkyards , and so its always well worth a look . You should ask the guard whether you can take things before you go grabbing them .

If it does have sharp edges , you should sand them down before you continue . Flip the seat over and fit your steel bars to it . You will need to create a solid square with this material . You should weld them to the base of the chair or use a hatchet to fix them to it . Make sure that the bars are as firm as they can be .

There are usually four holes that you can use to fix the base of the chair to the fixture itself . <p> Step 4 : Fit the legs to the chair You will need a ratchet and four bolts for this part of the project .

That way , you can make sure that the legs are at a perfect 90-degree angle from the base of the seat . <p> Step 5 : Screw on the castorsThe castors are the little wheels that will allow you to move the chair in your study . Of course , this feature is essential . Different wheels suit different floor types , and so you should check out some castor selection tips .

As a Good Cook blogger I often get sent amazing products to try and share with you , my readers , and this month I received a chillingly awesome Halloween Kit that came with several products from the Sweet Creations line which is a Good Cook product line designed especially for dessert making , baking and holiday parties . Included was a Good Cook Sweet Creations Haunted House Cookie Cutter Set , a Halloween Cupcake Stand , a Halloween Cake Pop Press , a cute 3D Frankenstein Cookie Cutter , cupcake liners , and even some cute treat bags ! <p> Since there were so many delicious goodies to make , and some great recipes I wanted to share , I am going to divide this into two separate posts , starting with my personal favorite , the Haunted House Cookie Cutter Set . Let me start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a professional baker , in fact , this was actually the first time I have ever made a gingerbread house , unless you count the one I made in elementary school using graham crackers and milk cartons ! That being said , this was a very challenging experience , but one from which I learned a lot ! Had I not had the opportunity to learn from my fellow Good Cook bloggers tips and experiences , had I not done some research , and had I not had my husbands help , this would not have come out as well as it did ! <p> The Good Cook Sweet Creations Haunted House Cookie Cutter Set is not a pre-made Gingerbread House kit , instead it is one you make from scratch . It comes with 7 pieces : three cookie cutters ( the front/back , the sides and the roof ) , 2 rollers and 2 stamps . There is an easy-to-make GingerBoo Cookie Dough recipe on the back , as well as basic instructions . I want to go ahead and say that the kit itself is great ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clean ; user inexperience is what caused all of the mishaps and made it extremely time-consuming ! But in the long run , it was worth it ! <p> First you make your gingerbread dough . This was quite easy , and did not take long at all . Once the dough is made , work with it until it comes together and is no longer sticky , then put it into the refrigerator for about an hour or so to thoroughly cool . We left it in a bit too long , and wound up having to wait for it to get closer to room temperature to roll it out . Once chilled , using a rolling mat or parchment paper , split the dough in half and roll it out until it is around 1/8 ? thick . If you do not roll it thin enough , there 's a chance you will not have enough dough . Thankfully , we had plenty of dough left to where we were able to make a chimney , a sidewalk and an emergency wall as we dropped one of ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , use the cookie cutters to cut out the individual pieces . While there are designs in the molds , you can use the included stamps and roller to add more if you 'd like . Once you have all of the dough rolled out and have stamped and cut it , place each piece on a baking sheet and bake it at 325- for about 12 minutes or until the edges begin to brown . We had used parchment paper to roll out the dough , so transferring the pieces to the sheet was as easy as sliding the parchment paper onto the sheet and placing it in the oven . This kept the pieces from bending and/or stretching . Once baked , let it cool completely before you assemble it . <p> Now it is time to put it together . I highly recommend using a recipe for Royal Icing as this will work the best to hold your house together the one I included below worked perfectly , once we figured it out ! Having never made it before , I mixed it until it was way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add water until we got it to what finally turned out to be the right consistency . here 's another tip : this icing will dry out quickly if left exposed to air , so if you need to stop , stick the end of the icing bag in another plastic bag to keep it airtight and stick it in the refrigerator . <p> Royal Icing Recipe <p> Makes 3 cups <p> 3 tbsp Meringue <p> 4 cups Confectioners Sugar <p> 6 Tbsp warm water <p> Mix all ingredients together until icing peaks . Approximately 10 minutes .

Well that is about to change because I have found another one that I absolutely love and you will , too ! Ecocentric Mom . <h> The Idea Behind Ecocentric Mom <p> Ecocentric Mom is a unique subscription box filled with eco-friendly , natural , organic , and often vegan-friendly products for moms and moms-to-be . Started by an eco-friendly mom of four , Ecocentric Mom is dedicated to spreading awareness about environmentally friendly alternatives to everyday products . Its a great way to try products for moms and babies without having to buy a full size bottle . <p> Those of you that often read this blog know that I am a big supporter of eco-friendly and organic products , and this quote from the Ecocentric Mom website gives a great example of why : <p> " Take one example : soap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now in 140 different types of consumer products including liquid hand soap , toothpaste , undergarments , and children 's toys ? Yet study after study has shown that triclosan can interfere with hormones critical for normal development and function of the brain and reproductive system .

To top it off , triclosan has been associated with breast cancer . " <p> And that 's just one of hundreds of potentially harmful chemicals we use , and expose our children to , on an everyday basis ! <p> In order to help spread awareness about eco-friendly products for moms and babies , Ecocentric Mom created a monthly subscription service that includes a box filled with eco-friendly and natural products . Subscriptions can be purchased from bi-monthly all the way up to a year . There are three different box options from which to choose including the Pregnancy Box , the Mom &amp; Baby Box , and the Mom Box . Each one comes with 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motherhood .

This stone gently combs the fibers on the surface of the sweater , effectively removing pills and restoring the original look and feel of the sweater . <h> My Thoughts on Ecocentric Mom <p> Not only was my box nicely packaged with nothing more than the box itself and a sheet of colored tissue paper but it also contained more full-sized items than I was expecting . In addition , there was also an informative card complete with descriptions of each item , and their prices .

This has proven to be a popular choice for many families as a way to reduce their energy costs . In some states there is so much sunshine , it means that most of your energy needs could be covered . There have been plenty of popular schemes that allow you to sell your excess solar power to the main grid too . This means you can enjoy an income for your solar panel investment . So what are you going to use all that lovely sunshine for ? <h> Power Your Vehicles <p> Yep , if you charge your electric car , your elektrische scooter , or even your RV battery during a sunny day , you 'll be fully powered for free ! Think about how much you 're spending down at the gas station . Would n't it wonderful to say goodbye to all the hassle as well as the cost ? If you love your RV , chances are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your drive . Give it a boost , and enjoy . Sadly , you 're still going to need to get some gas to move it off the drive , though . <h> Do Your Laundry <p> Is it really that daft to use a tumble dryer on a sunny day ? Think about all the times you 've collected your washing from the line to find birds had fouled it . And what on earth is that dreadful stench on the air ? Do n't forget pollution can cling to clothing fibers too . Your solar panels could power your tumble dryer as well as the washing machine . Maybe other appliances too ( assuming your circuits can handle the draw . ) A winter 's day may be sunny , but washing wo n't dry on the line for hours . <h> Vacuuming <p> OK , so the panels wo n't actually take care of your housework for you . But if you have battery-powered vacuum cleaners like the robot vacuum or a handheld cleaner , you can get them charged up and ready to go at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from years ago ? They were power-hungry and probably cost you a lot more on your electricity bill than you might think . Go for a rechargeable one and clean up for free . <h> Cook Dinner <p> Seriously , the panels are n't going to serve up a meal ! But , if you cook it in an electric oven , microwave or slow cooker , you wo n't incur any energy costs . Make food while the sun shines ! Electric hobs and electric ovens will draw an enormous amount of energy . This could exceed what you 're generating up on your roof , so check your monitor . Even if you 're not quite breaking even , you could still be reducing the cost of cooking quite substantially . <h> Heat The House <p> Space heaters are a firm favorite on a chilly night . Unfortunately , the sun does n't shine during those wee hours . Still , you can keep one or two rooms nice and toasty before you lose the light with those small portable heaters . If you live in colder climes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are in nice and warm on a sunny day without turning on your boiler .

@@29515188 @3215188/ <h> UrthBox Monthly Subscription Box The Healthy Choice <p> Those of you who read this blog often know that I love sharing about monthly subscription boxes , as well as products that promote healthy living . Back in November I had the opportunity to review an item that combined both of these concepts , a delightful , monthly subscription box known as UrthBox . <p> What is UrthBox ? <p> UrthBox is a great way to discover healthy new foods , beverages , snacks and more every month . Each box features handpicked goodies focusing on organic , all natural and GMO-free ingredients.There are several different types of boxes from which to choose including Classic , Gluten-Free , Vegan , Diet and Just Snacks . Every month you will receive a box that is literally filled with full-size samples of healthy new foods , beverages , snacks &amp; more . <p> And what 's really cool is that you can earn big loyalty points for every purchase and then use those points towards purchasing your favorite items in the UrthBox Shop at member discounts . Plus you can earn huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your UrthBox through social media ! And these are not small penny discounts either ; for example , if you publish and share a YouTube video of your UrthBox , you get a $12 credit ! Not a bad way to save ! <p> My First UrthBox <p> As I mentioned above , my first box came in November . This one focused on a little bit of everything and included a large variety of drinks , snacks and more . There were also two cards included , one of which gave a little bit of background on each product , and the other was a discount towards the purchase of my next box . Heres what came in my first UrthBox : <p> COCO Libre Organic Coconut Water with a taste like you just cut open a fresh coconut , this water hydrates and provides 5 key electrolytes . <p> Prince of Peace Instant Ginger Honey Crystals a proprietary blend of honey and ginger crystals when added to hot or cold water makes a soothing , smooth , sweet and spicy , aromatic drink . <p> Twinnings of London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the world . <p> My Thoughts on UrthBox <p> Since my first box focused on a little bit of everything , it was a great way to see exactly what they offer . When I first opened the box , I could not believe how much was included ! There was a total of 11 products , which is much more than I am used to seeing with the majority of subscription boxes ! I really like that there were many items and brands I had never heard of , as well as several I had . What a great way to discover new products , and also to try products that I may have seen before , but was hesitant about buying without knowing whether or not I would like them . <p> Another thing I really liked about UrthBox was how the enclosed card not only gave information about each individual product and what ingredients it did or did not contain , but that it also told me which stores I could find each item . In summary , I believe UrthBox is an ideal way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also a great way to teach yourself how to eat a more healthy diet . And although UrthBox is a bit pricey ( see below ) , I really believe it is well worth the money ! <p> How to Order UrthBox <p> Ordering UrthBox is easy . You simply visit http : //www.urthbox.com/ , choose the type box you prefer , then select the subscription you want . There are three different subscription lengths from which to choose : one , three or six months . One month will cost you $25 , three months will cost $22 per month , and the best deal is the six month subscription at $19 a month .

@@29515189 @3215189/ <h> Luca + Danni Handcrafted Jewelry : Natural Elements Amethyst Bangle <p> Like many woman , I love jewelry . And I especially love jewelry that is handcrafted . But introduce me to a company that makes gorgeous , unique handcrafted jewelry as a way to share an inspirational message or for another great reason , and I am usually sold . And that is exactly what happened when I learned about Luca + Danni handcrafted jewelry . <p> Luca + Danni creates beautiful handcrafted jewelry " from bangles to pearls to antique glass " and they have a sweet and powerful story . The company was born out of the simple yet powerful belief that dreams can come true . In 2013 , Fred Magnanimis brother lost ( won ) his difficult battle with Leukemia . Fred , who was an investment banker by background , left his career on Wall Street to carry on his brother 's dream of creating a unique line of handcrafted American-made jewelry that " inspired others through the journey of life " . <p> " Named after his two young children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passion , we should all boldly embrace the journey of life . " <p> The Luca + Danni handcrafted jewelry collection offers many gorgeous pieces including this one , from the Natural Elements collection . Each handcrafted bracelet in this collection features four round or rectangle shaped sea sediment elements on bangles in your choice of oxidized natural brass or silver plated wrapped wire . They are available in multiple sizes , and each comes with a hook and catch closure to keep it safe on your wrist . The stones come in beautiful colors such as turquoise , sea green , navy blue , and the one I selected , amethyst . <p> The first thing I noticed when my bracelet arrived was the cute drawstring bag the bracelet was packaged in . There was also a small card that tells the story behind the company , as well as another card with instructions on how to care for your Luca + Danni handcrafted jewelry . <p> The bracelet itself was everything I was hoping for . Four deep wine-colored stones are securely attached to a shiny silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are actually multiple shades of red , orange and pink throughout each stone . The thin , lighter colored veins which trace patterns across their smooth , polished surface works with the coloring to give each stone its own individual look . Each stone measures a little less than one-half inch in diameter , and is about 7/16 of an inch thick . <p> The heavy gauge wire on which the stones are threaded appears to be very securely wrapped around the bracelet and then either bent in tightly or possibly tapped with the tip of a soldering iron , so I do n't  think I have to worry about it coming loose and allowing the stones to fall off . <p> The wrapped wire actually becomes part of the style of the bracelet as there is the same style wrapping as part of the hook and catch closure . While the stones are securely threaded on a piece of wire , they do have a bit of play so you can move them just a bit to give them a less uniform look . <p> There is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be very well made . It fits my wrist perfectly and looks great with a variety of outfits ! In summary , I love it ! <p> Looking for the perfect holiday gift for the fashionista on your list under $40 that is both unique and beautiful ? How about a handcrafted bracelet from Luca + Danni ? Luca + Danni handcrafted jewelry can be purchased directly through their website as well as through multiple individual retailers .

@@29515197 @3215197/ <p> I received this product for free from Smiley360 in exchange for my honest review . You can join Smiley360 here ! " <p> Proper nutrition is important no matter your age , but as you get older , you really want to make sure you are getting enough calcium to help avoid osteoporosis and other problems later in life . In addition to helping keep bones strong and healthy , calcium also plays an important role in nerve , muscle and hormone health . Unfortunately , studies show that 81% of women do not get enough calcium from food alone . While I have heard that statistic before , it really hit home for me when I received a phone call from my step father telling me my mom had fallen and broken her hip . She is in her late 60s , but to me has always seemed strong and practically indestructible . So no wonder it came as a shock to learn that a simple slip caused a break so bad , surgery was required to repair it . If that wasnt bad enough , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and re-break led to more surgery , followed by an even longer stay , followed by a move to another facility for in-patient rehab , followed by a long period of recuperation at home . The entire experience made me realize exactly how frail our bones can become the older we get , and also how dangerous and life-altering that can be . <p> While many of us know the role calcium plays in keeping bones strong , some may not be as familiar with the fact that calcium is n't the only vitamin that effects bone health . Vitamin D plays a crucial role , too . In fact , not getting enough vitamin D may actually reduce the amount of calcium your bones absorb from food alone ! Which brings up the topic of supplementing our vitamin and mineral intake with a supplement . <h> Caltrate Calcium &amp; Vitamin D3 Supplement Gummy Bites <p> As a Smiley360 blogger , I had the opportunity to try a calcium supplement made by Caltrate . According to the website , Caltrate is the number 1 selling brand of calcium supplements , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . They offer several different calcium supplements including Caltrate 600+D3 , Caltrate 600+D3 Plus Minerals , and the one I have been taking , Caltrate Gummy Bites . <p> As I mentioned above , calcium and vitamin D play important roles in bone health , and Caltrate Gummy Bites provide both . The National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends 1000 mg of calcium daily for women and men ages 19 50 , and 1200 mg a day for women and men over 51 years of age . Caltrate Gummy Bites provide 500mg of calcium ( 50% of the daily value ) and 800 IU of vitamin D3 ( 200% of the daily value ) . The recommended dosage is to take 2 Gummy Bites up to 2 times a day , at any time during the day . They are formulated for adults and teens older than 13 . <h> My Review of Caltrate Gummy Bites <p> Caltrate Gummy Bites are a bit larger than what I am used to seeing in a gummy supplement , but to me they are much easier to take than a pill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orange and Strawberry . They actually taste pretty good , with a few sprinkles of sugar crystals on the outside of each one to add a bit of sweetness to the semi tart fruit flavor . While the sugar tastes good , I personally prefer to take vitamins or supplements with little to no sugar . Caltrate Gummy Bites contain a total of 7 grams worth of sugars including corn syrup . The Gummy Bites also do not contain some of the other clinically proven bone building ingredients such as trace minerals , magnesium , vitamin K2 or strontium , but there are other types of Caltrate that do if that is what you are looking for . <p> Overall , as a calcium and vitamin D3 supplement , I believe Caltrate Gummy Bites are pretty good ! To me , the only drawback is the amount of sugars . Other than that , they taste good , are reasonably priced , and if you are like me and do not like taking pills , they are a very nice alternative . Please remember to always talk to your doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor and nothing in this review is meant to provide medical advice . <h> Save on Caltrate Calcium Supplements <p> While Caltrate is already reasonably priced , here are some coupons to help you save more ! 130178 @qwx330178 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

So it is the season that needs us to take extra care with our home and belongings . Here are some essential tips , to make sure that you keep your home safe and looked after , while you are away . <h> Ask a Neighbor To Help Out <p> If you have friends and neighbors close by that will be around , then recruit their help . If they can take your mail in from the mailbox and generally check on things in the house , it will help a lot . If you live in an area that snows , it might just need them to shovel the snow on your driveway or walk up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is obvious to everyone that nobodys home . A few small things like this from a neighbor can help massively as a deterrent . <h> Consider Technology To Help <p> If you are able to , then installing something like CCTV would help a lot . You could have it positioned at the entrances of your home , to check for intruders . There are a lot of apps and devices nowadays that mean you can see from the camera from your phone . So you can watch for anything suspicious when you are away . You could also get timers for the lights in your home . You can get timers that you set , or look for ones that you can activate . These things might cost a little bit to start with , but can be a really worthwhile investment . <h> Do n't Let Everyone Know <p> If you are going to be out of the country for two weeks , do n't share it with everyone you know on Facebook ! You need to especially check your privacy settings too . Otherwise , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not many deterrents will put them off . So only tell people that you know and trust . It is also a good idea to be careful about what you say on your voicemail too . Do n't say you 're away and will call them back in two weeks . Just that you ca n't come to the phone right now . <h> Keep Things Looking Normal <p> One thing that people are unsure of when they go away is leaving the curtains closed or open . You want to make things look as normal as possible . So if you normally have your curtains open , then they should still be quite open . Having them closed for two weeks can set off suspicion for many . <h> Keep Your Heating Running <p> In order to avoid any disasters when you get home from your trip , keep your heating running . Just set it to come on each day , but only for around thirty minutes each time . Then you wo n't come back to frozen or burst pipes , which can be a disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Not driving cars as often and using less electricity are the main things that people do to reduce their effect on the environment . Most people that make an effort to maintain an eco-friendly home tend to cut out anything that could potentially be harmful . The problem is , they do n't always realize when things are having a negative effect on the environment and so they do n't cut them out . Maybe it 's time to look at your own efforts and see if you 've picked up on these secret dangers to the environment . <p> Candles are often thought of as being more eco-friendly than electric lights . While it 's true that they use less energy than a lightbulb , therefore reducing the amount of fossil fuels we use , they release their own pollutants into the atmosphere . All candles will give out a certain amount of carbon , but some are much worse than others . Vegetable oil or beeswax candles are n't too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does n't mean you should burn them all the time though . The ones you really want to watch out for are paraffin candles . They are made from a byproduct of either petroleum or coal . This is then treated with industrial strength bleach to whiten it . Does n't sound so relaxing , now does it ? On top of this , the hardening agent used to get it into its candle shape is Acrolein , one of the ingredients of cigarette smoke that has links to lung cancer so you are doing yourself some damage as well . Yankee Candles are probably the biggest seller of candles in the world and most of their candles are made from paraffin . <p> Toxic Waste <p> Not the kind of toxic waste you see in big yellow barrels in the movies . This can refer to a lot of different things . One common one is paint .

The danger of asbestos in older properties is much larger so if you have some , make sure that the company that removes it for you are disposing of it properly . The same can be said of lead paint . <p> Light Bulbs <p> Another common one that people do n't realize is light bulbs . Some of the standard varieties are fine , but the fluorescent ones contain dangerous levels of mercury . They are safe if they are not broken , but you can not put them in a normal bin otherwise they will end up in landfill where they will pollute the soil and water . <p> As a general rule , if you have anything that you think could be harmful to the environment , the best thing to do is contact your local authority .

@@29515200 @3215200/ <h> Five Things to Consider When Purchasing Wireless Speakers <p> This is a collaborative post between Bullocks Buzz and Tesco . All opinions are my own . <p> With most people using their smartphones , tablets or PCs as the main source for music in their lives these days , wireless speakers have basically replaced component-based stereo systems , boom boxes , CD players and other sound devices . After all , with Bluetooth technology , you have the flexibility to listen to your music however and wherever you want without having to plug-in or placing it into a docking station . With todays vast selection , it can be hard to find the perfect one for your needs if you do n't  know what to look for . Below are five of the most important qualities one should look for when it comes to finding the perfect wireless speaker . <p> Audio Quality <p> The first , and one of the most important , features to look for is the quality of the sound . Oftentimes bigger does not necessarily mean better , nor does more expensive mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people prefer big bass , whole others prefer a mix of bass and treble . Whichever your preference , you should definitely make sure that it is able to reproduce low frequencies without distorting at higher volumes . Today you can find ones that allow you to maximize the bass , while others allow you adjust both the bass and the treble using an equalizer . Still others may not offer much in the way of features , but produce amazing audio . The absolute best way to find one with good sound is to go to an electronics store and try them out yourself . <p> Connectivity/Range <p> Another thing to consider is the connectivity , or the distance that the speaker will connect away from your smartphone , tablet or computer . It is important to consider where you want to be able to connect from in your home . Do you want it to be able to reach from one end of your home to the other ? Do you want to be able to connect and play through walls ? Once you know exactly what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range will fit your needs . Bluetooth speakers connect at varying ranges , although most will reach distances from around 30 feet up to 100 feet depending on the size and style . <p> Portability <p> Another factor to consider is the portability . Wireless speakers come in a wide range of sizes , from as small as an inch and a half , to as large as floor size . If you are looking for a smaller set to use for travel , keep a few things in mind . First of all , the connectivity distance will be a lot shorter . Also , keep in mind that some smaller ones do n't  sound very good with bass that tends to be weak and distortion at high volumes . <p> Extra Features <p> The majority of wireless speakers today come with an auxiliary input so you can connect with your computer , older MP3 player or other devices that are not bluetooth enabled . Some come with a video input which allows you to watch tv or videos on your phone while using the speaker for audio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a clock and an alarm ! It all depends on what you are wanting . <p> Price <p> The last thing you need to consider is the price . How much are you wanting to pay ? Wireless speakers can range in price from under $15 up to hundreds of dollars . As I mentioned above , more expensive does not necessarily mean you will be getting the best product . My rule of thumb is to get the best sound , along with the features you want , at a price you can afford . Once you find the one you like , be sure to shop around before purchasing as you can often find great deals both online and off . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Whether its another sensationalist news report trying to terrify us about crime statistics , or hearsay we have heard in the pub regarding the latest disease that is supposedly going round , we seem to expect danger at every corner . That is , except , for within the home . For some people their home is the only place in which they feel truly safe and where they feel able to relax . However , not every property is truly as safe as the homeowner may think . Unless you built your home from scratch yourself , you do n't  really have any clear idea about its internal workings and how well it has been put together . Usually this should n't cause you too much of an issue after all , every home has to pass certain structural requirements in order to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , under certain circumstances , put you and your family at risk . Here are some of the most common ones and what you can do to reinforce the home you love . <h> Windows that do n't  fit the frames <p> We all know how heat can make certain materials inside the home change in size and shape , and your windows are no exception . In a particularly old home you may find that you notice cracks or gaps around the edges of your windows that let in a bit of a draught . Annoying at best , and making your house feel cold and insecure at worst . You can solve this issue through various means , with the cheapest and most cost-effective one being with window sealant . However , if you want to implement a more long-term solution , it may be worth looking into getting your windows replaced . <h> Poor insulation and structural support <p> If you 're living in somewhere that is frequently subjected to extreme weather , you may hear your house creak from time to time . Usually this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out a little bit when you 're home alone ! But if your property is unusually cold and you feel like things are moving in ways you do n't  think they should , you could have a more serious structural issue on your hands . A viable solution for many people is the installation of timber cladding , which acts as an insulator and a reinforcer for the structure as a whole . <h> Chipped brickwork and loose tiles <p> Those cracked tiles on your roof are always the kind of thing you keep meaning to get fixed , but you never actually get round to it . However , by not doing so , you could be inadvertently putting your family at risk . All it takes is for one gust of wind to blow that loose tile onto the ground below , and it could hit someone in the process . Unless you 're experienced , never go on your roof yourself to fix anything always hire a professional . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

The image quality of technology screens have seen vast improvement , furthermore screens are not only getting bigger and bigger but also smaller and smaller . It 's not only that though , the way we interact with technology has also changed due to technological advancements such as touchscreen . Take a look at the differences in technology screens from past to present . <p> One of the most obvious improvements in the past decade has been with regard to the resolution of technology screens . This is n't just on televisions , but across the board , with smartphones and computers also seeing huge improvements . One knock on effect of this is that we are now able to enjoy larger screens , with figures showing that televisions have doubled in size over the last ten years . In 2014 , Apple begun to market products with Retina Display ' , a resolution so high that any pixilation ca n't be perceived by the human eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed everything , and not just in the mobile phone market . One of the many great features of the device was that it was completely touchscreen . This has gone on to become such a selling point that not only is it the industry standard for all smartphones , but also many laptops have gone on to adopt the technology . With the average household owning 5 screens each the tablet market , dominated by Apple and Samsung , has gone from strength to strength largely based on the usability of touchscreen . Furthermore , it is now conventional for smartphones and tablets to have multi-touch , a technology that allows the screen to recognise more than one point of contact with the surface . <p> The degree to which technology screens have advanced over the past decade has led to a massive change in which we use the technology .

Image resolutions have consistently improved and this shows no signs of slowing down , so as a result we can expect screens to get bigger and bigger and bigger . Touchscreen technology also looks set to continue its evolution , 3D Touch recognising not only the point of contact , but the force too .

Not only does the unbearable heat of our Southern summers come to an end , but the trees begin to turn vibrant colors , and apples , pumpkins and scarecrows abound . I also love that Fall is full of fun holidays , sweet treats , and delicious foods ; but the reason I love Fall most of all ? Because of all the fabulous foods I get to bake ! <p> Speaking of candy and baking , I have 2 pieces of sweet news ( one has to do with an awesome sweepstakes so be sure you read through the whole post ! ) and an awesome recipe to share with you today ! First of all , piece of news number one ! Perhaps youve already seen them at your local Walmart , but M&amp;Ms- has come out with a delicious new flavor : M&amp;Ms- Pecan Pie ! Now I know what you 're thinking most likely the same thing my husband did M&amp;Ms- flavored like pecan pie ? YES ! And I 'm here to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you love milk chocolate and pecan pie ! Heck , all you have to do is open the bag and smell and your mouth will start watering ! <p> Get ready for some more mouth-watering deliciousness ! After finding the M&amp;Ms- Pecan Pie at Walmart , I know I had to make an awesome recipe . And what says Fall more than Carrot Cake cupcakes frosted with cream cheese icing ? Carrot Cake Cupcakes frosted with cream cheese frosting and topped with M&amp;Ms- Pecan Pie that 's what ! Of course being in the Fall type of mood , I just had to make those carrot cake cupcakes topped with cream cheese frosting into something Fall-ish , so after much thought I decided to make them into scarecrows and wrap them in some cute Fall-themed cupcake wrappers . The cupcakes came out so yummy , and looked so cute , that I just had to share ( and I included a free printable so you can make your own Fall-themed cupcake wrappers , too ) ! <p> Ready to see how to make these adorable Fall Scarecrow Carrot Cake Cupcakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walmart to get your ingredients . In order to make the cupcakes a bit healthier and less heavy , I picked up some Motts- Apple Sauce to use in place of multiple cups of vegetable oil . I also grabbed some PillsburyG Creamy Supreme- Cream Cheese Icing so yummy on carrot cake cupcakes ! And of course I could n't forget those tasty M&amp;Ms- Pecan Pie ! I found them on the seasonal aisle , although I 've also seen them on an end cap .

In order to encourage rising , I like to start off baking the cupcakes at 400-F for about 8 minutes , then decrease the oven temp to 350-F and let finish baking . If you do n't  want to do this , just preheat the oven and bake the cupcakes at 350-F . <p> In a large bowl , beat together the eggs , oil , apple sauce , sugars , pineapple and teaspoon of vanilla . <p> In a separate bowl combine the flour , baking soda , baking powder , salt , cinnamon , nutmeg and small pinch of ground cloves , and mix well .

Kids will get a kick out of helping you turn these cupcakes into scarecrows for Fall and/or Halloween ! <p> Directions for Decorating Scarecrow CupcakesBegin by using the sugar wafer cookies for the hats , first cutting them down to size . Now insert 2 toothpicks into the top back side of the cupcake . These will provide a bit more support for the hats . <p> Use a dab of frosting to stick the two pieces of hat together into one <p> then place the finished hat on the cupcake . <p> Insert a few chow mein noodles on either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pecan Pie M&amp;Ms- for the eyes <p> a yellow one for the nose <p> and a big grin made of black cookie icing . <p> Now take a few pieces of the shredded wheat cereal and pull it apart into strands which will be used for the hay around the bottom of the scarecrows face . <p> Then add some decoration to the scarecrows hat using the colored cookie icing , and there you have your adorable scarecrow cupcake ! <p> Once all of the cupcakes are decorated its time to add the cupcake wrappers . To do this simply print out the free cupcake wrapper pattern on a pretty piece of cardstock ( or use it as a template to trace on your favorite fun Fall craft paper ) . <p> Cut out the cupcake wrapper so it resembles the one in the picture above , then either insert the tab into the slot ( if you decide to cut out this part out too ) , or just use a dab of glue to connect it on the backside .

This is one of three in the Morning Burst Body Wash line , the other two being : Splash Body Wash with Wildberry and Guava and Charge Body Wash with Pomegranate and Orange Zest . All three body wash formulas have these little beads , called Bursting Beads , which are filled with fruit extracts and give off the most wonderful aroma , while leaving your skin soft and clean . <p> I found that the thick gel-like wash lathers best when applied with either a puff or a sponge , foaming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large amount to clean your entire body , and it rinses off easily without leaving that slick film-like feeling . The citrussy scent of mango and papaya was so fresh and invigorating , filling my whole bathroom with great smelling steam .

It left my skin feeling soft and clean without drying it out or leaving it feeling tight and drawn-up . This formula is okay to use on normal , oily and dry skin , and since it is made by Clean and Clear , I imagine it would work well for people who are prone to getting blemishes on their body . <p> If you have not tried this body wash yet , I definitely recommend doing so , especially if you prefer body wash over soap . I cant wait to try the other two formulas , specifically the Charge Body Wash with Pomegranate and Orange Zest since I love the scent of citrus ! 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

In order to stay looking beautiful , here are five bad habits that you need to quit today . <p> 1 . Drinking Out of a StrawAre you one of those people that uses a water bottle with a straw on a daily basis ? If so , you may want to give it up and opt for the open container . Drinking out of a straw on a regular basis can ruin your appearance by creating lines around your mouth . The constant sucking motion you have to do in order to drink through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real way to get rid of them . Although you may not think a few lines are a big deal , they will make you look much older than you are . <p> 2 . SquintingIf you are a squinter , you need to remedy the situation quickly . Squinting creates lines around your eyes that make you appear older , and it will take corrective surgery or a multitude of creams and ointments to diminish their appearance . If you are squinting because of bright lights , wear sunglasses or talk with your optometrist about ways to prevent light sensitivity . If you are squinting because you 're having trouble seeing , talk with your optometrist about getting glasses or contacts or getting a stronger prescription . <p> 3 . SmokingThis is a no brainer . Not only does smoking make you less attractive to people who do n't like smokers , it can also do some major damage to your body and appearance . Like drinking from a straw , the constant sucking motion you use to smoke a cigarette will place lines around your mouth . Plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way to remedy this is through cosmetic dentistry like teeth whitening or dental veneers . Cigarettes also contain a variety of harmful chemicals , and when inhaled , these chemicals damage your body internally , which can have negative effects on your outer beauty as well . <p> 4 . Not Getting Enough SleepThere are plenty of reasons you may not be getting enough sleep , but that does n't make it okay . Sleep helps to rejuvenate the body and provide the right amount of energy you need to tackle the day . Without sleep , your body becomes tired , and this can have an impact on your muscles . Plus , being tired also creates bags and dark circles around the eyes , and no amount of concealer seems to make these go away . <p> 5 . Sitting at a DeskMany people spend their day sitting in front of a computer , and while this may be essential for your job , it 's damaging to your appearance . Sitting at a desk all day can ruin your posture and create issues like carpal tunnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunched when you 're older . In order to combat this , be sure to get away from your desk as often as possible . You should also do some exercises to improve your posture . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

For many , myself included , cleaning can be a chore that involves a lot of time , elbow grease and chemicals . And if you are like me , trying to live a more Green lifestyle , then you are doing what you can to avoid using harmful chemicals . This Spring , thanks to HomeRight , I wont have to use a lot of chemicals , or spend a lot of time and elbow grease on cleaning our home thanks to the SteamMachine Multi-Purpose Power Steamer I received for review ! <p> The HomeRight SteamMachine Multi-Purpose Power Steameris the perfect device for cleaning your home without the use of harsh or harmful chemicals . Instead , it uses pressurized , high temperature , steam to loosen and dissolve dirt , grease , grime without leaving behind any chemical residue . Better yet , it kills 99% of all germs and bacteria ! It makes cleaning your home fast and easy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clean everything from the stove to the windows to the bathtub ; in fact , it can even be used to remove wallpaper ! <p> There are several features about this SteamMachine that I absolutely love aside from its ability to make cleaning fast and easy . First of all its size . I was absolutely amazed at its compact design and light weight , plus it has a handle for easy carrying and two wheels for easy mobility especially when using it to mop floors ! Moving it from one room to another is a cinch . Secondly , the amount and assortment of attachments it comes with makes you job even easier . I love not having to use a bunch of different cleansers , rags , cloths , and other cleaning materials for each individual job this one machine practically does it all . Its 8 foot hose makes it super easy to reach high or low spots ( especially if you are short like me ) , and I like that is also has an 8 foot cord so I do n't  have to mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also love that it is designed so that the majority of the attachments fit right inside the front cover so you do n't  have to lug around a bunch of different brushes and nozzles . Speaking of attachments , here is a list of everything that comes with the SteamMachine : <p> Wallpaper steam plate <p> Floor steam mop with microfiber cleaning pad <p> Brass brush <p> Two nylon brushes <p> Jet nozzle <p> Squeegee <p> Measuring cup with fill funnel <p> Owners instruction manual <p> Using the HomeRight SteamMachine is quite simple . Using the included measuring cup and funnel , you first add the recommended amount of water . When you turn it on , two lights ( one red , the other orange ) will light up . As soon as the red light goes off , it is ready to use . Ive used other steam machines in the past that seemed to take forever to heat up , and then would only last only a few minutes and would emit a weak jet of steam . This one is ready to go in about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steam time at 45 PSI of pressure at the nozzle not bad for such a small machine ! <p> My first use of this machine came a short while ago when we moved to our new apartment . Now call me picky , but although I know many apartments are cleaned before you moved in , there was no way I was not going to give it a thorough cleaning myself , especially the tub , sinks and floors . The HomeRight SteamMachine made this quick and easy ! Using all of the different attachments , this one machine helped me clean the bathtub , the shower door , the bathroom sink , the bathroom floor , the kitchen floor , the kitchen sink and the counters ! And the best part of all ? No harmful chemicals were used ! <p> If you have ever used a steam machine then you know that these things release incredibly hot steam ( this particular one heats to 205- at the nozzle ) so you need to be careful ; and if you have kids then you need to be even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety features included . First of all , if I were still a kid , the first thing I 'd grab on this machine would be the handle because it looks like itd make a great imaginary gun ! Well HomeRight must have thought about this because the user-controlled handle comes with a locking mechanism that prevents the trigger from being squeezed until you unlock it . With a steam machine , the lid to the reservoir where you pour the water needs to be kept securely closed anytime it has water in it . If you release that cap when the machine is on , hot steam will come pouring out . To help remedy this , HomeRight made the lid so that it can not be opened all the way until it has cooled down to a certain temperature . <p> My Verdict <p> The HomeRight SteamMachine Multi-Purpose Power Steamer is a great steam cleaning machine for around the house . It really does save you time , and makes cleaning your entire home much easier . It is powerful enough for the jobs I need it for ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type brushes makes tough cleaning jobs easier . For example , just using a stream of steam to clean the grout between the shower wall tiles was not enough . Yet when I attached one of the nylon brushes , the majority came right off . In those few extremely stubborn spots , the copper brush was successful ! And speaking of the copper brush , it works great on the grill ! Overall , I would definitely recommend this steam machine for anyone that wants an easier way to clean ! <p> To learn more , visit HomeRight.com where you can also purchase the SteamMachine for only $99.99 !

@@29515222 @3215222/ <h> Say YES to Good Palm Oil What 's in the Food You Eat ? <h> Sustainable Palm Oil Isnt The Norm , But It Should Be <p> It was n't until about three years ago that I started to really get interested in what was going into the food my family eats and the products we use . The more I read , the more shocked I became , and that 's when I made the decision to start buying foods and products which contain more natural ingredients and less chemicals , and that are sourced sustainably and have less impact on the planet . That is also when I first heard about palm oil . <p> Perhaps you , like myself at one time , have never heard of palm oil , much less believe you 've used it . Actually you have used it and probably much more often than you think . That 's because , according to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ( RSPO ) , over 50% of supermarket goods contain the oil . It can be found in many foods such as chocolate , cereal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soaps , shampoos , candles , cosmetics , and lip balms . Its even in toothpaste ! In fact , around 70% of the worlds cosmetics and household detergents contain raw materials derived from palm oil ! <p> Why is it in so many products ? Mainly because it is the most efficient oilseed cropin the world . One hectare ( approximately 2.5 acres ) of oil palms can produce up to ten times more oil than other oilseed crops ! This not only makes palm oil the highest yielding vegetable oil in the world , it also makes it the least expensive . Plus , it has so many uses ! On top of being in all of these products we use , its a fantastic oil for cooking with its smooth , creamy texture , an absence of smell , and its ability to keep its cooking properties under high temperatures ( I personally love using it when I stir fry ) . Not to mention its healthy ! So while all of this sounds great , and perhaps even encourages you to start using it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13.47 million tonnes of palm oil is consumed , only a mere 21% of it is certified as being from sustainable sources . And where it is grown unsustainably , it can ( and has ) had a devastating impact on the environment , the people , and the animals who live where it is grown . To meet the growing demand for the oil , huge areas of tropical rainforest have been cleared in order to make room for palm oil plantations . As a result , large areas rich in biodiversity have been destroyed resulting in the loss of habitat for many endangered animals and indigenous people . Entire communities have lost their homes , and social unrest is appearing in other communities in the aftermath of this destruction . <p> Yet where it is grown sustainably , production has a huge benefit on local communities . The farmers that use sustainable practices are able to make more money producing more oil from less land . Plus , the use of sustainable palm oil practices protect irreplaceable forests and the species in them . <p> Thankfully , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good palm oil ( grown sustainably ) and bad palm oil ( grown unsustainably ) , and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ( RSPO ) is one of the organizations working on this issue . The RSPO is a collective of palm oil producers , consumer goods manufactures , investors , banks , and environmental/social NGOs such as the World Wildlife Fund whose goal is to work towards 100% sustainable palm oil by 2020 . The RSPO has developed a set of environmental and social criteria which companies must adhere to in order to produce good or Certified Sustainable Palm Oil ( CSPO ) . This CSPO is labeled good because it ensures the least impact on the environment . More and more companies are joining and the campaign is gathering momentum . <p> What Can We Do to Help Promote Sustainable Practices ? <p> First of all we can make sure to buy only those products that are made with good ( sustainably sourced ) palm oil . Simply look for the RSPO symbol on products , your assurance that it only contains RSPO-certified sustainable palm oil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbol here . <p> We can also help influence change by making sure the brands we use know that we care about sustainable palm oil and we want them to take action !

We will talk about building muscle , about losing weight , even about mental health . But what about your bones ? No-one can deny that it 's an essential part of a healthy body , but we do n't focus on it as much as we should . What are you doing to protect your bones and why , exactly , does it matter so much that you take care of them ? <p> As we grow older , we naturally lose bone strength and density . If it gets serious enough , it progresses to osteoporosis . That condition means that our bones suffer damage a lot easier which can seriously reduce our mobility as we grow . Keeping bones dense is about nutrition and exercise . Milk is a start but calcium is n't all you need . As AlgaeCal reviews on Supplement Police will tell you , vitamin D , potassium , zinc and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only preventing them from weakening but making them denser . Just like muscles , you can work your bones out , as well . They degrade and regenerate just like muscles and weight-bearing exercises ensure that they grow stronger as they regenerate , providing you 're giving them the nutrients they need . <p> The strength of your joints is just as important as the strength of the bones themselves . Especially if you do heavy impact exercise , missing out on joint care is going to lead to a lot more damage , potentially cause premature arthritis . You need to properly stretch before you exercise to stop joint and ligament damage from becoming a lot more common in exercise . You should also think of exercises that strengthen your joints . For instance , while running can have a negative effect if you overdo it , when done right it has a serious long-term benefit . Runners have been shown to have a significantly reduced risk of osteoarthritis in their knees , for instance . <p> While weight-bearing exercises are good for your bones and not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently wear down at them is your own body weight . There are a plethora of reasons to ensure that you have a healthy BMI and reducing the load on your bones is one of the most important ones . However , losing weight by cutting calories extensively is n't always the answer . It can actually lead to bone loss if you 're reducing your intake of calcium and the other vitamins and minerals mentioned above . Instead , the healthiest way to lose weight is always by doing more exercise . That way you 're not only burning calories but you 're strengthening your bones at the same time . <p> Without giving some consideration to our bones in both our workouts and our diet , we 're going to be feeling some of the most painful effects of age a lot quicker .

@@29515228 @3215228/ <h> Elderly Parents : Be Transparent . Be Patient . Be Empathetic <p> This is one of the toughest transitions a family can ever experience , and that is because it is so alien to all involved . It is a transition that brings up challenges in every sphere imaginable , from physical challenges to mental and emotional . The roles are beginning to shift , and your parents suddenly require more care and support than a child . <p> That can be quite unbearable for both you and for them . They do n't want to lose their independence or their pride , and you do n't want to see them become helpless or dependent . Sure , it is part of the cycle of life and one that is far more attractive than the alternative . But that does n't make it any easier to cope with . <p> They are your parents , the very people that went above and beyond to care for you and protect you , but the roles have now reversed and you are going to have to help make their transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . What 's more , there are going to be decisions to make , and decisions that will require you to master the art of respecting your parents independents and wishes while also ensuring they get the best care possible , whatever that means . <p> There is a lot to think about and consider , but ultimately you will want your parents to live happy and healthy lives , and to grow old gracefully , and there is a lot you can do to encourage that . It is just a matter of knowing what and how . <h> Always Have A Loose Plan <p> We do n't mean do what you think will be best at each stage . No . We mean anticipate each stage by being transparent with your parents and ensuring you know exactly what they want , what their priorities are and what they want to do . They are the priority , and by adhering to their wants and needs you will drastically reduce the stress levels of both you and them . So , what questions should you ask to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , you should ask them where they would like to live as they get older , what activities they enjoy doing , what activities they want to enjoy doing for as long as physically possible , whether they feel confident living alone and getting about unassisted , and what their current health status is , according to a doctor , not them . <h> Importance Of Giving Them Control <p> One of the worst things about growing old is losing control and losing that feeling of independence . As such , it is imperative you include them in all decisions and get their input . Do n't tell them what to do , let them decide . That does n't mean you ca n't recommend or usher them in a certain direction , but be as transparent with your reasons as you can . This could be recommending that they get help with household chores or transportation . It could be that they require medication reminders or even go one step further and get help with purchasing their prescriptions , in which case you can find some Nationwide Prescription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help selling their home and moving closer to you or closer to their friends . It could be they plan to move to a retirement home . The point is , always include them in these tough decisions and always listen to what they want to do and their reasons for doing so . It may not seem logical to you , but it could be an absolute make or break for them . The best thing you can be is supportive , and that includes supporting their choices . If you put yourself in their shoes you will be to get a better understanding . What would you want ? Empathy is going to become one of your greatest translation tools . <h> Encourage Exercise <p> Staying active is n't just about keeping the body active , it is also about keeping the mind sharp too . Age sees a lot of things slow down , from our metabolism to our muscle strength to our mental speed . But , by keeping active , we can stave this off a bit better . It will also protect them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . Of course , the idea of running 10km a week may not sound attractive , or possible , to your mother who struggles to walk around the kitchen . But that is okay because staying active does n't have to mean strenuous activity . It can just mean tai chi or yoga . It can mean walking around the garden or swimming . All of these will do your parents a world of good , it is just a matter of encouraging them to get stuck into a light routine that they can enjoy . <h> Mental Application <p> Our mind is our most precious gift , so to start losing that can be a horrendous realisation . That is why it is so imperative you find ways to help your parents stimulate their minds . Quite simply , regular mental workouts help elderly people maintain their cognitive functions . It could be that you get your parents into playing Bridge and getting them to join a local Bridge club . It could be that you invent a new game that they can play with your children their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to use technology , even if only a little bit , enough to be able to play a tech game or learn a new language on something like Duolingo . Why not go one step further and research what local activities there are to help them remain cognitively active as well as social . That is the ultimate find . <p> There is so much that you can do for your parents to help them grow old gracefully , and make that transition as smooth as possible , but it requires patience and planning as much as anything else . It also requires a high-level of transparency , openness and empathy , all of which will be beneficial to both you and your parents . So long as you prioritise them and their wants you will be okay , and you will be able to help them through this next stage of their life , as uncomfortable and unfamiliar as it will be . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

It 's fair enough , phobias come in all shapes and sizes , yet there are ways to get over your dog fears . There really are man 's best friends and the vast majority will never mean you any type of harm whatsoever . If your family are angling for a pet , and in particular a dog , then stopping them having one because of an irrational fear can be quite mean , especially considering the joy a dog could bring . You can find some hints and tips to help you overcome your fear of dogs , known as cynophobia , and take one or two to try . <h> Get Over The Inciting Incident <p> There is always something that caused the fear . Some people may not even remember what it was , others will latch onto it every time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a particularly bad attack or bite then you need to get over it . Hopefully , the dog in question was disciplined , and if you have n't yet you should seek compensation through a professional firm like The Dixon Injury Firm . You need to realize that not all dogs are the same and that the dog in question was either abused , i 'll , or perhaps you were on guarded property . It is the same as humans , some are bad , others not . Yet it is usually the owner who forges a dogs temper . Once you have rationalized the attack and you can see why it happened it will be easier for you to get over . Getting over the incident that caused the fear is a huge first step in beating the phobia completely . <h> Seek Therapy <p> Sometimes you can only overcome a fear through the help of someone else . This is certainly the case when you ca n't remember any inciting incident that caused the initial fear to begin . Therapists can dig down and find out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear stems from nothing in particular and is inherently irrational . Having someone else analyse you and everything you can be daunting , but remember , they are professionals and are just doing a job . If it means you overcome your fear then it will be worth it in the long run . You can even unlock other mysteries that can relate to cynophobia such as bottled up anxiety . <h> Spend Time With Dogs <p> In a supervised environment of course . Spend a day at your local kennels where you with people nearby where you can watch dogs and if you feel like it get close . Start off with the smaller ones , some are not much bigger than rabbits and can be easier to get to grips with . After this , you can start with the bigger breeds . If you are too nervous to get close to all of the dogs , ask one of the attendants to bring a smaller dog out for you to meet without being surrounded by the others . <h> Go For Walks <p> At your local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It helps the dogs , the center and indeed yourself . Again , start off with the smaller dog and work your way up . You 'll see that in large they all behave in the same way and are similarly managed . The more time you spend with the dogs the more you will realize how harmless they actually are . Once you 've overcome your fear you will be full of pride . No fear is hard to surpass , however irrational it may seem to those on the outside . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Most people head down to their local DIY store and purchase wooden planks . They then cut them to the right size and create square beds for their bulbs . However , there is a greener solution you might like to consider . Old railway sleepers are not expensive to purchase , but they perform the same basic job .

Replace the belts and ensure they are turning the brushroll and the power drive rollers . Other common culprits are faults related to the brushroll itself . An accumulation of dust or trapped objects might prevent it from spinning . If you find this to be the case , remove the brushroll , clean it properly and then put it back . <p> The motor is not workingYou might encounter a situation where a vacuum fails to work entirely while everything else seems okay .

If the power reaches the motor and the commutator turns easily , there is a high chance the motor overheated and burnt . The only solution here is to replace it . <p> The unit gets very noisyVacuum cleaners should have a reasonable noise level when being used , but this might not be the case sometimes .

Vacuum cleaners are designed to move smoothly , so this issue can be caused by an accumulation of dirt on the base plate . Do n't sweat it .

If the appliance does n't  turn or stay on , there are either loose wires , open wires or fuse issues . If you come to realize this , switch off the power .

Replace any bent or broken fins , lubricate the bearings that turn the wheels and most importantly , cover any leaks.In summary , your vacuum cleaner is simple , and having some knowledge in connecting wires and assembling things might prove useful . As you can see , most of the faults revolve around the motor and any other part that spins . Most of these can be easily replaced , but regular check-ups might also save you the trouble of doing a full repair . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Some are tiny like Chihuahuas , and some are just crazy like Boxers . <p> As there is such a range of breeds to choose from you can tailor your choice of look and temperament to your home situation . If you have kids , then a breed with gentler attitude might be best . But if you need a working dog to help you on your land then try a hunter like an Irish Setter or Border Collie . <h> Down Dogs are so much work <p> One of the downsides of being a dog owner is that pooches rarely look after themselves like their kitty counterparts .

They are perfect for people that are feeling lonely or spend long swaths of time on their own .

This allows them to keep them in one of the dog urns for ashes that are now available . So they can be respected and remember in the home of their family . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

@@29515255 @3215255/ <h> 5 Eco-Friendly Ways to Cut Down on Waste <p> Waste is a problem for any home . It seems people do n't know how to stop making a mess . If you try to live an eco-friendly life , it can be hard seeing your home contribute to this . Over your whole life , you 've probably added to the piles of garbage resting on landfills right now . Enough is enough though . It 's time to cut down on waste . Here 's 5 eco-friendly ways you can do that . <p> Buy Better PackagingA lot of waste comes from packaging . To avoid creating this kind of waste you need to pay attention to the packaging of the products you buy . Try always to get a product that has biodegradable packaging or can be recycled . You ca n't stop buying things altogether , but you can at least try to cut down on the amount of unusable waste your home produces . Be sure to check the box or plastic packaging any of your purchases comes in . <p> Buy Recycled FurnitureIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can help cut down on waste . The waste may not be from your home exactly , but a lot of wood and materials are wasted in the creation of new furniture . To help save the trees , do n't buy new furniture . <p> Better yet , try to recycle your old furniture yourself and keep the chain of recycling going . If you ca n't find an immediate buyer , just put the old furniture in public storage for the time being . You can get it out again when you have an interested buyer . <p> CompostingHousehold food waste is enormous . Even if you finish everything in the fridge before you buy more or never leave an uneaten meal . We create so much food waste and throw it all away when we could be using it for the purposes of composting in our gardens . Compost helps feed plants . It makes the soil extra fertile . If you want to grow flowers or other plants in your garden , you 'll need it to keep them well nourished . Get a composting bin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Grow Your OwnAs an additional point to the last one , how about trying to grow your food instead of buying it ? No need to worry about it not being fresh then . Not to mention you 'll never have to worry about the packaging again either . You ca n't grow everything in your garden , but you can get a selection of seasonal vegetables growing . At least during the spring and summer you should be able to feed yourself from the contents of your garden alone . <p> Use Less ElectricityYes , you can waste electricity too . In fact , this might be the most harmful waste to the environment out there . If you leave a light on in an empty room , you use a lot more electricity . That electricity is likely made through the burning of fossil fuels . Not only does the smoke directly pollute our environment , but the digging for coal and oil damages our countryside beyond repair and turns it into a wasteland . Never use more electricity than you need to . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

At first , everyone was excited about this new sweetener that could replace the sugar in food . But then , it became known that aspartame has been linked to symptoms including ( but not limited to ) headaches , dizziness , mood change , vomiting/nausea , and even a change in heart rate . Who wants to eat that ? <p> Recently I had the opportunity to try a gum that is both sugar-free and aspartame-free .

The list of positive facts goes on and on , you can learn more HERE . <p> P++r is a fitting name for this gum as not only is it aspartame-free , but it is also vegan , gluten-free , non-gmo , nut-free , diabetic friendly and dairy free ! It is completely safe for pregnant moms and children of any age . <p> I have to be honest here and say that I was expecting it to taste like all sugar-free gums taste , with that flat , fake-sweet taste that remains in your mouth long after the gum is gone . I was expecting it to lose all flavor after about 25 chews , too .

I love that it is so , well , pure , without any chemicals , gluten or other yucky ingredients . And the fact that it is actually helpful toward your teeth , well that is a great bonus ! I definitely recommend P++r Gum ! <p> P++r Gum is available in four yummy flavors : Spearmint , Peppermint , Wintergreen and Pomegranate Mint . You can find it both online and off .

@@29515258 @3215258/ <h> Comparing Pets : Which Is The Best Pet For Your Family ? <p> Getting a pet is a big step for a lot of families .

To help you make this important decision , there is a brief run down of the most popular family pets below . Hopefully comparing pets will make your decision easier . <h> Cats <p> A feline friend can make a wonderful family pet . They can be affectionate and often enjoy interacting with children and adults alike . They work particularly well for busy families that do n't  spend a lot of time at home . This is because with the installation of a cat flap they can have the autonomy to decide to go out alone . <p> However , it is important that you consider the effects that getting a cat can have in your family before you make the decision to get one . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can get fleas or worms . Which can be carried into the house and transferred to humans . It is also possible that your cat might not have the best temperament , and could scratch or bite young children if they are not very careful around them . <h> Dogs <p> Another popular family pet is a dog . Dogs make wonderful pets because they are brilliant companions , and enjoy attention from all family members . They can also be trained to do and not do certain things so they can be a bit easier to keep under control than their feline counterparts . <p> One of the biggest problems you can have when getting a pet dog , however , is deciding which sort of breed to go for . There are so many that it can become very confusing . Happily , there are websites like Puppies Online , chocked full of information about particular breeds . So you can do your research , and find the one that will suit your home and family the best . <p> Fish <p> If a cat or dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then how about an aquatic animal instead , like a fish ?

I received a free test and lab results , but the experience and opinions are my own ! <p> Have you ever wanted to learn more about your family , your ancestry , and what makes you uniquely YOU ? Having lost many relatives on my fathers side in the Holocaust , and not knowing very much about my mothers side of the family , I 've always been interested in learning more . Not just about my ancestry , but also where many of my traits came from , as well as anything I might possibly pass on to my children . <p> You may remember back in November I shared that I had received a DNA test kit from 23andme as part of my BabbleBoxx . I could n't wait to take the test , send it in and receive my 65+ online reports about my genetics ! Well guess what ? <p> My results are in ! <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit about 23andme and the DNA test kit . <p> The 23andMe DNA kits come with everything you need to easily collect your DNA sample and mail it back to them . Inside the kit is a vial that you fill with your saliva . While this wasnt hard , it did take me a few minutes to fill it up to the line . Once it was filled , and before I mailed my test , I registered it kit by creating an account on the 23andme website and telling them the numbers on my box . From there all that was left to do was to mail the kit back ( postage is prepaid ) and wait for my 65+ reports . <p> Waiting did n't  take long . In just a few weeks I received an email letting me know my results were ready ! When I logged in to see my reports , I was amazed ! There are tons of personalized reports in four key areas : Ancestry Reports , Wellness Reports , Traits Reports and Carrier Reports . It is so much fun going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learning new things ! <p> Originally I was most interested in learning about my ancestry composition . While I knew that my fathers parents came from Poland , I 've never been very clear about my mothers side . I know some of her family came from Ireland , but that 's about it . As it turns out I am 99.3% European including some Eastern European as well as British , Irish , French , German and a mix of other regions . The remaining tiny percentage is a smidgen Sub-Saharan African and a tad East Asian and Native American ! <p> I was also very intrigued by my other reports . There were dozens of wellness and carrier reports , and it was neat to see how my DNA determines my unique traits such as taste and smell , facial features , hair and so much more . Here are some fun facts from my reports that were dead on ! <p> One report showed that I am more likely to have dark hair that is wavy or curly as opposed to straight . Yep ! <p> Another showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am ! In fact , I am such a light sleeper that I have a hard time getting a full nights sleep because the smallest noise will wake me up . It also said I 'm likely not to move much when I am asleep , which is also true . My husband laughs at me because I rarely move from the position I am in once I fall asleep . <p> I am also likely to consume more caffeine than average . Yep . One of my biggest weaknesses is the amount of Cokes I drink . <p> I am more likely to prefer sweet snacks over salty . Again , this one is spot on . I have an incurable sweet tooth ! <p> I am likely tolerant of lactose . Love dairy ! <p> My DNA also says that I am more likely to have freckles . Yes , all over my arms and shoulders ! <p> It was a such a fun and interesting experience to find out everything I learned from my DNA . Who knew that a little bit of spit could reveal so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 23andme.com is also packed full of information , tutorials , forums and more . They even have a DNA Relatives section where you can find and connect with genetic relatives to learn about relationships , shared ancestors and family history ! It was so neat to discover a list of possible relatives and their relationship to me ! And 23andMe also offers a service where your family members can send in their DNA samples for testing and you can link them all together as a family . This can really help you get an even more complete picture of your family genetics ! <p> I loved seeing the picture my DNA painted of me , and I would highly recommend doing it for yourself and even your family ! Order your DNA test kit from 23andMe and find out what makes you uniquely you ! 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176 
@@29515263 @3215263/ <h> Five Silly Quilting Mistakes You Need To Avoid <p> Whether you are new to quilting or an old hand , there is always something to learn in this wonderful craft activity . Check out my guide below to ensure you 're not making silly mistakes that can cause you unnecessary frustration and problems . <p> Do n't make the mistake of thinking that you have to sew by hand if you have want to . People that are new to the craft of quilting , often do n't  realize that they can use a machine . Machine quilting is very popular now , and can make it much easier to complete projects in a reasonable amount of time . <p> When quilting its very easy to get carried away and spend loads of money on material . This can be a problem as its bulky to store and hard keep tidy . Many people make the mistake of buying a whole bolt of fabric they like . When in reality they do n't  need nearly as much to complete their quilting project . The thing with quilting is you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same design . That why its much better to buy mixed bundles of precuts . These come in a variety of sizes known as fat quarters , fat eighths , jelly rolls , and layer cakes . So no matter the size of your design , you 'll be able to find something that fits . <p> Using your bare hands <p> Another big problem quilters come across is getting marks on the quilt as they are making it . Nobody wants to give a gift , which has grubby prints all over it from the oil on your hands . A good way to avoid this is to use quilting gloves . They are covered in lots of tiny rubberized dots , a bit like a slipper sock , so it makes it really easy to keep hold of your quilt while you are sewing it too . <p> Not keeping to the standard size <p> When you decide to make a quilt as a gift or as an addition to your home , you will need to pick the right size . Make sure to stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet . Keeping to the standard sizing can also help you work out how many pre-cut packs you will need to use . For more information on how many squares you can get out of a fat quarter see here . <p> While relieved to find out that they can use their home sewing machine for the job , many quilters are n't  aware that they need to change the foot . Feeder feet are used in quilting to make sure that the fabric does n't get bunched up on the backside of the quilt , as you pass it through the machine . Its also important to turn the speed of your machine down as it makes it much easier to handle the quilt as it goes through . Do n't  forget to use a heavier gauge needle as well , as it will be easy to work through the thick layers of fabric . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

This is your opportunity to have a fresh start in a new area and make some brilliant life changes . Revolutionizing your life in this way is a massive step forward , and takes a fair amount of effort to execute correctly . It can be so easy to want to make it through the process with as little stress as possible that we forget to make the necessary checks on the new home we 're hoping to occupy . <p> Even if you 've found and fallen in love with your dream house , before you move in it is instructive to take a few necessary checks of the general condition and state the house is currently in . If you notice there 's a fair amount of work to be done , that does n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just means that you might have to allocate additional budgeting funds to get everything fixed . Once you do , your dream home could be twice as beautiful as you initially expected . <p> However , you also want to prioritize the safety of your family . Assessing whether the house is in a livable state should be your first task before you move yourself or your family in . Thankfully , the following and very handy 11-point guide will help you check off the most important things to consider when you 're just about to sign off on that purchase . <p> It will also give you a strong idea of what needs sorting out if you do decide to move in . Without further ado : <p> Locks <p> If you 've moved into the property , you immediately want to change all of the locks . It sounds sad to even mention , but you can never be sure who has a second key lying around from the previous tenancy , and you want to keep your family secure . Taking an afternoon to hire a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors , and additional security points is well worth the cost . You might even find areas where security can be improved , and that 's always a positive result . <p> Be sure to cut additional keys after the locks have been installed , and hand them to a close family member . Avoid placing second sets of keys in obvious locations outside such as under the welcome mat , under plant pots or in an outhouse . These are the first places a prospective thief will look . Keeping the secondary keys with a close relative will also allow you to avoid the need to re-hire a locksmith professional , saving you money long term . <p> Damp <p> Upon your inspection of the property , be sure to check for any damp , otherwise known as moisture spots . This will show in the ceiling or walls as a dark , bubbly stain . Be extra vigilant about this when being shown around a property by a letting agent , because they 'll usually do their best to try and avert your eyes away from the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see . Large damp spots , especially in multiple rooms signify an issue with the structural insulation of the property and can weaken the integrity of the building over time . If you catch it in its early days , it 's not too late to rectify . Hire a roofing or construction professional and get them to look at it and give you a quote . There might be a chance they can pre-emptively fix the problem , giving you peace of mind for when you move in . <p> Carpets <p> Even if the last tenant of the property was the cleanest it was possible for a human being to be , there 's guaranteed to be a stain on the carpeting somewhere . Giving the carpets a good , honest deep-clean will allow you to feel happy with the hygienic standards in the property . This is important if you have a baby too because you 'll feel much happier letting them crawl on a carpet that 's recently been washed . <p> Valves <p> The mains water valve is there to help stop any disastrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how to operate it , if you need any special tools or not , and also make sure you have easy access to it in an emergency . It might mean the difference between a destroyed kitchen/bathroom or not . Taking a moment to assess the safety contingencies of your future home is one of the most important things you can do , and being able to switch off the plumbing in a hurry is no different . <p> Circuit Breakers <p> As with the mains water valve , you want to locate and understand how to operate your circuit breaker box . If there 's an electrical fire , you need to know where to kill the power in your house . If the switches are n't labeled , now is the time . If the breaker box is high up on a wall , or otherwise difficult to reach , make sure you keep a step ladder nearby to promote ease of access in an emergency . <p> Smoke Detectors <p> No matter if all of the smoke detectors in the house are operating perfectly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure they 're doing fine . Make sure there is one in every hallway , one in the kitchen and other large living spaces . It 's better to have too many smoke alarms than too little . Also make sure your house features a carbon monoxide alarm , as this will help you ensure your family 's safety were the worst to happen . <p> Deck/Patio <p> Ensuring the decking/patio outside is free from any trip hazards and loose panels can help prevent any nasty accidents from occurring during your home-welcoming summer BBQ . Clearing any debris from the garden might take a couple of days to do , but it 's worth it . Closely inspect the garden for any sharp or foreign objects that might provoke injury . As a general rule , if you 'd be happy to walk in your garden bare-footed , it 's probably safe . Keeping the grass trimmed and the flower beds maintained will also allow you to see any nasty objects that might be lurking in the undergrowth . If you have children , be sure your watchful eye is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injure themselves on accidentally , so be sure even the most curious child would have difficulty doing so . <p> Roofing <p> Your roofing setup is arguably one of the more important and necessary upkeep requirements you can invest time into . Hiring professional roofing residential services to identify issues in your shingling , insulation , or simply helping you construct a new , better roof for potential solar panel support will go a long way . If the roof is in a state of disrepair before you purchase the property , getting it sorted now will help you prevent any nasty structural accidents or huge fees later down the line . For the most part , if you can afford a new house , you 'll be able to budget for a decent roof . It 's vital that you do . <p> Drainage <p> Keep an eye on the drainage systems . Figure out how they run and where they run to . Upgrading your roof will help you install new drainage systems if you summarize the current setup is n't up to par . Generally , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any damage or holes , and leading with a slight downslope into the larger drainage holes at select points around the property . If this is n't the case , excess rainwater can build up and prove to be a burden on your roofing , causing leaks and other preventable issues . <p> Trees <p> If you 're lucky enough to have purchased a property with large gardens , taking some time to assess your tree health is time well used . Making sure they 're free from rot and infestation will allow you to identify if a tree needs maintenance , or needs chopping down entirely . Also , even if the tree is in perfect health , be sure that the roots are n't intercepting the structural integrity of the foundations in your property . Be sure that the growth directions are n't impeding or touching any power lines . Trees grow slowly , so this might seem like an issue you can put off for the time being if you do identify an issue . This is unwise . Be sure to keep this as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Garage <p> If your property comes with a garage , making sure it 's free from debris and stored items of the last tenancy will allow you to utilize the space effectively . Make sure that the structural integrity of the outbuilding is still fine before you park your car in it . Make sure that the insulation is great , the roofing is solid , and the drainage system is correct to help prevent any of the nasty issues listed above from affecting your car , or the people in it . Make sure there are no pet infestations , and if there are take the necessary measures to remove them . <p> When purchasing the right house , sometimes a little repair is worth it . If you 'd like your property to have character , often you have to renew an older structure to best function with the living requirements of the modern age . You might just fall in love with the place more than you were expecting to . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Each box comes with the following : <p> easy-to-follow instructions <p> disposable gloves <p> a bottle of color optimizing creme <p> a bottle of color gel <p> a tube of Color and Shine Conditioner <p> Before beginning I do highly recommend wearing old clothes and using an old towel that you wo n't mind if it gets stained . I have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after shampooing to use the color .

Let stand for 2 to 3 minutes . <p> Rinse and you are done ! <p> BEFORE AFTER **Keep in mind , the conditioner that is included acts as a UV filter and adds Vitamin E to help lock in shine and color .

Though the Aborigines have been using it in their medications for centuries , it has not been until the last decade that its healing benefits have caught on across the world . <p> Tea tree oils effectiveness is owed to its Big Three antimicrobial properties . First of all , it acts as an anti-fungal to get rid of basic fungal infections . Secondly , it has anti-viral properties to help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties include its work as an anti-bacterial , which kills bacteria and prevents it from growing . It can be used to treat many ailments such as skin infections , rashes , athletes foot , dandruff , cuts , minor burns , insect bites and more . Yet before we get into some of its many uses , I want to note that tea tree oil should never be ingested or used inside the mouth . If ingested it can be quite toxic causing all sorts of issues ranging from confusion to coma . It should also never be used on babies younger than 6 months , nor left where pets can get into it particularly cats . If you have sensitive skin , you may find that it is too harsh to use , unless you use it in diluted form . <p> Tea Tree Oil can be used at full strength , or it can be dissolved/diluted in water or a carrier oil such as almond oil or jojoba oil . When used to treat skin infections and other skin conditions , it can be applied directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colds and other respiratory illnesses , it can be added to a vaporizer so that the mist can be inhaled . Drops of the oil can also be added to bath water . You can even find it in all sorts of products now including deodorants , shampoos , soaps , antibiotic first aid creams and even household cleaning products . <p> Relieves asthma or other breathing conditions when a few drops are added to a humidifier . Can also add 5 " 10 drops to 1 ounce of carrier oil , and massage into chest and throat 2 " 3 times daily . <p> Works as an antiseptic on small cuts . After cleaning the area well , apply a few drops of the oil directly . If a bandage is needed , allow a few drops of the oil to penetrate a cotton ball , then lay it face down on the wound and cover with a bandage . <p> Treats acne : dilute a few drops of tea tree oil with 20 to 40 drops of witch hazel , and apply to skin once or twice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head lice : add a small amount to shampoo . <p> Removes ticks ; just add a few drops of undiluted oil to the skin , and the tiny bugs will usually unlatch . <p> Freshens laundry : add a few drops in your washing machine to scent your clothes . Also , if you forgot to put the clothes in the dryer , run again with tea tree oil to remove mildew . You can even scent wool dryer balls with tea tree oil . <p> Cleans dishes : add a few drops to dishwasher dispenser , then fill with a green dishwashing soap . <p> When purchasing tea tree oil , as with any essential oil , you want to make sure you are buying it in its purest form from a reputable company . Many companies will add other ingredients in order to cut costs , increase shelf life , or enhance the oils aroma . These additives can reduce the effectiveness of the oil , and in some cases could even be harmful . The oil should also be in a dark-colored , airtight bottle which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way .

Every time I go into my favorite store , I see about five or six versions of the same tool with each brand claiming that theirs is better than the other . However , to me , they all look the same after all , there is only so much one can do to a spatula to make it stand out from the rest ! Or so I thought until I received a package from Handy Home Products full of items belonging to The SKrAPr Family of products . <p> Every item in the SKrAPr product family was designed with one goal in mind : to take some common kitchen tools and make them better in order to help make your life easier . While the majority of products are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home as well . All of their products are made from unique materials that are dishwasher safe , heat-resistant , and also resistant to bacteria , mold and mildew . Many are free from phthalates and parabens , and all are recyclable . The entire line originated with one tool that you may have heard of before called The SKrAPr . <p> The SKrAPr <p> The SKrAPr is designed to help you with the toughest clean-up tasks without the use of harsh and abrasive chemicals . Made from a patented resin , The SKrAPr does not promote mildew or bacteria growth , and it safely cleans all smooth surfaces without scratching or marking . It will remove ice , paint , caked on food and dirt from almost any smooth surface . Safely use it on your glass-top stove , hard-anodized pans , le Crueset pots and pans , granite and marble counters , griddles , cookie sheets , hardwood floors , tile floors and many other smooth surfaces through out your home ! <p> I have used it on so many different things its hard to list them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used it for include removing spilled candle wax from a table , scraping baked-on foods from glass baking pans and aluminum baking sheets , and removing a sticker someone had put on one of our windows in our apartment . Yet the one that impressed me the most was when I used it to remove some type of stain that was caused by water from an indoor fountain I used to keep on a glass-topped end table . I had tried countless cleaners and tools to remove that white film , and finally I was able to remove it using the SKrAPr ! It literally has worked wonders on things I would either spend half an hour on scrubbing or giving up on . I sure wish I 'd had this for my car this past winter with all that snow ! <p> Included in the package is a mini-SKrAPr that fits perfectly on your key ring for those winter days when frost is on your car windows . Clean it off using the mini or the full-sized SKrAPr without worrying about scratching the windshield . <p> The Skrapr SPrEADr <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smoothly and effortlessly ! It safely slices and spread everything from icing to jams and jellies . Made from a FDA approved resin , the SPrEADr is very flexible , able to cut soft breads , and has a long enough blade that you can easily reach that small amount of jelly left in the bottom of the jar ! It is available with both a smooth and serrated edge , and has many uses including frosting cakes , icing cupcakes , spreading all types of spreads and condiments , slicing soft breads and cheeses and even sending in your childs lunch as a safe alternative to a knife ! <p> I love using mine for icing cakes , buttering bread , spreading cream cheese , applying mayo , catsup and other condiments and much more . Its flexible blade makes spreading so much easier than using a utensil that does n't  give at all . And its great that it can also be used as a knife for slicing cakes , pies , breads and other soft foods . It comes in several bright , cheerful colors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who like to help in the kitchen , the SPrEADr is much safer for them to use in place of a knife or other sharp utensil ! <p> The Skrapr GrILLr <p> The GrILLr is a revolutionary tool created specifically for cleaning grills . Made from a patent pending resin , it has a cutlery-grade stainless steel blade that has been molded into the tool for maximum strength and durability . The blade has also been designed with unique chisel-points and arcs so that it will fit all grill shapes and sizes . It makes cleaning your grill much less of a chore ! <p> Last summer I reviewed the unique Coleman Fold-n-Go Charcoal Grill that works perfectly for us since we live in an apartment . The grates of this grill are a different shape and size from the skinny round bars you see with your typical grill , and because of this , the only way to clean them has been to use soap and water . Needless to say this is a time-consuming , sweat-producing task , until now . Thanks to The GrILLr and its unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and easily ! Its ergonomic handle is actually comfortable in your hand while you are using it , plus I love that it is heat-resistant , anti-bacterial and dishwasher safe ! <p> The Skrapr SKOOPr <p> The SKOOPr is designed to scoop ice cream effectively and easily the other typical scoopers . With its ergonomically flat side edge and claw nose it removes ice cream quickly and easily from containers of any shape . The material it is made from is mildew resistant and dishwasher safe . Since it is available in many bright colors , it is great for using at parties , too ! <p> Opening a fresh container of ice cream and getting that first scoop usually calls for a pretty good amount of force , especially if it is still hard . The SKOOPrs claw-like nose makes it much , much easier to get that first scoop . Plus , its flat side edge makes getting that last little bit of ice cream from the corners and sides a cinch , too . In fact , it makes scooping ice cream so easy , a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of its ease of use , I love the fact that I am able to make picture-perfect scoops of ice cream using The SKOOPr ! <p> The package also came with the miniature SKOOPr Jr . for tiny hands to help ! The SKOOPr Jr . basically resembles a spoon , but has a slightly deeper bowl perfect for eating bites of ice cream while Mom or Dad scoops ! <p> The Skrapr CUrV <p> One of the newer members of the family , The CUrV is the modern-day answer to those old , worn out , moldy wooden spoons , the silicone spatulas with the tops that come off and the metal spoons that scrape your pots and get too hot to the touch . Made from a high-impact resin , The CUrv is dishwasher safe , heat-resistant , and resistant to bacteria , mildew and mold . Its surface and blade design is ideal for use with sauces , stir frys , mixes and batters . Plus it is completely safe to use with all non-stick pots and pans , le Crueset , ceramic and aluminum bowls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool in place of so many others ! Since space is already tight , being able to replace my old spatulas , wooden and metal spoons has opened up a lot of much-needed space in my drawers ! The unique , non-stick coating on The CUrv not only protects against bacteria and mildew , but it also completely eliminates the transference of flavor when I use it for cooking multiple types of food a simple rinse under the faucet and its ready to use again ! I also like that it has such a thick , ergonomic handle which makes it easy to keep a good grip , yet it is comfortable , too . Plus the very tip of it is flexible so it works great for scraping sauce and food off the sides of pots and pans during cooking . <p> The CUrV also came with another product known as The rASP . This small , hand-held tool has raised points on its surface which makes it perfect for mincing garlic , ginger and other similar herbs and foods . The handle is designed to promote an easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe , heat-resistant material that is also bacteria-and-mildew resistant . <p> The Skrapr BrUSHr <p> Say goodbye to those nylon brushes which stain easily and breed bacteria and mildew , and say hello to the ultimate marinating and basting tool , The BrUSHr ! Made of a dishwasher safe , heat-resistant material , The BrUSHr has a removable , Flexible Bristle Head which makes cleaning much easier . It is BPA-free , and contains no plastics , phthalates or Bisphenol A. Its unique bristles also rinse clean incredibly fast and easy so you can marinate different foods without worrying about flavor transfer . <p> I love The BrUSHr so much more than the typical brushes I used to use . Not only does it work better , but it is so much cleaner and more sanitary ! The handle is nice and thick for a comfortable , secure grip , and the three rows of bristles pick up plenty of sauce or marinade with each dip . And since it is heat-resistant , I am not concerned with it melting when around the grill ( I do n't  advise putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold . When it comes time to clean , I can simply remove the head from the handle , place both in the dishwasher and that is it ! Two bristles heads and one handle are included in the package . <p> The Skrapr GLOWr <p> The GLOWr is one of the latest in The SKrAPr product line . Designed for use as a glowing , visual boundary marking system , these small discs can be used to outline areas in extremely dark nighttime conditions . The GLOWr Wayfinding Illumination Discs are a green alternative to expensive electrical lighting and those ineffective reflectors . No batteries or bulbs are needed , and you can safely illuminate your driveways , sidewalk or other areas for up to 24 hours at a time , every time ! <p> A few weeks ago , The GLOWrs really came in handy when our power went out due to that crazy line of storms that came through .

@@29515285 @3215285/ <h> How Do I Know That My Childs Shampoo Is Non-Toxic <h> Make sure your childs shampoo is non-toxic <p> These days , our bath and cosmetic products frequently contain any number of substances that really are n't  very good for our health . Even things made for children , like mild shampoo or kids bodywash products can have ingredients you should avoid . <p> To make sure your childs shampoo is non-toxic , you will have to start reading labels . Unfortunately , there is no single marker or label that will give you the entire picture . Terms like " mild " , " natural " or " green " are all just marketing ideas that do n't  have any concrete meaning . You need to actually read the ingredients , and try to avoid some of these toxins : <h> Artificial Fragrances <p> These can be tough to identify because there is no single chemical we can list for you . Overall all , this group of compounds can be disruptive to hormone pathways and some are irritating to delicate skin . Stick with shampoos and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fragrance . Labels will usually say " no artificial fragrances " , so look for that . <h> Parabens <p> This group of chemicals is used as preservatives , and is in all kinds of soaps and cosmetics . They have been found to possibly disruptive to the body , and can have toxic effects on numerous systems . Generally referred to as " parabens " , they go by a number of names such as butylparaben , ethylparaben or propylparaben . <h> Sodium Laureth Sulfate <p> There are a few slight variations to this chemical name and they all should be avoided in your kids bath products . As an ingredient , it is a surfactant that helps the product make lather , foam and bubbles . This is a very likely compound in childrens products because they do love their bubbles . Do your best to avoid it though , even if you have to sacrifice a little extra lather . The problem is n't so much the compound itself , but that it can produce 1,4-dioxane during manufacture and that has been identified as a carcinogen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive skin . <h> Triclosan <p> Though you 're more likely to find this in soaps and wipes rather than shampoo , you should be on the look-out for triclosan . Its the most common chemical used in the " anti-bacterial " range of products that seem to be everywhere these days . Its possibly a carcinogen , a hormone disruptor and is frankly unnecessary . If you want your child to have a well-developed immune system , they cant constantly be protected from germs . You need things to be a little dirty . <h> Mineral Oil <p> Probably not in shampoo specifically , but mineral oil is still found in a number of lotions and other body products that you should be aware of . It sounds harmless compared to the fancy names of the other chemicals and its one that we are generally already familiar with .

Hot , long , sunny days , the kids are out of school , lots of fun outdoor activities such as camping , playing in the backyard , grilling out , swimming and more . But with the increase in outdoor activities comes an increase in bug bites , poison oak , ivy and sumac and cuts and scrapes . So for parents , summertime also means time to stock up on first aid products . <p> Recently , the makers of the popular , over-the-counter allergy relief medication , Allegra , expanded their product line to include two new topical anti-itch creams . I was sent both of these creams for review , and was impressed with how well they work . <p> The two formulas include Allegra Anti-Itch Cooling Relief Cream and Allegra Anti-Itch Intensive Relief Cream , both of which are designed to alleviate itching and pain caused by insect bites , minor skin irritations , sunburn , rashes due to poison oak , ivy and sumac , and minor cuts and scrapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief from chapped or cracked skin . <p> Itchy skin is usually triggered by a chemical in a persons body called histamine . The Allegra Anti-Itch Relief creams work in two ways . First , by acting as an antihistamine , getting beneath the surface of the skin to stop the itch at the source . Second , they contain all-day moisturizers and Vitamins A , C and E which help to soothe and protect the skin while it gets back to normal after scratching . <p> We have used both creams several times for everything from minor scrapes to mosquito bites , and they are living up to their name . When my husband and I got eaten alive by mosquitos while grilling out the other night , we immediately applied the Intensive Relief to each bite and within seconds the itch was gone . A few weeks ago , my husband was cleaning gutters on the roof and got a sunburn on his neck and shoulders . The Cooling Relief cream took the burn out , and once he started to peel , it helped with the dryness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent addition to our medicine cabinet , and I highly recommend it to anyone who spends time outside and suffers from itchy , irritated skin due to a variety of causes ! <p> Allegra Anti-Itch Relief creams can be found at groceries , drug stores and mass merchandisers across the country .

Whether looking for Madison , NH Home Security or a security system for another location , most security companies will provide you with eco-friendly , energy-efficient options .

Making the switch from electric-powered lights to light up the exterior of your home to solar-powered lights can save you up to 15 percent on your next electric bill . Solar powered lights automatically turn on and off based on the amount of sunlight present , and cost next to nothing to stay on overnight . <p> For interior lights , switch your old incandescent light bulbs for energy-efficient light bulbs . In many areas incandescent light bulbs are no longer being sold , for they are harmful to the environment as well as extremely energy draining . Compact fluorescent lights are more cost-efficient , eco-friendly , and just as attractive as incandescent . <p> Thermostats and Water Heater <p> Older homes generally have older , if not original , thermostats and water heaters .

A great feature , this option allows you to automatically save money and energy by keeping the house warmer while you are gone , and cooler while you are there to enjoy it . <p> Energy Efficient Windows <p> New windows help to keep your home more comfortable without using your air conditioner or heater as often . When windows wear out , they tend to allow outside air in , making the home drafty and uncomfortable . Additionally , older windows are single-paned versus new double-paned windows . Double-paned windows are more resistant to weather temperature , as well as safer , for it more difficult to break into a double-paned window . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

So what did I wind up selecting ? <p> Tools in My Drawer <p> SLICING AND DICING have you ever tried to cut with a dull knife ? It does n't  work very well which is why every kitchen needs a good set of sharp knives . every kitchen needs cutting tools , from knives to cut , slice , mince and dice , to graters for shredding.1.Paring Knife a paring knife is vital to any knife collection , and comes in different styles . This particular one is a cooks knife style . I choose it because its small size gives me more control than a larger knife , which makes it perfect for doing intricate work such as mincing garlic or peeling an apple . I also like its soft , round handle which gives me a good grip and better control.2.4.5 ? Serrated Edge Utility Knife a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? utility knife with a serrated edge because it can be used for cutting a wide variety of foods from sandwich meats to larger vegetables , for which other knives are either too big or too small . Its serrated edge works great for cutting soft foods with a hard crust such as breads and tomatoes . 3.6 ? Fine Edge Cooks Knife another of my favorites , my knife collection is just not complete without a Cooks knife . I like this particular knife as it is a smaller version of the chef knife , which for my small hands , gives me better control . It can alsobe used for practically anything from chopping to slicing to mincing due to the shape of the blade.4.7 ? Santoku Knife another knife-collection staple , the Santoku is my personal favorite . It is excellent for chopping fruits and vegetables and slicing meat , and its fine edge makes nice , clean slices . I also like that its wide blade works great for scooping sliced food into bowls or onto a plate . Plus , it has a curved blade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I chose this particular one because it has a Granton edge those little hollowed out grooves on both sides of the blade . This type blade works great for getting thin , even cuts of meat without tearing or shredding . It also reduces the chance of food sticking to the knife . I also like its soft , round handle which gives me a good grip and better control.5.Folding Grater I chose this grater first of all because of its unique folding design.This grater takes up a lot less room than my old box grater . I also like that it has a handle on the top so you can hold it firm with one hand , while grating the food on the other . Graters are essential because they can be used for so may things from thin , slices of carrot to fresh grated herbs ! <p> STIRRING AND SERVING there 's not much you can cook without the need for stirring , transferring and serving.6.Silicone Whisk the whisk is an incredibly handy tools to have in your kitchen drawer . It is ideal for blending ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say this because one of its primary uses is to incorporating air into your mixture ( eg : whisking eggs makes them light and fluffy ) . It also works great for blending ingredients ( wet or dry ) until the have a very smooth consistency . Plus , nothing sticks to it ! 7.12.5 ? Nylon Slotted Spoon a slotted spoon is another major necessity for any kitchen . How else can you stir and serve foods that are in liquids and need to be strained off before serving ? This particular one I chose for its extra wide handle for better grip and control , and for its longer length perfect for reaching into deep pots . The fact that it is nylon keeps my cookware safe from scratches , and the stainless steel stem adds durability.8.12.5 ? Nylon Basting Spoon the second most-important spoon in any kitchen , this basting spoon is ideal for stirring sauces , soups and more . It also works great for mixing salads and stir fry , for adding juices on top of meats ( basting ) , and for transferring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nylon material is safe for my pots and pans , the wide handle provides a better , more comfortable grip , and the stainless stem adds durability.9.Large Silicone Flex Turner I chose this turner spatula mainly for its large size and the fact that it is made of silicon . It works great for turning over foods such as eggs , pancakes and tortillas . I do n't  have to struggle to keep the foods on it like I do with smaller sized turners . Since it is made of silicon , it is heat-resistant and gentle on my cookware.10.Straight Tip Scissor Tongs these tongs are exactly what any cook needs for handling , lifting , transferring and serving a wide variety of foods regardless of shape , size or weight . I personally prefer these type tongs to the straight edge ones because I feel like they get a better grip on the food , and give me better control.11.Silicone Edge Spatula 2 pack I love these two spatulas . I chose them because first of all they are made of silicone and wont scratch my cookware . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warp , crack or chip . Secondly , they are an essential tool when it comes to spreading , lifting and mixing . This pack came with 2 sizes : the larger one which is ideal for scraping down the sides of bowls and folding ( eg : blueberries into batter ) . The smaller one which works great for getting the ingredients out of small cans such as tomato paste ! <p> MEASURING AND MORE12.Double Sided Flip Measuring Cups I choose these measuring cups for two reasons : their design and their ability to fit perfectly in my tiny kitchen drawers . This set of two unique flip measuring cups are actually four cups in all including 1 cup , 1/2 cup , 1/4 cup and 1/3 cup sizes . You switch sizes by flipping them inside out . They work great for measuring both liquids and solids . They also come with a connector ring that is made of a durable plastic that wo n't crack , bend or break.13.Collapsible Funnel every kitchen needs a funnel . You never know when you are going to need to refill your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small opening or filter the oil from a deep fryer . This particular funnel fits in my kitchen drawer perfectly because it collapses to 1/4 its size . I am not sure of the material , but it seems very durable . I also like how it has a lip on the handle which gives me a better grip and better control . Its bright color makes it fun , too ! 14.5 Piece Prep Bowls this set of five prep bowls are definitely a must-have for any cook ! I chose these to help make my food prep go faster . I use them to hold the individual ingredients needed for a recipe spices , an egg , cheese , whatever the recipe calls for . It is much easier than having to search out the ingredient , then measure it out then add it to the pot . Instead , I can just grab the bowl and toss it in ! The fact that they double as measuring cups with two measurements per bowl makes things even easier ! 15 . Double Handle Colander okay so this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you have a deep drawer you are in luck ! Either way , a colander is a must for any kitchen . There are hundreds of uses from straining the oil off the meat you just browned , to washing lettuce for a salad to draining a can of peas . I like this particular one for several reasons . First of all it has a nice , deep and wide bowl so I can fit large foods in it easily . Secondly , the slits are a bit wider than most , providing quicker drainage , but not so large to where the food will fall through . I also like that it has two comfortable , no-slip handles , and it has legs so if you set it in the sink , the food is not touching the surface . The plastic it is made of is very durable , and can withstand hot liquids . <p> So did I meet the challenge of using my tools in this recipe ? <p> Yes ! I wound up using 10 of the 15 items when making this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piece Prep Bowls for keeping the cheese , minced garlic and onion in until needed.Colander for draining the oil off the browned meat and later for straining the noodles.Silicone Edge Spatula 2 Pack I used the smaller one for getting the tomato paste out of the cans , and the larger one for evenly spreading the meat sauce and cheeses when layering the lasagna.Nylon Basting Spoon for stirring the meat sauce , and spooning it into the baking dish.Straight Tip Scissor Tongs for removing the pasta noodles from the colander once the water was drained.Double Sided Flip Measuring Cups for measuring out the correct amount of cheese , water and other ingredients.Silicone Whisk for whisking together the cottage cheese , parmesan cheese and the egg.Santuko Knife for slicing the lasagna into squares.Large Silicone Flex Turner for scooping the lasagna squares out of the dish and onto a plate . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

There are a variety of different heating methods out there and no one method will be right for the same people . For a homeowner or business owner who does not own an HVAC unit , the next best way to produce the heat that they need is by using a space heater . Here are a few of the benefits of using space heaters in your home or business during the cold winter months . <p> One of the most beneficial parts of using a space heater is that you will be able to avoid the installation cost that is common with HVAC units .

@@29515305 @3215305/ <h> Using Light and Color to Bring More Light To Your Living Room <p> Other than the bedroom , the living room is the place in our home where we spend most of our time . A cozy living room should feel warm and inviting . Lighting and color usage plays an integral part in this feeling . Here are just a few ways that you can use lighting and color to brighten up your living room . <h> Add a new splash of paint to your walls <p> A new coat of paint may be all your room needs to feel bright . Old paint may be faded or stained and could give your room a dull appearance . New paint will make it feel fresh , and as a result make you feel fresh . You can also coordinate the colour to the mood that you want the room to give off . Warm colours such as yellow , beige and tan can feel more stimulating , whilst light blues , greens and greys are more relaxing . The former may be more suitable for those wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for a place of quiet downtime may prefer the latter . White meanwhile is the perfect neutral color for reflecting light . <p> Remove winter curtains <p> Thick winter curtains are ideal for the cold months , preventing heat from escaping the home . However , in summer they may make your living room feel darker , absorbing the sunlight . Use thinner summer drapes such as these Montgomery ready made curtains . These will allow in some natural light even when shut , whilst keeping your privacy . <p> Choose light colored furniture <p> Just as light walls are more likely reflect light , so is light furniture . If you have mahogany side tables , switch them out for a lighter wood such as beech or oak . If you 've got a black leather sofa , consider swapping it out for cream leather instead <p> Make use of mirrors <p> Nothing reflects light quite as well as a mirror . Place these opposite a window to allow more light into the room . Mirrors are all great devices for bringing the illusion of more space to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as chrome and glass for a similar effect . <p> Grow bright plants <p> Bright plants such as these ones from House of Plants immediately bring vibrant colour to a room . Not only do they make a room look more bright and cheerful , they 're also good for our mental health improving our concentration and memory by providing fresh oxygen into the air . <p> Introduce interior lighting <p> If finding enough natural lighting is a problem , why not introduce artificial lighting into your living room ? Floor lamps and table lamps are great for illuminating corners of room whilst using up less electricity than overhead lighting . For those that want to wire new ceiling lighting in , consider track lighting as opposed to spot lighting it can often look just as stylish and is much cheaper and easier to install . Incorporate warm white light to give more energy to a room and cold white light to give it a more relaxing feel . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

By this time we were getting full and luckily found the perfect sized meals on the Small Plates section of the menu . My husband ordered the New Zealand Petite Lamb Chops , while I went with the Sliced Filet Mignon wanting to try one of the steaks for which Flemings is known . <p> Like the rest of our order , the food arrived in just the right amount of time .

Juicy slices of perfectly cooked and seasoned filet mignon are served over a shiitake risotto , and topped with chili oil and a porcini butter drizzle . Each tender bite tasted like a little bite of heaven on earth . Flemings really managed to cook the meat to perfection , hitting that rare-medium-rare sweet-spot right on . <p> In summary , the food was impeccable and the service is second to none ! Our server was knowledgeable and friendly , and the food simply delicious !

@@29515316 @3215316/ <h> Origami Owl Living Locket A Review <p> Women love jewelry . Whether its earrings , rings , charm bracelets or necklaces , its hard to go wrong when you give a girl a piece of jewelry ! This Mothers Day , give her something a bit more unique than your typical jewelry , give her Origami Owl ! <p> While I love jewelry , too , I am not one of those people who layer it on . Instead I prefer to keep it simple with just a few pieces to compliment whatever outfit I am wearing . I also prefer to buy wear jewelry that means something to me : my engagement and wedding rings , earrings my mom gave to me , a charm bracelet that tells my story , or my latest addition , an Origami Owl Living Locket and necklace . <p> I 'm sure most of you have heard of Origami Owl , not only known for their business model , but also for their unique jewelry such as charms , bracelets and lockets . For those of you who are not familiar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background I find quite impressive ! <p> Origami Owl was created by a pre-teen girl by the name of Bella . Like many parents , Bellas wanted her to learn the value of work , so instead of offering to buy her a car on her 16th birthday , they told the then 14-year-old Bella , that if she wanted a car , shed have to buy it herself . So , with $350 and her familys support , she started selling lockets to friends and family after school . Not only were the lockets an immediate hit , but Bella was able to make her dreams come true when she purchased her very own Jeep . But that 's not all she did . She also created a business that gave thousands of people a job . Today , there are over 60,000 Independent Designers , and thousands more waiting to sign up . Pretty impressive for a 14-year-old , is n't it ? ! <h> Origami Owl Living Locket <p> The Living Locket- is the locket that started it all , and it is also the locket I choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Living Locket is a locket that you can customize with small charms that represent your story and your life . But instead of the charms attaching to the chain , they fit inside the locket ( which has a clear glass face so everyone can see the charms ) . <p> There are tons of lockets from which to choose available in a variety of shapes , sizes and materials . There are silver lockets , gold lockets , engraved lockets , etched lockets , lockets covered in Swarovski crystals , and even colored lockets . And there are even more charms , ranging from birthstones to animals , food , hobbies and more ! The Living Lockets are designed to where you can pretty much create it to look any way you want . You get to select the locket , the charms you want to add inside , the type chain you want , any dangles you may want ( these are individual charms that hang down beside the locket ) , and a plate . Plates are pieces that go inside the locket behind the charms to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , colors and designs . <h> Origami Owl Living Locket Review <p> The Living Locket I created began with the beautiful Silver Twist Living Locket with Floral Face that features floral engravings and Swarovski accent crystals . I choose not to have a plate as I wanted whatever shirt I was wearing to provide the background for the charms . I added a silver , flat oval link custom chain , and started with four simple charms including a dragonfly , a silver Chai ( Hebrew for life ) , and amethyst and blue zircon Swarovski crystal stones . Over time I plan to add a few more charms , although I like the simple look , so most likely will not fill it to capacity . <p> I was definitely not expecting the adorable packaging that my locket arrived in ! The origami box is designed to resemble a Chinese take out container , and inside was a beautiful oriental print " fortune cookie " jewelry holder . As soon as I removed my locket and chain , I fell in love . The locket itself is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face , and smooth sides and backing . The face is a piece of thin glass , as is the backing ( remember , I choose not to get a plate for mine ) . Each of the charms is exactly as pictured on the site , with great detailing on the butterfly , nice bright color in the amethyst and blue zircon Swarovski crystals , and pretty , clear crystals inset on the silver Chai . <p> The only thing I wish I 'd ordered differently is the chain . The one I got is a bit longer than I prefer , but that is my own fault for not measuring one of my other necklaces to check the exact size chain I wanted . One thing I noticed that I would never have thought of myself , is that the front and back pieces of the locket are close enough together so that the charms will not ever flip over to their backsides . For many charms this may not matter , but for some for example , my Chai charm where the front has the crystals while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All in all I am very impressed with my locket ! <p> Prices for the Living Locket necklaces are about average with the most basic locket starting at $12 , chains staring at $12 , charms starting at $5 , and plates starting at $6 . As I mentioned above , each piece seems to be very well made , and even the glass on the front and back of my locket is holding up wonderfully . The Living Lockets would make a great gift for birthdays , holidays and especially for Mothers Day ! <p> Living Lockets are not the only jewelry that Origami Owl offers . You can also find a nice selection of watches , bracelets , earrings and more on their website . Check it out now ! 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176 
@@29515318 @3215318/ <h> Mighty Mug The Mug That Wont Fall Over ! Review <p> Need a great gift for the coffee-lover on your list ? How about a mug that wont topple over and spill ? Sounds a bit hard-to-believe ? Check out the Mighty Mug ! <p> Like many of us , I absolutely love coffee . In fact , rarely do I start my day without a nice hot mug . Of course there 's been a few times when Ive accidentally knocked that mug full of that nice , steaming hot coffee , resulting in splashes , spills , and once , a complete topple ! There has also been a few occasions where I have almost ruined my laptop by accidentally knocking over a glass of water or soda while blogging , too . So when I heard about the Mighty Mug , I knew I had to give it a try ! <p> Now I admit , that upon hearing about the Mighty Mug , not only did I want to try it , but I was also a wee bit skeptical . A mug that wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel cup with a lid that helps avoid spills , but never have I seen one that actually will not topple over ! But sure enough , the Might Mug really does work ! <p> When my Mighty Mug arrived , the first thing I noticed after the beautifully rich color and smooth easy-to-grip surface was that it looked similar to a typical travel mug with one big exception : it has a seam on the outside shell about 1/4 of the way up from the bottom , and you can actually feel the top and bottom move up and down just a tad . Now the mug does n't  come apart at the seam , or wiggle back and forth , or anything like that . Nor does the seam go all the way through into the inside of the mug . However , it is an integral part of the Mighty Mugs design , and along with a small hole on the bottom , its what allows the technology used to work . <p> Okay then , so how exactly does it work ? Aside from that small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suction cup or anything sticky on the bottom . Instead it works by using Smartgrip Technology which allows it to grip to whatever smooth surface you set it on and stand up to all of those accidental bumps , knocks and elbows without falling over . Basically what happens is when you set the Mighty Mug down on a flat , smooth , solid surface , it creates a strong airlock that prevents accidental knocks and spills . Then , when you lift the mug up normally , the airlock is released . Pretty neat , huh ? And as long as you place it on a smooth , flat , non-porous surface , it really does work ! <p> But wait , it gets even better . The Mighty Mug is BPA-free , dishwasher safe and car cup holder friendly ! They come in a large variety of vibrant colors and fun patterns , and there are even several different designs including a vacuum insulated mug to keep hot beverages warm , an ice tumbler for cold beverages , and even a travel mug that fits single serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mighty Mug Solo travel mugs . This 11 ounce mug is the perfect size for a single cup of your favorite beverages , and it will fit under most single serve coffee machines ! Its double wall construction helps to keep hot beverages hot , and cold beverages cold . A screw-on top further ensures against splashes or spills , and the lid even has a handy lift-up flap to access the spout . It also fits perfectly in my cars cup holder , and of course , it uses Smartgrip technology to avoid spills at home or when taken on the go . <p> Sounds pretty cool , does n't  it ? ! So , do you want to try the incredible Mighty Mug for yourself ? You can learn more about the Mighty Mug and purchase products directly through the Mighty Mug website . Prices range from $19.99 to $24.99 . So head on over to the Mighty Mug website and purchase one today !

@@29515328 @3215328/ <h> What Can You Do About High Medical Bills ? <p> If you 're financially minded , you probably know a thing or two about saving money on healthcare already . You 'll know the best way to use your insurance , the preventative measures that will keep you out of the doctor 's office , and how to compare different treatment options . What many people do n't know is that they can save money even after receiving a bill . Here are a few ways to do this and avoid high medical bills piling up <h> Check for Errors <p> You 'd be amazed at the number of medical bills that contain some kind of clerical error . This is especially true when it comes to Medicare claims . The more services you need , the more room there is for error . If you or someone in your family has undergone a particularly long or complicated medical treatment , it 's a good idea to go through your bills and check for any errors that have slipped through the net . If you find that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can usually call and have it corrected quickly and easily . A lot of people are intimidated by the idea of auditing their medical bills , but you 're ultimately responsible for making sure all your billing is correct . It always helps to have copies of your records , and an explanation of different benefits from your medical company to weigh up against your bill . <h> Get Help <p> If you 're experiencing major financial hardship from your medical bill , or you 're on low income , you may qualify for assistance with it . A lot of doctor 's practices and hospitals will run their own program for this , and the staff will be able to give you the information you need . If you do n't qualify or their program ca n't help you , they 'll often be able to suggest other resources you can use to get free assistance with a medical bill . Even when you can comfortably afford the bill , if the condition was caused by another entity 's negligence , you can find out about legal assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some program or service that can remove at least some of the financial strain of big medical bills . <h> Negotiate with Tenacity <p> Many people have no idea that their medical bills are negotiable , not only through the doctor 's practice or hospital , but through their insurer as well . Talking to your insurer about this may take a little more effort than persuading a billing manager to correct errors , but it will often be well worth the effort . You might get waved away at first , but keep trying . When emails and phone calls do n't get you the results you 're going for , try writing a formal letter clearly outlining your request for a discounted bill , and requesting help from the right department of an organization . If the charges you 've received for a recent medical treatment seem somewhat extreme , do a little research and find out what the average cost from other providers is . Bringing this up can often be enough to prompt a major hospital to lower the price for you . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

While many of us are lulled into a false sense of security thanks to cell phones and car clubs , the truth of the matter is a roadside emergency can happen at anytime and anyplace . And unfortunately , where you break down may not always be in a safe location with cell phone service and a tow truck minutes away . Being prepared with an emergency kit can make all the difference . Below is a list of 20 must-have items for your car emergency kit . <p> 1 . Charged Cell Phone <p> Although you should never operate a cell phone while driving , having one in the car is one of the most important items you can have in your car emergency kit . Most likely you already carry one on your person , but it does n't  hurt to consider getting either an Emergency Cell phone which is made specifically for use in emergencies , or buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure your regular cell phone is always fully charged before you even get in the car . Keeping a spare charger in your car at all times is advisable as well . <p> 2 . First Aid Kit <p> There are all types of pre-made first aid kits which you can buy , but you can actually save some money by putting together one of your own . In addition to the basics such as band aids and antiseptic wipes , a first aid kit for the car should also include adhesive tape , gauze pads , aspirin , antiseptic cream or ointment , a small pair of scissors , and anything specific to you or your family . If you include specific medications make sure they are not temperature sensitive . If you do choose to buy a kit , make sure you are familiar with everything that is in it .

Flashlight and Extra Batteries <p> Choose a flashlight that is bright and weatherproof . Also , keep extra batteries and a spare bulb available . <p> 5 . A Multi-Tool <p> One of those small Swiss Army Knives with several different tools or a Leatherman Tool will work perfectly . <p> 6 . Warm Blankets and/or Extra Clothes <p> This is especially important when traveling during the cold , winter months . <p> 7 . Matches or Some Other Type of Fire Starter <p> 8 .

All Sofi and Liv products are made with 100% natural ingredients and do not include any parabens , petrochemicals , phthalates , sulfates , synthetic dyes , synthetic fragrances or mineral oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are made right here in the U.S.A !

I immediately fell in love with this shampoo that also doubles as a body wash . As soon as I began washing my hair the bathroom was filled with the incredibly relaxing scent of lavender with a hint of chamomile . Just a small amount provided plenty of cleansing lather which rinsed out easily leaving my hair clean and incredibly soft . When I bathe with soap it always dries my skin leaving me clean , but itchy . So after every shower I have to apply some type of lotion to ease the dryness . Yet when I used the Sofi and Liv as a body wash , it not only left my skin clean and smelling wonderful , but I did n't  have to apply any lotion as it did n't  dry out my skin at all .

The lotion has the perfect consistency , not too thick , yet not so thin as to be watery . Like the shampoo/body wash , a little bit goes a long way . I love how it absorbs quickly , leaving my skin silky soft and hydrated without any greasy residue . <p> Specially formulated just for Mom are the Ylang Ylang Calming Shampoo and Body Wash and the Calming Body Lotion . Like the Lavender Chamomile blends , the Ylang Ylang is made with all natural ingredients that are both calming and hydrating .

The Liv and Sofi rinsed off quickly and completely , leaving my skin clean , soft and hydrated and my mind and muscles soothed . <p> I find myself using the Sofi and Liv Ylang Ylang Calming Lotion frequently throughout the day . I love the calming scent of Ylang Ylang , and my hands and skin have never felt so soft .

This 100% natural balm does much more than just ease diaper rash .

This provides more flexibility and may even offer you the chance to do something that you love . Best of all , it may increase your earnings significantly . One way to earn a living for yourself is to become a landlord . But as property prices start to climb , it can be tricky to make the profit you 're looking for ; unless you know exactly how to profit from a fixer-upper . <p> Perhaps one of the most lucrative ways to profit from the property market is to buy a fixer-upper .

If you 're doing it up to rent it out , you can demand a higher rent for a property finished to a high standard . So if you can do this work yourself , you will see a higher return on your investment . <p> Good quality finishes work well in a neighborhood that expects them . Be sure you are in the right location to attract tenants who want a higher standard . Start by addressing the heating and cooling systems .

This will also help you establish a good budget for your renovation project . Once the work is over and the modern facilities installed , it 's time to address the decor . <p> Kitchens and bathrooms should be kept simple , stylish and clean . Choose good quality flooring that looks fresh . Wall colors are often neutral in these spaces , but a more vibrant accent wall could create the style your clientele may be attracted to . Tiling and grouting can take a long time , so start in these rooms first . <p> Flooring throughout the property may be in one style . Or you may choose to separate different areas with a change in flooring . If you 're choosing hardwood or tile throughout , be sure to add a rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it feel more homely .

Choose neutral colors throughout , but do n't be afraid to add a stylish accent color to each room . This makes the property appear more homely and attractive to the type of people that could be living here . <p> Even if you 're not letting the property as a furnished house , it can be a good idea to dress it for viewings . Place a dining table and chairs complete with runner and place settings in the appropriate place . Arrange some seating and a coffee table in the living room .

If it feels too high for the current market , you could choose to wait . However , time is money in the property game ! You may need to rent it out to cover the cost of your mortgage . <p> Doing up an old house is a lovely project to take on , especially if you enjoy DIY .

Choose a good rated mortgage to avoid negative equity if you need to sell within a specific time frame . <p> Rental income can often cover the cost of your mortgage repayments and offer you a little more too . But keeping a tenant happy can be tricky at times . You need the property occupied and the tenant paying on time to be sure of a reliable income .

@@29515345 @3215345/ <h> 6 Common Causes of Car Fires <p> If you have ever witnessed a car fire , you know it can be a scary site . Thick black smoke billows , orange flames spew , and fire trucks and police surround the site . Odds are you wo n't ever have to deal with a fire involving your own vehicle , especially if you take it in for regular check-ups and fix anything that needs repairing . However , it can be helpful to know the common causes for car fires for you and your passengers safety . Below are some of the top causes of car fires . <p> 1 ) Car Crashes : one of the most obvious causes of car fires are car crashes . Although most cars crumple zones are designed so the sheet metal absorbs the impact around dangerous areas such as the engine , fuel tank and battery , a hard enough hit can still possibly cause fluid leaks and spillage , as well as heat and smoke creating ideal conditions for a fire . <p> 2 ) Flaws in the Design : Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires . Notice I say contribute as a design flaw in a vehicle usually is n't going to cause a car fire on its own . They can , however , create conditions that are perfect for a fire , and sometimes even create conditions in which an eventual fire is inevitable . <p> 3 ) Poor Maintenance : While lack of maintenance is not going to directly cause your car to catch fire , in general , your car can be a lot more dangerous and can indirectly lead to a vicious fire . For example : frayed wiring can lead to a spark which can ignite flammable fluids such as oil or gasoline . Keeping up with repairs and performing regular maintenance can all help you avoid conditions that can lead to a vehicular fire . <p> 4 ) Electrical System Failure : another very common source of car fires , a cars electrical wiring runs throughout the entire car ; a stray , unnoticed frayed wire could wreak havoc . In addition , standard car batteries are also capable of causing plenty of trouble . A batterys charging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine bay , and the electrical current the battery provides ( along with faulty or loose wiring ) can then produce sparks which can quickly ignite leaked vapors or a fluid drip . Again , routine maintenance plays a big role in this . <p> 5 ) Overheating : Many people wonder is a cars engine overheating can cause the car to catch fire . While the engine overheating alone is unlikely to cause your car to burst into flame , what can happen is the engine overheating and making internal fluids rise to dangerous temperatures and begin to spill out of their designated areas . When this happens , the fluids drizzle and spurt onto the exhaust system and other super hot parts , where they can ignite and spread . <p> 6 ) Fuel Leaks : One of the most common causes of car fires are caused by a fuel leak . Any number of factors can cause a fuel leak , but at the same time , they can also arise on their own . Whatever causes it , a fuel system leak is really dangerous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7.2 degrees Celsius ) or above can quickly catch fire from a simple spark , and gasoline that reaches 495 degrees Fahrenheit ( 257.2 degrees Celsius ) will ignite by itself . This makes it easy to imagine how fuel dripping onto hot metal and plastic parts can cause a fire . If you ever smell gas in or around your car , find and fix the leak immediately ! Of course , as we have mentioned before , proper maintenance can go a long way in preventing a fuel system fire . <p> When it comes right down to it , the most important thing to remember is that once a vehicle is on fire , it really does n't  matter what caused it . The only thing that does matter is that you get out fast and get as far away from the car as possible . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Read on for some advice . <h> What to buy the techie in your life <p> If you share your space with a technologically minded person , you might be racking your brains what to get them as they have so much stuff already ! The good news is that there 's a lot you can get if you take a bit of time and research it first . <p> The key to getting a successful tech present is to identify the piece of tech they love the most such as an iPad . Its likely that they will already have the main item or it will be out of your price range . But you can still get something related to it by checking out sites that review accessories that go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way you will manage to get something that is useful and of good quality . <h> What to buy other peoples kids <p> Urgh ! Buying other peoples gifts is so hard to do . For one you probably do n't  know what they are really into , especially as the toy fads change so quickly nowadays . <p> Also , you have no idea what other people will be buying them . So even if you do go for the most on-trend items , you could just be doubling up with something that their parents or friends have already bought . Which ends up as a waste of the money that you have spent . <p> To avoid this , some people choose to give gift cards . Then the little one can be a part of the choice process of what to get . Although others feel that gift cards can look a bit impersonal , as if you have n't put in too much thought . <p> If its imperative that you gift shows though and care , as well as being original , how about making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or put together a craft pack for the kids to play with and make snow theme decorations . <h> What to buy a senior <p> What is it with seniors ? They always seem to say do n't  worry about getting me a gift this year . But how awful would it be if they were the only one that did n't  have anything to open on Christmas morning when everyone else in your house did ? <p> So if you are looking for a gift or two for a tricky senior why not try these on for size . <p> First of all , anything that helped them keep warm , especially if they live somewhere it gets cold in the winder is a good investment . How about a modern take on an electric blanket . Fur covered throws plugin , and heat up in no time . They make a great gift that is not old fashioned . <p> Or what about a nice ruled notebook ? You can present them with this and ask them to record all of their secret recipes for the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get just for this purpose . Or how about a Mother Spoon ? Then they will be able to pass on all their cooking knowledge in a quick and easy fashion . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

With all of the concern about what type of preservatives , dyes , artificial ingredients and other chemicals that is in our food , have you ever stopped to think about what is in the candy we eat ? <p> Here are just a few examples of what is really in that candy bar you love : <p> Many peanut-inspired candies maintain their " freshness " with an ingredient called " TBHQ " , also known as lighter fluid ! When taking a bite of rich chocolate covering vanilla nougat , take a look at the ingredients found in that " chocolate " all EIGHT of them . I thought chocolate was just that , chocolate . And do n't  even get me started on the corn syrup and hydrogenated vegetable oil ! <p> " Launched this summer , Legit Organics casts a spellbinding remix on organic candy with a range of treats that tread lightly on the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and additive-ridden counterparts . " <p> About Legit Organics <p> Legit Organics is a family owned and operated business that products their candy and snacks right here in the US .

And what they do is produce delicious , certified organic snacks whose ingredients come from farmers who do not use GMOs , chemical herbicides , pesticides or other chemicals . Even the milk , cream and butter used in their products come from humanely treated , pasture-raised cows . <p> And their candy really does taste just as good , if not better than , their non-organic counterparts ! I know because Legit Organics was kind enough to treat me to several boxes of two of their most delicious candy bars , Shot Caller and Word ! These two candy bars are packed so full of natural goodness , there is no room left for TBHQ , artificial colors or flavors , corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Legit Organics Shot Caller <p> The definition of shot caller is one who calls the shots ; the boss . Filled with roasted peanuts , soft buttery caramel and airy nougat , then covered in rich milk chocolate ( REAL chocolate ) , this candy bar is a delicious mouthful of natural goodness ! Add that to the fact that Shot Caller is certified organic with no hydrogenated oils and no artificial ingredients , plus it is Non-GMO you can see why Shot Caller is definitely the boss of all organic candy bars ! Want even more natural goodness ? Check out the ingredients ! <p> When I first heard about Legit Organics , unfortunately my first thought was are they really as naturally good as they are making them out to be ? You know as well as I that many companies are labeling their products as organic when they are actually just poorly executed knockoffs as their non-organic counterparts . However , after reading more about Legit organics including the ingredients in their products which are displayed right there on their website for the whole word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are truly working to product products that are legitimately wholesome , natural and delicious .

@@29515355 @3215355/ <h> Is Solar Energy Right For You ? Reducing Your Carbon Footprint <h> Three secrets to knowing if solar energy is right for your home <p> We hear a lot about the need for Americans to protect the environment . From promoting the merits of natural gas cars to reducing food waste to using solar energy , society is slowly taking steps to reduce its carbon footprint . <p> Solar energy has long been the little darling of alternative forms of electricity " with good reason . It relies on an unlimited source of energy , it crushes expensive energy costs , and it increases the value of your home . According to Intermountain West solar company Legend Solar , there are boundless benefits for the community and environment as a result of switching to solar . Year after year , the installation of solar paneling becomes more cost effective , which is why many residents are considering converting . But is solar energy the right choice for you ? Here are three things to consider before making your decision : <h> 1 . How much does it cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a cost connected to harnessing that energy . Based on general estimates of $10 per watt installed , you could be looking at a $5,000 to $45,000 investment . <p> A big selling point is the government incentives for converting to solar energy . It 's true that the federal government will extend a tax credit equivalent to 30 percent of the gross system costs . And most states offer incentives as well . But you still need to cover the initial installation costs . Most solar paneling companies will offer financing , and some advertise zero down at installation , but the long-term financial commitment to this system is worth thinking about . <h> 2 . What is the condition of your home ? <p> To maximize the cost-saving benefits of solar energy , one must first consider additional ways to make your home energy efficient . For example , it makes little sense to install solar paneling when your home is poorly insulated . Rather than going big at the beginning , take a moment to evaluate your home and identify smaller , yet equally impactful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Does your freezer need to be replaced ? Or are you still using the washing machine you bought in college ? When you have made smaller investments in your home 's ability to conserve energy , then the impact of installing solar paneling will be huge . <h> 3 . How 's the weather ? <p> It makes sense that in order for a solar energy system to be truly worthwhile , you must live in an area that gets large amounts of sunshine . As technology improves to help areas in the Midwest or upper Northwest regions optimize the moderate amounts of sun they receive , it 's the warmer regions that benefit the most from solar energy . An ideal customer has lots of southern exposure with no obstructions , such as trees or tall buildings . Basically , if you can grow an orange tree , you will enjoy the optimal benefits of solar energy . <p> Converting to solar energy is a popular and profitable option for many Americans . However , it may not be the ideal choice for everyone . By considering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your location , you can be sure your decision will lead you toward a bright , energy efficient future . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

We have a perception of our parents , that they will never get old and will remain the same way as when we were younger . This is not a fantasy that people develop , it is common for a lot of us to associate our parents with memories from childhood , and when we see them age and realize they are aging , it can be pretty difficult for us to deal with . <p> Our parents probably do not enjoy getting older , either .

When we moved into this house , I was lucky enough to have one room totally dedicated to my blogging and crafting . However , within a few months it became apparent that the room was being used more for storage than work . All of my actual blogging takes place sitting in the den , computer on my lap . Why ? Because I did n't  have a desk that worked . Now , thanks to the Realspace Magellan Collection L-Shaped Desk from Office Depot , I finally have a real , functional space to work ! <p> I am almost too embarrassed to show you the before picture of my work space , but I am going to because it will help give you an idea just how much of a difference this desk has made . As you can see , the desk I used before did n't  have enough surface space to to set up everything I needed . This small desk served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anytime I wanted to use my Cricut , I had to take down the entire photo set up , move it out of the way and then move my Cricut Explore AirG machine over to the desk and set it up That was more than enough rearranging for me so there was no way I would add alternating my computer to the mix , too ! <p> Now with my new desk from Office Depot , everything has changed . A small foldout table has become my primary tabletop photography studio , and my new Realspace Magellan Collection L-Shaped Desk provides more than enough room for my computer and my Cricut with plenty of storage for my supplies . <h> Features of the Realspace Magellan L-Shaped Desk <p> I love having lots of space to spread out , and the Realspace Magellan Collection L-Shaped Desk provides plenty . The entire desk measures approximately 30 ? inches in height , 58 3/4 inches in width and 18 3/4 ? deep . One side of the L-shaped desk features a leatherette inlay , which is durable and functional , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to storage , the Realspace Magellan Collection L-Shaped Desk steps right up to the plate ! Three box drawers provide plenty of storage space for your work supplies , manuals , software , and other accessories , and a nice , deep bottom file drawer works perfectly for your letter or legal-size files . And yes , it is designed to accommodate hanging files . <p> A cabinet with a door works as perfect storage for some of my craft supplies , and is big enough for a desktop CPU tower to be hidden nicely out of sight . There is a hole in the back panel of the cabinet for wires and cords to easily fit through . Additionally , the handy slide-out keyboard tray is the ideal spot to store my laptop , and of course , for those with a desktop , it makes it easy to keep your keyboard out of the way . <h> Assembly <p> The desk is an assemble-it-yourself desk , but it is really one of the best made and easiest to put together Ive owned . The entire process took my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything you need comes in the box , with the exception of a Phillips head screwdriver and a hammer ( to help push in the wooden dowels ) . I do highly recommend assembling this desk right where you are going to put it as it is quite heavy . And although there are little plastic rounded knobs that go on the bottom of the legs to make moving easier , on carpet it may be a bit of a pain to drag around large distances . Luckily my floors are hardwood so it slid the few inches we needed to move it into place with no problem . <p> Every single panel and piece in the box was labeled with an alphabetized sticker that corresponds to a parts list in the instruction manual . Even better , all of the hardware ( screws , dowels , etc. ) are separated into individual plastic pouches and numbered by each step . A huge time saver ! Another thing that made assembly easier was that the drawer rails come already attached so that is one less step to do . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures . At first I was a tad taken aback that there were no words in the instruction manual , but I soon realized that the pictures were spot on . And honestly , once you get past the first few pages , the assembly becomes pretty repetitive and quite easy . In fact , the hardest part of the whole process was that it took a while to put together . Having two people definitely makes it go much faster . In the end everything fit together very nicely and the desk looks great ! Yes , it is time-consuming , but it is not frustrating at all and that is what makes all the difference ! <h> The Finished Product <p> Over the years I have purchased and assembled a lot of furniture , and I can honestly say that this desk is my favorite of them all . Yes , its pressed wood , but it is by far a higher quality than most assemble-it-yourself furniture I 've found . It is very sturdy and comfortable , and it looks exceptionally nice . With a little care , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , it is a great buy especially for the price ! <p> The Realspace Magellan L-Shaped desk can be purchased both online and in-store at Office Depot or OfficeMax . It is available in four different finishes , including Classic Cherry , Honey Maple , Gray , and the one I chose , Espresso . If you choose to order online and pick-up in-store like I did , the store will have it waiting for you within an hour , and they will even help you load it . Just know that the box it comes in is very large and heavy ( it weighs a whopping 170 lbs . in the box ! ) , so it is definitely a two-person job to carry . And to give you an idea of the overall size of the box , I went to pick it up thinking I could fit it in the back of my Kia Soul with the seats laid down . Did n't  happen . I had to come back the next day with my father-in-law 's truck ! <p> Overall I am very happy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good quality , attractive , mid-price piece of furniture , and having my work/craft room finally put together and organized has made my working life so much easier ! 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

@@29515362 @3215362/ <h> Aging Like A Boss ! How to Deal with Common Aging Issues <p> As far as aging goes , most of us are used to dealing with the realities of it in our parents , or in other older relatives such as grandparents , aunts , and uncles . It is n't something that many of us consider about ourselves until we stop and realize that we are actually experiencing some of the things that our seniors are going through too ! Of course , for some people , the thought of aging can be scary , as it means potentially not being in control of what happens to our bodies . But once you overcome this fear of the unknown , the idea of getting older becomes something you are much more capable of just taking in your stride . Plus , if you have already dealt with some of the downsides of the aging process through your senior relatives or friends , you will already be somewhat experienced in how to deal with such problems . It is n't always just medical issues , however . The process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , whether they are aesthetic or emotional . But , getting older should n't be seen as such as negative thing it should be celebrated , as there are plenty of good things about it too ! So , with all this in mind , it can be useful to know how to deal with these common aging issues so you can be the baddest senior on the block ! <h> Wrinkles <p> One of the most common aging issues we all have to deal with is wrinkling . It can sometimes seem as though we are constantly bombarded by the media of images of older women with seemingly flawless skin . Anti-aging product adverts are ten a penny , and there 's always some new product or treatment on the market that claims it can turn back the clock on your skin . Of course , in some cases , it can be easy to see why they look so tempting . If you genuinely have excessively wrinkled skin that makes you look old beyond your years ( maybe due to a bad diet or prolonged sun exposure ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as surgery . This is a huge step to take , though , and recovery can often be a long and painful process . Otherwise , take a step back and question whether your skin is really as bad as you think it is . You 're not going to stay 21 forever , and a few lines here and there are inevitable plus , they show you 've lived ! Just look at celebrities like actress Helen Mirren , for example . She has healthy , supple skin , without trying to mask the fact that she 's an older lady . Take usual precautions such as staying out of harsh sunlight , washing your face morning and night and using a light serum , and there 's no reason why you cant love the skin you 're in . <h> Joint problems <p> Another of the common aging issues is joint problems . If you 're a very active person , you probably do n't  envisage this stopping just because you 've gotten older . However , sometimes life can deal us a cruel hand , and you may be forced to stop doing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being up to it . One of the most common examples of this is joint problems . A huge proportion of senior people across the world suffer from some kind of joint pain so much so , that it is often considered to simply be a normal part of aging . But in reality , its not something that you should have to put up with at all . Some joint pain can be a direct result of disease and illness other types are known as the result of wear and tear , which is perhaps why these conditions appear to be so prevalent in later life . One of the most common types is osteoarthritis , which is reported to affect around 27 million people in the United States . It can affect some different joints ranging from the knees to the hips , so you need to make sure you find a doctor who specializes in your specific ailment . A Hip Joint Surgeon will be able to perform corrective surgery on you , whether you need a minor procedure or something more permanent , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such a major procedure , but the sooner you catch these issues the sooner you can be back on your feet . <h> Emotional issues <p> A huge part of aging that no one really talks about is the prospect of the emotional changes that can happen to you , as well as the physical ones . There is a whole hoard of factors that can lead to us experiencing negative emotions as a senior the loss of friends , accepting illness and/or a lack of mobility , stresses of a low pension the list is endless . If you end up suffering from a condition such as dementia , your mental health is even more precious as it can be easy for people living with this disorder to become confused and upset . So , you need to be prepared to cope with the emotional changes you are going to ( potentially ) go through as an older person , whether that 's on your own or with the support of friends and family . Make sure you are mindful of your own mental health and make a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how you are feeling . If you are retired , and you spend a lot of time in your house , make a conscious effort to keep your mind occupied at all times , if you can and not just by watching television ! Read books , do some DIY or gardening , make some crafts even consider starting a business from home ( providing you can legally do so as part of your retirement ) . Leading a sedentary and reclusive life is what causes many elderly people to become frail and nervous of the outside world , and they can even become ostracized from their families . Keep active , keep current and keep socializing and there 's no reason why you cant live a happy and stress-free life even well into your senior years . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Thoroughly Research What Neighborhood <p> Florida is a diverse state with plenty of cities within it . Depending upon a person 's interests , different cities will be a better fit . <p> Some of the top cities in Florida are Miami , Fort Lauderdale , Boca Raton , Port St. Lucie , Pembroke Pines , Jacksonville , St. Petersburg , Tallahassee and Tampa . <p> 2 . Find A Home <p> Moving to a new city without a home or apartment already purchased can make the move entirely too stressful .

Unfortunately , I do not much care for the taste of our tap water here , and buying case after case of bottled water will add up big time not to mention I 'd be adding to the 38 billion disposable water bottles thrown away every year in the U.S ! So when the makers of bobble offered me the opportunity to try one of their innovative bottles , I jumped at the chance ! <p> The bobble is a reusable , self-filtering water bottle that makes having clean filtered water where ever you go a cinch . Each bobble is made from recycled PET , is completely recycleable , and is PVC-free , BPA-free , and phthalate-free . Plus , a bobble water bottle offers a sustainable solution to the waste created by the disposal of single-use , plastic water bottles . <p> Bobble water bottles are available in several styles . The Original bobble ( the one I received ) comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is clear in color and has a clear cap that fits over the filter/lid . Similar to the original is the carry cap bobble which is available in the same sizes as the original , but has a cap with a loop that doubles as a handle . The caps are made of a soft material and are available in several bright colors that match the filters . Then there is the Sport bobble which holds 24 ounces and comes in a variety of bold and bright colors . <p> The uniquely designed filters are carbon activated and not only remove chlorine and other organic impurities from traditional tap water , but each one meets or exceeds the NSF International Standard 42 for chlorine , taste and odor reduction ! One filter will work at peak capacity for approximately two months ( or filter around forty gallons of water ) before it is time to replace it . If you do the math , this equates to one filter replacing 300 single-use water bottles ! Imagine the impact you can make in one year ! The filters are one-size-fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as pink , green , lavender and others . <p> I feel in love with my bobble as soon as I tried it , from the actual shape of the bottle which is similar to an hourglass and fits comfortably in my hand to the cool , clean and crisp taste of the filtered water . I also like how the cap ( which is actually part of the filter ) easily lifts up when you are ready for a sip , then to close it you just push down on it . It also does not leak at all , even when I turn it completely upside down . <p> My absolute favorite thing about the bobble water bottle ? A bobble will cost between $9.99 and $12.99 depending on the size and style , and it comes with your first filter . After that , a new filter will run you around $6.99 every two months . A case of bottled water costs anywhere from $3.99 to $5.99 and will last maybe one weekyou do the math ! Healthy , eco-friendly and affordable what more could I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to process orders through the website , but bobbles are sold in many stores around the world including Target , Walgreens , Amazon , Bloomingdales , Best Buy Publix , Earth Fare and many more !

I especially like the fact that they candles are soy wax simply because soy wax burns a lot cleaner and longer than paraffin . Paraffin is actually made of petroleum , whereas soy comes from soy beans , so when you burn a soy wax candle you are not getting the toxins and pollutants you can get from paraffin . <p> Each candle comes in a heavy glass jar with an airtight lid , so once the candle is used up you still have a nice jar that can be re-used for all sorts of things . Choosing a scent was the hardest part as there are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tropical Retreat . This scent is colored a pretty aqua blue that reminds me of the Caribbean sea , and according to the site its scent is a blend of green bananas , coconuts , oranges &amp; grapefruits . .

While I could n't pick out the individual scents , together the do make a very fresh and pleasant tropical scent . You can also see where the ring is through the glass . <p> Although the site said it could take around 10-15 hours to uncover most rings , I was able to extract mine after about 5 hours without having to dig too much or causing any irreparable damage to the wax . The ring itself was wrapped in several layers of foil as well as a tiny plastic bag , so you do n't  have to worry about wax getting all over it . Once opened , this is what I found inside : <p> So what is my ring worth ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring has ' 14k ' or similar information imprinted on the inside of the band than you have a ring that is worth $100+ . We advise that you take it to a jeweler to get a verbal estimate to see if it is worth $100 's or $1,000 's . <p> If the ring has Thailand ' or something similar imprinted on the inside of the band it is most likely worth $100 or less . <p> Unmarked rings are likely to be toward the $10 range but could be valued up to $100 . <p> I could tell almost immediately that my ring was not worth $100 , let alone $5000 . Although it does have a marking inside , it is obviously a piece of costume jewelry , albeit a nice piece ! Weight-wise it is fairly heavy , and the stone itself is clear and free of bubbles . Size wise it is a bit big , I would guess around a size 8 or 9 .

Enter the code on the RINGREVEALG page of the website ( making sure to log in with a Facebook account or to create an account ) . They will then reveal if the code is worth $100 , $1000 or $5000 ! If you 're a lucky winner , you 'll get to choose the ring of your style and size in their exclusive ring boutique . And if you do n't  win , you will always have the ring you found in your candle ! <p> Is Diamond Candles Worth It ? <p> Each candle sells for $25 before shipping . While I believe that a large part of the experience is the excitement of waiting to find out if you got one of the $5000 rings , you still get a pretty candle that smells good and burns for a long time regardless of the ring you find . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring is worth at least $10 , then you are only spending $15 on the candle , and that is not a bad price for a scented soy candle of that size . <p> With the Holidays right around the corner , Diamond Candles would make an excellent gift idea . After all , its hard to go wrong with a scented candle , and the fact that there is a piece of jewelry inside is an added bonus ! They even have candles for other special occasions such as birthdays , anniversaries and even the birth of a new baby ! 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

You may think that gift cards are impersonal but actually they help people create their own gifts and experiences . A movie theater gift card might enable your thirteen year old son to go on his first date , and a restaurant gift card might help your strapped-for-cash brother treat his wife to a great night out .

@@29515391 @3215391/ <h> Natural Pest Control Solutions That Keep Your Family Safe <p> One of the main problems that homeowners face is keeping their property free from any pests and vermin . These little critters can enter your home when you are n't watching and , before you know it , they will have made themselves very much at home in your house . Sometimes , the infestation can be so bad that you may think that there is just no way of getting rid of them . <p> However , there is no cause to despair as you will find that there is plenty that can be done to fight these pesky creatures . Sure , you could hire a professional bug and vermin exterminator , but these companies can be fairly expensive and might use chemicals that are dangerous for the environment and your family 's own health . Thankfully , there is plenty that you can do on your own , and the good news is that most of these methods are completely organic and natural . Meaning you do n't have to worry about the environment or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pests and vermin ! So how can you get your home back to how it once was ? Here are my favorite natural pest control solutions . <p> Now that winter is almost over , the weather will start to heat up , which means you will have to deal with all the bugs and insects that the good weather brings . And one of the most annoying of these insects is the common housefly . These are very dirty creatures and can spread germs and bacteria by landing on your food . Unfortunately , they can be very tricky to catch and kill because they are so darn fast ! Thankfully , there is one fantastic solution . You just need to buy some natural fly traps . These often come in the form of sticky plastic that you hang in the middle of your rooms . The plastic is coated with a sweet substance that attracts the flies . They then land on it thinking that it is food , but get stuck to the plastic and die . Be sure to hang your traps in problem areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you can manage to keep any pests out of your house in the first place , you wo n't have to go to any trouble of trying to get them out ! This may be easier said than done , but it is n't totally impossible . And there is one natural method that works quite well . You just need some essential oils . Flies and ants hate the smell of essential oils , so if you place them around entryways and small holes which some insects could enter through , you will notice that you do n't have quite as many creepy crawlies coming into your home . First of all , you need to mix a solution . Mix together some fresh water with a few drops of peppermint oil , basil oil , and lemon oil . These are fragrances that pests and insects ca n't stand ! Thankfully , they smell pretty good to us ! Then just dab on some of the mixture to the frames of your doors and windows and around any holes and gaps , and the insects will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden . You can find them quite cheaply in garden centers , and once you have a few in your garden , you will have a constant supply of basil leaves for all your cooking . Just think of all the fresh pesto you could make ! Not only that , though , but they also give off a fantastic aroma . It smells great to us , however , pests and insects absolutely hate it ! So , one useful trick is to place some basil plants as close to your windows and doors as possible . That way , insects wo n't want to come near the entryways to get into your home . You could add a few window boxes to your windows to make sure you can add the plants as near to them as possible . Once you do this , the great aroma from the plants will waft into your house . Lovely ! <p> Many homeowners are reluctant to use poisons that target pests and vermin in their homes as many of them contain lots of chemicals and artificial ingredients . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could also have effects on people 's health if they are used over a long period of time . However , producers have now cottoned onto the fact that people are wary of using these , and are now starting to manufacture poisons that are completely natural and organic . These are very effective at getting rid of household pets and vermin . You will be able to find them in your local supermarket , garden center , and home stores . <p> Remove Trash <p> One reason why rats and mice get into houses is that the owners leave out leftover food and trash . You will find that if you keep your home tidy and clean , you wo n't be affected by so many vermin . If you remember to store leftovers correctly and take your trash out on a regular basis , you wo n't be plagued by vermin . However , many people find they have a problem with garbage after they have had a party or after big events such as Christmas . They just do n't have the storage facilities for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a rubbish removal firm could help you out by taking away your excess rubbish . <p> If you have pets , they could be bringing in bugs , such as fleas , into your home . One way around this is to make your cats and dogs wear a flea collar . You can find lots of collars that are coated with herbal solutions that repel fleas . Once the dog or cat is wearing their new collar , they wo n't attract any fleas . In fact , the fleas will be actively repelled . So there is no more need to worry about these small creatures getting into your home and infecting you ! 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Keep in mind that when you buy from Zaycon , you will be ordering in bulk , which is usually a 40 pound case that 's A LOT of chicken ! <p> My Zaycon Foods Experience <p> One of Zaycons most popular items is their boneless , skinless chicken breasts which contain no hormones , additives or artificial ingredients . These chickens are non-caged , come directly from the farm , and have never been frozen .

Once we were up , I simply told the truck driver my name , and showed my receipt . His helper then got the case from the truck , put down a sheet of plastic in my trunk , and loaded the box of chicken for me ! The whole process took maybe 2 minutes way less time than I would spend on a trip to the grocery store , and I never even got out of the car ! <p> While the chicken was being loaded , I asked the driver a couple of questions about the chicken , mainly about the freshness of the meat .

So not only did I save time and money going through Zaycon meats , I also got fresher chicken ! <p> Once home , we unloaded the box and set to work . Inside the box was 4 plastic bags that each contained 10 pounds of chicken . Although not frozen , the chicken was still very cold , and when we opened the first bag , both of us were amazed at the size of the breasts .

All I have to do is simply pull one or two packs from the freezer and let them thaw . <p> Cooking with Zaycon Foods ChickenThe first time we tried the chicken , we grilled out for my nieces birthday .

I also know the importance of teaching STEM beginning at an early age . Unfortunately , a lot of children do n't  enjoy subjects such as math and technology , but if you make the activity fun , children will be more engaged and will enjoy what they are learning . Cubetto , one of the newest STEM toys focused on basic programming skills , has been designed to do exactly that . <h> Meet Cubetto <p> Created by Primo Toys , Cubetto , is an award-winning , Montessori-approved coding toy that teaches young children the basics of computer programming . As the first and only screen-less programming system , Cubetto is powered by a revolutionary coding language made up of colorful blocks that enable children to write their first computer programs . <p> Cubetto comes with everything you need to get started including a friendly wooden robot , a physical programming console @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expandable coding blocks , a collection of beautifully illustrated play maps , and an activity book . There is no screen and children do n't  have to be able to read in order to begin learning and understanding the basic coding principles . <h> How Does Cubetto Work ? <p> Using the " coding blocks " and the board children " program " can Cubetto to move in certain ways . Each colorful block is linked to a different command that tells the robot whether to move forward , left or right . Using the stories and challenges in the activity book , children plan where on the play map they need Cubetto to go , and which way he needs to move in order to get there . They then place the corresponding colored blocks into the board , " programming " Cubetto to move the directions they tell him to go . The robot will then follow that exact sequence allowing children to see the physical results of their actions immediately . <p> Planning and executing these mini adventures helps children learn a lot more than coding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think critically and independently . And as they get more familiar with how Cubetto works , children can create their own adventures to send him on , moving through obstacle courses or even around the house . <p> You can see exactly how it works in this video <p> Cubetto is also the only coding toy that can be used by both sighted and non-sighted children in the same setting . This creates an equal learning environment that also promotes inclusive play . And , by using movement , touch and sound , it also helps children with disabilities strengthen their sequencing and communication skills . <p> Cubetto not only teaches basic coding principles , it also encourages creativity , critical thinking , spatial awareness , and communication skills , all while allowing children to learn at their own pace . Plus since it uses movement , sound and touch , children of all learning styles will have fun while they learn . <h> Where to Purchase <p> Ideal for girls and boys aged 3 years and up , the Cubetto Playset is available for purchase on www.primotoys.com . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Activity Pack , which offers four additional world maps and matching story books .

The Spark of Fashion covers are available in light purple or silver and are made from a glittery , sparkling fabric . The Double Chick line , the one I choose , are reversible covers available in several patterns including paisley , floral and polka dots . <p> I selected the pretty Paris/ Vintage Dots White Spiral Notebook Cover .

So when I was offered the opportunity to try the Qi Orthopedic Pillow , I could n't wait to see if it would help . The Qi Pillow , pronounced CHEE-pillow , may look like an ordinary throw pillow , but in fact it is an innovative orthopedic back support device . Designed and created by a Human Spinal Biomechanics researcher , author and lecturer , the Qi Pillow has been scientifically tested and proven to provide orthopedic back support for people of all shapes and sizes leading to the reduction and elimination of pain and fatigue in the lower back . In a third-party clinical study , the QiPillow was proven to help 91% of back pain sufferers relieve their back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posture and comfort . Inside the Qi Pillow is an air-controlled core that uses the same technology as the Sleep Number Bed System . The user can easily adjust the amount of air inside the pillow by loosening the top valve and either adding or releasing air . No special tools are required , you simply give it a few puffs , its easier than inflating a balloon . The pillow works by providing dynamic tension when positioned against the small of the back and supporting the weight of your body . This helps maintain correct posture , relax muscles and make the body more comfortable , which in turn reduces and eliminates the pain and fatigue brought on from sitting for long periods of time . Other pillows only provide static tension , collapsing under your body weight , making you slouch and constantly having to adjust the pillow and your position . This keeps your muscles tight , tense and constantly moving which translates to fatigue and pain . I spend the majority of time typing while sitting on the couch in our den . While I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I have , and since I began using the Qi Pillow , I have noticed a marked improvement . I no longer slouch , nor am I constantly adjusting my position .

While the Qi Pillow works wonders on my back pain , another bonus is that it looks nice . Anyone walking in and seeing the pillow would think it was a regular throw pillow . It measures around 18 ? by 18 ? , and covered in soft , micro suede that is available in camel or sage . The outside cover is completely removable and machine washable . Order your Qi Pillow today and say goodbye to lower back pain .

Lately when have been trying to eat more healthy which led to us using fresh fruits and veggies more often especially in smoothies , soups and juices . For years I have used just a basic , inexpensive blender , but it just was n't cutting it pun intended when it came to making everything I want to be able to make . Enter the Ninja Ultima Blender ( BL830 ) ! <p> The Ninja Ultima Blender is a super powerful blender which , thanks to its dynamic motor , dual stage blending and expansive variable speeds , has the ability to replace several of your small kitchen appliances . With this one machine , you can chop , blend and everything in between . <p> When it comes to blades , the Ultima is the ultimate ! What makes it unique is the dual stage blending , where it uses two sets of independently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blades that rotate at 5,000 RPMs at freeload work to easily and completely crush whole , fruits , vegetables , seeds and ice . Then , at the bottom , the High Speed Cyclonic Blades rotate at 24,000 RPMs at freeload to totally liquefy the ingredients into a smooth and silky consistency in just seconds ! Combined with its 1500 watt/2.5 horsepower motor , the blades are sharp and powerful enough to where they can easily grind nuts , grains , meats and even coffee beans . Please keep in mind that they are very sharp and be careful when handling ! <p> In addition , the Ultima also features 10 different speeds which offer everything from gentle to Total Crushing- to Nutrient Complete Juicing- . Make your concoction as smooth or as chunky as you want it to be with the simple twist of a dial , and with no worries of over mixing or processing . The simple control panel also offers a Pulse switch , and the Start/Stop switch . <p> Unlike my old blender , the Ultima also has a nice heavy and sturdy base complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securely in one spot . Although its a bit loud when blending , at least its not flying all over the counter . Its also very easy to clean , both inside and out . Just remember , those blades are incredibly sharp ! <p> The Ninja Ultima comes with a nice , extra-large 72 ounce pitcher jar ( that 's 9 cups of liquid by the way ) that is durable , stain-resistant , BPA-free and dishwasher safe . The large base jar is perfect for making everything from milkshakes for the entire family to large batches of soup . can stuff lots in it without out to add bit by bit . The lid on the pitcher is also nice and sturdy and features a locking handle for safety , a push release and , my favorite , a spout for pouring directly out of the pitcher . <p> In addition to the large pitcher , you also get three 16 ounce single serve cups that can be placed right on the blender base using the special single serve blade . The cups come with Sip &amp; Seal lids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This is actually one of my favorite features as I can now make just enough smoothie for one person . Using the single serve blade , the cup fits rights on the motor base . Turn the switch to Single Serve , pulse it a few times until you get the consistency you like , then remove the blade lid and replace it with a Sip &amp; Seal lid , and go . No more having to pour from the pitcher into a cup , and then wash them both when done ! <p> Speaking of washing , cleaning the Ultima is also a breeze . Again , the blades are incredibly sharp so please be careful ! While the pitcher is dishwasher safe , if you do n't  want to run a cycle , you can just fill the pitcher halfway with water , add a couple of drops of dish soap and pulse the blender 5-10 times to clean it . Rinse , and done ! <p> Having the Ninja Ultima in your kitchen enables you to create endless delicious recipes from juices to dips to purees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers several additional attachments to increase its versatility and broaden your culinary horizon . It comes with easy-to-follow directions , and a booklet of healthy recipes . You can also find many more recipes on the Ninja website . <p> While the Ninja Ultima Blender itself is amazing , its price point is even better . I know that I would never spend $600 on a Vitamix . The Ninja Ultima ( BL830 ) is around $265 , and considering that it has many of the same features as the more expensive Vitamix , it 's well worth the cost . <p> The Ninja Ultima Blender series can be purchased both online and off .

The labels are covered in buzzwords that make you feel like drinking one is going to do you a lot of good . But hang on ! First of all , pre-bottled or freshly made smoothies can be very expensive . Furthermore , when you break down a piece of fruit into smoothie form , you increase the sugar . This sugar then goes into your body , and can damage your teeth and give you a short-lived sugar rush . The new advice is to take your fruit as whole pieces , in its natural form , and not smoothies . Not only is this better for your health , but it 's also better for your wallet ! <p> Utilize the power of supplements <p> That being said , eating loads of fruit and vegetables can get expensive .

Store Winter Tires <p> Now that the snow and ice have gone away , its time to remove your Winter Tires and replace them with something more appropriate for warm temperatures . If you do not have Winter Tires you should make sure your current tires are in top shape . Be sure to check the tread , the amount of wear , and the tire pressure .

Protect the Interior <p> After wiping down and vacuuming the interior , make sure you apply a protectant to your seats , dash board , and any other vinyl and leather surfaces as well . Look for a protectant that offers UV protection to help prevent fading and cracking due to the heat and intense sunlight during the spring and summer months . You may also want to apply the protectant to exterior trim as well .

We all look back on articles about what was fashionable in the 80s and 90s and laugh ; but at their time , they were the height of style . When things change so rapidly when chic becomes derided it can be a nightmare trying to keep up . In the early 2000s , jeans were worn so low-waisted they showed underwear and were bootcut . Wearing something like that today would be a style catastrophe . On the other hand , certain fashions have become classics . <p> Fashion changes roughly four times a year , along seasonal lines . There is usually a color , a trend , a must-have accessory or just a designer at the top of the line . <p> Unless you have unlimited resources , keeping up with ever-evolving tastes can be a nightmare . You want to remain on trend and avoid the faux pas , but at the same time , very few of us have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So why not try and build a wardrobe that is solid in the basics ?

Think of these pieces as you wardrobe foundations . <p> Furthermore , on the affordability scale , most brands will occasionally run discounts . Be it Old Navy coupons or a discount code for your favorite high end retailer , a bit of hunting can lower the cost too . So with that in mind , let 's examine the basics . <h> A White Shirt <p> Ideally in a fabric that is going to last , like silk or pure cotton .

There are more manufacturers of jeans than can be counted , so try on as many as you can until you find your perfect match . <h> Nude Pumps <p> The beauty of nude pumps is that they go with everything ; you 're never going to have to worry about clashing colors .

@@29515435 @3215435/ <h> The Benefits of Accepting Credit Cards for Small Business Owners <h> 6 Benefits of Accepting Credit Cards <p> I grew up in a family where my dad was a restaurant owner , and since then Ive worked in a variety of different retail businesses . Over the years , I 've watched as more and more people began using credit and debit cards , and less and less cash . As a small business owner myself , I know that it is pretty much imperative that you accept credit card and debit card payments . In fact , the benefits of accepting credit cards well outweigh the drawbacks , regardless of whether you are a small or large business owner . <h> Customer Satisfaction <p> Every business owner wants to make sure their customers are happy . How else do we get them to keep coming back ? Whether you make your sales face-to-face or outside the office , providing customers with a quick , easy and secure way to pay is a necessity . Accepting credit cards in addition to your other methods of payment offers your customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And with access to portable credit card machines and E-commerce/Virtual Terminals , every business owner has the ability to accept credit card payments no matter where you conduct your business . <h> Legitimacy <p> Another of the many benefits of accepting credit cards is legitimacy . When people see the credit card logos displayed in your store or on your website , it gives your business a new level of trust and legitimacy . People trust the credit card companies enough to use them , and that trust transfers to the businesses who accept them . We all tend to buy from businesses we trust . <h> Quick and Easy Sales <p> I do not like wasting time when making a purchase and neither does anyone else . Credit card machines not only offer a way to complete transactions immediately , they are also a secure , cost-effective and reliable way to collect payments . Additionally , by offering customers more convenient payment options , more people will be attracted to the reliable and efficient services your business offers . <h> Time Savings <p> Using credit card machines save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit from the convenience of having the profits from credit card sales delivered to your bank account instantly . Plus , there is the added benefit of you no longer having to make trips to the bank to deposit checks and money orders , and then wait days or even weeks for them to clear . <h> Higher Sales <p> Did you know that over 175 million people in America carry at least one credit card ? By not accepting credit cards , you are running the risk of losing thousands of potential customers . Many people are no longer willing to pay in cash , and others do not have other means to make their payments . Additionally , there are people who only use credit cards to make particular types of purchases , especially large purchases and online purchases . <h> Cost Effective <p> Many businesses are under the false belief that accepting credit cards is too expensive to do . The truth is , accepting credit cards is a relatively inexpensive business expense . First of all , the majority of credit card processing rates are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use them . In reality , many merchants discover that the increase in sales generated by accepting credit cards more than covers the costs involved . <p> So now that you know some of the benefits of accepting credit cards , why not bring your business to the next level and get started today . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176 
@@29515437 @3215437/ <h> How to Network Your Home for a Fraction of the Cost <p> Once upon a time , data networks could only be considered within the realm of large corporations . Over the years , as technology advanced , applications increased and costs plummeted , networks began sprouting in medium and even small businesses . Today , networking has become so prevalent in western society that homes are no longer complete with just the traditional triptych of running water , electricity and telephony ; this has been upgraded to a tetraptych that includes Internet connectivity . <p> It is interesting to note that when traditional utilities were first introduced into homes , they were usually located in only one room . For example , running water could be found only in the kitchen , just one telephone would be installed per home , and a light fixture was present only in the living room . As the years went by , this quickly changed . Telephones could be located in any room , running water was available in the kitchen , the bathrooms and in the garden , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the home . <p> Internet connectivity seems to have gone through the same stages . Only a few years ago , network connectivity was only available at or near the modem , that is , at only one location within the home . Today homes are being built with Internet connectivity in all rooms via structured cabling . Connect your modem to a switch and the switch to structured cabling and you have wired Internet that is accessible from all of your rooms " and this technology is changing our homes for the better . <p> But what about us poor chaps who bought our homes several years ago when such a trend was not at all prevalent ? Sure , Wi-Fi is a solution , but it is unsuitable for some of today 's bandwidth hungry applications such as high-definition or 4K video streaming . Of course you could hire someone to cover your home completely with super-high-speed Wi-Fi which is available today , but the costs can approach and even surpass those of re-cabling from scratch . How can we enjoy a similar quality of Internet connectivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabling throughout ? Is there a cheaper solution ? <p> Power-line communication is a method that allows you to use the internal electrical cabling of your home to carry data in addition to the AC power it already provides . In essence , it allows you to have a network jack wherever you have a main socket . Just plug in a Power-line device at your Internet modem and another wherever you want to have a network jack and you instantly have a wired connection to the Internet . In the past , the cost was too high and the quality was too low . Recently , however , this technology has improved drastically and even though it may be known as the poor man 's structured cabling , its performance can be exceptional . It all depends on the quality of your electrical cabling . If it 's up to British standards from an accredited British cable supplier for example , then the quality of the network is expected to approach that of a conventional structured cabling infrastructure . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

So when offered the opportunity to review a unique cutting board by Epicurean , I could n't wait to try it out ! <p> Epicureanis known for using innovative materials to make their top-quality products for the kitchen .

These cutting boards are made right here in the USA from layers of non-porous wood fibers compressed with a food safe resin . The boards are NSF certified , and their non-porous surface makes them easy to clean and prevents them from harboring bacteria .

I love that there is a hole for hanging the board in the upper corner , and the shape looks exactly like my home state . I have used mine several times since it arrived , and it still looks brand new . When reading on the Epicurean site about how to care for my new cutting board , I noticed that although the boards are stain-resistant , you need to be careful with highly alkaline products or foods . You do n't  want to leave them on the board for a prolonged amount of time or they may leave marks ( as they would with any cutting board ) . This includes things like liver , papayas and red beets . So far I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from steak to red onion . <p> The only things I wish Epicurean would have done differently was to put something on the backside to keep it from sliding around on the counter while I slice and dice . Thankfully , this was easily resolved by purchasing some of those small , round rubber dots and sticking a few on the backside of the board . They are very inexpensive and work perfectly , holding the board securely in place . Aside from that , this cute and fun cutting board serves its purpose well and looks great doing so ! In summary , I absolutely love my State Shape cutting board , and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality cutting board that will not only last for years , but adds a bit of fun to your kitchen decor , too ! <p> The Epicurean State Shape boards make for a great conversation piece , and they are perfect for showing your state pride .

@@29515446 @3215446/ <p> Last year I shared with you one of my favorite ways to make smoothies using the Tribest Mason Jar Personal Blender . This year I 'm back to tell you about another Tribest favorite of mine , the Dynablend Horsepower Plus Blender ! <p> In addition to its sleek , modern stainless steel body and design , the Tribest Dynablend Horsepower Plus blender is one of the most powerful blenders Ive owned . With a 1.1 horsepower motor , and a max speed of 23,000 RPM , it makes quick work of pretty much anything you want to blend . It is very easy to use , and comes with a great heavy-duty , tempered glass pitcher instead of the plastic one like most blenders have today . <p> One of the first things that caught my eye about this blender was both the manual and automatic settings . In addition to a manual variable speed dial ( which you can set anywhere from low to high ) , there are also 3 convenient pre-programmed , automatic settings including 60-second blend , 30-second pulse , or 60-second blend and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to obtain the exact texture you want whether making sauces or smoothies . <p> The blender comes with a detailed instruction manual that also includes several delicious-sounding recipes for drinks , soups , salsas , pesto , puddings and more . You also get a super nice stainless steel utility scoop that actually acts as a multi-purpose tool . Use it as a tablespoon sized measuring spoon or as an agitator , or to sample , stir , and add ingredients while in use ! In addition to the scoop , you also get an extra seal and a tool for replacing the seal if need be . <p> When you plug the blender in , you will notice that an LED light continuously blinks . Then , once you turn the blender on , that light remains lit . This is a great safety feature that can remind us to unplug it- especially when small kids are around . The tempered glass pitcher is nice and heavy , yet it is still easy to remove from the blenders body and attach back on . The lid stays on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouring . <p> Over the last several months , I 've used this blender for all kinds of things including pureeing soup , making smoothies , and even grinding coffee beans ! One of my favorite things to make are fruit smoothies using frozen fruit . So far Ive been quite impressed with how quick and powerful the blender really is , pulverizing the rock hard fruit without a problem . Admittedly it is a bit loud , but the speed and power more than make up for that . <p> I also love how easy the controls are to use , and the fact that it has both automatic and manual pulse ! The only drawback I 've found so far is that the blade can not be removed for cleaning so you have to be super careful when washing . Plus , it is not dishwasher safe . However , you can always use a long handled brush to clean , and then fill the pitcher with hot water , put it back on the blender and let it run for a minute or so . After rinsing , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I absolutely love this blender and would recommend it to anyone wanting a professional grade blender without the high price . And did I mention that the Tribest Dynablend Horsepower Plus blender also comes with a 10 year warranty ? ! <p> I do want to mention one more thing before I go . Be sure to read the instruction manual before use . It is recommended you clean this blender prior to use due to the high speed motor which can cause an odd smell . I did notice this smell at first , but after cleaning it and then running it several times ( it took me about 5 times total ) with water in the pitcher according to the instructions , the smell went away completely . I 've had no problems with it since . <p> The Tribest Dynablend Horsepower Plus blender is available online through the Tribest site and through Amazon . <p> UPDATE : I recently went to check the price on the blender , and noticed several poor reviews . This actually surprised me as I 've been using this blender now for at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If , however , anything changes with this , I will definitely come back and update this review . <p> The most common complaint was a breakage issue with the plastic blades under the pitcher when blending ice or other hard items . I did find one review that suggested you should hold down the canister ( by hand ) when you start blending frozen fruits or ice to avoid breakage problems . <p> Do you have a favorite recipe you use with your blender ?

If a life or death situation ever happens to our loved ones or us , the stress alone can send us into a massive state of panic , and in a situation where every second is vital , we need to be in control of our emotions . And that is a tough thing to do when it 's someone you love . In fact , it 's part of our biology going back to when we were cave people . When we were faced with something like a bear attack , our body pumps a stress hormone called cortisol through our system , which gives us the energy to run away . You might have heard of the fight or flight syndrome . But in the modern world , we cant run away from these situations , not when someone we love needs us and needs us to remain focused !

@@29515458 @3215458/ <h> Char Crust : Delectable Dry Rub Seasonings 130178 @qwx330178 <h> Review and Giveaway ! <p> Have you ever had one of those perfectly cooked delicious steaks where the outside is slightly charred and the inside is so moist and delectable ? Now there is a way to get that same taste in the comfort of your own kitchen , even without using a grill ! Char Crust Dry Rub Seasonings ! Chicago , 1957 , Al Farber 's Steak House was a place of legendary seasoned steaks , lightly charred on the outside , while juicy and delectable on the inside . After closing in 1977 , the family continued to sell their two original special blended dry rubs for which they had become so well known , the Original Hickory Grilled ( originally just called Char Crust ) and the Roto Rub . By 1998 , the original owners son and his new wife , after much prompting , introduced their Char Crust retail line including both the original rubs as well as an three additional flavors . <p> Today Char Crust is sold nationwide and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavors including Hickory &amp; Molasses , Sun Dried Tomato &amp; Garlic , Amazin Cajun and many more ! Yet despite their success , they still stick to the original way of making their rubs in small batches at a time , using only the freshest herbs and spices . Char Crust generously let me pick out two rubs to review . After much deliberation , I decided to try the Teriyaki Ginger and the Original Hickory Grilled . Teriyaki Ginger What They Say : The taste of sweet teriyaki with fragrant shoga ( ginger ) . Great on shrimp , chicken and steak . What I Say : This has the most incredible taste ! It was not too sweet , nor did it have too much of a bite of ginger . I used it on pork chops and vegetables . <p> Teriyaki Pork Chops <p> Original Hickory Grill What They Say : Rich hickory grilled flavor , enhances the meat 's natural flavor without overwhelming . Also great on chicken , tuna steaks and veggies . What I Say : The perfect blend of hickory and salt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used it on chicken and pork chops , next will be steak ! <p> Original Hickory Grilled on Chicken Breasts <p> Char Crust was extremely easy to use ! I just poured some of the rub in a bowl and dredged the meat through it on both sides . Then I lightly drizzled olive oil on top to prevent the spices from burning . I choose to broil the meat under the broiler , and while it was cooking , I flipped it from side to side a few times until it was cooked all the way through . The smell was incredible while it cooked , and had my husband and son asking when it would be done ! The first time I cooked with it , I had to laugh when my son asked why I had burned it so badly ! The rub cooks to where it literally looks like a charred-crust ' , so I can see why he thought it was burned ! However , the crust has absolutely no burned taste at all , and the meat inside is so moist and juicy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A BOWL &amp; DREDGE THE MEAT ON BOTH SIDES <p> PLACE ON FOIL-LINED BROILER PAN <p> BROIL , FLIPPING MEAT OCCASIONALLY UNTIL COOKED THROUGH <p> FLAVORFUL CRISPY OUTSIDE WHILE JUICY &amp; TENDER INSIDE <p> Using Char Crust to flavor vegetables is also a cinch ! I choose to use the Teriyaki flavor with a blend of Asian-type frozen vegetables including water chestnuts , broccoli , red bell pepper , snow peas and more . Once the veggies were thawed , I put the in a bowl , drizzled a bit of Olive Oil over them , then sprinkled with Char Crust and tossed to blend . I then put them onto a foil lined cookie sheet , set the oven to 425 degrees and baked them for about 10 to 12 minutes until they were cooked through . The result ? An incredibly delicious Teriyaki-flavored side dish ! I definitely recommend Char Crust ! It is so easy to use and there are many different ways you can use it too ! You can bake , broil or grill both meats and vegetables for a menu full of fantastic flavored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes for $5.49 each .

@@29515459 @3215459/ <h> Top- Safety Features for Family Vehicles <h> Buying a New Family Car ? Consider These Top Safety Features for Family Vehicles <p> Your family is one of your main considerations when it comes to buying a new car . You want a car that is not only large enough , comfortable , and roomy , but also safe . Below are several of the top safety features for family vehicles you should consider when looking for a new family car . <h> High crash test scores <p> While a test score is n't exactly a safety feature , it is extremely important as it gives you an idea of the protection offered by the vehicle . There are two types of ratings you will want to look for . The first is either a four-or-five-star crash test rating on both front and side impact tests from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) . The second is a " Good " rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ( IIHS ) for 40-mph frontal offset and side-impact tests . This particular test is designed to measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an SUV or pickup truck . <h> Front Airbags <p> The second safety feature worth considering is a front airbag system . While many vehicles come with standard airbags , take it a step further and look for one with Advanced Frontal Airbags . These particular airbag systems have sensors that take into consideration factors such as occupant size , position of the seats , and the severity of the crash to determine the level at which both the driver and passenger front airbags will inflate . Not only are these airbag systems better designed than current airbags when it comes to saving lives , they also help reduce the risk of airbag-related injuries or death to children and small-framed adults . <h> Side-impact and side curtain airbags <p> In addition to front airbags , also look for vehicles that offer side-impact and side curtain airbags . The side-impact airbags are mounted in either the seat backs or the doors and offer protection to the upper body/torso during side-impact crashes . Side curtain airbags ( also known as head curtain airbags ) often run the length of the cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These systems also work to protect occupants in case of a rollover by helping to keep everyone inside the vehicle . <h> Stability Control <p> A vehicles stability control system uses sensors to monitor how closely your vehicles path matches your intended path based on steering , throttle and braking . When needed , this system can actually apply braking forces to individual wheels and reduce engine power to help prevent skidding and sliding . It also helps the driver maintain control during emergency maneuvers , and really comes in handy on vehicles with a higher center of gravity . <h> Antilock Braking System ( ABS ) <p> Antilock braking systems prevent your vehicles brakes from locking up by rapidly applying intermittent brake pressure . As you know , a locked-up wheel ( or wheels ) will slide and cause you to be unable to steer around potentially dangerous collision . ABS helps give the driver more steering control as well as allows for shorter stopping distances on slippery surfaces . <h> Tire-pressure monitoring system <p> In most cases when a tire fails it is due to it being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checking your tire pressure , a tire pressure monitoring system can help by letting you know via a dashboard warning light when a tire is low on pressure . <h> Rear parking sensors or rear-mounted camera <p> Unfortunately , back-over accidents are becoming more and more common , especially in larger vehicles and mini-vans . Children and pets are the most common victims . To help avoid this happening , look for a vehicle that offers either a rear-view camera or rear parking sensors . The camera allows you to easily see what is directly behind you , and in some cases around the entire car . The rear parking sensors will alert you via audible beeps if you are getting close to an object behind you . Some systems use pillar-mounted light displays as well . <h> Child Seat Compatibility <p> Something all parents should have in mind when choosing a car is your childs safety seat compatibility . In fact , when looking for a new car , bring the seat along so you can install it during a test drive . All 2002 and up vehicles come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) system standard in the backseat . This provides a more secure means of installation for child safety seats through the use of tethers . In addition , newer vehicles come with Automatic Locking Retractor/Emergency Locking Retractor ( ALR/ELR ) seatbelts which allows parents to lock down safety seats without tethers , and provides an added measure of safety for those that do . <h> Automatic crash notification <p> Although no one likes to think about it , if the worst happens and you and your family are in an accident , you will want to ensure that help arrives as fast as possible . Many vehicles today offer what is known as an onboard automatic crash notification system . Some of the most common ones include OnStar , Lexuss Lexus Link , and BMWs BMW Assist . These systems will automatically summon emergency assistance , and will identify your location to rescue personnel . They can also be used for common roadside assistance such as flat tires or breakdowns . <p> Kids are our most precious cargo , so when shopping for a new family car , I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicles ! 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

If you sit down and think about it for a while , it 's pretty amazing what our bodies can do . But more often than not e take these super senses for granted and assume they 'll be with us for life . It 's only when our vision starts to go blurry , or we have to ask people to repeat something they have said , that worries start to set in . Inevitably , as we age , our some of our senses diminish slightly . But putting a plan in place to look after god 's gifts now can certainly help halt any deterioration . Below is a breakdown of the five senses and what you can do to maintain their health . <h> Sight <p> The medical term for our sight is ophthalmoception . Sight gives us the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Losing this sense can be extremely scary . Maintain good eye health by visiting your optometrist once a year . If you wear contact lenses that are daily , never sleep in them . Sleeping in contacts stops oxygen getting to your eyes . It can also cause bacterial infections that can become very serious and result in vision loss . Antioxidants can help eye health , so make sure to include green leafy vegetables in your diet , as well as oily fish , eggs , and brightly colored fruit . Maintain regular physical exercise even in older age . High blood pressure , diabetes and narrowing arteries can all lead to vision loss . So stay healthy ! <h> Sound <p> The medical term for our hearing is known as audioception . It is a mechanical sense that works with the notion of vibrations .

If you use headphones , avoid ear plugs and go with large headphones instead . But still always keep the volume at 60% or less of the highest option available . You can take a hearing check test online here if you have concerns . <h> Taste And Smell <p> The medical term for taste is called gustation and smell is known as olfaction . Our sense of smell is vital for protecting us against dangers such as smoke , fire , gas and bad food . To protect this sense always get your sinuses checked for any infections . Avoid smoking as this can drastically change your sense of odors . And if you are on medications and notice a change in your sense of smell , let your doctor know as they may be able to alter your meds . Taste can be affected by a lack of vitamin B-1 and zinc , so always make sure you have enough of these nutrients in your diet . And also keep hydrated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Touch <p> Touch is known as somatosensory in the medical field . It works by using neural receptors found in hair follicles , the throat , and the tongue . If you lose your sense of touch , it is known as tactile anesthesia . This can be very distressing as we use touch for everything from kissing to typing and hugging to protecting ourselves from the heat and cold . Keep the nerve fibers in your body healthy by avoiding smoking , eating healthily and stocking up on B-12 rich foods . If you are allowed to , take aspirin to dilate blood cells and help improve your circulation . Always check with a medical professional before changing medication . And always wear gloves and warm socks if you are going out in cold weather . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

There are several simple steps you can take to make your current car more fuel-efficient . Here are 5 easy ways to make your car more fuel efficient . <h> 1 . Get Rid of that Lead Foot <p> It may seem obvious , but if you drive with a lead foot speeding , taking off from red lights at warp speed , you are wasting gas . Likewise , by avoiding heavy braking you can also avoid unnecessary trips to the gas station . Research suggests that driving techniques can actually influence fuel efficiency by as much as 30 percent ! Drive steadily without frequently slowing down or speeding up and you will be on the right road to improving your vehicles fuel efficiency . When appropriate , use your cruise control .

Avoid Idling <p> Did you know that by letting your vehicle idle you can end up consuming anywhere between half-a-gallon to one gallon of gas per hour ? Not to mention all that needless CO2 you are pumping into the atmosphere ! With older cars , people were taught that it was better to let the car idle than to keep turning it off and on . Todays engines are built to where they consume less fuel turning off and restarting as opposed to idling . Additionally , todays cars do not need to sit and idle in order to warm up during the cold winter months . Instead , to warm up the engine , just to start the engine , wait for around 20 seconds and drive on . <h> 3 . Tire Pressure <p> You should check your tire pressure at least once a month , more during the cold months of winter .

In fact , a poorly maintained vehicle can actually burn up to 30 percent more fuel than when it is properly maintained . When it comes to fuel efficiency , there are several components that play a key role including the air filter , oxygen sensor , spark plugs , and fuel injectors .

@@29515466 @3215466/ <h> Support Aging Parents By Not Making These Common Caregiver Mistakes <h> 8 Common Caregiver Mistakes to Avoid <p> It can be quite distressing watching our parents ' heath fail and see them struggle with day to day tasks . But this is where you can step in and help them out . Lots of adults look after their aging parents and care for them as much as possible . However , this is n't an easy task , and it can often cause arguments between parents and children . Especially if the parents still think that they can manage on their own . But regardless of whether you argue and bicker , it is still important that you stay by your parents ' side to care for them and help them when it is needed . <p> One reason why there is so much tension between parents and the children who are caring for them is that this is a role reversal . Your parents will have been used to looking after you and caring for you all of your lives , but now that responsibility has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be responsible for them instead . Many parents can find this change hard to take . Not only that , though , but they also find it hard to come to terms with their ailing health and newfound difficulty doing everyday tasks and activities . But another reason for all this stress and tension is that the children can often make some mistakes and say the wrong things to their aging parents . Here are some common pitfalls that you should try to avoid when supporting aging parents . <h> Do n't Force Them To Do Anything That They Ca n't <p> Some adults find it difficult to notice when their parents can not do tasks and jobs that they once did with ease . If you find that one of your parents is struggling with something , you should n't persuade them to try harder . They are probably already trying pretty hard , but their old age and reduced mental capacity are probably holding them back ! For instance , you might think that changing a lightbulb is n't too difficult , But it is for an elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to carry on and try harder , you should step in and do the small job for them . Otherwise , they could end up getting very frustrated and stressed out <h> Do n't Get Annoyed When They Forget Things <p> We all forget things every now and then . And this becomes a lot more frequent the older that we get . So the chances are that your elderly parents will be forgetting things a lot more often than what they once did . The worst thing you can do in this situation is to get annoyed with them for always forgetting . If you do lose your temper with them over this , it will only upset them . You just need to be very understanding and remind them how to do certain things or where they placed something . If they continually forget to do tasks such as use their DVD player or tune the radio , it might be worth printing out some instructions that they can always refer to . <h> You Do n't Figure Out Your Own Limitations <p> Looking after your elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot out of you emotionally wise . Lots of people think that they can manage on their own , and stretch themselves in order to hold down a full-time job , look after their own family , and care for their elderly parents . However , none of us are superheroes , and this often becomes way too much for one individual to handle . For this reason , it is important that you know what your own limitations are . Not knowing this , and taking on too much , can lead to you getting very stressed and suffering a burnout . So you need to work out what your limitations are and stick to them . You might find it easier if you share the responsibility of caring for your parents by splitting it with your siblings . It is also important to know that there might be a time when they need to go into a care home for the best possible healthcare and treatment . If you feel that the time for this has come now , you can always look for the perfect home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caring For Your Parents For Praise <p> When you decide to care for your elderly parents , it is important that you are doing it for completely altruistic reasons . Namely , these should be to ensure your parents continue to have a happy and healthy life . Unfortunately , some people only care for their parents just because they think that this good deed will bring them a lot of praise and will put them in the high esteems of their peers . They may also expect their parents to praise them for taking care for them . However , if you do it for these reasons , your heart is n't likely to be in the right place , and you will find that you may not do things to the best of your ability . Instead , make sure that you are doing it because it is the right thing to do <h> Do n't Ignore Them <p> When you were in your twenties and thirties , you probably did n't call your parents that often . You might have even only visited them a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that age , as you have your own life to lead , and your parents would have been perfectly fine on their own living their own life . However , now that they are elderly , it is n't quite so acceptable to ignore them for this same length of time . In fact , you will find that you have to check up on them a lot more regularly . Ideally , you should visit them at least twice a week , and aim to call them every other day . You might even call them every day just for your own peace of mind . So if you have n't spoken to them in a while , it may be time to pick up your phone . I 'm sure that they will be very happy to hear your voice and know that you are thinking about them ! <h> You Do n't Emphasize With Them <p> Your parents will be struggling with their aging just as much as you are . In fact , they could possibly be taking it a lot worse than you are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents to try and understand the emotions and feelings that they are currently going through . Sure , there will be days when they are moody and frustrated . But this is because they are annoyed that they are not as young and healthy as they once were all the negative energy certainly is n't directed at you ! Once you understand where they are coming from and are empathetic , you will find you can handle their mood swings a lot more effectively . Not only that , but you will become a lot more sympathetic . <h> Their Home Is Still Full Of Risks And Hazards <p> Your elderly parents will probably struggle with mobility problems . This will make it increasingly difficult for them to walk around their home . Things like steps and stairs will be extremely difficult for them to get up and down . Thankfully , there is plenty that you can do to make things easier for them around the house . For instance , you should try and remove as many risks and hazards as possible . There are also plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it easier for them to get around and do their everyday tasks . One of the best adaptations is a stair lift . You can get one of these fitted to the main staircase in the house so that your parents can easily get up and down the stairs whenever they need to . <h> You 're Encouraging Them To Stay At Home <p> You may think that if your elderly parents stay at home , they might be out of the way of potential hazards and accidents . However , this is n't the case , and you should encourage them to be as active as possible . If they keep up a good social life and get out of the house often , they will be getting exercise , which can help them to keep their health and fitness levels up . Not only that , though , but it will also help them to maintain good mental health . Whenever possible , you should take them on days out . Even if it is just a quick visit to a nearby cafe , it will certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too bored at home . <p> Looking after your elderly parents will be a big challenge that you will face sooner or later .

@@29515470 @3215470/ <h> Helping The Entire Family Deal With The Loss Of Pet <p> Dealing with the loss of a pet can be an incredibly difficult time for you and your family . From your partner to your children , to your own parents , everyone will process the loss differently . So , how can you help your entire family with this ? How can you make sure that you yourself have time to grieve and process . This guide aims to help with this and give you some tips on helping the entire family deal with the loss of a pet . <p> Many psychologists and specialists in this area say the same thing about explaining the death to children . They insist that honesty is imperative and that you must also be very clear about what has happened . There is no use in using euphemisms or dancing around the issue because this can cause confusion . Be sure that your child understands that lost ' does n't mean they might be coming back . If your pet has been dealing with health issues for some time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are no longer feeling any pain . <p> Finding a way to memorialize your pet can also help every member of the family get closure on the loss . There are a number of ways you can do this . The traditional way it to bury your pet in your back garden , or another outdoor space closeby your home . A tombstone , a tree or a plant can mark the spot . Pet cremation is now also a popular option and allows to keep your pets ashes . From here there are a number of options for you and your family to discuss . You can turn your pets ashes to diamond items , such as a piece of jewellery . You may be surprised just how many options are available to you in this respect . You can pick the colour and even the cut of the diamond , so it becomes exactly the item that you want . <p> Whenever and however you decide to memorialize your pet , also use this time to express your feelings verbally . Go round the family and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they are feeling by setting a good example . Sharing a favourite memory of your pet , and expressing how much you will miss them , is a popular format for this . Afterwards , a sense of peace and finality can be achieved . <p> For many animal-loving families , getting a new pet might be an early consideration . However , when families are ready to take this step can vary dramatically . Whatever you do , do n't make any decisions in a rush . Getting a new pet too soon will cause problems with your own grieving process . It is also not fair on your new pet , as you may not be able to give them the attention and affection they deserve . Explain to younger family members that you are not replacing their old pet . Instead , explain it like you are getting a new friend . Liken it to their friendships at school . They make new friends even though they still love and care for their old friends . A new pet should be regarded in the same way . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

Oh , they had some slots for cards , a place for cash , and a pocket for coins , and even a little plastic sleeve for other cards and photos .

@@29515486 @3215486/ <h> Therafit Sandals Review and Giveaway ! Shoes for Women <p> One of my favorite things about Spring and Summer is that I can wear sandals and flip-flops ! I love the feeling of sunshine and open air on my feet . However , lately I have been having lots of problems with my feet , and was recently diagnosed with heel spurs and plantar fasciitis , which basically means many shoes , especially sandals and I no longer get along . For months now I have been searching for a pair of shoes that provide enough cushioning and arch support that I am able to walk long distances and stand on my feet for a decent period of time . I have tried everything from $130 shoes to $9 inserts , and while some relief has been found , I still can not be on my feet for long periods of time without my heels absolutely killing me . While searching the internet for solutions , I came across a site for shoes called Therafit , and they sounded exactly like what the doctor ordered ! Imagine how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review a pair of their sandals ! <p> Therafit shoes were created by Dr. Lisa Masterson who designed them specifically for women and the busy , active lifestyle we lead . Dr. Lisa understands how we are on our feet constantly , and for the majority of that time we are running around in shoes that are not conducive to that lifestyle , and as a result this leads to pain in the feet , legs , hips and back . Her goal was to create what she called the 12 hour shoe for the 12 hour day ; a shoe that was not only comfortable , but attractive enough to where women would want to wear it . The Therafit shoe line was born ; comfortable , stylish and attractive shoes that are accredited by the National Posture Institute , a leader in posture and body alignment programs and solutions . <p> These shoes are available in several different styles including work shoes , athletic shoes , walking shoes and sandals . Since I was looking for a warm weather shoe , I decided on a pair of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiffany , Sandy and Carly . The Tiffany Sandals are available in silver and black and feature a bit of " bling " along the strap for added style . The Sandy Sandal is more sporty and comes with a white sole and either a pink , blue or yellow strap . The Carly Sandal , my personal favorite , is more of a casual sandal that is available in brown or orange . <p> I choose the Carly Sandal because it can be worn easily with a sundress or skirt as well as with jeans or shorts . I choose it in brown since it would match more of my clothes . These sandals have a light brown sole with a dark brown leather strap . On the strap is a laser cut flower that is the perfect size , not so big as to be tacky , and not so small to be unnoticeable . Now for the best part the level of comfort . <p> Like all Therafit shoes , the contoured midsoles of the sandals are made up of multiple layers and densities to provide cushioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With every step you take , these layers also distribute the shock from impact downward and outward instead of your foot absorbing it . <p> Therafit shoes also utilize an innovative Personal Comfort System ( PCS ) technology which allows you to adjust the level of cushioning in the heel area by removing one or more of three adapters from the outsole . These specially designed adapters resemble pegs and are quite easy to remove , you just push from one side , grasp the end of the adapter on the other side and twist while pulling . Adding or removing the adapters allows for an increase or decrease in impact resistance . <p> For even more comfort , the sandals have 86 reflexology nodules , or little bumps all over the footbed which similar to acupuncture put pressure on certain points of your foot helping to loosen tension and even improve circulation . A deep heel bed allows for even more support , stability and comfort . <p> The first time I put these sandals on I could immediately tell a huge difference . Where with other sandals it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or support , the Therafit sandals feel as though they are conforming to the shape of the bottom of my feet . The midsole is supporting my arch allowing my weight to be more evenly distributed , where with other sandals it feels as though all of my weight is being supported on my heels and the balls of my feet . The heel is definitely where I needed to find some relief , and these sandals do exactly that .

@@29515490 @3215490/ <p> You might not know that fish is one of the best foods for our body . The high-protein and low-fat food have a wide array of health benefits . It can help maintain our cardiovascular health and prevent blood clotting . It also is essential to prevent arthritis in later life . And as for mental health , it has been found to help reduce depression . A lot of people get confused as to what fish is the best one to eat ; you should try salmon , mackerel , and sardines ! And families are often unsure on how to add it to their weekly diet . After all , kids often turn up their nose to a plate of salmon . Therefore , here are some easy ways to add fish to your family 's meal plan this week ! <h> Go international with your food choices <p> It 's time to bring a bit of culture to your dinner .

Not only will it teach your kids about cuisines around the food , but it will ensure they are getting plenty of fish in their diet . <h> Head to a fish restaurant <p> You can get your kids excited about eating fish this week by heading out to a fish restaurant . That way , they will be more inclined to try some fish dishes . To choose a great restaurant , you should make sure you check the menu in advance .

You might want to make a prawn sauce which would be ideal with a salad . Or you could make a pasta dish with tuna sauce . It 's a popular choice which your kids will love . By hiding fish in sauces , picky kids will eat up without knowing they are eating the protein-filled goodness . <p> You can also add fish to your child 's sandwiches for lunch .

Giveaway ! 130178 @qwx330178 <p> Cleaning has never been one of my favorite things to do , especially cleaning the bathroom , or more specifically , cleaning the toilet ! I am always seeking something to make that particular chore easier and needing to be done less frequently ! So when I was given the opportunity to review Soft Scrub 4-in-1 Toilet Care , I jumped at the chance ! <p> If you have ever used any Soft Scrub product , then you know how well it cleans with very little elbow grease on your part . The new 4-in-1 Toilet Care takes almost all of the dirty work out of cleaning your potty ! This innovative toilet bowl cleaner combines four elements into one : it cleans the toilet bowl , prevents future build-up , fights toilet bowl ring and freshens/deodorizers , all for up to four long weeks ! And all you have to do is attach it to the rim of the toilet bowl , and your job is finished ! <p> Attaching the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook it around the toilet bowl rim . You want to adjust it to make sure the cage holding the four balls of cleanser and freshener are directly in the flow of water when the toilet is flushed . Put the seat back down , close the lid and that is it ! Keep an eye on it , and once the hanger cage is completely empty , it is time to replace . <p> I was quite impressed with Soft Scrub 's 4 in 1 Toilet Care ! Like all Soft Scrub products , it is very tough on stains , easily removing toilet bowl ring , water stains and more each time you flush the toilet . I have used similar products before , but none that had all the features of this one and worke <p> First Day of Use <p> Not only does it clean , but it also releases a fresh , clean-smelling scent constantly .

Its cleaning power did not fade after just a few flushes , and it does not turn the water blue either ( I personally do not like products that do that ) . <p> Three and a Half Weeks Later ( no cleaning of the inside on my part ) <p> Another difference I noticed was that the Soft Scrub rim hanger actually stayed in place exactly where I had placed it . The hanger attached perfectly to the rim , and stayed in the stream of water where I had originally placed it . I did n't have to continuously adjust it , or bend the hook part of the hanger in an attempt to get the correct angle for the cage to be in the flow of water . <p> Best of all , after nearly four weeks without any cleaning on my part ( of the inside ) the toilet bowl remained clean , bright white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be quite impressed as well , especially when I tell you the price ! For a little less than $2.00 at Wal-Mart , you too , can enjoy a clean toilet bowlwith very little effort on your part ! <p> Soft Scrub 4-in-1 Toilet care is available in two formulas and scents . Alpine Fresh has all the cleaning power of Soft Scrub plus the extra whitening power of bleach . Sapphire Waters , the one I reviewed , also has the great cleaning power of Soft Scrub without any added bleach . <p> You can find Soft Scrub 4-in-1 Toilet Care at your local mass merchandiser , drug store and grocery , as well as at many online sites .

The problem is that festival fashion can be hard to get right . You want to look cute , quirky and elegantly cool while ensuring that you 're dressed to battle the elements should you have to . So , to ensure that your outfits are on point , I 've put together this handy guide to festival fashion . <h> Pack a capsule wardrobe <p> First things first , a capsule wardrobe is a must .

Not only are they annoying and uncomfortable , they can also be quite painful . While UTIs are quite common , affecting more than 7 million individuals a year , if you are a female , then unfortunately , you are more susceptible than a man . In fact , statistically speaking , one in three women will experience their first UTI by age 25 , and 50% of us will experience a UTI at some point in our lifetime !

Hot flashes , night sweats , mood swings and missed periods are among the most obvious and common . However , many are surprised to also experience Urinary Tract Infections .

@@29515500 @3215500/ <h> Best Advice For Your Bad Back <p> Most of us do n't even think about our backs until they give us trouble . Then it is the end of the world . Back pain can be excruciating and debilitating . Our spines are central to everything we do . All the muscles that connect to them play a part in every movement we make . Even a small move when you are suffering from back pain can feel like a catastrophe . Pity the poor parent who has to lift a child or groceries or even climb a set of stairs . Back pain can affect any region of the back . Most commonly it is felt in the upper back and neck regions and also in the lower back . What are the best ways to deal with these types of back pain and how can we prevent them happening in the first place ? Here are a few thoughts on what you can do for a bad back . <p> Preventing back pain <p> We might notice that as a rule children do not suffer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They may not suffer from other types of degenerative pains and illnesses either , but we can learn something . That is , the lifestyle we lead must somehow contribute to our trouble . <p> Fitness <p> This is not to say that being unfit is a direct cause of back trouble , but it certainly does not help ! Many of us can say that we are not as fit as we should be . If that is the case and being that way is not helping any back problems , then it is fair to say that we could do something abot that . That might involve losing some excess weight for example . It could involve being more active in terms of walking , running , taking stairs and swimming . <p> All of these activities and indeed any aerobic activity will help to she 'd the pounds . It may be that you could join a gym or start attending a class in Pilates . It may be that you can invest in some home fitness equipment and start your own regime . Whatever it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall health will be and the more flexible you will become . In general , the fitter you are , the less back trouble you will experience . Having said that , some fitness regimes may not help you if you are already suffering and in pain . <p> The way we sit and lie <p> More than one wise observer has commented that the way we sit in the West has a direct effect on the level of back trouble we experience . It is very simplistic to suggest that everyone who squats because of a lack of furniture has no back trouble . But there is some truth to the fact that we often sit badly for very long periods of time . This certainly is not helping our posture and possibly is exacerbating the trouble . There are two areas of concern ; both affect different areas of the back . <p> The first deals with the lower back region . The vast majority of our soft seating furniture is bad for our backs . You could correct that a little bit to say that the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact remains that slumping into soft sofas while watching TV can not be healthy for any spine . Instead , we should be sitting upright and supporting ourselves especially in the region of the lower back . <p> The other area that we should be addressing is the bed we are sleeping on . It is a sad fact that many of us assume that the bed we have is sufficient . Its a mattress , and I will lie on it , ' is not the most enlightened viewpoint . It does n't seem to matter that we might not be sleeping that well or that we have back trouble directly as a result of this assumption . The fact is your mattress should be supporting you extraordinarily well . That old mattress that we bought as a bargain some years ago is more than likely not helping you at all . <p> We should be investing in the best mattress we can afford and trying understand how that can help our posture and even alleviate back ache . Take a look some contemporary mattresses such as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make and model . You will find that there is a tremendous amount of technology and development that has gone into producing a quality mattress . One that can give you the right amount of support . For most of us , that is far firmer than we might think . <p> Support , while you sleep , is vital . That also extends to the pillow that you are using to support your head and neck . If those pillows are too high they will be pushing your head up and not allowing your neck the support it needs . Find the right pillow and your spine and back will thank you for it . <p> The way we work <p> If you are in a physical job involving lifting heavy weights , it can take a toll on your back . If this is your profession , you probably know how to lift without straining your back . Sadly many of us who are not so wise regularly try to lift things at home that are too heavy . Either that or we simply lift badly . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this , you will take the pressure off your back . If the weight is taken in the lower back , then you will suffer . <p> If you are already suffering from back pain , you should take the advice of a professional . The people best placed to answer your questions and give you advice are specialists who have studied anatomy . They include Physiotherapists and Chiropractors . Massage can help muscles relax and release stiffness . Yoga is often recommended for sufferers because it is a gentle way of stretching and releasing that most of us can do at home on a daily basis . A little light exercise is beneficial for a bad back , which is essentially where we began . The best cure is , of course , going to be prevention .

In particular , getting kids to the dentist and getting them to care about oral hygiene can be trying . Many children are afraid of dental checkups and do n't  yet understand the importance of taking care of their teeth . Weve talked briefly about how to ensure your kids have healthy teeth , but parents also wonder how best to get their children acclimated to the process of going to see the dentist regularly , brushing their teeth , etc. and there is plenty of useful information out there to help . <p> To begin , a note about when you should first take your child to the dentist . A common misconception is that since baby teeth will fall out anyway , its not important to take your child to the dentist until their permanent teeth appear . This line of thinking can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing baby teeth to decay and go uncared for increases the likelihood of decay in permanent teeth . In fact , the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends taking your child for their first dentist visit before their first birthday . <p> The dentists office can be a scary prospect for a youngster , though , so finding a kid-friendly dentist with ample experience is key to helping your child feel comfortable . To further ease them into the idea of visiting the dentist , have them meet with the dentist on the first visit , who then ( if they are competent and good with kids ) can calmly explain to a child what they will be doing during the appointment . Kids can catch on pretty quickly , and when you take the time to explain things to them , they can generally take it to heart . Besides , they might become genuinely intrigued hearing about rotary toothbrushes , fluoride coating , and cavity creeps . <p> During that first visit , stay with them to provide reassurance if possible , and answer any questions your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visit is over , congratulate them on being well-behaved , and hook them up with a prize . Most dentists offices have a nice goodie jar that kids can choose a trinket from , further associating the dentist with something positive as opposed to an ordeal to be suffered through . <p> Its also important not to transmit any of your own hang-ups or negative vibes about visiting the dentist to your child . Your kids can pick up a surprising amount of your negative energy , and that includes feelings about visiting the dentist . Remember , your role should be to support your child through their visit , not transplant your cynical fears to their impressionable mind . <p> Once the hard work at the doctors office is through , you 'll need to start instilling good oral hygiene habits . Here are some helpful initial hints : Diet is first and foremost . Sugary snacks stick to teeth and increase the risk for decay , so discourage the overindulgence of these sorts of treats in favor of healthier options . Encourage your child to cease all sucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lastly , help your child brush their teeth properly , twice a day is a good start . Use a soft , kid-sized brush and a small , pea-sized amount of toothpaste . Remember the golden rules of proper brushing technique : <p> 1 ) Place your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to the gums . <p> 2 ) Gently move the brush back and forth in short ( tooth-wide ) strokes . <p> 3 ) Brush the outer surfaces , the inner surfaces , and the chewing surfaces of the teeth . <p> 4 ) To clean the inside surfaces of the front teeth , tilt the brush vertically and make several up-and-down strokes . <p> 5 ) Brush your tongue to remove bacteria and keep your breath fresh . <p> And there you have it !

If you , like me , find yourself longing for your favorite fried foods , but do n't  want the fat and grease that goes along with it , give the Rosewill Air Fryer a try . <p> I have to be honest and say that when I first heard about air fryers , I was a bit skeptical . I mean how could " frying " chicken in hot air give you that same crispy , crunchy texture and moist tender inside ? Or how could it give you that same light golden outside and soft , chewy inside for your favorite fries ? Despite my doubts though , I decided to give it a try in the hopes of finding the answer to the predicament of wanting fried foods but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> How Does the Rosewill Air Fryer Work ? <p> Instead of using hot oil to cook foods , the Rosewill Oil-Less Low Fat Air Fryer works by using hot air in combination with high-speed air circulation ( Rapid Air ) and a top grill . Basically you set your food inside the basket , adjust your time and temperature , and a mechanical fan then circulates the hot air 360- around the food at high-speed , ensuring that it cooks evenly , thoroughly and quickly . You can air fry all sorts of foods such as potato chips , french fries , chicken , fish , and even pastries . But the absolute best part is that air fried foods are much healthier than oil fried foods . For example , air fried French fries contain up to 80% less fat compared to fries prepared in a deep-fat fryer . In fact , when using an air fryer , many ingredients do n't  even require the use of oil at all while others call for only a small amount ! <p> The Rosewill Air Fryer is quite easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature , and then press the ON/OFF button to allow the appliance to preheat .

Be sure not to fill the basket past the max line printed on the baskets side . Keep in mind that with some foods you will still need to use a bit of oil , but nowhere near what deep-frying calls for . For example , when making homemade fries you will need to use about 1/2 Tbsp. oil . If you are not sure about times and temps , the included manual has a very helpful guide ! <p> You can use the air fryer for all sorts of foods including steaks , pork , spring rolls , frozen chicken nuggets , cakes , rolls , muffins , and so much more .

It will also tell you if you need to use oil or not . And if you need a quick reference guide , on the top of the Air Fryer there is a little metal plate that gives you cooking temps and times for some of the more common items you may be cooking . <p> So far we have used it for homemade fries , chicken , pork chops , and potato chunks , and all have turned out perfectly cooked and tasting delicious ! I have noticed that the cooking times are a bit longer , for example our tater tots took about 13 minutes as opposed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the excellent taste , the lack of oil , and the overall healthier way of eating is well worth the added time . <p> In addition to being easy to use , the Rosewill Air Fryer is also easy to clean up after . If you 've ever deep-fried foods then you know just how messy that method of cooking can be . Not only does the fryer itself need lots of cleaning , but over time the counter tops and anything else nearby gets covered in an oily residue . Since the Rosewill Air Fryer uses hot air circulation , there is no greasy mess left to deal with ! Instead , once finished , you simply remove the frying basket and tray and wash them using warm , soapy water . Or you can simply toss them both into the dishwasher . The air fryer itself is also easy to clean as the interior is non-stick and wipes right out with a slightly damp , clean cloth . <p> At just 12.6 by 10 by 12.8 inches , the Rosewill Air Fryer fits nicely on the counter top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cabinet . This particular model has a 2 quart capacity ( 2.4L ) , and features an LED display with glass panel .

@@29515508 @3215508/ <h> HangerJack More Room When You Need It A Review 130178 @qwx330178 <p> Living in an apartment it is near impossible to have enough space to do anything , especially when it comes to laundry . In this particular apartment , we made some sacrifices in order to be out of the city , surrounded by woods and have spacious rooms . And the rooms are spacious , all except for the bathroom and the kitchen . To make it worse , the washer and dryer are actually in the bathroom . Not in a closet in the bathroom , but right there , against the wall as you walk in . Because of this , I have had to be creative when it comes to doing the laundry and folding clothes . Usually I would grab the clothes out of the dryer , toss them on the bed and start folding . It was actually something of a race between me and the cat to see if I could get all of the warm , clean clothes hung up before they became her napping place . The majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have the HangerJack , and it has made my laundry life so much easier ! <p> The HangerJack is actually a very simple invention , nothing more than a bar with a spring-loaded hinge that you attach to the wall and pull into a horizontal position to hang clothes on as you fold your laundry . Once finished , just push it back down against the wall where it is completely out of the way . When you pull the HangerJack up , it will securely lock into place . The bar has ridges in it that will hold one or two hangers a piece so the hangers do n't  slide around , and it is capable of supporting up to 65 pounds ! It is 24 ? in length , which gives me plenty of room to hang all the clothes in a load . When you are ready to fold it back down , simply press the button on the underside to release the spring hinge and fold it back down . Who would have thought such a basic concept could be such a huge help ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it took maybe five minutes for my husband to put it up . He first marked the position for the holes , then inserted the butterfly anchors ( we installed on a wall with no studs . It does come with instructions and parts for use in walls with a stud , too ) . Next he attached the HangerJack to the wall using the screws , and that was it . Finished ! <p> I picked the perfect place for it , right on the outside bathroom wall , on the other side of which is the dryer . Now I can simply pull the clothes from the dryer , place them on top , and either hang or fold each piece of clothing . It has literally cut my folding time in half , and made putting clean clothes away so much easier ! <p> Of course the HangerJack can be used for plenty of other things as well . Use it in your garage to hang shovels or gardening tools , use it as a bike rack , use it as extra hanging space in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . You can find the Hanger Jack either though the HangerJack website or on Amazon . 130174 @qwx330174 130182 @qwx330182 130181 @qwx330181 <h> Comments <p> There are so many people over the world struggling with same problem you have over here it is typical to have similar situation even in a little older houses all in same , and very small bathroom .

How about a company that makes four different flavors of all natural peanut butter that is Gluten-Free , and a motto that says Peanut Butter with a Twist " ? If that sounds appetizing then you should check out PB Crave ! <p> PB Crave is an active participant in the Minnesota Keystone Initiative , and is committed to helping the fight against hunger by donating a minimum of 2 percent of the profits from each jar sold to Project Peanut Butter , a non-profit organization working to help malnourished children . They also donate funds to promote awareness of direct giving to the project as well . PB Crave is also dedicated to minimizing their impact environmentally . <p> PB Craves products are made from all natural ingredients and are both cholesterol and gluten-free . Each of the four flavors is created using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premium Belgium chocolates . Keep in mind , since this is an " all natural " peanut butter , the natural oil from the peanuts and the Palm Fruit Oil will separate from the peanut butter and other ingredients over time . This indicates there are no artificial preservatives or hydrogenated oils used in the product . If this occurs , simply mix it up again with a knife or spoon by twisting it around through the peanut butter . <p> Their four flavors include whimsical names such as Cookie Nookie , Choco Choco , Razzle Dazzle and Coco Bananas ! The peanut butter itself is very rich and creamy , more creamy than other peanut butters I have used , and it has a great fresh peanut-y taste . Each jar I opened had an aroma that perfectly matched the flavor ! Everyone in my family loves their fun twists on basic peanut butter , and we are guaranteed to never be bored again with a plain old peanut butter and jelly sandwich ! And now for the yummy part ! <p> My Description : remember eating banana and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jar , without that awful dry mouth ! Nice and creamy , rich-tasting peanut butter with a tad of sweetness from the honey , along with just the right amount of fresh banana taste . Natural tasting banana , not that fake , manufactured flavor ! <p> My Description : Definitely twisted ! If you like raspberries then you will find this to be a treat . As soon as you open the lid you can smell the raspberry flavoring . The peanut butter is rich and creamy and has a definite raspberry flavor along with a slight hint of both white and dark chocolate . <p> My Description : Delicious is the key word ! Again the peanut butter itself has a wonderfully rich and fresh peanut-y taste with a bit of honey-sweetness , and added to that is a perfectly portioned serving of semi-sweet chocolate . It has the perfect balance between the peanut butter flavor and the chocolate , and its not so sweet as to remind you of candy . Would make a wonderful cookie or pie ! <p> My Description : I could eat this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blended with a hint of honey and whole bunch of sweet chocolate-chip cookie-dough flavor . Again , its not as sweet as if you were eating a chocolate chip cookie , but it definitely has a lingering flavor reminiscent of cookie dough ! <p> There are so many ways to use this peanut butter ! You can put it on a sandwich , spread it on crackers , eat it by the spoonful , use it in cake , cookies and pies or even mix it up with some ice cream . The options are incredible ! In fact , coming soon the the PB Crave website will be a list of recipes , and right now you can learn some other interesting ways to enjoy your PB Crave by clicking on the Recipe Tab . <p> My opinion ?

After multiple doctor visits , hours of reading , and hundreds of conversations with other women , I 've pretty much learned all the things I can do to increase our chances and make sure my body is ready . But while I 've been focusing on what I can do , I 've been ignoring the fact that there is plenty my husband can be doing as well to help increase our chances of conceiving . After all , we all know it takes two to tango ( and to conceive ) !

While he does n't  have to give up drinking completely , its a good idea to limit his alcohol intake and to familiarize himself with acceptable serving sizes of alcoholic ( and caffeinated beverages ) well before and while trying to conceive . Regular exercise should also be part of his daily routine , especially since it helps reduce stress , can make him feel better about himself , and benefits long-term health . <p> Eat Right <p> While a healthy diet is essential for good health , it also can play an important role in fertility .

While technology today allows you to call for help , sometimes it is much faster ( and cheaper ) to change the flat yourself . Yet a surprising number of people do not know how to change a flat . Below are the steps you need to follow in order to safely change a flat tire . <p> 1 . Pull Over at a Safe Spot <p> As soon as you notice that you have a flat tire , the first thing you need to do is find a safe spot to pull off of the road . If you are on a highway , taking the next exit is the safest bet . If not , pull as far onto the shoulder as possible , making sure you are on a flat surface . Never park in the middle of a curve , or on a hill . Always set the parking brake , and if you have a manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Your Hazards <p> Make sure you turn on your hazard lights before leaving the car . If its at night and you have flares , this is a good time to make use of them . Grab your owners manual before heading to the trunk and removing all of the items you will need to change the tire . This includes the spare , the jack , the lug wrench and the bracing materials ( bricks or pieces of wood ) . <p> Secure the Car and Loosen the Lug Nuts <p> Begin by placing the bracing materials behind and in front of one of the tires that will not be lifted by the jack . This is to help prevent the car from rolling and also to increase stability . Before you can loosen the lug nuts , you may need to remove the hubcap or wheel cover . At this point you will not want to completely remove the lug nuts , but instead simply loosen them by turning the wrench to the left ( counter-clockwise ) . If the lug nuts are really tight , try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrench arm . You can also try hitting the wrench arm with a rock . 130174 @qwx330174 <h> Comments <p> Thanks for the tips ! I had a flat tire the other day . My car had a spare tire in the back , but I still had to call a tow truck , because I did n't  know how to change a flat . Hopefully , these tips will change that so that I 'll be prepared the next time I get a flat tire . Its a good thing that you made a note to place bracing materials behind and in front of one of the tires that will remain on the ground while the rest are lifted by a jack . That seems like something important to remember to keep the car stable while I 'm changing a tire . 130172 @qwx330172 130175 @qwx330175 130173 @qwx330173 130176 @qwx330176

When you 're looking to flush out the toxins in your body , one of the easiest ways to start is to simply drink more water .
