Cara and Chris are a young couple that is desperate to say goodbye to their current " dorm room chic " style and embrace a much more grown up space ! They moved in a few years ago but have done nothing to the space besides fill it with their random college furniture . They want to create an upscale rustic master bedroom that has a western lodge vibe all for their budget of $500 . But with such a small budget , can Monica and Jess create their dream lodge master bedroom ? <p> Monica and Jess love the pictures Cara and Chris sent in with the gorgeous woodwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the budget they are working with , the girls have to stretch their budget and stretch the limits of conventional design in order to give them the master bedroom they have always dreamed of ! <p> The first part of their plan is to take care of the carpet , which has clearly seen better days ! The flooring in the hallway right outside their bedroom is hardwood , so they are hoping that when they pull up the carpets there is also hardwood in the bedroom . But even if there is n't , the girls have some ideas on how to create a floor that goes along with their new style . Since the furniture pieces in the room are hand-me downs , they do n't match at all , but Monica and Jess are going to show the couple how they can make them work for the space anyway . Monica and Jess also want to add some architectural detailing to the space in order to give it that cabin feel they are looking for . Cara and Chris also sent in some pictures of simple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge , but would cost more than half their budget , so Monica and Jess have come up with a simple and easy DIY project that will give them the same look for a whole lot less . <p> Before they get started on the projects , the first thing the girls do is check to see what is under those beat up carpets they have on the floor . They were hoping for hardwood , but when they pull up a section of the carpets they discover it 's actually subflooring . The good news is that Monica and Jess can still make it work in a way that still will compliment the room 's new elegant and rustic style they are going for . <p> After the pull up the carpet and remove all the tacks and nails from the floors , Monica and Cara get started on a custom pendant light project that 's super simple . While at the home improvement store , Monica found some inexpensive wastebaskets that had a really cool architectural design to them and look almost like a cage . She shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit she purchased to create a cool and simple light fixture for the room . <p> Meanwhile , Jess and Chris get started on transforming the subflooring in the room . Jess explains that they will use porch paint on the floors , which is nice and thick and will help create a seamless look . Chris is a little skeptical and has never heard of people using subflooring as their main flooring , so he is excited to see what the designers have in store for this project . <p> Monica and Jess want this rustic upscale retreat to really feel elegant so they decided to paint the top third of the walls a warm neutral cream color and finish off the bottom section of the walls with a darker blue gray hue . After the paint has dried , it 's time to really bring this room to life by adding some architectural detailing and design that will trick the eye and our budget !

They transform the smaller dresser by sanding the drawers and staining them in a warm walnut . Then , they use the other dresser as a base for some DIY custom built-ins that they will create for the closet unit . They trim the dresser to fit inside the closet and then paint it white , before they install it in the closet . <p> Because the space is small , instead of using regular nightstands , Monica and Jess create floating shelves underneath the wastebasket light fixtures to give the couple the functionality of night stands without taking up too much space . <p> After the first day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transform into the elegant rustic lodge that Cara and Chris are hoping for .

But since there was n't actual woodwork underneath the carpets , they have to improvise in order to create the same look . They will create stripes on the floors and use a brown porch paint that will give the floors the multi-tone look for a lot less money . <p> Monica and Jess really wanted to have a statement piece for the room , but they were tight on cash , so Monica shows Cara how to create the perfect piece , DIY style . They build a live edge accent mirror with plywood that will look like they took a giant tree and sliced it down in order to see the bark and edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with real wood can cost a fortune .

Once completed , the room looks radically different and one that actually belongs to a pair of grown-ups , not college students . <p> The architectural details are really what are giving the room the lodge and cabin feel that wanted . Monica and Jess were able to use half the amount of wood they would need to plank the whole room , which really saved them so much money and added a ton of visual interest . To actually plank the walls , use the amount of pine needed and have someone come out to install , it could easily cost $1,000 .

They ca n't believe Monica and Jess used their old dresser from college in order to create this ! By moving the dresser into the closet , the girls were able to free up a lot of space in the room and only spend $75 . <p> To buy a statement mirror and new dresser for the bedroom could have easily set them back more than triple their budget . But by redoing the piece of furniture they already had and creating their own statement piece , they were able to create the same look spending only $45 total . <p> The lights on each side of the bed could not have been made any easier and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook . To buy a pair of lights like the ones that were in the inspiration photos would have cost $300 . But instead they create them themselves for only $50 .

In addition to that , all the accessories and paint used in the room to create their rustic lodge master bedroom only set them back $195 . To decorate this space like the high-end sophisticated lodges seen in the magazines , could have easily cost the couple $10,000 to 15,000 . But with some creativity and the ability to DIY , this whole room was created for only $495 ! <p> Chris and Cara 's master bedroom is full of their college furniture and seriously lacking style . Monica and Jess create a plan to transform this room into a rustic retreat with DIY projects that will create the feel of a western lodge .

With inexpensive materials you can get any at any hardware store , this planter turns any black thumb to bright green ! <p> Build your own self-watering container for 70 percent off the retail price . Landscaping expert Beverly Welch from The Arbor Gate shows how to make these containers , which can run over $100 if you purchase them . While store-bought containers may be a little fancier , she says this DIY version is even better because it gives you better soil depth and larger reservoir for water . <p> Materials : <p> 18-gallon storage tote with lid <p> 1 1/2 " PVC pipe <p> 4 " or quart plastic nursery pots <p> 1-gal plastic nursery pot <p> organic soil <p> time-release fertilizer <p> 1 bag soilless planting mix <p> Tools : <p> Measuring tape <p> Utility knife/shears <p> Drill with 1/4 " bit <p> Sharpie marker <p> Step 1 : Cut the Lid <p> Take the lid of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the inside rectangle , leaving the outer edge that snaps to the top . Set the outer edge aside . <p> Step 2 : Building the aeration shelf <p> The aeration shelf sits above the water reservoir , creating an air space between the root zone and the water . This air space provides oxygen to the root zone and prevents the media from becoming oversaturated or waterlogged . <p> 1 . Take the inner portion of the lid that you cut from the top and put it on a flat surface . <p> 2 . Place the 1-gal pot in the center of the lid , upside down . <p> 3 . Use the Sharpie to trace the top perimeter of the pot . <p> 4 . Turn the pot right side up and center it in your previously traced circle . <p> 5 . Use the Sharpie to trace the bottom perimeter of the pot . <p> 6 . Draw a dashed line between the two traced circles , creating a dashed circle . <p> 7 . Cut out the dashed circle using the utility knife or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bit , drill a grid of holes about 1 " apart each way in the flat surface of the lid . Stay at least 1 " away from the center hole and from the start of the rim of the lid . <p> 9 . Decide where you want to locate the Fill Tube ( see below ) . Place the 1 1/2 " PVC pipe in that location and cut that hole out . It should be just slightly larger than the PVC so the pipe slides easily and does not bind up . <p> Preparing the Water Reservoir and Soil Chamber <p> The bottom of the tote will be the water reservoir , the top portion of the tote will be the soil chamber , and the two will separated by an air space . Measure 4 inches from the bottom and drill a drainage hole . <p> For our project , we are using recycled nursery pots . There are lots of other options short lengths of PVC , Solo cups with holes punched in them , or tin cans with both ends cut out ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will need enough of whatever you use to support the aeration shelf and the moist media . It is a good idea to plan to nearly cover the bottom of the reservoir with the exception of the holes we cut for the wicking pot and the fill tube . <p> Making the Wicking Pot <p> The wicking pot is the magic that makes everything work , so we will take time to make sure that we build it correctly . There is more than one way to construct the wicking pot , but the principles that make it work must be met . It must sit on the bottom of the water reservoir and reach through the aeration shelf into the soil chamber . It must have sufficient holes in the base to draw water into the wicking media . It must also have holes in the portion that will be in the air gap . These holes allow for the air in the media to be displaced during the capillary action that makes the wicking pot work . <p> A 5 " Pond Basket meets all of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot made to hold aquatic plants . They are available at many nurseries and big box stores that carry pond supplies . However , a very effective wicking pot can be made by recycling a plastic 1-gal nursery container . <p> 10 . Drill multiple 1/4 " diameter holes 1 " apart in all directions for the entire height of the pot and all around its circumference . <p> Preparing the Fill Tube <p> Water must be in the reservoir at all times . It does not have to be full , but it can not be allowed to dry out completely at any time . The easiest way to keep the reservoir filled is with a tube that sits in the reservoir and is filled from the top . The fill tube should extend well above the top of the SWC so soil does not fall into the tube . The actual height can be anything that is convenient for the user . Beverly puts hers at about 2 ' . If you are only planning to build one or two self watering containers , most big box home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more expensive than buying it in bulk lengths . The fill tube should be located on one of the outside edges of the watering container , but it does not matter if it is on the sides or the ends . The location should be the most convenient for watering access . <p> 11 . Cut the desired length of 1 1/2 " PVC . <p> 12 . Cut the end that will sit in the reservoir at an angle so it will never become blocked . <p> Assembling the Components <p> 13 . Set the water reservoir and soil chamber in its permanent location ( they are heavy once filled ) . <p> 14 . Set all of the aeration shelf supports into the bottom . <p> 15 . Set the aeration shelf on the supports . <p> 16 . Slide the fill tube into its hole . <p> 17 . Slide the wicking pot into the center hole and check it for fit it should sit into the hole easily and the bottom should rest on the floor of the water reservoir . If it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosen the hole a bit . Remove the wicking pot after checking for fit . <p> 18 . Add the lid . <p> Fill the Wicking Pot <p> The media for the Wicking Pot is important the wrong composition will fail . This is only for the Wicking Pot . Do not use this as your planting media . <p> 19 . Fill the pot with a soilless planting mix . You can find this pre-mixed at a garden store , or mix your own . Mix 1 part peat , coir , or peat-based potting mix , 1 part Perlite or Expanded Shale , and 1 part Vermiculite . You will not need large amounts - just enough to fill the wicking pot . <p> 20 . Moisten this mix thoroughly . You should be able to squeeze a few drops of water out of the mix . <p> 21 . Fill and pack the wicking pot with this media . It should be packed tightly . Leave 1 1/2 " of headspace at the top . <p> 22 . Water the filled wicking pot until water drains from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vermiculite . This should be filled to the point of spillage . <p> 24 . Set the wicking pot into its space in the aeration shelf . <p> Fill the Soil Chamber <p> Fill the soil chamber with organic soil and time release fertilizer until it is 1/3 full . Water this thoroughly and lightly tamp it . We do not want to pack this because it is our root environment - we just want to make sure that there are no air pockets in the soil . Repeat with the second and last third , again watering thoroughly each time . This is a little more than recommended for this volume of soil , but it will be expected to last all season . <p> Plants <p> We used strawberries and spinach , but you can use any flowers or plants you like . Add water ! <p> Price : <p> We spent about $50 for our container , but you could easily do it for a lot less if you only used one plant .

You can use a black plastic garbage bag trimmed to fit . The mulch cover should extend past the rim of the container so it can be held in place with the mulch cover retainer which we made from the rim of the lid that remained after we built the aeration shelf . Using the binder clips to hold this all in place is convenient . <p> To plant through the mulch cover , cut X shaped slits in the plastic , pull the plastic back , and set the transplant in place or plant your seeds . If you are broadcasting a seed crop or planting closer than 3 " spacing , do not use a mulch cover . You can mulch with pine straw or compost just as you would an in-ground garden . <p> Seasonal Maintenance <p> Taking care of an self-watering container during the growing season is easy .

As always , keep an eye on your plants . They will tell you if they are not happy . If you are using a liquid fertilizer , just mix it in a 5-gallon bucket and use the mix to fill the water reservoir . They will self-feed as they draw the mix into the media . <p> Because you have not used garden soil , you will have few , if any weeds . Any that arrive on the wind or from birds will be easy to prick out from the loose , damp media . Planting can be very intensive in these containers .

With a one year-old daughter and another little girl on the way , they want to create a cozy retreat space for themselves . Their inspiration pictures show beautiful nautical-inspired rooms with plenty of coast charm , but with Lyndsay recently becoming a stay-at-home mom , money is tight . With a budget of $800-900 , they are hoping Monica and Jess can help them create their perfect Nantucket retreat . <p> The space has a lot of potential but is seriously suffering from design neglect .

Bloggers Monica and Jess transform the room into an effortlessly elegant space with a glamorous feel for under $700 . <p> This city row home is in desperately needs some style , and it 's definitely not coming from these two homeowners ! When Mike and Colleen moved in together a year ago , they combined all their furnishings they had had , which not only made their furniture mismatched but also their style ! <p> The couple would love to have their living room and dining room have an elegant and high-end look that is open and comfortable , but are completely style deficient and have no clue to where even to begin with the combined space in their narrow townhome . Not only is the space tight , but the couple 's budget of $700 is definitely going to have to be stretched in order to create the elegant look the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in show two gorgeous spaces completely decked out with beautiful chandeliers , elegant tables and sophisticated dTcor . Colleen knows she has expensive taste , but unfortunately not the funds to support it ! So Monica and Jess are going take the photos the couple sent in and use them to create their own version of an elegant space that they think will be much more fitting for the couple in their home : approachable elegance . While this idea of elegance and glamour scares Mike a little , the designers assure him they are in good hands ! <p> The first thing that absolutely has to change is the part of the home Mike ca n't stand the most : the stair rails . These extremely outdated rails are not only lacking style , but completely make the space feel smaller . But ripping them out also means taking out the carpet , and Monica and Jess have no idea what 's underneath . <p> While Mike uses a reciprocating saw to cut the railing he loathes into segments , Monica helps him rip out the heavy pieces from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only becomes instantly more modern , but also open ! <p> After they successfully remove all the rails , it 's time for them to see what 's hiding underneath the carpet . While removing the carpeting on the side reveals beautiful molding on the walls , what is underneath the carpet of the stairs is n't as pretty . Although it 's hardwood , it 's in really bad condition and an absolute mess . Refinishing these stairs is now definitely out of the question and completely replacing the stairs is something that just wo n't fit into their budget which leaves them with only one other option : carpet . Luckily , Monica and Jess have basic carpeting skills so they can handle the job themselves , but it may not fit within their budget . Their best bet is to find a remnant piece of carpet at a really good price and install it themselves . It 's not ideal , but it 's a much better option than what they started with . <p> Monica and Jess really like the picture they sent in of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very popular right now and a look that exudes elegance . The only problem is this kind of furniture is simply not within the couple 's budget . So Jess purchased a thrifted coffee table for only $30 , and to make it look more elegant , they paint it a perfect gold color that gives the table the perfect mix of elegance and glamour without being gaudy . From there , they use a glass cutter on a mirror in order to make it fit inside the parameters of the top of the coffee table . The glass cutter allows the girls to break it cleanly and evenly . Once cut , they attach the mirror to the table with specially designed glue used for mirror installation and just like that , Colleen has a brand new table for her living room ! <p> In the inspiration photos the couple sent in , there were beautiful and elegant chandeliers that lit up the room . To create a similar look but on a budget , Monica shows Mike a simple DIY project that will create a light fixture made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a modern orb light , by removing the basket out of two planters and connecting them with wire to create a sphere . They drill a hole in bottom which will allow the wires of an inexpensive light fixture to come through the planter . Spray painted a metallic color , it gives them a new high-end finish . <p> Next , they get to work painting the room . Colleen and Mike love the new light color the girls show them for their walls , but are n't so sure about the color for the accent wall . Monica and Jess have chosen a teal green that is really going to add pop to the room , but Mike is not completely convinced . Although the color looks a little bright in the can , with 3 dry coats it looks more like a dark emerald color that instantly adds elegance to any room . Mike is n't sold yet but Monica and Jess hope that once the room comes all together he will like it . <p> The next day Monica and Jess arrive early to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profile handrail along the wall and then bring in the remnant carpet that they will use on the stairs . Monica was able to score this piece from the carpet store for only $60 and even got the padding for free ! The girls install the carpeting and the stair area now looks incredible . It 's open , modern and has come a long way from what they started working with yesterday . <p> Next , Monica shows Colleen how to create sophisticated curtains for the living room.They start with two plain white curtains that she purchased for $20 . First , Monica and Colleen stencil the top quarter of the panels in a modern and elegant geometric pattern . The finishing touch is adding grommets to the top of the curtains . <p> While one of the big walls in the room got painted with a pop of color , the other big blank wall where the TV used to be is crying out for some style ! To fix this void , Jess and Mike paint an antique mantle that Jess picked up that will act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , they paint the opening of the fireplace the same jewel-tone color of the accent wall which will unify both sides of the room . <p> While Monica and Jess add the finishing touches to the room , Mike is getting nervous especially over that green wall color . But when the girls reveal the finished room to the couple , any fears they had are completely out the window ! They ca n't believe how incredible the space looks and how much it has transformed in such a short period of time . They are amazed at how everything in the room came together so perfectly and transformed into exactly what they wanted . <p> The space is so open and feels inviting and warm while also looking elegant . Taking out the banister and installing new carpets played a huge part in opening up the space . It was something Mike has desperately wanted to do for years and with a little DIY magic , only cost $110 ! Although Mike loves the new stairs , he reveals to Monica and Jess that much to their surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room : it 's the color of the wall ! The girls can not believe their ears when he reveals that he loves how much it brings to the elegance of the new space . <p> Another elegant element added was the framed fabric artwork that was hung above the couch of the living room . The best part about this gorgeous piece is that it was made with a thrifted frame and fabric that all together only cost $50 . <p> Even though the table that was previously in their dining room space was not a bad table or very large , the fact that it was bar height really made it appear like it took up a lot of space . Therefore , they decided to get something else that would work better in the space . They purchased a second-hand table and chair set and simply added slip covers to the chairs to make them look more elegant . All in all , this only cost them $125 . <p> The modern orb light fixture looks awesome in the living room and is reminiscent of something you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could easily run $500 , but Monica and Jess DIY 'd it using planters only costing them $42 . <p> The mirrored coffee table adds an extremely elegant touch to the living room . This could have easily cost them hundreds of dollars , but with some creativity this replica was made for only $45 . The DIY stenciled curtain panels also added a ton of style to the space and was made with simple materials for only $52 . <p> The new faux fireplace in the room helps fill up so much more space on the one side of the wall but is not in your face at all when walking in through the front door . It was a simple project that completely transformed the area , all for only $54 . <p> All of the other accessories and dTcor Monica and Jess used to decorate and add an approachable elegance to the rooms totaled to $215 .

Monica and Jess create a plan to transform the space into an approachably elegant and comfortable room . <p> Mirrored tables and furniture are super trendy right now , but they can cost a pretty penny .

They hope Monica and Jess can incorporate their new dark-wood furniture into this style on their budget of $800 . In the room , Paola and Mike have a perfectly functioning fireplace that they would love to use , but right now , it 's been overtaken by Paola 's shoes . Connected to their bedroom area is a great space that Paola uses as a vanity area . The space has a ton of potential , but between its outdated spaceship-like lights around its mirror and outdated dresser for storage , the space is not working ! <p> The inspiration photos that Paola and Mike sent in had traditional wood elements incorporated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm and rustic . The photos also had lots of natural textures scattered throughout , but the kind of authentic South American gaucho accents that the couple are looking for can be very costly . Monica and Jess have some ideas thought on how to create that same look and feel in this space that will completely fit into their budget . <p> The vanity area has a ton of potential , and the girls want to make it the perfect space for Paola , but before they do anything to amp up the romance in this area they have to remove all its outdated elements . Paola is so excited to finally transform this space , but as they are pulling out the existing furniture to bring in a new vanity piece they hit a little problem : the previous homeowners carpeted around the vanity . Unfortunately , the piece that the girls planned on bringing in wo n't fit in that space and new carpeting wo n't fit into the budget .

But to bring in an artisan who is specially trained to get that look would cost more than double their budget and take a ton of time . So Jess shows Paola how to do a DIY project using textured paint that will make the fireplace look like it was created with clay or stucco ! <p> Monica and Jess get to work redoing the old vanity by painting it deep cranberry metallic color and give it a brand new wood planked top that will be the base for a custom vanity mirror .

Although it was on sale , it was still $700 , so Monica came up with an idea of her own to recreate the same effect with paint and epoxy removers on new mirrors and thrift store frames . <p> Currently , Paola 's shoes are taking over the entire bedroom and need to find a new home ! Monica and Jess show Paola how to build a fully functional shoe rack that also displays her prized possessions in an artistic way .

Wrapping up an ugly , brass chandelier that Paola and Mike alredy had transforms it into a beautiful light fixture for this rustic and romantic master bedroom design ! <p> Although Paola and Mike want a rustic look , Monica and Jess have to remember that whatever they bring in this room must fit together with the more modern furniture pieces that Paola and Mike just purchased . So , Monica and Jess decide to bring in pieces that have a very simple reclaimed look , like the blanket ladder that Mike is going to make . This project could n't be an easier , and when it 's done will be the perfect piece to display some funky blankets with different textures . <p> The girls are really trying to bring that cowboy gaucho style into this room so what better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! In Argentinean culture , antlers are very symbolic and used for many things such as musical instruments , weapons and even cooking utensils .

They ca n't wait to reveal this warm , rustic sanctuary to the homeowners . <p> Paola and Mike are blown away with their new rustic and romantic master bedroom retreat and can not believe it is even the same space ! The couple are so excited to finally sit by their beautiful fireplace and enjoy a nice cup of coffee after a long day .

Joey loves bacon so he came up with the idea to experiment by adding bacon to the macaroon mixture . The Bacon-Roons turned out to be a delicious treat that combined sweet and salty flavors . <p> The Paleo style meal continued when Matt made a tasty and healthy substitute for rice . Since a Paleo diet does n't consist of processed foods , he turned cauliflower into a dish that looks just like rice by grating the vegetable . <p> Then , Matt made a killer barbequed carrot that is extremely easy to do . Since we usually eat with our eyes first , he wisely used a variety of colored carrots . It gave this dish a nice presentation . <p> " You do feel better and I think it shows .

About ten years ago , the former hairdressers opened Nebo where they serve their family 's favorite recipes . <p> They say it 's never too late to try something new , and the Pallotta sisters are testament to that . Ten years ago these hairdressers swapped their scissors for chefs ' knives . Now they have turned their favorite family recipes into a family business . <p> " Everything about these recipes is memories , " says Carla Pallotta . <p> Carla and Christine Pallotta grew up in Boston 's North End , a predominantly Italian neighborhood . Despite spending lots of time in the kitchen as kids , they did n't really start cooking until they decided to open up a restaurant , Nebo Cucina and Enoteca . <p> Nebo is where Joey met up with the sisters to learn some of their favorite family recipes . <p> Christine explains how they went from hairdressers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 years until I got bored one day and said to my sister , ' I 'm opening a restaurant the way Ma would cook every night , " said Christine . <p> " I thought she lost her mind , " says Carla . <p> " We never cooked before . We never worked in a restaurant , " says Christine . <p> Three weeks before the sisters opened Nebo , their mother came in and taught them her recipes . Their mom never wrote recipes down , she cooks from memory , taste and touch , so the sisters had to do some reverse engineering to get the recipes . <p> Today , Carla and Christine are showing Joey how to make four different dishes : stuffed artichokes , stuffed peppers , minestra and beans and a spumoni sundae . <p> First , they make the stuffed artichokes . Once they mix together the breadcrumbs , eggs , Romano cheese , salt , pepper , parsley , capers , garlic and olives , they separate the leaves of the artichoke and shove in the stuffing . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put a little bit of water in the bottom , some garlic and some olive oil . And then just sit them in so they fit in the pot really tight . Cover them and let them steam . When the leaves can pull out easy they 're done , " says Carla . <p> Next , the sisters prepare a similar dish -- stuffed peppers . This time they use olive oil instead of eggs in the stuffing . <p> The bread used for the stuffing is baked right at the restaurant . The recipe is over a hundred years old and the bread is made from a starter that came over from Italy . <p> While the artichokes are steamed on the stove top , the peppers are placed in a well oiled pan and baked at 350 for about 45 minutes . <p> Once the peppers and artichokes are done , it 's time for a taste test ! <p> " Look at all the breaded goodness in there , " he says .

" asks Joey . " I think the simplicity of it . I mean to literally just put something in a pot and let it braise and the different flavors going in , " says Carla . <p> This simple recipe combines prosciutto ends , pepperoni , cannellini beans , spare ribs and escarole . The ingredients are simmer for about two hours . <p> " We like to put our minestra and beans over a fried pizza .

The flavors are ridiculous and I know I 'm going to save room because we have a spumoni sundae we 're going to make now . So let 's get back in the kitchen ! " says Joey . <p> The Spumoni sundae is the sisters ' twist on a traditional Italian dessert . They start by coating the bottom of the ice cream dish with an espresso chocolate Nutella hot fudge , then a couple scoops of vanilla gelato followed by a couple scoops of pistachio gelato . That is topped with amaretto cherries , whipped cream and pistachios . <p> " Alright , let 's all dig into this bad boy , " says Joey . <p> After a taste he declares , " That 's frickin ' dangerous !

@@105022704 @422704/ 91054 @qwx951054 <h> Designing Holiday Gift Baskets <p> A gift basket is the best gift , or the most preferred gift , to give a person because you can put your artistry into creating something that is going to be remembered forever . <p> " Making gift baskets is very easy , " said expert " basketologist " Shirley George Frazier , author of The Gift Basket Design Book . " It 's not a difficult process because you are going to find items that are going to put a big smile on a person 's face . " <p> Any type of open container can be a basket . The first item that you think of is definitely a basket . It can be any size . You can find baskets , perhaps in your own attic , garage , in your home , which you may not have a purpose for anymore and you just want to repurpose it . <p> Once you 've chosen the perfect basket or container , get some brown paper grocery store bags . Open the bags right at the split and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ container . The bag may need to be torn a bit to fit properly . Use your fists to punch it down to get it nice and firm . That firmness will help keep the gifts and food stabilized inside the basket . <p> Once you have the paper bags inside to stabilize everything , the next step is adding what 's called " shred " on top to hide those grocery store sacks in the bottom of the basket . Then , it 's time to add the goodies . Shirley has an inexpensive tip to keeping everything up right . <p> The paper serves as the base for making the gift basket , but you will also want to keep items upright in other way . Shirley suggests using skewers , breaking them into three pieces and attaching them with tape on the back of certain taller and heavier items . Use scissors to punch a hole in the paper and bring the skewer down into the paper . <p> " All the heavy items , like a bottle of cider or something else that 's heavy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items around it , maybe some chips , maybe some dip , that 's going to be light , " Shirley says . " And it 's going to actually just sit on top not on top , on the side of the heavy item so that those items stay upright , as well . " <p> Dots of glue can also be used to stabilize items next to each other . Both the skewer and glue cost just pennies . <p> Filling the basket with goodies that you know the recipient will love is the best part , and the most fun . <p> " Really think about the person who 's receiving the gift because you really want to amaze and dazzle them , " Shirley says . " You also think about the enhancements that you add . It could be something glitzy and glamorous . It could be pine cones , acorns , different types of little sparkly items that are not only beautiful for the holidays , but for every day gift giving . " <p> Cellophane can be purchased at many craft stores and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can find clear cellophane , as well as a variety of prints . Place the cellophane underneath and bring it atop the gift basket . <p> Tape down the back ends of the cellophane so they 're not in the way of the appearance and then use a twist tie to secure the cellophane at the top . <p> Now it 's time for the bow . Even though you can easily pick up a bow or two from the craft store , you probably have bows around your house already that are ready to be repurposed to place on top of your gift basket . <p> " Now you 've crowned that gift basket with that beautiful bow that comes from your heart and from your house at the same time , " says Shirley . " And that is your total gift basket , from what we call the basket to the bow . " <p> Shirley has some do 's and don'ts when it comes to making a gift basket . <p> Do not place chocolate items and fragrant candles or soaps together . Chocolates are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate that has been wrapped with soaps and other fragrant items , the chocolate is not going to taste like chocolate . Wrap it totally in cellophane twice so that you enclose the packaging in a way that none of the scents get into the chocolates . <p> People have allergies and you might not be aware of what everyone is allergic to . So when talking to friends of the person who you 're giving the gift basket to , make sure that you know of any allergic reactions that they might have to any items . The person receiving the basket should be able to enjoy everything in the basket . <p> Do n't cut your cellophane too short . It should be tall enough to fan at the top of the gift basket . Make sure to cut the cellophane as tall as possible . <p> And think outside the box , or basket , when thinking of a container . <p> If a basket is not the right container , you can look at flower pots , or even shoes . Anything with an open middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to open and eat , or put on a mantle , or use in everyday life . <p> You can use all types of baskets for your gift baskets . But you can also use mugs . You certainly have mugs in your home and you can easily find mugs that can be filled with all kinds of snacks and gifts . A mug is n't very big , but you 'll be amazed by how many items that you 'll be able to get into that mug for that person on your gift list . <p> " A gift basket is the best gift to give because you can personalize it specifically for the person who is going to receive it , " Shirley says . " Instead of buying a gift at the store , which could be okay , you can make a spectacular and really extraordinary gift for a person by putting your own personality in the gift . And also add the preferences and the choices that people want in that particular gift . But you can start off with the items that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift basket are all about .
