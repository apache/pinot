@@21346898 @1346898/ <p> The motion of a particle along a straight line at aconstant accelerationis called the " Uniformly Accelerated Motion . " <p> In this chapter , we need to first **31;37;TOOLONG was done in Chapter 1 . <p> Velocity:Velocity is defined as the change in displacement per unit of time . Note that both velocity and displacement are vector quantities . Speed is defined as the change in distance per unit of time . Here both speed and distance are scalar quantities . The average speed v is mathematically shown as : <p> ? pronounced " delta " means a change .

Again , note that both acceleration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of velocity is a scalar quantity . <p> Note:For the one dimensional motion of a particle ( that means motion along a straight line ) , and for a one-way motion scenario , the directions of velocity and acceleration do not change . This allows us to usespeedinstead of the velocity vector itself and the magnitude of the acceleration vector instead of the acceleration vector itself . <p> This will be the assumption in almost all of the examples and assigned problems in this chapter . <p> Example 2:A car 's speed changes from 15m/s to 25m/s in 5.0s along a straight road while moving in one way . Find the magnitude of the acceleration of the car during this period . <p> Solution : <p> Definition of Motion:When the relative position of a particle with respect to a reference point changes with time , the object is said to be in motion . For convenience , the reference point may be chosen to be the origin , O , in a set of x-y coordinates system . <p> Equation of Motion : Theequation of motionis defined as the relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Motion of Uniformly Accelerated Motion : <p> For motion along a straight line and atconstant acceleration , a , the equation of motion has the form : <p> The proof of the above equation will be given and discussed later . Right now , let 's just accept this equation . There are2 termson the right side of it.Verify that each term must have unit of length because the left side isxand has unit of length.You may choose the SI system , for example , and verify that each term has unit ofmeter . <p> Example 3:A car traveling along a straight road at 8.0m/s accelerates to a speed of 15.0m/s in 5.0s . Determine(a) its acceleration , ( b ) the distance it travels during this period , ( c ) its equation of motion , ( d ) the interval of validity of this equation , and(e) the distance already traveled att =2.0 s . <p> Solution:We have so far learned the following equations : ( Rewritethem , but with horizontal fraction bars ) . <p> ( 1 ) a= ( vf-vi ) /t ; ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction bars . <p> ( a ) a= ( 15.0m/s - 8.0 m/s ) / 5.0s = 1.4m/s2 . <p> ( b ) x= ( 1/2 ) ( 1.4m/s2 ) ( 5.0s ) 2+ ( 8.0m/s ) ( 5.0s ) = 58m . <p> Any object that moves along a straight line and at constant acceleration , has an equation of motion in the form : <p> x = ( 1/2 ) at2+vit . The equation of motion of this car can be found by substituting the constants in the equation . <p> The constants are:vi= 8.0m/s and a= 1.4m/s2 .

( b ) Determine the distances she travels during the 1st , 2nd , 3rd , 4th , and 5th seconds. ( c ) Are the answers in Part ( b ) equal ? If not why ? What should be the pace of motion for such distances to be equal ? <p> Solution : <p> ( a ) <p> x(0) = 3.40(0)2 + 2.10(0) = 0 . <p> x(1) = 3.40(1)2 + 2.10(1) = 5.50m . <p> x(2) = 3.40(2)2 + 2.10(2) = 17.8m . <p> x(3) = 3.40(3)2 + 2.10(3) = 36.9m . <p> x(4) = 3.40(4)2 + 2.10(4) = 62.8m . <p> x(5) = 3.4(5)2 + 2.1(5) = 95.5m . <p> ( b ) d1is the distance traveled in the 1st second . d2is the distance traveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d1= x(1) - x(0) = 05.5m - 00.0m = 5.5m . <p> d2= x(2) - x(1) = 17.8m - 05.5m = 12.3m . <p> d3= x(3) - x(2) = 36.9m - 17.8m = 19.1m . <p> d4= x(4) - x(3) = 62.8m - 36.9m = 25.9m . <p> d5= x(5) - x(4) = 95.5m - 62.8m = 32.7m . <p> ( c ) As can be seen from Part ( b ) , the distances traveled in subsequent seconds become greater and greater . What is this telling us ? Is it because the motion is an accelerated one ? Ans. : ..... . If your answer is " Yes " , you are right.In accelerated motion , unequal distances are traveled in equal time intervals . <p> An Equation With No Apparent Time Element <p> Sometimes , in solving problems , we may run into situations where time ( t ) is not given . It is possible to combine the equations of distance and acceleration to find an equation that is explicitly independent of time . Look at the following two equations that we already know:a = ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at2+vit . If ( t ) is solved for from the 1stequation and substituted into the 2ndequation , the following equation will be resulted : <p> vf2- vi2=2ax. ( explicitly independent of time ) <p> Students are encouraged to try the algebra and derive this equation as explained above . <p> Example 6 : During take off , an airplane travels 960m along a straight runway to reach a speed of 65m/s before its tires leave the ground . If the motion is uniformly accelerated , determine ( a ) its acceleration , ( b ) the elapsed time , ( c ) its equation of motion , and ( d ) its midway speed . <p> Solution : ( a ) vf2- vi2= 2ax ; ( 65m/s ) 2- ( 0m/s ) 2= 2a(960m) ; <p> 4225 = 1920a ; a= 2.2 m/s2 . <p> ( b ) a = ( vf-vi ) / t ; solving for ( t ) ; t = ( vf-vi ) /a ; <p> t = ( 65m/s - 0m/s ) / ( 2.2m/s2 ) = 30. sec . <p> ( c ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 0 ) t ; x(t) = 1.1t2 . <p> ( d ) vf2- vi2= 2ax ; vf2- ( 0m/s ) 2= 2 ( 2.2 m/s2 ) ( 960/2 ) m <p> vf2= 2113 ; vf= 46 m/s . <p> Freely Falling of Objects : <p> All objects in the vicinity of the Earth are under a gravitational pull toward the center of the Earth whether falling or not . This gravitational pull imposes an acceleration of 9.8m/s2on all objects nearby the Earth and the acceleration vector is always toward the Earth 's center . Since falling objects move along straight lines and accelerate as they move , the following equations apply : Note that these equations are valid only if air resistance can be neglected . This is true for objects that are tiny , solid , and dense . <p> It is better to take the origin to be the point of release , or the starting point . Also , if downward is taken to be the ( +y ) axis , thengthat is in the same direction of +y becomes positive ( g= +9.8 m/s2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has a positive velocity at any given instant . Its direction of motion always agrees with the ( +y ) axis . <p> In the following example , it is easy to show that the climbing time and the returning time for an object thrown straight upward are the same . Also , we will show that the upward throw speed and the downward ground striking speed ( on the return ) are the same.Note : This time , let 's assume +y to be upward as usual . This way , sincegalways acts downward , it must be given a ( - ) sign compared to the upward +y . Draw a figure for the upward motion and a separate figure for the downward motion . <p> Example 8 : A rifle is fired straight upward at the ground level and the bullet leaves the barrel at an initial speed of 315m/s . Determine ( a ) the highest elevation it eaches , ( b ) the time to reach the highest elevation , ( c ) the return time to the ground , and ( d ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance . <p> Solution : <p> ( a ) At the highest point , the bullet comes to a momentary stop and Vf = 0 . <p> Since , we do not know the climbing time , we better use the equation that <p> does not have time explicitly in it . <p> Vf2 - Vi2 = 2gy ; 02 - 3152 = 2 ( - 9.8 ) y ; y = 5100m . <p> ( b ) To calculate the climbing time , let 's use the equation : <p> g = ( Vf - Vi ) /t and solve for t by swapping the diagonal terms . <p> Make sure to always use horizontal fraction bars . <p> t = ( Vf - Vi ) /g ; t = ( 0 - 315 ) / -9.8 = 32s . <p> ( c ) It is easy to see that the return time is the same as the climbing time of 32s . When returning , it starts at an initial speed of Vi = 0 and a height of y = 5100m . Using the y-equation , t may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) g t2 + Vi t ; y = ( 1/2 ) g t2 ; -5100m = ( 1/2 ) ( -9.8 ) t2 ; t = 32s . <p> ( d ) It is easy to show that it strikes the ground at the same speed that it left the rifle : <p> 1 ) Motion is ( a ) the velocity change of an object , ( b ) the acceleration change of an object , ( c ) the relative change of the position of an object with respect to a reference point .

@@21346899 @1346899/ <h> Experiment 9.1 <h> Refraction of Light ( Snells Law ) <p> The objective of this experiment is to verify the Snells law of refraction by tracking a laser ray through a rectangular slab of glass . <p> Equipment : <p> A rectangular slab of glass , a laser pointer , a few sheets of paper , a sharp pencil , a ruler , and a protractor <p> Theory : <p> Refraction is the abrupt change in the direction of light as it changes medium . The reason is the change in the speed of light as of light in vacuum is 300,000 km/s , in water 225,000 km/s , and in clear glass 200,000 km/s . It is the difference in sit changes medium . Different transparent media pose different light transmission properties . For example , the speedpeeds that makes light bend as it enters a different medium . <p> A good analogy to this optical phenomenon is when a car enters a gravel road from asphalt . If the gravel-asphalt borderline is straight and perpendicular ( - ) to the road edge as shown in Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced speed due to more friction offered by gravel . If the gravel-asphalt borderline is slanted as shown in Fig. 2 , then the car pulls to the side that offers more friction to the tire on that side . <p> Light behaves in a similar manner . When a ray of light is incident perpendicularly on the interface between two transparent media , it enters the new medium without bending . Fig. 3 . <p> When light crosses the interface of two media in a slanted way , bending ( breaking ) of light or refraction occurs . Fig. 4 . <p> Fig.3Fig. 4 <p> In physics and engineering , normal line means perpendicular line . For practical reasons , angles of incidence ( i ) and refraction ( r ) are measured with respect to the normal line ( N ) . This is clearly shown in Fig.4 . Both ( i ) and ( r ) are measured with respect to line NN , the normal to the interface . <p> Refraction Index <p> The refraction index , n , of a transparent medium is defined as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed of light in that medium . The formula is <p> where the speed of light c = 300,000 km/s and v is the speed of light in the desired medium . The refraction indices for water and glass are therefore , <p> Based on this definition , the refraction index of vacuum is 1 because <p> Air at normal atmospheric pressure is very dilute and has a refraction index of 1.00 very close to that of vacuum . <p> nair= 1.00 <p> Snells Law of Refraction : <p> The Snells law simply relates angles i and r to the refraction indices of the two media n1 and n2 . It is easy to show that <p> n1 sin ( i ) = n2 sin ( r ) <p> Example : A ray of light that is making a 42.0 angle with water surface enters water from air . <p> Find the angle of refraction that means the angle through which it enters water . <p> Also find the angle of deviation ( D ) . <p> Solution:n1 = 1.00 , n2 = 1.33 , <p> i = 90.0 - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law results in : n1sin i = n2 sin r , <p> 1.00 sin ( 48.0 ) = 1.33 sin(r) ; sin(r) = sin ( 48.0 ) / 1.33 <p> r = 34.0 ; D = i - r = 48.0 - 34.0 = 14.0 . <p> Procedure : <p> Place a flat sheet of paper on a flat surface . <p> Place or mount the laser pointer such that its ray is not only horizontal to the sheet of paper , but also travels very close to its surface and leaves a streak ( line ) of red light on the paper . Some adjustment and practice is crucial . <p> When an uninterrupted streak of light is present , place the rectangular or square slab of glass on the flat paper such that the laser ray is incident on a clear side it ( as shown in the figure ) and exits from the opposite side . With a sharp pencil , draw four straight lines around the slab in order to register the location of the slab on the paper . <p> The ray incident on side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refract and enters the slab through angle r1 . See Fig. 5 . In glass , it travels to the opposite side BB and becomes incident on the other side through angle i2 and finally refracts back into air through angle r2 . Mark two points on the incoming ray and two dots on the outgoing ray ( with the sharpened pencil ) in order to register their locations . Make sure to mark points 1 and 2 ( points of incidence ) as well . <p> Lift the slab and turn the laser off . On the paper , connect the marked points in order to reproduce the laser ray trace . <p> Draw two NN ( Normal ) lines as seen in the figure at points marked 1 and 2 .

To verify the formula for the period , T , of an oscillating mass-spring system <p> Equipment : <p> A linear spring , slotted weights , a stop watch , a spring hanger , a meter stick or a 30.0-cm ruler , a mass scale , a C-clamp and rod attachment , a skew clamp , a regular weight hanger and a few sheets of Cartesian graph paper <p> Theory : <p> Hooke 's law simply states that for alinear springthe spring force , Fs , is proportional to the change in length , x , that the spring undergoes . ( Here , the term " spring force " means the force exertedby the springonthe object attached to it . The object is often called the " mass .

If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ) , the externally applied force , Fappl. , is to the right , but the spring force , Fs , acts to the left . On the other hand , when the spring is pushed to the left , Fig. ( c ) , Fsacts to the right . <p> If massMis hung from a spring as shown below , it stretches the spring of initial lengthy1 , and the spring attains an equilibrium length ofyo+ y1 . If the mass is pushed up a distanceAand then released , it oscillates above and below that equilibrium level.DistanceA , that is themaximum deviation from equilibrium , is called the " amplitude " of oscillations . <p> This formula is a result of the solution to a 2ndorder linear differential equation with constant coefficients . The differential equation is set up very easily as follows . At any instant of oscillation , it is the spring force Fs=-kythat accelerates massMat a ratea=d2y /dt2.According to Newton's2ndlaw , Fs= Ma . This may be written as : <p> -ky = Ma , or-ky = Md2y /dt2 , or d2y/dt2+ ( k /M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as : <p> d2y/dt2+ ? 2y = 0where ? 2= k /M from which ? = ( k /M ) ( 1/2 ) . <p> Procedure : <p> The value ofk , the spring constant , may be measured in two ways . One method is to use Hooke 's law . The other method is to measure the period T of oscillations of a mass-spring system . The values of k determined by the two methods may then be compared and used as a verification of the validity of the theories involved . <p> I. The Hooke 's Law Method : <p> The mass-spring system acts similar to a spring scale . It has a vertical ruler that measures the spring 's elongation . <p> 1 . Measure the mass of the hanger without the spring . <p> 2 . Attach the spring and hanger to the support . Zero the system by sliding the ruler against the needle . The ruler slides easily once its collar or slider ( at the back of the ruler ) is squeezed with two fingers . By zeroing the system with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take its mass into account for this part of the experiment . <p> 3 . Place a 100g mass M1 on the hanger and measure the change in length of the spring ? y . It is better to use two 50g slotted masses instead of a single 100g mass . Make sure that the slots are exactly parallel and opposite to each other such that the weights hang perfectly vertical . If the slots are not opposite to each other , the weights hang tilted , making the needle tilted and causing an incorrect reading of the scale . Record the measured values of M and ? y , and the calculated value of F , in a table similar to the one shown below . <p> 4 . Repeat the above step for two or three additional values of mass up to about 250g .

Add the mass of the weight hanger to this mass and record it in the appropriate space in a table similar to the one shown below . <p> 3 . Pull the mass with its weight hanger down to about 2 to 3 cm below its equilibrium level and release . Start counting oscillations when the mass reaches either the highest or the lowest point . Start counting at zero while starting a stopwatch . The greater the number of oscillations , the more accurate is the measurement of the period . Count about 25 to 50 oscillations , and stop the watch . Record the total time in the table , and calculate the period T and T2 . Repeat this procedure for all recommended masses . <p> 4 .

The result is conversion of electric work to heat energy . To calculate the energy delivered to the calorimeter , the formula for power may be used : <p> P = W / t or W = Pt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above equation , which gives the electric energy consumption , becomes : <p> W = V I t(1) <p> On one hand , by measuring the applied voltage V , the effective current I , and the consumption time t , the electric energy delivered to the calorimeter can be calculated by this formula . On the other hand , by measuring the initial and final temperatures of the calorimeter , as well as the masses of the water , the aluminum container , and the heating element ( including its attachments ) , the amount of heat generated can be calculated . Of course , the specific heats of water , aluminum , as well as the heating element must be obtained from your physics text or from a handbook . The heat absorbed in the calorimeter is <h> Qtotal = Qwater + Qaluminum + Qelement <h> Note that the heating element itself has a small mass , and the mass of it may be added to the mass of the metal legs to which it is attached . This is not going to introduce significant error . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heating element assembly together , and simply use the specific heat of brass for it , although the element itself may have a different specific heat . The existing heating element assembly in the calorimeter in this laboratory is mainly brass .

T ) , or <p> Qtotal = mw cw + mAl cAL + mBr cBr ( ? T ) ( 2 ) <p> This equation calculates the total heat generated in calories as a result of electric work done in the heating element in joules . Both values can be calculated in order to determine how many joules one calorie can generate or vice versa . <p> Procedure : <p> Using a zeroed mass scale , measure the mass of the internal container of the calorimeter ( mAl ) first , and then measure it again when it is 1/3 full with clean water . This way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be calculated easily . Disassemble the heating element assembly from the lid of the calorimeter and measure its mass mBr with a balance scale . Reassemble the heating element into the lid . If the mass is predetermined , skip this step . Place the thermometer in the calorimeter through the hole in the lid , and wait until thermal equilibrium is reached . Record this initial temperature ( Ti ) . With the electric power source off , connect the calorimeter to the source in series with an ammeter . <p> Note that the ammeter in this experiment will measure currents that exceed 200 mA . There is a third terminal on the multi-meter that is specially used for this purpose . The positive wire ( red ) must be pulled out of the usual positive terminal on the meter and inserted into this third terminal , which is labeled ( +10 A or 10,000 mA ) . The negative wire ( black ) remains in the terminal that is labeled " Common . " <p> Now that you have connected the calorimeter , ammeter ( in +10 A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost time to turn the power on . The voltmeter on the power source is not accurate . It is better to measure the voltage of the power source with a separate meter . A typical diagram of the experimental arrangement is shown below : <p> Now disconnect the ammeter from the power source for the purpose of first selecting an operating voltage . Turn on the power source , and set the voltage to not more than 6 V. Turn off the power ( without changing the voltage setting ) , and reconnect the ammeter to the power source . Re-check the initial temperature ( Ti ) . When you are ready to measure time , turn on the power source . <p> It is better to write down the values of V and I every 30 seconds , and then calculate a mean value for each , and use those mean values in the calculation of consumed electric energy ( W = V I t ) .

@@21346916 @1346916/ <p> A mass attached to a linear spring and set into up-and-down motion performs a motion that is called " simple harmonic motion , or SHM . " We need to first study the behavior of a linear spring . <p> Linear Springs : <p> A linear spring is one for which the change in length ( ? x ) is proportional to the change in the applied force ( ? F ) . <p> ? F = k ? x <p> where k , the proportionality constant , is called the " spring constant . " <p> Example 1 : A linear spring has an unstretched length of 18.0cm . When it is under a load of 125N , its total length is 20.5cm . Calculate ( a ) its constant , k , and ( b ) the load that makes it 25.0cm long . <p> The Metric unit for k is N/m . <p> Example 2 : A linear spring has a length of 35.0cm when under a load of 225N and a length of 43.0cm when under a load of 545N . Find ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( no load ) length . <p> Solution : To be solved by students . <p> The Linear Spring Formula : <p> Note that the formula ? F = k ? x is a relation between the applied force ( to the spring ) and the change in the spring 's length . The spring force ( Fs ) is always opposite to the applied force . As the following figures indicate , <p> when Fapplied is to the right , ? x is positive , Fs pulls to the left and is negative , and <p> when Fapplied is to the left , ? x is negative , Fs pushes to the right and is positive . <p> Based on the above Fs = - k x is the formula for a linear spring . When ( x ) is positive , Fs is negative and vise versa . This fact is reflected by the ( - ) sign in the formula . Note that Fs is not the applied force , it is the force that the spring exerts . <p> Simple Harmonic Motion : <p> Recall the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; therefore , ? = ? t . This will be used later . <p> If mass M performs a uniform circular motion in a vertical plane , its shadowon the x-axis performs a back-and-forth motion that is called simple harmonic motion . To understand the following figure , visualize that mass M moves slowly and counterclockwise along the circle ( of radius A ) , and at different positions , picture its shadow on the floor . The angular position of mass M on the circle is determined by ? . Corresponding to every ? there is a shadow position measured by x from C to H ( or O to K ) . It is possible to relate x to ? . Since ? = ? t ; therefore , x can be related to ? t . <p> The graph of x vs. ? is shown below with the assumption that at t = 0 , ? = 0 . That is mass M starts its motion from the position for which ? = 0 . Note that the farthest Point K can go from Point O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circle . A , the maximum deviation from the equilibrium position , is called the " Amplitude " of oscillations . <p> Example 3 : A bicycle wheel of radius 30.0cm is spinning at a constant angular speed of 180 rpm in a vertical plane .

" In the absence of frictional forces , the graph of such motion as a function of time has a perfect " sine " shape . It is for this reason that the motion is called harmonic . Figure ( a ) below shows a spring that is not loaded . Figure ( b ) shows the same spring but loaded and stretched a distance ( - h ) , and Figure ( c ) shows the loaded spring stretched further a distance ( -A ) and released .

We may therefore state that : <p> Acceleration : As shown above , at the middle ( x = 0 ) , a = 0 because the spring is neither stretched or compressed , F = 0 .

The formula for this constant speed is <p> v = f ? , <p> where , in SI units , f is the frequency in Hz and ? is the wavelength in meters . If the properties of the medium change , then the wave speed , v , changes . For a string , the mass and length remain constant to a high degree if the string is put under tension . Putting a string under tension affects the speed of waves in it . The formula for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F is the tension in the string in newtons , v is the wave speed in m/s , and is the mass per unit length of the string in kg/m. = Mt / Lt = total mass/total length . <p> Procedure : <p> 1 .

Measure the length of the string , and calculate its mass per unit length , , SI units . <p> 3 . Mount a rod and C-clamp on the edge of the table , and use a skew clamp to connect the string vibrator to the vertical rod . <p> 4 . Mount another rod and C-clamp on the same edge ( preferably at the corner of the table ) , and attach the pulley system to it . <p> 5 . Attach one end of the string to the string vibrator .

Plug in the string vibrator to the electric socket and turn it on . <p> 8 . Adjust the amount of weight suspended from the string until you obtain a good standing-wave pattern . Try to develop patterns ranging from one to eight loops if possible . ( The meaning of the word " loop " as used here needs to be clarified . A loop is a section of string between nodes , but the point at which the string is attached to the vibrator is not strictly a node .

Hz , which is the frequency of oscillations of the string vibrator , and calculate the percent error . The frequency of the vibrator is 120 Hz for the following reason . The frequency of the city electric outlet is 60.0 Hz , and in each half-cycle the coil ( electromagnet ) of the vibrator attracts and releases the blade . In each cycle , the blade is attracted and released twice . Therefore , the blade oscillates 120. times per second . 
@@21346919 @1346919/ <p> The discussion of electric potential is important because we are always looking for convenient sources of energy . Since any two point charges exert a force of attraction or repulsion on each other , if one charge moves in the field of the other a distance dr under an average force F , the work done is equal to Fdr . This means that if there is just a single charge alone in the entire space , there is potential . When a second charge is placed in the field of the first charge , then work and energy actualize and we think of potential energy . Recall the " potential energy " concept you learned in Physics I. The cause of gravitational potential energy is gravity . The potential energy a rock has in the gravitational field of the Earth is because of gravity . Gravity attracts mass M with a force F = Mg . When a rock is lifted to a height h , the work done on it is equivalent to Mgh . The potential energy stored or consumed is also Mgh . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ +q1 createsata distance r1from it:E = kq1/r2 . If another charge +q2 is placed at r1 , q1 repels it . As q2 moves away under the varying and repelling force F=kq1q2/r2 to 8 , more and more work will be done on it . The maximum amount of work that can be done may be calculated by integrating F+dr from r1 to 8 . <p> The electric potential V of a point charge q1at a typical point P in space at a distance r1 from it is given by : <p> Now if another charge like q2 is placed at P a distance r1 from q1 , then q2 finds a potential energy equal to <p> Consequently , we can write : P.E . = V1 q2 or , in general , Ue = Vq <p> If we examine the unit of V , we will see that it has units of ( energy per charge ) or in SI units ( Joules / Coulomb ) .

The presence of a second charge is necessary for Potential Energy to make sense . <p> Example 2 : Calculate the potential energy that another charge q2 = 5.00nC possess when placed at the three different points of the previous example . <p> Solution : P.E.1 = V1(q2) = 225 ( J/Coul. ) * ( 5.00x10-9 Coul. ) = 1130 nJ <p> This means that it takes 1130 nJ of energy to push a 5.00-nC of positive charge from infinity to a distance of 1.00m from charge q1 . <p> P.E.2 = V2(q2) = 113 ( J/Coul. ) * ( 5.00x10-9 Coul. ) = 565 nJ <p> It takes 565 nJ to push a 5.00-nC charge from infinity to a distance of 2.00m from q . <p> P.E.3 = V3(q3) = ( 0.0 ) * ( 5.00x10-9 Coul. ) = 0.0 nJ . <p> This means that it takes no effort ( energy ) to place a charge very far away from q1 . <p> Example 3:How much energy is needed to place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on each side ? Suppose that each charge is coming from far away ( infinity ) and that the triangle is in space far away from other electric charges . <p> Solution : 1 . Placing the 1st charge does not require any energy because other corners are empty . There is no repelling force against the first charge and it can be done effortlessly ( W1 = 0 ) . 2 . To bring a 2nd charge from infinity and place it at 0.250m from the 1st charge some work must be done . The work to be done is equal to the change in P.E . of the 2nd charge in the field of the 1st charge . It is equal to : <p> 3 .

Since E is constant , so is F , the force on any point charge q placed in E. The Work done on +q by constant F as it is pushed to the right varies linearly with x , simply <p> As the field does more work in pushing q to the right , more of its potential is used up . As the work done by the field ( W ) increases because of the increase in x , the P.E . or Ue of q decreases . <p> We may write:W = - P.E.= -Ue .

This makes the V equation to be <p> V = -E(x-x1) <p> Equipotentials : <p> Around a charge distribution , there are points at which potential is the same . This means that if charge q is placed at any of such points , it will have the same potential energy . A collection of such points form a surface that is called an " equipotential surface . " In 2-D , we show such surfaces as lines and call them " equipotential lines . " For example , around a positive or a negative point charge , there are infinite concentric spheres that each is an equipotential surface . Of course , the charge itself is at the center of such spheres . In the 2-D drawings shown below , for each of the ( + ) or ( - ) charge , the concentric circles are in fact concentric spheres . <p> The above charges are of course assumed to be separate and very far from each other and any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field line ( red or blue ) crosses an equipotential line ( each black circle ) , the angle is 90 degrees ; in other words , field lines are necessarily perpendicular the equipotential lines .

If two flat sheets of aluminum foil sandwich a thin sheet of paper , a capacitor is formed . When aluminum foils are connected to the poles of a battery , electrons from the negative pole flow through the connecting wire and distribute themselves over one foil making it negative . This negative side repels equal number of electrons from the other side and causes the other side to become positive . The repelled electrons flow toward the positive pole of the battery where they get absorbed by it . This process causes the battery to find new poles : the plates of the capacitor . One difference is that the new poles have more charges accumulated on them . The closer the plates ( or the thinner the insulating material , here the paper ) , the more charge accumulation occurs on them . However , there is a limit to the amount of positive and equally negative charges that can accumulate themselves on the two plates . If accumulation exceeds a certain value , electric discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity of the plates is obviously dependent on the area of each plate . Of course the assumption is that both plates are made equal and completely face each other . The thinner the insulating material ( called the dielectric ) the stronger the electric field between the plates and therefore the greater the capacity . The Capacity of a parallel-plate capacitor is given by <p> In the above formula , A is the area of each plate and d is the gap between the plates or the dielectric thickness . The quantity ( e ) is called the Permittivity of the material for electric field transmission through it . The permittivity of vacuum ( free space ) is shown by ( eo ) . These two quantities are related by ( e = ? eo ) where ? is called the dielectric constant of the material . The value of ? for vacuum is 1 , for mica is 5.4 , and for water is 80 . This means that if mica is used as the insulator ( the gap between the plates ) , the capacity increases by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Example 4:Calculate the capacity of a parallel-plates capacitor with rectangular ( 20.0cm by 30.0cm ) aluminum plates separated by a 0.10mm sheet of paper . The dielectric constant of regular paper is ? = 3.3 . <p> This means a square of side 2380m = 1.48 miles ( A capacitor 1.48mi by 1.48mi ? Not practical ! ! ! ) <p> Charge-Voltage Formula : <p> For a capacitor , the charge on the capacitor , Q , and the voltage , V , it generates are related by the formula : <p> The capacity of a capacitor is 1F if it can hold a maximum charge of 1C when connected to a voltage of 1V . Majority of capacitors have very small capacities . Most of them are built to hold charges of C or nC magnitudes . Farad = Coul. / Volt <p> Example 6 : Calculate the capacity of a capacitor that holds at most 30.0C of charge when connected to a 12.0V battery . <p> Solution : C = ( Q/V ) = ( 30.0C / 12.0volts ) C/volt or C = 2.50 F. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60.0C of charge on each plate and the voltage across it is 7.50 volts . Find its capacity . <p> Solution : The charge-voltage ratio is C = Q/V . The more the accumulated charges , the greater the voltage it makes . Capacity , C , is constant , anyway . <p> C = ( 60.0C ) / ( 7.50 volts ) = 8.00F ( micro-Farads ) . <p> Connection of Capacitors : <p> It is sometimes necessary to come up with a capacitor of a certain capacity that is not available in the lab . By combining two or more of different capacitors , the desired capacity can be made . In two ways capacitors may be connected : in series and in parallel . An equivalent capacity can be calculated for each type of connection . The following figure shows both types of connection and a formula that calculates the equivalent capacity for each type of connection : <p> Fig. 1Fig. 2 <p> Series : <p> The battery voltage must be equal the sum of voltages across the three capacitors . We may write : <p> Vtotal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If 2 electrons flow to the left of C1 , they repel 2 electrons from the right plate of C1 making its right plate positive . Those repelled electrons move to the left side of C2 making it negative while repelling 2 electrons from the right side of it making its right side positive . The same happens to C3 . The repelled 2 electrons from the right of C3 will be absorbed by the positive pole of the battery and the current is complete . Of course saying " 2 electrons " is just an example . In reality some 1013 or 1014 more or less electrons might flow . We end up with equal charges on capacitors that are in series . <p> Equivalent Capacity:The single capacitor that can replace those three capacitors must hold the same amount of charge , simply Q. For the equivalent capacitor , we may write : <p> The total charge Qtotal that leaves the battery distributes over the three capacitors such that <p> Qtotal = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 . <p> If capacities C1 , C2 , and C3 are proportional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , and say 18 electrons leave the negative pole of the battery , 4 will flow to C1 , 6 will flow to C2 , and 8 will flow to C3 and settle on their left plates . Equal number of electrons will be repelled from the right side plates making them positive . The repelled 18 electrons will be absorbed by the positive pole of the battery and the current is complete . This is just an example , in reality some 1013 or 1014 more or less electrons might flow . Qtotal = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 . <p> Equivalent Capacity : <p> Using Q = CeqV for the equivalent capacitor as well as the individual capacitors , yields : <p> CeqV = C1V + C2V + C3V <p> Dividing through by V , yeilds : <p> Ceq = C1 + C2 + C3 <p> Look at the following two simple examples : <p> Example 8 : A 30.0F capacitor is in series with a 6.00F capacitor . Find the equivalent capacity . <p> Solution : <p> 1 / Ceq = 1 / C1 + 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30.0 + 1 / 6.00 ; Ceq = 5.00F ; <p> Make sure you use horizontal fraction bars when verifying the solution . <p> Example 9 : A 30.0F capacitor is in parallel with a 6.00C capacitor . Find the equivalent capacity . <p> Solution : Ceq = C1 + C2 ; <p> Ceq = 30.0 + 6.00 ; <p> Ceq = 36.00F <p> Example 10 : In the figure shown , find the equivalent capacity . <p> Solution : Between a and b , there is a parallel set that simply add up . Cab = 60.0F <p> Then , Cab and Cbc are in series and their reciprocals add up to give the reciprocal of Cac . <p> 1 / Cac = 1/Cab + 1/Cbc = 1/60 + 1/20 = 1/15 <p> Cac = 15.0F <p> Example 11 : In the figure shown , find the voltage across and the charge accumulated in each capacitor . <p> Solution : From the top figure : <p> Cab = 12.0 + 15.0 = 27.0F ; and from the bottom figure : <p> 1/Cac = 1/Cab + 1/Cbc ; 1/Cac = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overall capacity that the 18.0-V battery faces . Since Q = CV ; thus , <p> Q = ( 9.00F ) ( 18.0V ) = 162 Coul . This means that each capacitor in the bottom figure accumulates 162C of charge ( They are in series ) . Knowing their capacities , we can calculate their voltages . <p> Qab = CabVab ; Vab = 6.00 Volts ( Same for C1 &amp; C2 ) <p> Qbc = CbcVbc ; Vbc = 12.0 Volts ( For C3 ) <p> Going to the ab-portion of the top figure , we may find how the two parallel capacitors divide the 162C of charge . They divide it as ( 12/27 ) and ( 15/27 ) proportions . Go to the next column . <p> Q1 = ( 12/27 ) ( 162C ) = 72.0C <p> Q2 = ( 15/27 ) ( 162C ) = 90.0C .

@@21346926 @1346926/ <h> The Coefficient of Kinetic Friction <p> The objective is to determine the coefficient of kinetic friction between two selected surfaces by applying two different methods . <p> Equipment : <p> An incline , a wooden block , a weight hanger , a set of slotted weights , a cord and pulley system , a sheet of graph paper , and a scientific calculator <p> Theory : <p> The Coefficient of friction is defined as the ratio of force of friction to the normal force , = F / N . Consider the following two cases ( Figures ) . One is for static friction and the other for kinetic friction <p> The force of friction acts against the direction of motion . Note that Fk &lt; Fs and consequently , k &lt; s . <p> If the externally applied force ( F ) is just equal to the force of static friction , Fs , then the object is on the verge of slipping , and the coefficient of friction involved is called the coefficient of static friction , s . <p> If the externally applied force ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fk , then the object slides at constant speed , and the coefficient of friction involved is called the coefficient of kinetic friction , k . <p> In order to find the coefficient of kinetic friction between two surfaces , the following two experimental procedures are to be followed : <p> I ) Inclined Plane Method : <p> In this case the tangent of the angle at which a block slides down on an incline at constant velocity gives the coefficient of kinetic friction between the bottom of the block and the top of the incline . k = tan ? k <p> The reason is as follows : <p> First , it is easy to prove that when the sides of two angles are perpendicular to each other , the two angles are equal , as shown Fig. 3 below . In each of the right triangles the sum of angles must be 180 . Each has a 90-angle . Also , Angles 1 and 2 are opposite and therefore equal . Their third angles must therefore be equal .

Verify this by paying more attention to the figure . <p> Also , note that for equilibrium , we must have N = F- or N = W cos ? . Why ? <p> At a certain angle of inclination , ? k , at which the block slides down at constant velocity , Fk and F become equal : <p> Fk = F , or Fk = W sin ? k . Why ? <p> Since , by definition k = Fk / N , we may write : <p> k = ( Fk / N ) = ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ k ) , ( verify ) or k = tan ? k . <p> II ) Horizontal Plane Method : <p> Referring to Fig. 5 , it is clear that M1 moves to the right because of F = M2g . ( F causes a tension in the cord that transmits to block M1 and pulls it.M1 is resisted by the friction force Fk . With tapping the horizontal surface , F = Fk only when M1 slides to the right at constant velocity . At a constant velocity of M1 to the right , we may write : <p> k= ( Fk / N ) = ( F / W ) or , k = M2g / M1g , or , k = M2 / M1 . <p> Procedure : <p> In this experiment , since the coefficient of kinetic friction is to be measured , all cases of constant speed motion of the block must be accompanied by tapping the incline .

@@21346927 @1346927/ <p> When you are beside a swimming pool , you notice that the pool appears shallow . If you look straight down into the pool , it still appears shallow , but not as shallow . This phenomenon is a result of refraction of light . Refraction is an abrupt change in the direction of light rays as they change medium , water to air , for example . The change in the direction of light from medium to medium is because of the change in speed it undergoes . Light speed in different media is different . A detailed proof will be discussed at the end of the chapter when you have established a strong basic knowledge . <p> Refraction is also another phenomenon verifying the straight line motion of light Refraction is the abrupt bending of light upon entering a new transparent medium . In this connection , the index of refraction will be defined . Light travels at different speeds in different media . For example the speed of light in glass is 200,000,000 m/s . Light speed in water is 225,000,000 m/s and in vacuum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in that medium . We may write : <p> c = 3.00x108 m/s is the speed of light in vacuum , and andvis speed of light in the medium of refraction index n . <p> Example 1 : Calculate the refraction indices of water , glass , and air ( almost vacuum , because air around us is very dilute at one atmosphere of pressure ) . <p> It is easy to see that when a ray of light ( a laser beam , for example ) is incident on water surface at a certain acute angle , it bends and enters water through a different angle ; in other words , it refracts . This refraction phenomenon is shown below for two cases : 1 ) when light enters water from air , and 2 ) when light enters air from water . <p> Fig. 1 <p> When a ray enters a medium with a greater refraction index , it refracts and gets closer to the normal line , N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a less dense medium , it refracts and goes away from the normal line , N ( Right figure ) . <p> Fig. 2 <p> Light entering water from air gets closer to the normal line after refraction . n1 and n2 are the refraction indices of medium 1 and medium 2 , respectively <p> ? i= angle of incidence <p> ? r = angle of refraction <p> D = angle of deviation <p> Light entering air from water goes away from the normal line after refraction . <p> In reflection , ? r = ? i , but in refraction , ? r in not equal to ? i . It is possible to arrive at a relation between these two angles . The relation that is not too difficult to derive is called the " Snell 's Law of Refraction " as shown below : <p> n1sin ? i = n2sin ? r <p> ? i is the angle of incidence , it means the angle that ray makes with normal line in medium 1 where its refraction index is labeled n1. ? r is the angle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes with the normal line in medium2 where its refraction index is labeled n2 . <p> Example 2 : A ray of light makes a 40.0 angle with water before entering water . What angle does it make with water surface after entering water ? nwater = 1.33 . <p> Solution : As the figure shows , the angle of incidence is not 40.0 degrees . It is 50.0 degrees , because the angle with normal at the point of incidence is important . ? i = 90.0- 40.0 = 50.0 and n1 = 1.00 for air . <p> Note that water has a greater index of 1.33 ; therefore , the refracted ray gets closer to the normal line , N. <p> Example 3 : A square slab of glass 1.00cm thick is 8.00cm on each side . The slab is placed flat on a table and a laser ray parallel to the table is incident on one edge of it making a 33.0 angle with that edge . The ray enters the slab and exits the opposite edge . ( a ) Show by calculation that the exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Calculate the shift ( s ) between the incident and exit rays . See the top view in the following diagram : <p> First answer these two questions : 1 ) If you find angle r1 , knowing that I1K = 8.0cm , can you calculate I1I2 from triangle I1KI2 ? 2 ) If you find angle A , knowing I1I2 , can you calculate I2H from triangle I1I2H ? If yes , that 's a good sign . First try to solve this problem without looking at the solution . <p> Let 's us consider the case of looking straight down into a swimming pool and seeing the floor of the pool higher . The apparent depth d'can be found from the formula <p> where d is the actual depth and n2 and n1 are the refraction indices of the final and initial media for the ray of light . Note that in both figures , A is the object and A ' is its virtual image . The image is virtual because it can not be formed on a screen . <p> Fig. 5 <p> Example 4 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appears to be at a depth of 5.5 ft when looking straight down onto it standing by the edge of the pool . What is the actual depth at that point ? <p> Solution : d ' = d ( n2 / n1 ) ; 5.5 ft = d ( 1.00 / 1.33 ) ; d = 7.3 ft . <p> Example 5 : Knowing that it takes two rays to form the image of a point of an object , draw a ray diagram to come up with the apparent position of an object at the bottom of a swimming pool for the case when it is not being looked at straight down . Choose the two rays as follows : a ) Ray 1 emerges from point A on the object perpendicular to the water surface . b ) Ray 2 emerges from point A on the object and makes a 60 angle with the water surface as shown in the left diagram . <p> Solution:Ray 1 is incident on water surface from underneath through ? i = 0 with the normal line N. From n1sin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? r = 0 as well , and Ray 1 goes out of water without refraction . <p> Ray 2 is incident on water surface from underneath through ? i = 30 with the normal line N. It refracts as it enters air through an angle greater than 30 . However , the refracted rays 1 and 2 are divergent in air and do not intersect to form a real image of A in air . We extend them in the opposite direction as shown in the right figure . The extensions in the opposite direction meet at A ' , the virtual image of A. <p> Fig. 6 <p> A ' , the virtual image of A appears to be higher as expected . <p> Total Internal Reflection : <p> In general , a ray incident at the interface between two transparent media faces reflection and refraction at the same time . Any ray will be partially reflected and partially refracted . Reflection is governed by ? i = ? r , and refraction by n1sin ? i = n2sin ? r . As the angle of incidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets reflected and a smaller portion refracted . The limiting value of ? i when light enters an optically denser medium is 90 ( left figure ) . This means that a ? i very close to 90 is possible for when light enters an optically denser medium . In such case , a small portion of light refracts and enters the second medium , and most of it reflects . In the figures shown , except the very right one , only the refracted portions are shown . <p> Fig. 7 <p> Now if light is going from a medium into an optically less dense medium ( middle figure ) , we know that it refracts though a greater angle than being incident. ? i is always less than ? r in this case . In other words , ? r can reach its limit of 90 before ? i is even 50 degrees for water-air interface . If ? i is large enough to make ? r more than 90 , then no light leaves the denser medium and all will be reflected back to the denser medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The limiting incident angle ? iat which refracted rays travel parallel to the interface is called the " critical angle " and is shown as ? c ( middle figure ) . Therefore , for ? i = ? c , ? r = 90 . Using these values in the Snell 's formula , yields : <p> n1sin ? c = n2 sin 90 ; n1sin ? c = n2 ( 1 ) ; sin ? c = n2 /n1 . <p> Example 6 : What is the critical angle for rays entering air from water ? <p> 1 ) Reflection and refraction are two phenomena that verify ( a ) the particle-like behavior of light .

( b ) No . <p> Thin lenses are studied here . The equations we work with apply to thin lenses only . Lenses work on the basis of refraction . Lenses are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spherical mirrors well , you will see that lenses have similar properties . One point that should be mentioned here is that a convex lens is converging , and a concave lens is diverging . This is one difference between lenses and mirrors . <p> A lens that is thicker in the middle is called " convex " and is converging . This means that it gathers parallel ray of light at its focal plane . A converging lens ( like a converging miror ) creates real images in five cases and virtual image in one case only . <p> A lens that is thinner in the middle is called " concave " and is diverging . It makes parallel rays of light to spread apart and diverge . A diverging lens ( like a diverging mirror ) creates virtual images only . Again virtual images are upright with respect to their respective objects and real images are inverted . <p> Example 7 : Decide if the following lenses are convex ( converging ) or concave ( diverging ) : <p> A converging ( convex ) lens is thicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point on its focal plane . If the parallel rays are also parallel to the main axis of the lens , they gather at the focal point on the main axis . Of course , the main axis of a lens is its axis of symmetry . See Figure 9 , below : <p> Fig. 9 <p> A diverging ( concave ) lens is thinner in the middle and diverges parallel rays of light in a manner as if they are coming from a point on its virtual focal plane . If parallel rays are also parallel to the main axis of the lens , they diverge as if they are coming from the virtual focal point , F on the main axis . Of course , the main axis of a lens is its axis of symmetry . See Figure 10 , below : <p> Fig. 10 <p> Important Rays in Lenses : <p> We may use three important rays to draw ray diagrams for the image of objects in lenses . The way important rays are numbered may vary from text to text . As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are as follows : <p> Ray 1 : Ray 1 may be chosen to be the one moving parallel to the main axis that passes through the focal point after refraction ( going through the lens ) . Of course , for a diverging lens , the refracted ray appears to have come from the virtual focal point . <p> Ray 2 : Ray 2 can be chosen as the one that passes through the focal point and travels parallel to the main axis after refraction ( going through the lens ) . <p> Ray 3 : Ray 3 is the one that passes through the center of the lens , and it goes straight through without refraction . Note that the center of a lens is where its main axis crosses it . Note that we are talking about a thin lens for which thickness is negligible . The following diagrams show the important rays for both converging and diverging thin lenses : <p> Fig. 11 <p> Now that the basics for thin lenses are covered , we may proceed with the ray diagrams for the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lenses : <p> This type of lens is used in microscopes , telescopes , projectors , and more . Each human eye has a converging lens . Converging lenses are used in eye-glasses to correct farsightedness . There are six cases for image in a converging lenses . In each case we may use 2 of the 3 important rays to form the image . In drawing ray diagrams , we keep in mind thefollowing assumptions : <p> a ) The object is placed perpendicular to the main axis with its bottom on the main axis . b ) An arrow is used to show the object with its tip indicating the top . c ) Only the image of the top of the object is enough to find the image of the whole object . d ) A real image is formed when real ( refracted ) rays of light intersect . e ) A virtual image is formed when the refracted ( real ) rays are divergent and do not intersect . In such case , the extension of the divergent rays in the opposite direction do intersect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be formed on a screen . A virtual image can not be formed on a screen . <p> Case I : Object at infinity ( do = 8 ) <p> Object at infinity means very far from the lens . A distance of 100m may be considered infinity for a lens whose focal length is within half a meter . Rays coming from distant objects are essentially parallel or close to being parallel . If we hold a converging lens such that its main axis is parallel to the incoming almost parallel rays , the image forms at its focal point F on the main axis . This is the case when you hold a converging lens in front of the Sun and you see the accumulation of the refracted sunrays as a burning spot . You can change the lens orientation and form that spot on the main axis as shown . The spot on the main axis is the focal point , F. The distance from F to the center of the lens , O , is called the focal length of the lens . <p> do = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Inverted <p> 3 ) A'B ' &lt;&lt;AB 4 ) di = f <p> " &lt;&lt; " means much smaller . <p> Fig. 12 <p> In this figure the assumptions made above are not completely observed . Although object AB is placed perpendicular to the main axis ; however , the bottom of the object is not on the main axis . The center of the object is on the main axis . For the Sun , due to a nice symmetry , top A and bottom B are shown by arrowheads . <p> Case II : Object beyond 2f ( do&gt; 2f ) <p> From all points of the object infinite rays of light emerge radially outward . If A ' the image of point A , the tip of the object , is found , the rest is easy . Over half of the rays that emerge from A do not reach the lens simply because the lens is not in their way . All rays that are incident on the converging lens will come to the same point after refraction through the lens . This gathering point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it A ' , we choose only two of those infinite rays that are convenient for us . Ray 1 is the ray that travels parallel to the main axis and after refraction passes through F , and Ray 2 that passes through F and travels parallel to the main axis after refraction . You need to carefully track these to rays . The refracted rays 1 and 2 intersect at a point that we call A ' , the image of A. If from A ' , a line perpendicular to the main axis is drawn , point B ' , the image of B , the bottom of the object will be determined . The ray diagram is shown below . You need to completely redraw it . As you will note for an object placed beyond 2f , the image forms between f and 2f . <p> do &gt;2f <p> Image Conditions : <p> 1 ) Real <p> 2 ) Inverted <p> 3 ) A'B ' &lt; AB <p> 4 ) f &lt; di &lt; 2f <p> Note that points A , O , and A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use important ray 3 ( the dotted line ) , it would go through O , without refraction , and reach A ' where the other two rays intersect . This verifies the fact that refracted rays coming from a point of the object meet at a common point to form the image of the that point of the object . <p> Fig. 13 <p> Case III : Object at 2f ( do= 2f ) <p> do = 2f <p> Image Conditions : <p> 1 ) Real 2 ) Inverted <p> 3 ) A'B ' = AB <p> 4 ) di = 2f <p> Ray 1 travels parallel to the main axis and passes through F after refraction . Ray 2 passes through F and travels parallel to the main axis after refraction . The two refracted rays intersect at A ' that is the image of A. The line drawn from A ' normal to the main axis intersects it at B ' the image of B. B falls on 2F . <p> Fig. 14 <p> Case IV : Object between f and 2f ( f &lt; do&lt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> 1 ) Real <p> 2 ) Inverted <p> 3 ) A'B ' &gt; AB <p> 4 ) di &gt; 2f <p> Ray 1 travels parallel to the main axis and passes through F after refraction.Ray 2 passes through F and travels parallel to the main axis after refraction . The two refracted rays intersect at A ' that is the image of A. The line drawn from A ' perpendicular to the main axis intersects it at B ' that is the image of B. <p> Fig. 15 <p> Case V : Object at f ( do= f ) <p> do = f <p> Image Conditions : <p> 1 ) Real 2 ) Inverted <p> 3 ) A'B ' &gt;&gt;AB <p> 4 ) di = 8 <p> " &gt;&gt; " means much greater . <p> Ray 1 travels parallel to the main axis and passes through F after refraction . Ray 3 goes through the center , O , without refraction . The two rays are parallel and theoretically do not intersect . In practice , the object is placed very close to F so that do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lens and much greater than the object . This is the case with projectors . <p> Fig. 16 <p> The following figure shows such ray diagram . When AB is slightly passed F , the image forms far from the lens and much greater than AB . <p> Fig. 17 <p> Case VI : Object within f ( do&lt; f ) <p> do &lt; f <p> Image Conditions : <p> 1 ) Virtual 2 ) Upright <p> 3 ) A'B ' &gt;AB <p> 4 ) di forms behind the lens <p> This is the only case that a virtual image is formed . A virtual image can not be formed on a screen . Ray 1 passes through F after refraction . Ray 3 goes toward the lens ' center without refraction . The two rays are divergent going to the right . They should be extended in opposite directions to intersect each other at A ' . A ' is the virtual image of A. It can not be formed on a screen . <p> Fig. 18 <p> Real and Virtual Images : <p> In the first 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed because real rays of light intersect to form it and it is called the " real image . " A real image can be formed on a screen . <p> In case 6 above , A ' , the image of A is formed by the extension of divergent real rays in the opposite direction , and it is called the " virtual image . " A virtual image can not be formed on a screen . <p> The Lens Formula : <p> Thin lenses use the same formula as lenss . It is easy to show that the relation between the object distance do , the image distance , di , and the focal lengthf of a lens is : <p> This is true for all lenses , converging or diverging . <p> Note in the figure that A'B ' = HO and AB = KO . Also , FO = f . <p> FB = do - f and FB ' = d i - f . <p> With these in mind , writing the similarity of two pairs of triangles , the above formula can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right as a typical case . ABF is similar to HOF . It results in <p> AB / A'B ' = FB / FO ( 1 ) <p> FKO is similar to A'FB ' ; thus , AB / A'B ' = FO / FB ' ( 2 ) <p> Comparing ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) results in FB / FO = FO / FB ' or , <p> ( do - f ) ( di - f ) = f 2 or , dodi - dof - dif + f 2 = f 2 or , <p> Fig. 19 <p> dodi = di f + dof ; dividing through by dodi f , <p> 1 / f = 1 / do + 1 / di <p> Magnification : <p> Magnification , M , is defined as the ratio of image size to the object size . It is easy to show that magnification is also the ratio of the image distance to the object distance . A negative sign is usually assigned to the second ratio to account for the virtual image . It is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bothered by the negative sign in its formula . <p> Important : <p> In the lens formula ( 1/f = 1/do + 1/di ) , do is always positive , because the object itself is real . If the image is real , di is also positive . If the image is virtual , di is negative . Even f , the focal length can be positive or negative . For a converging lens , f is real and positive . For a diverging lens , f is virtual and negative . In general , anything real is positive , and anything virtual is negative . <p> Example 8 : A 10.0-cm object is placed at 18.0cm from a converging lens perpendicular to its main axis . The focal distance of the lens is 12.0cm . Find the image distance , magnification , size , and state if real or virtual . Also , provide an appropriate ray diagram . <p> Example 9 : A 5.0-cm object is placed at 10.5cm from a converging lens perpendicular to its main axis . The focal length of the lens is 21.0cm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and state if real or virtual . Also , provide an appropriate ray diagram . <p> Solution : <p> 1/do+1/di = 1/f <p> 1/10.5 +1/di = 1/21 ; di = -21.0cm . <p> Fig. 21 <p> Since di is negative , the image is on the same side as the object ( left ) and the image is therefore , virtual . The magnification is : <p> M = - di / do = -(-21.0)/10.5 = + 2.0 ; Also , M = A'B ' / AB ; <p> +2.0 = A'B ' /5.0 ; A'B ' = + 10.0 cm . ; The image is upright . <p> Another example : <p> Example 10 : A converging lens forms a real image that is 4.00 times greater than the object at 60.0cm from the lens . Find the focal length of the lens , and the object size if the image size is 20.0cm . <p> Solution : Since the image is real , it is necessarily inverted . M = - 4.00 . <p> But , M = - di / do ; - 4 = -60/do ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1/15 + 1/60 = 1/f ; f = 12.0cm <p> AB = 20.0 / 4.00 = 5.00cm <p> Image in Diverging Lenses : <p> There is only one case for image in a diverging lens . No matter where the object is placed around the main axis of a diverging lens , the image is always upright , virtual , smaller than the object , and forms on the same side of the lens that the object is placed . This type of lens is used to correct nearsightedness . A ray diagram is shown below : <p> Object placed anywhere on one side of the diverging lens along the main axis <p> Image is always : <p> 1 ) Virtual 2 ) Upright <p> 3 ) A'B ' &lt;AB <p> 4 ) di forms on the same side that the object is placed . <p> For clarity , only half of the lens is drawn . Ray 1 traveling parallel to the main axis refracts as if coming from the virtual F. Ray 2 going toward F refracts parallel to the main axis . The refracted rays 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lens . Their extension in the opposite direction meet within the virtual focal length to form A ' . Since A ' is above the main axis , the image is always upright , virtual , and smaller than the object . <p> Fig. 23 <p> Note that f , the focal distance of a diverging lens is virtual and in solving problems , it should be treated as a negative quantity . <p> Example 11 : A 14.0-cm object is placed at 8.0cm from a diverging lens perpendicular to its main axis . The focal length of the lens is 12.0cm . Find the image distance , magnification , size , and state if it is real or virtual . Also , provide an appropriate ray diagram . <p> Solution : f = 12.0cm <p> 1/do+1/di =1/f <p> 1/8 +1/di= 1 / ( -12 ) ; <p> di = - 4.8cm . Since di is negative , the image is virtual as expected . The magnification is : <p> M = - di /do = -(-4.8)/8 = 0.60 ; Also , M = A'B ' / AB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8.4 cm . <p> Fig. 24 <p> Another example : <p> Example 12 : Show that the general lens formula ( 1/f = 1/do+1/di ) is valid for a thin slab of glass as well . A thin slab of glass may be viewed as a lens for whichf ? 8 . Let f ? 8 in the formula and see how doand di are related . What does the ( - ) sign mean ? What is the magnification ? Solution : To be done by students . <p> Example 13 : Using the general lens formula , show that when object is moved very far away from the lens to say infinity ( do ? 8 ) , the image forms at the focal point F. Solution : To be done by students . <p> Example 14 : Using the general lens formula , show that when object is at F , the image forms at infinity . <p> Solution : To be done by students . <p> Example 15 : The distance between the object and its real image in a converging lens is 125.0cm . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A'B ' &gt; AB , find doand di . <p> Using the quadratic formula yields : do = 50cm and do = 75cm . Only do = 50cm is admissible because d i =do + 25.0 = 75.0cm and yields a magnification of greater than 1 ( A'B ' &gt; AB ) . <p> Another example : <p> Example 16 : The distance between the object and its virtual image in a converging lens is 32.0cm . The lens has a focal length of 24.0cm . Find do , di , and the image size , if the objects height is AB = 4.5cm . <p> do = -48cm and do = 16cm are the possible answers . do = 16.0cm is acceptable ( being positive ) , and d i = 48.0cm . In the formulas , we should treat d i negative . d i = - 48.0cm . <p> Fig. 26 <p> M = - di /do = -(-48)/16 = 3.00 ; Also , M = A'B ' / AB <p> 3.00 = A'B ' /4.5 ; A'B ' = 13.5 cm . <p> Another example : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its virtual image in a diverging lens is 24.0cm . The lens has a focal length of 48.0cm . Find do , di , and the image size , if the objects height is AB = 12.0cm . Draw a ray diagram before solving . <p> Solution : Left for students . Answer : 48.0cm , -24.0cm , and 6.0cm . <p> Lens Makers Formula : <p> The following formula provides a relation between the radii of curvature of a thin lens , its refraction index , and its focal length . It is called the " lens makers formula . " <p> where R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the sides of the lens , n is its refraction index , with f being the focal length . In this formula , if R1 or R2 is positive , the corresponding side is convex ( bulged out ) and adds to the converging property of the lens . If R1 or R2 is negative , the corresponding side is concave ( caved in ) and adds to the diverging property of the lens . n , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Example 18 : The radii of curvature of a convex-convex lens are 24cm and 36cm . The refraction index of glass is 1.50 , Find its focal length . <p> Solution : The diagram shows that the more convex a side is the shorter radius it has . Using the lens makers formula yields : 1/f = ( n-1 ) ( 1/R1 + 1/R2 ) <p> 1/f = ( 1.5-1 ) ( 1/24 + 1/36 ) = 5/144 ; f = 29 cm <p> Fig. 27 <p> Example 19 : The radius of curvature of the convex side of a convex-flat lens is 30.0cm . The refraction index of glass is 1.50 , Find its focal length . <p> Solution : The diagram shows that the flat side has a radius of curvature of 8 . Not that 1/8 = 0 . Using the lens makers formula yields : 1/f = ( n-1 ) ( 1/R1 + 1/R2 ) <p> 1/f = ( 1.5-1 ) ( 1/30 + 1 / 8 ) = 1/60 ; f = 60.0cm <p> Fig. 28 <p> Example 20 : The radius of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25.0cm . The refraction index of glass is1.50 , Find its focal length . <p> Solution : Note that the radius of the concave side is always treated as negative . The diagram shows that the concave side has a radius of curvature of R1 =-25.0cm and that of the flat side is R2 =8 . Not that 1/8 = 0 . Using the lens makers formula yields : 1/f = ( n-1 ) ( 1/R1 + 1/R2 ) <p> 1/f = ( 1.5-1 ) ( -1/25 + 1 / 8 ) = -1/50 ; f = -50.0cm <p> Fig. 29 <p> Example 21 : The radius of curvature of the concave side of a concave-convex lens is 25.0cm and that of its convex side is 40.0cm . The refraction index of glass is 1.50 , Find its focal length . <p> Solution : Note that the radius of the concave side is always treated as negative . The diagram shows that the concave side has a radius of curvature of R1 =-25.0cm and that of the convex side is R2 =40.0cm . Using the lens makers formula yields : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1/f = ( 1.5-1 ) ( -1/25 + 1 /40 ) = -15/2000 ; f = -133cm <p> Fig. 30 <p> The Convergence Power ( C ) of a Lens : <p> The power of a lens is defined as the the reciprocal of its focal length . The shorter the focal length of a lens , the greater its converging or diverging power . The formula is <p> where if f is in meters in SI , then C is expressed in " diopters . " <p> Example 22 : Calculate the convergence power of a lens that has a focal length of 50.0cm . <p> Solution : C = 1 / f ; C = 1 / ( 0.500m ) = +2.00 diopters . <p> Example 23 : A student experimenting with a lens notices that when sunlight is perpendicular to the lens surface , a bright spot forms at a distance of 80.0cm from it . If the spot is at its minimum size , determine ( a ) the focal length of the lens , and ( b ) its converging power . <p> Solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight that are also parallel to its main axis to the smallest bright spot on an object , the distance from that bright spot to the lens is the focal length of the lens . We may write : <p> ( a ) f = 80.0cm ; ( b ) C = 1/f ; C = 1 / ( 0.800m ) = +1.25 diopters . <p> Example 24 : To measure the focal length and the power of a diverging lens , a student places it on an optical bench in a vertical position as shown . He sends two symmetric parallel laser beams with respect to its main axis to the lens and traces the refracted rays at points A , B , A ' , and B ' as shown . The measurements are also shown . Find the virtual focal distance , f , and the negative power , C , of this lens . <p> Solution : Points A , B , A ' , and B ' are made on a vertical flat sheet of cardboard adjusted to show the trace of the refracted laser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward to locate the virtual focal point . Distances AH , HK , and BK are measured in ( cm ) and the values are shown . From the two similar triangles AHF and BKF , we may write : ( a ) <p> 25/10. = ( 45+f ) / f ; 25f = 450 +10. f ; f = 30. cm <p> ( b ) C = 1 / f ; C = 1 / ( - 0.30m ) = - 3.33 diopters . <p> Fig. 31 <p> Another example : <p> Example 25 : A student is farsighted and uses a pair of glasses each of which power is +1.50 diopters . What is the focal length of each lens in cm ? <p> Solution : C = 1/f ; f = 1/C ; f = 1 / ( 1.50m-1 ) = 0.667m ; f = 66.7cm <p> Convergence Theorem : <p> If a number of thin lenses are placed beside each other with their main axes aligned , the total power is equal to the sum of individual powers . We may write : <p> C = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Example 26 : A concave ( diverging ) lens with a focal length of 40.0cm is combined with a convex ( converging ) lens with a focal length of 25.0cm with their main axes aligned . What is the focal length of the combined lens ? <p> There are two types of telescopes : refractors and reflectors . A refractor uses two converging lenses and works completely on the basis of refraction . <p> A reflector uses a converging mirror and a converging lens . We will discuss the two-lens telescope or simply the refractor here . <p> Refractor Telescopes : <p> A refractor telescope has a lens that is exposed to light coming from distant objects . It is called the " Objective Lens . " The other lens through which the final image is viewed is called the " ocular " or the " eye-piece . " The focal length , fo , of the objective lens is a few meters and that of the eye-piece , fe , is a few centimeters . The magnification power of a refractor may be found from the formula M = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first and second images is shown below : <p> Fig. 32 <p> A'B ' , the first real and inverted image formed at Fois not labeled for clarity and lack of space in the figure . The observer adjusts the eye-piece such that the first image is not exactly at Fe , the focal point of the eye-piece , but it is within the focal length of the eye-piece . The Eye-piece forms a virtual image ( A ' ' B ' ' ) from that first real image . The observer simply sees A ' ' B ' ' . A'B ' , formed at Fo , shown but not labeled , is a real image that acts as a virtual object for the eye-piece . This is the first time , we have mentioned a term like " virtual object . " <p> Human Eye : <p> For the anatomy of human eye , you may refer to your text or an anatomy text . The main point here is that human eye has a converging lens whose focal length can vary by the eye muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retina where photosensitive nerves transmit the image to the brain for processing and recognition . As an object gets closer to human eye ( s ) , the eye muscles push from all sides to make the eye lens more converging so that the image forms at the retina . If the image is not formed on the retina for any reason , the image will not be clear . We may discuss a few of the eye problems here in brief . <p> 1 ) Farsightedness : <p> A farsighted person can see far objects clearly . This means that the image of far objects form on the retina without any problem . As an object gets closer to a farsighted eye , the image moves a way from the lens to the back of retina . A normal eye makes the eye lens more convex ( converging ) to form the image back on the retina ; however , a farsighted eye is not capable of doing that and the image forms behind retina . To make the eye for observing nearby objects more convex , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore the remedy for farsightedness is a converging lens . <p> Fig. 33 ( a ) <p> Fig. 33 ( b ) <p> The eyeball is shown with the eye lens on its left side . <p> In Fig. ( a ) , the farsighted eye is comfortable with a far away object . In Fig. ( b ) , the image is not formed on the retina for a nearby object . The eye lens is not convergent enough and forms the image behind retina . The remedy is to make it more convergent by using a convergent lens as shown in Fig. ( c ) . <p> Fig. 33 ( c ) <p> 2 ) Nearsightedness : <p> A nearsighted person can see near objects clearly . This means that the image of near objects form on the retina without any problem . As an object moves away from a nearsighted eye , the image moves toward the lens to form in front of retina . A normal eye makes the eye lens less convex ( converging ) to form the image back on the retina ; however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the image forms in front of retina . To make the eye for observing far away objects less convex , a concave ( diverging ) lens must be added to the eye lens . Therefore the remedy for nearsightedness is a diverging lens . <p> Fig. 34 ( a ) <p> Fig. 34 ( b ) <p> The eyeball is shown with the eye lens on its left side . <p> In Fig. ( a ) , the nearsighted eye is comfortable with a nearby object . In Fig. ( b ) , the image is not formed on the retina for a far away object . The eye lens is very convergent and forms the image in front of retina . The remedy is to make it less convergent by using a divergent lens as shown in Fig. ( c ) . <p> Fig. 34 ( c ) <p> 3 ) Astigmatism : <p> When eye is not capable of forming the image of a point as a point , the problem is called astigmatism . The reason is the loss of symmetry of the eye lens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To solve this problem , the correcting lens must be custom-made to account for the asymmetry of the eye lens . <p> Dispersion : <p> Dispersion is the separation of light into its constituent colors . This phenomenon can be treated as a ray optics subject in this chapter or as a wave optics topic in the next chapter . When a light ray is incident on the interface between two transparent media , it refracts . The refraction angle depends on the wavelength or color of the refracted ray . The shorter the wavelength , the greater the angle of refraction . Since white light is a mixture of different colors and consequently a mixture of different wavelengths , and different wavelength refract through different angles , when a ray of white light goes through refraction , it separates into its constituent colors and forms a rainbow . The best way to show this phenomenon is by a prism . A prism refracts a light ray twice , once at the entrance and once at the exit . A prism is a triangular slab of glass . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) In the ray diagrams for image in lenses , the object ( an upward arrow ) is meant to be ( a ) perpendicular to the main axis .

The study of fluids at rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on weight density , D , of the fluid and depth , h , at which pressure is to be calculated . Of course , as we go deeper in a fluid , its density increases slightly because at lower points , there are more layers of fluid pressing down causing the fluid to be denser.For liquids , the variation of density with depth is very small for relatively small depths and may be neglected . This is because of the fact that liquids are incompressible.For gases , the density increase with depth becomes significant and may not be neglected . Gases are called compressible fluids .

This makes the air layers denser and denser as we move from outer space toward the Earth 's surface . It is the weight of the atmosphere that causes the atmospheric pressure . The depth of the atmosphere is about 60 miles . If we go 60 miles above the Earth surface , air molecules become very scarce to where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single molecule ( a good vacuum ! ) . Vacuum establishes the basis for absolute zero pressure . Any gas pressure measured with respect to vacuum is called " absolute pressure . " <p> Calculation of the Atmospheric Pressure : <p> The trick to calculate the atmospheric pressure is to place a 1-m long test tube filled with mercury inverted over a pot of mercury such that air can not get in the tube . Torricelli ( Italian ) was the first to try this . The figure is shown above . In doing this , we will see that the mercury level drops to 76.0cm or 30.0 inches if the experiment is performed at ocean level . The top of the tube lacks air and does not build up air pressure . This device acts as a balance . If it is taken to the top of a high mountain where there is a smaller number of air layers above one 's head , the mercury level goes down . This device can even be calibrated to measure elevation for us based on air pressure . <p> The pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure that the same diameter column of air generates but with a length of 60 miles ( from the Earth 's surface all the way up to the no-air region ) . <p> Using the formula for pressure ( p = F / A ) , the pressure of the mercury column or the atmospheric pressure can be calculated as follows : <p> To 2 significant figures , this result is a coincidence:patm = 1.0 kgf /cm2 . <p> If you softly place a 2.2 lbf ( or 1.0 kgf ) weight over your finger nail ( A = 1 cm2 almost ) , you will experience a pressure of 1.0 kgf / cm2 ( somewhat painful ) that is equivalent to the atmospheric pressure . The atmosphere is pressing with a force of 1 kgf = 9.8 N on every cm2 of our bodies and we are used to it . This pressure acts from all directions perpendicular to our bodies surfaces at any point .

This pressure is F/A . The two pressures must be equal , according to Pascal 's principle .

@@21346941 @1346941/ <p> Force may be defined as the cause of motion and deformation . When a force is applied to an object , the object either moves or changes shape or both . In most cases , it is not possible to detect the deformation by naked eyes at the molecular or atomic level . Deformation occurs no matter how small . <p> In Chapter 1 , force was defined as the product of mass and acceleration . Simply F = Ma . A more useful form of this formula isSF = Ma . SF means the sum of forces acting on mass M. Since forces acting on an object may act in opposite directions , SF is also called the net force . <p> The formula SF = Ma is called the " Newton 's 2nd Law of Motion . " <p> For example , a car moving along a straight and horizontal highway , experiences an engine force Fe , while being opposed by an overall frictional force , Ff ( road friction as well as air resistance ) . If the car is moving to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction , then Fe acts to the right and Ff acts to the left . The net force is SF = Fe- Ff . <p> Example 1 : An 850-kg car is accelerating at a rate of 2.4m/s2 to the right along a straight and horizontal road where it experiences an overall frictional force of 1500N . Determine the force that its engine exerts . <p> Solution : If " to the right " is taken to be positive as usual , Fe is positive , and Ff negative.Note that friction always opposes the direction of pending motion . Applying Newton 's 2nd law : <p> Note that the 2040N must be rounded to 2 significant figures and then added to the 1500N . <p> Example 2 : A 2400-kg truck is moving at a constant speed of 15m/s on a horizontal and straight road that offers an overall frictional force of 1800N . Calculate ( a ) its acceleration , ( b ) the engine force , ( c ) the distance it travels in 35s , ( d ) its acceleration if it changes its speed to 25m/s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force in this case . <p> Example 3 : A car that weighs 14700N is traveling along a straight road at a speed of 108 km/h . The driver sees a deer on the road and has to bring the car to stop in a distance of 90. m . Determine ( a ) the necessary deceleration , ( b ) the stopping force , ( c ) the brakes force , if the road friction is 2100N , and ( d ) the stopping time . Try to solve the problem yourself before looking at the solution . <p> Solution : The mass of the car and its velocity in ( m/s ) must be determined first . Recall that w = Mg . The mass of the car is therefore , M = w/g , or M = ( 14700N ) / ( 9.8 m/s2 ) , or M = 1500kg . <p> 1 ) If an object is under a zero net force , it is either stationary or if moving , it moves at constant velocity .

For each case , a force diagram must be drawn . Let 's take the +y-axis to be upward . Make sure that you carefully draw each force diagram with minimal looking at the following force diagrams . <p> ( a ) w = Mg = ( 80kg ) ( -9.8 m/s2 ) = -780N <p> This is the case that the elevator has just started going upward . Since its speed has to change from zero to some value , it has to accelerate upward and the person feels heavier because the floor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man that is greater than his weight . This creates a nonzero net force and therefore accelerates the person . <p> SF = Ma ; N- Mg = Ma ; N =M ( g + a ) <p> N =M ( g + a ) = ( 80.0kg ) ( 9.8+2.5 ) m/s2 = 984N <p> ( b ) w = Mg = ( 80kg ) ( -9.8 m/s2 ) = -780N <p> In this case , since the elevator goes up at constant speed , its acceleration is zero and so is the acceleration of the man .

If the cord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 2nd question is definitely " Yes . " The answer to the first question is now more clear , " No . " Block B is not free to fall and must pull block A in addition to moving itself . The vertical forces on block A cancel each other , according to the Newton 's 3rd law . The force of gravity on block B is the cause of motion while block A is on the horizontal surface . In fact , we are only interested to find the acceleration of the system of blocks while A slides horizontally . Let 's summarize : ( 1 ) the force that causes motion is WB and ( 2 ) this force has to move both masses ( MA + MB ) . Since the system is connected , both blocks move at the same acceleration ( same magnitude ) .

This is mathematically written as : <p> Note that Fappl. = Fk and w = N . <p> It is easy to understand that Fk ( force of kinetic friction ) is the force that the horizontal surface exerts on the object and Fappl. is the force that equals Fk . If Fappl. is exactly equal to Fk , the object slides at constant velocity . We also know that if w and N are the only forces in the vertical direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula may be written as <p> This formula is often written in its cross-multiplied form:Fk = kN . This means that , if the coefficient of friction between two surfaces is known , and we can also determine the normal or compressive force between those two surfaces , we are then able to determine the necessary force that can slide one surface against the other at a constant velocity . <p> Example 8 : The coefficient of kinetic friction between a cement block and a plank of wood is 0.38 .

This is mathematically written as : <p> Again , N = w , and Fappl. = Fs , on the verge of slipping , and the above equation may be written as : <p> This formula is often written in its cross-multiplied form:Fs = sN .

The first 3 apply to the force of friction , and the last 2 to the coefficient of friction . <p> 4 ) Coefficient of friction ( ) depends on the materials of the contacting surfaces . <p> 5 ) Coefficient of friction ( ) depends on the smoothness of the contacting surfaces . <p> Example 11 : Two kids are sitting on the opposite sides of a 3.0-m long table and sliding a 150-gram empty cup toward each other , back and forth .

At a first glance , you may think that ( Vf2- Vi2 = 2ax ) is a good idea . In this equation , the acceleration ( a ) of the cup is not known . This means that we need to use the kinetic equation , SF= Ma in order to solve for acceleration , first . What are the forces acting on the cup after it is given an initial instant push ? The only acting force is the force of kinetic friction , Fk . To find Fk , we need to knowN , and consequently ( w ) . Therefore , we must start from w = Mg . <p> w = Mg = ( 0.15kg ) ( 9.8 m/s2 ) = 1.47N ; therefore , N = 1.47N . <p> Fk = kN ; Fk = ( 0.12 ) ( 1.47 N ) = 0.176 N. <p> SF = Ma ; - 0.176N = ( 0.150kg ) ( a ) ; a = -1.173 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 02- Vi2 = 2 ( -1.173 m/s2 ) ( 2.9m ) ; Vi = 2.6 m/s . <p> Example 12 : A truck that weighs 29,400N traveling at 72.0 km/h on a horizontal and straight road skids to stop in 6.00s .

@@21346942 @1346942/ <p> This chapter discusses how length , mass , and time measurements are affected for objects that travel at very very high speeds ( close to the speed of light ) . The speed of light in vacuum is c = 3.00x108 m/s = 3.00x105 km/s = 1.86x105 miles/s . Those who drive their vehicle about 20,000miles per year , will have an odometer reading of about 186,000 miles in 9 years . Light travels this distance in one second . <p> In " Special Relativity , " the relative motion of non-accelerating objects is studied . In other words , constant velocity motion relative to a reference frame which motion is also at a constant velocity is studied . <p> In " General Relativity , " the relative motion of accelerating objects is studied where mass , force and energy calculations play important roles . <p> Before starting the special relativity , it is necessary to review the topics of relative motion as well as inertial frames . An inertial frame is one that has a constant velocity . This means that not only the speed of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same direction and its motion is along a perfectly straight line . Earth itself is not really an inertial frame , because it turns about its own axis as well as going around the Sun , the combination of at least two curvy motions ; however , since such radii of curvature are so great , its motion very well approximates an inertial frame for short intervals of time . <p> Relative Motion : <p> I ) Relative Motion in One Dimension <p> For simplicity , we first look at relative motion in one dimension , say the x-axis , for example . Suppose car A is moving East at 65miles/h ( with respect to the origin ) , and , behind that , car B is moving at 55miles/h East ( also , with respect to the origin ) . The passengers in car A see or measure the velocity of car B moving West at 10miles/h while the passengers in car B see or measure the velocity of car A moving East at 10 miles/h . <p> Based on the above , the relative velocity of car B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative velocity of car A with respect to B ( VA/B = +10km/h ) . <p> This example also emphasizes that the measurement of motion ( distance , time , velocity , and acceleration ) is relative and depends on who measures what ! <p> II ) Relative Motion in Two Dimensions <p> In the figure on the right , the position of particle P with respect to frame A is rPA . Its position with respect to frame B is rPB . Note that the position of frame B itself with respect to frame A is determined by rBA . According to vector addition , we may write : rPA = rPB + rBA . <p> Now suppose both of particle P and frame B are moving with respect to frame A , not necessarily at the same velocity . Taking the time derivative of both sides and setting each term equal to its corresponding velocity , results in <p> ( d/dt ) rPA = ( d/dt ) rPB + ( d/dt ) rBA.or , <p> vPA = vPB + vBA . <p> This reads as : <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the velocity of P relative to B plus the velocity of B relative to A. " <p> The order of the subscripts must be carefully written . In general , <p> vAB = - vBA . <p> Example 1 : <p> A fighter jet traveling North with velocity VFG = ( 750 mph , N ) . fires a rocket Eastward at VRF = ( 1,800mph , East ) . Find VRG , the velocity of the rocket with respect to the ground ( as seen by observers on the ground ) . <p> Solution : We may write : VRG = VRF + VFG <p> VRG magnitude is equal to ( 7502 + 18002 ) 1/2 mph = 1950mph . <p> VRG direction is equal to tan-1(750/1800) = 23 North of East . <p> The point is that an observer in the jet sees the rocket traveling Eastwardat 1800mph ; however , the observers on the ground see the rocket moving 23 North of East at a speed of 1950mph . Again , it depends on who measures what ! <p> Example 2 : <p> A fighter jet traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) fires a rocket that appears moving Eastward to the observes on the ground.If the rocket travels at 1800mph relative to the fighter , find the direction of the rocket relative to the East and the speed of the rocket relative to the ground . <p> Solution : We may write : VRG = VRF + VFG <p> VRF magnitude is 1800 mph as seen by the jet 's occupants in the direction shown that is be calculated . <p> VRG magnitude is ( 18002- 7502 ) 1/2mph = 1640mph . <p> The direction of VRF is equal to tan-1(750/1640) = 25 South of East . <p> An observer in the jet sees the rocket traveling 25 South of East at 1800mph ; however , the observers on the ground see the rocket moving East at a speed of 1640mph . <p> III ) The Galilean Transformation : <p> In this section , it will be shown how the measurements of position , velocity , and acceleration differ in two frames that move at constant velocities relative to each other . <p> The figure on the right shows two frames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant velocity u relative to frame S. Suppose that points O and O ' coincide at t = 0 . The positions of point P relative to the two frames are related by <p> r ' = r - ut ( 1 ) <p> This vector equation is equivalent to three scalar equations in a 3-D space . Often for simplicity , we arrange for the Ox and O'x ' axes to be on each other . In such case frame S ' moves at constant velocity u along the x-axis of frame S , as shown in the lower figure . For this arrangement , the three components of Equation ( 1 ) become : <p> x ' = x - ut y ' = y z ' = z and t ' = t . ( 2 ) <p> Equations in ( 2 ) give the coordinates of a particle in two inertial frames moving relative to each other at constant velocity . This is called the Galilean transformation of coordinates . <p> Note : An assumption is made that the observers in both frames measure the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clocks are synchronized , and this remains true indefinitely . This means that in Newtonian Mechanics , there is only a single universal or absolute time for all frames . The special theory of relativity has shown this assumption to be false ; however , it is an excellent approximation for our everyday experiences with ordinary motions when we deal with speeds much much lower than speed of light . <p> To find the expressions for relative velocities , let 's take the time derivative of the 3 position equations in ( 2 ) . We get : <p> dx ' /dt = dx/dt - u dy ' /dt = dy/dt and dz ' /dt = dz/dt , or <p> v'x = vx - u v'y = vy and v'z = vz . <p> Since the motion is in 1-D only , and there are no relative velocities in the y and z directions , we may drop the subscripts from the x equation and write the only relative velocity equation as <p> v ' = v - u <p> To obtain an expression for acceleration , let 's take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that u is a constant velocity and its derivative is zero ( du/dt = 0 ) ; therefore , <p> dv ' /dt = dv/dt - 0 or a ' = a <p> This clearly states that the observers in both systems measure the same value for the acceleration of a particle . <p> As an example consider a train car moving to the right at velocity u in which a person throws a ball straight up relative to the train . The ball will go straight up and down back to his hands as measured in the train 's frame ( S ' ) as shown . An observer on the ground frame ( S ) notices a parabolic path for the ball . From the point view of the observer in S , the ball has two motions : one at constant velocity u horizontally , and one up and down under gravity acceleration . The horizontal acceleration measured by both observers is zero ( du/dt = 0 ) . Also , the gravity acceleration is measured the same by both observers . <p> This observation does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other is moving . No experiment allows us to distinguish between inertial frames . This is expressed as the Galilean principle of relativity : <p> " The laws of mechanics have the same form in all inertial reference frames . " <p> 10 ) The VRG magnitude is ( a ) 67 South of West . ( b ) 67 South of East .. ( c ) 67 North of East .. <p> A man holding a rifle in a train that travels North at velocity VRG = ( 150 mph , N ) fires a bullet that moves Westward . The man must have held the rifle in the Southwest direction for the bullet to travel exactly westward relative to the ground . If the bullet leaves the rifle at 360 mph , answer the following questions : <p> 12 ) The direction of vector VBG relative to East is ( a ) 25. ( b ) 225.

Also , recall that the more rigid a medium , the faster mechanical waves travel in it . Before Maxwell and the introduction of electromagnetic theory , light was thought as a mechanical wave and because of its enormous speed required a medium of infinite rigidity and at the same time negligible density . These two required properties were quite contradictory to each other . Such bizarre medium was named ether . It was also assumed that the entire space was filled with ether and that ether was at absolute rest and any object 's motion relative to ether would therefore be its absolute motion . <p> This way of thinking ( the ether theory ) was shattered by the Michelson -Morley experiment in 1887 . Michelson developed an interferometer that showed there was no such thing as ether and therefore the thought of absolute reference frame and absolute motion became questionable . <p> The Michelson-Morley Experiment : <p> The Interferometer : <p> As shown on the right , two adjacent and coherent light rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P set at 45 . One ray that passes through P , travels toward the flat mirror M1 , gets reflected back to P , and then gets reflected down toward the telescope as shown . The other ray gets reflected upward at P toward mirror M2 that reflects it back downward to P and after passing through P reaches the telescope . If the apparatus is at rest , since both rays travel the same distance , the final rays arriving at the telescope will necessarily be in phase and a certain interference pattern will be expected to be viewed by the telescope . This expectation is quite normal if the interferometer is at absolute rest . <p> Since Earth travelsabout the Sun at 19 miles/s the thought of stationary interferometer is out of question . <p> The interferometer is first aligned in the direction of motion of the Earth about the Sun . This means that Ray SM1 is set parallel to the direction of the Earth 's motion . Now , we want to calculate the time difference between the arrival of the final rays to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest , there should be a time difference between the arrival of final rays at the telescope . <p> Let c be the speed of light relative to the ether , and v , the speed of Earth relative to ether . Refer to the figure above . When light goes from P to M1 , distance L0 is traveled at speed c - v. The light returned from M1 travels at speedc + v. The back and forth time is therefore : <p> When light goes from P to M2 and back , the travel time is <p> The reasoning for this calculation is on the right . <p> The difference in travel time between the two rays is therefore , <p> As light goes up to M2 , the Earth goes to the right and the velocity of light relative to the ether is VLE or c as shown ( the hypotenuse vector ) . Ether moves to the left relative to mirror M2 , as shown by VEM = -v . Light moves straight up relative to mirror M2 , VLM . We may write the vector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnitude of VLM is needed for travel time calculation of light going up and back down to P. Since VLE = c , and VEM = v , the magnitude of VLM from the vector triangle is <p> This speed appears in the denominator of T2 on the left . <p> According to the above calculations , with respect to a stationary ether , there must be a time delay ? t = L0v2/c3between the arrival of final rays at the telescope causing some change in the interference patterns compared to a stationary situation . No change has been observed so far by many experimenters who have repeated this experiment with more and more precisions . Even when the apparatus is turned by 90 degrees to swap the roles of the mirrors in order to double the time delay effect , no change in the interference patterns occurs.No change in the patterns means ? t = 0 . This can be true only if v = 0 . This makes VEM= 0and consequently , VLM = c . In other words , light travels at the same speed c in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Results of the Michelson-Morley Experiment : <p> The results of the Michelson 's experiment are : <p> 1 ) There is no such thing as ether . 2 ) Light travels at the same speed c in all directions regardless of the velocity of its source . <p> The Contraction Hypothesis : <p> One result of Michelson 's experiment is that light travels at the same speed in all directions . This result is in agreement with the way waves propagate in a uniform medium . We know that the speed of waves in a medium is a property of that medium ; in other words , it is the physical properties of a medium that determines the speed at which waves are allowed to travel in it . One might think that there is nothing in vacuum to be called a medium ; however , the transmission of both of the electric field and magnetic field effects are limited and dependent on two constants e0 and 0 . These are the permittivity and permeability of vacuum , respectively . Note that the factor 1/c2 in Maxwell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Important : Now , one problem or question arises here . In Michelson 's experiment as soon as light waves leave slab P , they travel at speed c , but the fact that the relative speed of waves reaching M1 is c-v and after reflection the relative speed of waves arriving at slab P is c+v may not be ignored . The calculation of T1 is still valid . Also , waves going up to mirror M2 arrive at M2 not exactly at its middle , but slightly to the left of its middle because meanwhile M2 moves some distance to the right ; therefore , the calculation of T2 is valid as well . With no change in the interference patterns observed by the telescope , the requirement , ? t = 0 , is still valid as well and we must have T1 = T2.The question is thatif light travels at the same speed horizontally and vertically , how can T1and T2 be equal ? We need to look at the expressions for T1 and T2 again . <p> The only way T1 and T2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of motion of the Earth ( or the apparatus ) must have shrunk to compensate for the difference . This establishes the basis for the topic of " Length Contraction . " Let 's look at the expressions for T1 and T2 again . <p> and . <p> The above two are not equal the way they are ; unless the L0 in T1 is replaced by a shrunk length of L0 ( 1- v2/c2 ) 1/2 . This means that the length L0 in the direction of motion must have shrunk by the factor ( 1- v2/c2 ) 1/2 . This was originally suggested by G. F. Fitzgerald in 1889 . In 1892 , H. A. Lorentz suggested that the cause of contraction must be the modification of electrical forces within the moving body . <p> Einstein 's Postulates for Special Relativity : <p> As was mentioned before , special relativity deals with the relative motion of inertial frames or non-accelerating frames . Einstein used the above discussions to come up with his famous two postulates of special relativity as follows : <p> 1 ) The Principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all inertial frames . <p> 2 ) The Principle of Constancy of Speed of Light : The speed of light in free space is the same in all inertial frames . It does not depend on the motion of the source or the observer . <p> Definitions : <p> 1 ) Event : An event is the occurrence of something at one point in space and at a single instant in time . <p> 2 ) Observer : An observer is a person or an automatic device with a clock and a meter stick . Each observer can record events only in the immediate vicinity . Each observer has to rely on colleagues at other locations to record the times of distant events . An observer may see or photograph a distant event , but such observations do not count as a record of the event . <p> 3 ) Reference Frame : A reference frame is a whole set of observers uniformly distributed in space as shown belowon the left . All observers in a given reference frame agree on the position and the time of an event . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to record it after which the data will be communicated to other observers . The notation S , S ' , S " , ... will be used to denote different inertial frames . The frame in which an object , such as a clock or a rod is at rest , is called its rest frame . The following notation will be used to precisely describe events in special relativity : <p> x : Position coordinate of an event , a point in space <p> ? x : x2 - x1 = L A space interval , a length <p> t : Time coordinate of an event , an instant in time <p> ? t : t2 - t1 = T A time interval , a period <p> Synchronization of Clocks : If the clocks are spread apart by one light second that means the distance light travels in one second , and pre adjusted to the correct number of seconds ahead of each other depending on their respective distances , we might then say that they are synchronized . Above , the figure on the right shows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a is preset at 12 noon , then clocks b , d , e , and f must be preset at 1s past noon , 2s past noon , 3s past noon , and 4 s past noon to be synchronized . <p> The Relativity of Simultaneity : <p> Two spatially separated events that are simultaneous in one frame are not simultaneous in another frame that is moving relative to the first one . This effect is called the relativity of simultaneity . <p> To show this , consider a train ( frame S ' ) moving at a constant velocity v relative to a platform ( frame S ) . In frame S , an observer is exactly located at O , the midpoint between A and B. In frame S ' , another observer is exactly located at O ' , the midpoint between A ' and B ' . <p> If two firecrackers explode simultaneously at points A and B , the observer at O records them simultaneously because of being equidistant from A and B. The observer at O ' receives the signal from B before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not judge the two explosions to be simultaneous . This is called the relativity of simultaneity and it is reciprocal . Events simultaneous for O ' will not be so for O , either . <p> Since simultaneous events that occur at two different locations in S are not simultaneous in S ' , the time interval between the events will be different in the two frames , as well . This will also affect the measurement of length . The problem with Length measurement is explained below . <p> Length Measurement : <p> We do not have any trouble measuring the length of a stationary rod . In order to measure the length of a moving rod , the positions of both ends of it must be marked against a ruler simultaneously . How can this be done ? One person alone can not do it . We have to rely on two measurements done simultaneously . <p> Even if , we do that as we are standing in frame S , the people moving with the rod ( in frame S ' ) will complain about the simultaneity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneous . Consequently , observers in frames S and S ' do not agree on the length of the rod . <p> It is the relativity of simultaneity that leads to the length contraction introduced by Fitzgerald and Lorentz . They believed that there is a physical contraction caused by the modification of electric forces between atoms . The theory of special relativity arrives at the same results from a different point of view- a profound analysis of the process of measurement . <p> Time Dilation : <p> We are going to compare two time intervals ? t and ? t ' one measured in frame S and one measured in frame S ' . Let S ' be the rest frame of the clock . It means the clock is at rest in S ' . In this frame , if a signal is sent upward from time clock A ' , it will get reflected at mirror M and returns to detector B ' placed very near to A ' . This measurement that is done in the rest frame of the clock is called Toor the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's see how the measurement goes in frame S , in which the clock moves at velocity v. Here the time interval ? t is measured by two observers A and B at different positions . We may write : <p> Let 's name this correction factor g on which basis the dilated time can be calculated . <p> and hence , T = ? To or , ? t = ? ? t ' <p> In the rest frame of the clock , frame S ' , the time interval for a pulse going from A to M and return to B is 2Lo/c . <p> In the moving frame S , the emission and detection events occur at two positions . The time interval in this case is greater than the interval recorded in the rest frame of the clock . <p> Since ? &gt;1 , the time interval T measured in frame S ( by two clocks ) is greater than the proper time , To , measured by the clock in its rest frame S ' . This effect is called Time Dilation.Two spatially separated clocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between two events than the proper time recorded by a single clock that moves from A to B and is present at both events . <p> Time dilation is reciprocal . If ? t is the proper time for a clock in S , then the two observers in S ' would measure ? t ' = ? ? t . If this effect were not reciprocal , there would be a way to distinguish between inertial frames . Time dilation applies to any periodic phenomenon , electronic , mechanical , or biological . <p> Example 3:A train moving at 0.6c takes 5s to pass an observer on a platform . ( a ) What is the time interval measured in the train 's frame ? <p> Solution : The value of ? for v = 0.6c is 1.25 . The observer on the platform measures a time interval of 5s between two events at a single position , and therefore the proper time . The observers in the moving frame measure the dilated time ; therefore , T = ? To = ( 1.25 ) 5s = 6.25s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its rest frame , S , is the distance between its ends called its " proper length , Lo . " <p> An observer O ' in S ' that moves at a velocity v relative to frame S , can measure the rod 's length by recording the interval between the times at which O ' passes A and B. Note that O ' can not tell if he is moving to the right or the rod is moving to the left ; therefore , he can measure the rod 's length by two ways of thinking : ( 1 ) If he sees the rod moving to the left at velocity v and treats himself as being at rest , he records two instances while being at the same position and therefore he measures the proper time ? t ' or To . In this case , since the rod is moving by and not stationary , the contracted length of it , L , is measured ; therefore , <p> L = vTo or L = v ? t ' . ( 1 ) <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rod at rest and himself in motion , then he records two instances at two different positions ( the rod ends ) and therefore , he measures a dilated time interval , ? t , or T that corresponds to the proper length , Lo , of the rod ; therefore , <p> Lo = v ? t . ( 2 ) <p> Substituting ? ? t ' for ? t in ( 2 ) , we get : : <p> Lo = v ? ? t ' ( 3 ) <p> Now dividing ( 1 ) by ( 3 ) yields : <p> L = ( 1/ ? ) Lo . <p> Since ? &gt; 1 ; therefore , L &lt; Loand the effect of length contraction is apparent from this equation . <p> Example 4 : The length of a train that moves at 0.6c relative to the ground is 640m as measured by the people on the ground . Calculate ( a ) the actual length of the train . How long does it take the train to pass a light pole at the station ( b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the train frame . <p> Solution : ( a ) The 640m is the contracted length , L , measured by the ground observers . The value of ? for v = 0.6c is 1.25 . We may calculate the proper length by Lo = ? L = ( 1.25 ) ( 640m ) = 800m . <p> ( b ) The travel time of the train measured by the ground people is L = v To ; 640m = ( 0.6c ) ( To ) ; To= 3.56s <p> ( c ) The travel time of the train measured by observers on the train is Lo = v T ; 800m = ( 0.6c ) ( T ) ; T= 4.44s <p> The Relativistic Doppler Effect : <p> For sound waves , the observed frequency depends on the source frequency according to the following equation : <p> For sound there is a medium ( air ) that serves as an absolute reference frame . For Electromagnetic waves ( signals ) traveling in vacuum , there is no absolute reference frame and therefore relativistic Doppler effect must be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame , S ' , and arrived at S ( treated to be at rest ) , depends on the relative velocity of S and S ' , only.There are two extreme cases : <p> 1 ) Source and observer are receding and the direction of v is completely along the line of sight : : <p> Suppose S ' is emitting E&amp;M signals at period To in its own frame while moving away from S at a velocity v to the right . The signals recorded by S will have a longer period because of time dilation . The thought that S records time dilated signals of period ? t = ? Tois not completely correct . This is not the whole story ! Not only S receives dilated signals , but also there will be a time delay for each ? t equal to d/c associated distance d traveled by S ' during each ? t . Since d as measured by S is <p> d =v ? t = v ? To , the period of signals recorded by S is : <p> T = ? t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( 1 + v/c ) To <p> Clocks tick slower in a moving frame relative to another frame treated to be at rest . If To is the period of signals emitted in S ' , then ? To is the dilated period . S however records <p> T = ? To + d/c where d =v ? t = v ? To , the distance traveled by S ' during each ? t as measured by S. <p> Since ? = ( 1 + v/c ) -1/2 ( 1 - v/c ) -1/2 ; therefore , <p> This equation is used when source and observer move away from each other such that the direction of v lies completely along the line of sight . For approach , the sign of v must be changed . <p> 2 ) The direction of v is perpendicular to the line of sight : <p> In this case , the transverse Doppler effect is used and involves the effect of time dilation , only . <p> Example 5 : A spaceship approaching Earth at 0.8c emits E&amp;M pulses that are 1.20 seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded here on Earth . <p> Solution : The period for the approaching pulses is T = ( c-v ) / ( c+v ) 0.5 To = 0.40s . The frequency is therefore f = 1/T = 2.5Hz <p> The Twin Paradox : <p> Let 's see how time elapses for a twin that one stays here on the Earth and the other makes a round trip to a distant point in space at high speed and back . Suppose twin A stays here and twin B travels at 0.8c . If twin B emits 15 pulses at intervals of 6 minutes while going away and 15 pulses of the same period on his way back , the total time for his trip according to his calculation ( proper time ) is To = 180 minutes . Twin A however , received longer period pulses one way and shorter period pulses on B 's return and his total calculated time for B 's trip is ( dilated time ) T = 300 minutes . <p> For v = 0.8c , the value of ? = 5/3 . As we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculation 300 = ( 5/3 ) 180 ! ! ! The details of calculations is shown below : <p> The situation is not symmetric . One reason is that the going away time as calculated by A is much longer than the return trip . Also , twin A remains at rest and relaxed while twin B undergoes modified inter-atomic electric forces that account for length contraction . Moreover , it is twin B that undergoes changes in acceleration at the return point . Note that at the return point , special relativity is not sufficient to account for switching to accelerated frames ; however , general relativity also confirms that the twin paradox is true . <p> Example 6 : To verify that the twin paradox is not symmetric , solve the above problem by assuming that A emits pulses and B receives them . Find the number of pulses twin B receives while ( a ) receding from A , and ( b ) approaching A. <p> 8 ) Standing in a train that travels East at 25m/s , if you throw a ball Eastward at 5m/s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated as an absolute frame ) is ( a ) 30m/s East ( b ) 20m/s East ( c ) 30m/s West . click here . <p> 9 ) Standing in a train that travels East at 25m/s , if you throw a ball Westward at 5m/s , the speed of the ball relative to Earth ( if treated as an absolute frame ) is ( a ) 30m/s East ( b ) 20m/s East ( c ) 30m/s West . <p> 10 ) Standing in a train that travels East at 25m/s , if you throw a ball Eastward at 5m/s that hits a wall in front of you and bounces back at the same speed , the return speed of the ball relative to Earth ( if treated as an absolute frame ) is ( a ) 30m/s East ( b ) 20m/s East ( c ) 30m/s West . <p> 11 ) Question ( 9 ) thinking may be used to conclude that the speed at which light travels the horizontal distance Lo from P to M1 , in Michelson 's apparatus as shown above , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) neither a nor b. click here . <p> 12 ) Question ( 9 ) thinking may be used to conclude that the speed at which light travels the horizontal distance Lo from M1 to P , in Michelson 's apparatus as shown above , is ( a ) c-v ( b ) c+v ( c ) neither a nor b . <p> 13 ) In Michelson 's experiment as shown above , the actual velocity direction of the ray that goes upward , VLE , must be ( a ) pure North ( b ) pure East ( c ) Northeast . <p> 14 ) The reason for the Northeast direction of VLE in Question 13 is that ( a ) the bounced off rays from slab P want to go straight up ( b ) the slab that is the source for bounced off rays , has itself an Eastward motion ( c ) both a and b. click here . <p> 15 ) In Michelson 's experiment as shown above , the Northeast VLE = c has two components , VLM and VME = v.

@@21346949 @1346949/ <h> Four Principles of Interpersonal Communication <p> These principles underlie the workings in real life of interpersonal communication . They are basic to communication . We ca n't ignore them <h> Interpersonal communication is inescapable <p> We ca n't not communicate . The very attempt not to communicate communicates something . Through not only words , but through tone of voice and through gesture , posture , facial expression , etc. , we constantly communicate to those around us . Through these channels , we constantly receive communication from others . Even when you sleep , you communicate . Remember a basic principle of communication in general : people are not mind readers . Another way to put this is : people judge you by your behavior , not your intent . <h> Interpersonal communication is irreversible <p> You ca n't really take back something once it has been said . The effect must inevitably remain . Despite the instructions from a judge to a jury to " disregard that last statement the witness made , " the lawyer knows that it ca n't help but make an impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once a word goes out of your mouth , you can never swallow it again . " <h> Interpersonal communication is complicated <p> No form of communication is simple . Because of the number of variables involved , even simple requests are extremely complex . Theorists note that whenever we communicate there are really at least six " people " involved : 1 ) who you think you are ; 2 ) who you think the other person is ; 30 who you think the other person thinks you are ; 4 ) who the other person thinks /she is ; 5 ) who the other person thinks you are ; and 6 ) who the other person thinks you think s/he is . <p> We do n't actually swap ideas , we swap symbols that stand for ideas . This also complicates communication . Words ( symbols ) do not have inherent meaning ; we simply use them in certain ways , and no two people use the same word exactly alike . <p> If a message can be understood in different ways , it will be understood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is always somebody who knows better than you what you meant by your message . <p> The more communication there is , the more difficult it is for communication to succeed . <p> These tongue-in-cheek maxims are not real principles ; they simply humorously remind us of the difficulty of accurate communication . ( See also A commentary of Wiio 's laws by Jukka Korpela . ) <h> Interpersonal communication is contextual <p> In other words , communication does not happen in isolation . There is : <p> Psychological context , which is who you are and what you bring to the interaction . Your needs , desires , values , personality , etc. , all form the psychological context . ( " You " here refers to both participants in the interaction . ) <p> Relational context , which concerns your reactions to the other person--the " mix . " <p> Situational context deals with the psycho-social " where " you are communicating . An interaction that takes place in a classroom will be very different from one that takes place in a bar . <p> Environmental context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furniture , location , noise level , temperature , season , time of day , all are examples of factors in the environmental context . <p> Cultural context includes all the learned behaviors and rules that affect the interaction . If you come from a culture ( foreign or within your own country ) where it is considered rude to make long , direct eye contact , you will out of politeness avoid eye contact . If the other person comes from a culture where long , direct eye contact signals trustworthiness , then we have in the cultural context a basis for misunderstanding .

The foils become charged up with like charges that repel each other causing the foils to separate and open up . That is how the foils indicate that some electric charges are transferred to them .

They are easier to remove from the atoms . <p> Free electrons do not belong to any particular atom . They flow in between atoms under the repulsive forces from the electron clouds of different atoms and the smaller attraction forces from the nuclei of the closest atoms . Conductivity of a substance depends on the number of free electronsof that substance . <p> Classification of Materials : <p> From the point view of conduction , materials are classified as conductors , semiconductors , and insulators . The electric conductivity of a substance depends on its number or abundance of free electrons . <p> Metals are conductors . A metal contains a large number of free electrons . <p> Nonmetals are insulators . A nonmetal contains few free electron . <p> Semiconductors are alloys of metals and nonmetals . The have controlled conduction properties depending on their metal percentages . <p> Static Electricity : <p> If electricity ( accumulation of negative or positive charges ) can not flow easily , it causes localized charges and forms static electricity . This happens when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an insulator . Because of lack of free electrons in the insulator , the transferred electrons stay locally and do not distribute in the insulator quickly . They form static electricity . <p> If a conductor ( mounted on an insulator ) , is given a number of excess electrons , the electrons distribute themselves in that conductor ; however , the insulator mounting stops the electrons from flowing into the mounting and it becomes a boarder for the free electrons . In the conductor part , since the excess free electrons repel each other , they locate themselves as far from each other as possible . For a sphere , the farthest possible distance is a uniform distribution of charges over its external surface . For other shape objects , it depends on the geometry . <p> The following figure shows a metal sphere as well as an oval-shaped metal object , both on insulator mountings. 12 electrons are removed from the sphere and given to the oval . The sphere becomes positive and the oval negative . Note the higher concentration of electrons at the farthest possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Object : <p> An object may be given electric charges in two ways : 1 ) by direct contact , and 2 ) by induction . <p> 1 ) Charging by contact : <p> When a charged object is brought into contact with an uncharged ( electrically neutral ) object , part of its charges flow onto the uncharged object and make it partially charged . The transfer proportion depends on the shapes of the two objects . For example , if the two objects are two identical metal spheres with insulator mountings , they share the charge equally . For asymmetric and unequal objects , the reasoning is more complicated and involved . The following figure shows the simple case of two identical metal spheres on insulator mountings a ) before contact , b ) during contact , and c ) after separation . <p> 2 ) Charging by Induction : <p> Charging by induction means charging without contact . The Earth may be considered as being electrically neutral . Adding a certain number of positive or negative charges to the Earth does not affect its neutrality . Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not count at all compared to the charges that the Earth contains . That is why Earth is electrically neutral for our experiments . We can easily transfer some charges to it or take from it and it will not be affected . If an electrically charged sphere ( on an insulator mounting ) is connected with a conductor ( a metal wire ) to the ground , it gets discharged either by transferring some electrons to the Earth or pulling some from it . The following figure shows how a positively charged sphere and a negatively charged one become discharged by being connected to the Earth . <p> Charging an Object Positively by Induction : If a plastic rod is rubbed against wool , it becomes negatively charged . If the rod is brought near a neutral metal sphere that is on an insulator mounting , it repels the free electrons of the sphere to the far end of it . At the same time , the rod attracts the positive charges of the sphere to the very near end of it . If the far end is connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground while the positive charges are held captive by the rod . When the connection with the ground is cut off , the rod may be taken away leaving the sphere with positive charges . The process is shown below : <p> Charging an Object Negatively by Induction : To be explained by students with appropriate figures . <p> Electric Field ( E ) : <p> Anywhere there is an electric charge , q1 , there exists the property of attraction or repulsion on other charges placed around it . This effect of attraction or repulsion is called the electric field of q1 . The electric field of charge q1 at Point P , depends on the amount of q1 and 1/r2 where r is the distance from the point charge . We may come up with a formula for electric field ( E ) as <p> E1 = kq1/r2(1) <p> E1 is the magnitude of the electric field of charge q1 at Point P. <p> Again , k is called the Coulomb 's constant . Its value is k = 8.99x109 Nm2/C2 . The unit for electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength ( E ) of a point charge q weakens with ( r ) is like the way light intensity weakens as we move away from a light bulb . Suppose you have built an empty sphere out of glass that has a surface area of 1 ft2 and has a tiny light bulb at its center . Also suppose that you have made another glass sphere which radius is twice the first one and is around the first sphere . It is easy to show that when you double the radius of a sphere , its area quadruples ( 4 ft2 ) . If the two glass spheres are concentric , you can see why the light intensity at the outer sphere is 1/4 of the light intensity at the inner sphere . You have already figured it out that the same amount of light energy that passes through the inner sphere must reach the outer sphere and pass through it as well . Since the same energy is given to an area 4 times greater ; therefore , the intensity becomes 4 times weaker . This is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to the light intensity ( brightness ) if you made glass spheres with radii 3x , 4x , 5x , 6x , and so forth ? Again as you have correctly visualized , the light intensity ( brightness ) would become 1/9 , 1/16 , 1/25 , 1/36 and so forth ( Fig. 1 ) . <p> Problem : Calculate the electric field strength around a 25C point charge at the following different distances : ( a ) 10.0cm , ( b ) 20.0cm , ( c ) 30.0cm , and ( d ) 50.0cm . <p> Test Charge : One unit of positive charge is called a test charge . Force per unit charge is called Electric Field Strength ( Metric unit being N/C , of course ) . When a test charge is placed at different points around a positive charge +q , it will be repelled by a force . The farther the test charge , the weaker the force of repulsion . Note that the direction of the repulsive force is always along the line connecting +qand the test charge and acts outward as shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ +q ) charge . Visualize a test charge ( +1 unit ) at the tail of each vector . <p> For a negative charge ( -q ) , a similar situation is shown below . Visualize a test charge ( +1 unit ) at the tip of each vector . When a test charge is placed at different points around a negative charge -q , it will be attracted by a force . The farther the test charge , the weaker the force of attraction . Note that the direction of the attraction force is always along the line connecting -qand the test charge and acts inward as shown below : <p> Fig.2 : Field Strength of a ( -q ) charge . <p> Electric Field Orientation:The electric field orientation of a ( +q ) and a ( -q ) charge separated by a distance L is shown below . Such two equal and opposite charges form the so-called an " electric dipole . " <p> Note : The meaning of each field line is as follows : if a test charge ( +1 unit of charge ) , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that curved line being constantly repelled from the ( +q ) and attracted toward the ( -q ) until it is absorbed by ( -q ) . <p> The space around these two charges contains infinite number of points . Each point experiences the effects of two fields , one from the ( +q ) charge and one from the ( -q ) charge . Since each field acts along the line that connects the charge to a given point , vector addition must be employed in order to find the resultant field . The following example clarifies the need for vector addition : <p> Homework : In the figure shown , find the resultant field at each point where there is a charge . For example , when finding the field at where q1 is , suppose q1 is nonexistent and find the resultant field by q2 and q3 at that point . <p> Uniform Electric Field : <p> An electric field is called uniform if its strength does not change with distance . The electric field of a point charge is not uniform , because it strongly weakens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ( 1/r2 ) and its field lines diverge or open up very quickly in space . There are other physical quantities that vary as ( 1/r2 ) . Gravitational effect of a mass , M , also weakens as ( 1/r2 ) . Such quantities are said to follow the ( 1/r2 ) law . Is it possible to create an electric field that does not change with distance ? The answer is " yes " . If two parallel metallic plates are separated by a distance and connected to a battery , one plate accumulates some negative charges while the other plate accumulates equal amount of positive charges . The electric field in between the plates and specially away from the edges will essentially be uniform and the electric field lines become parallel . Such a device forms the so-called parallel-plate capacitor . The following figure shows the difference between the non-uniform field of a point charge and the uniform field of a parallel-plate capacitor . <p> If charge q is placed at a point where the electric field isE , it will experience a force ( F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the fact that , for example , for a point charge we may write the Coulomb 's law as <p> F = q2 ( kq1/r2 ) or , F = q2E1 <p> E1 is the electric field of charge q1.q2 is in the field of q1 . <p> In general , <p> F = q E <p> Example 3 : In the figure shown , find ( a ) the force on the oil drop of mass 2.0 micrograms carrying a charge of 450nC at 1.0cm from the positive plate , ( b ) the work it does as it moves to reach the negative plate , ( c ) its K.E. just before hitting the negative plate , and ( d ) its speed before striking the negative plate . <p> 3 ) Free electrons are those that ( a ) do not belong to any particular atom and move in between atoms under the influence of repulsion from the electronic clouds of atoms or the weaker attraction from the nuclei of the surrounding atoms .

( c ) $1.17 . <p> Now let us consider cases where there are more devices , resistors in a circuit . The resistors could be in series or in parallel . <p> Resistors in Series : <p> Devices ( resistors ) in a portion of a circuit are said to bein series if they experience the same current . The following diagram shows three resistors in series with a battery . We can show thatif R1 , R2 , and R3 are in series , there is a single resistor Rt ( called the total or the equivalent resistance ) that can replace them all such that <p> Rt = R1 + R2 + R3 <p> In a series circuit as shown : <p> 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistors , but the voltage-drop across each resistor is different . <p> 2 ) Positive current leaves the ( + ) pole of a battery . Going clockwise , along with the current shown , from the ( - ) pole to the ( + ) pole of the battery , the voltage ( V ) goes up . Then as the current flows through each of R1 , R2 , and R3 , the voltage drops proportionally.The total voltage drop must be equal to the voltage jump produced by the battery . We can write : <p> Resistors that are between the same two nodes experience the same voltage and form parallel connection . At one node the arriving current divides amongst the resistors and at the other node the currents join and form the main undivided current . The greater a resistor , the smaller the current its branch pulls . Parallel resistors divide the main current amongst themselves proportional to 1/R . The voltage for all resistors between two nodes is the same . The equivalent resistance , Rt or Req may be calculated from the formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no resistance between points d and a ( Connecting wires have negligible resistance ) the voltages of points d and a are equal . So are the voltages of points b and c . This means that if we use a voltmeter to measure Vdc and Vab , we get the same readings . Vdc = Vab = Vbat . Since Vab is known , Vbat , we may calculate the currents in each branch by using the Ohm 's law . <p> I1 = Vab / R1 , similarly I2 = Vab / R2 and I3 = Vab / R3 . <p> The voltage Vab = Vdcis the same for all resistors and is equal to the battery voltage ( Vbat ) ; therefore , <p> I 1 = Vbat / R1 <p> I 2= Vbat / R2 <p> I 3 = Vbat / R3 <p> Of course , the 3 resistors can be replaced by one resistor , Reqor Rtsuch that I = Vbat / Rt <p> Since I = I 1 + I 2 + I 3 ; therefore , <p> ( 1 / R t ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R2 ) + ( 1 / R3 ) <p> Fig. 3 <p> Example 11 : In the following figure , find the equivalent resistance in each case . <p> Fig. 4 <p> Solution : In Fig. 1 , the two resistors are in series and they simply add up to a greater resistance ( 15O ) . <p> In Fig. 2 , the two resistors are in parallel and their reciprocals add up to yield thereciprocal of the total that is smaller than the smaller resistor ( 6O ) . <p> In Fig. 3 , the two parallel resistors yield 8O . The 8O is then in series with the 9O . They add up to 17O . <p> In Fig. 4 , each parallel section must be calculated first . The first set yields 18O , and the second set yields 8O . The 18O and the 8O are then in series and add up to 26O . <p> A Shortcut for Two Parallel Resistors : <p> There is a shortcut formula that calculates the equivalent of two parallel resistors quickly . The formula is : <p> Example 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by using the above formula . <p> There are many cases in which a parallel portion is in series with other portions . The other portions may also be comprised of series or parallel portions . A typical case is shown in the following example : <p> Example 14 : In the figure shown , find the current through , voltage across , and power dissipation in each resistor : <p> Let R1 = 12 O , R2 = 60 . O , R3 = 5.0 O , and V = 45 volts . <p> Solution : <p> Rab = 1 / ( 1/ R1 + 1 / R2 ) = 10 . O <p> Rac= Rab + Rbc = 10 + 5 = 15 . O <p> I = Vac / Rac = ( 45 volts ) / ( 15 ohms ) = 3.0 amps <p> Vbc = ( I ) ( Rbc ) = 15 volts <p> Vab = Vac - Vbc = 45 - 15 = 30. volts <p> I 1= Vab / R1 = 2.5 amps <p> I 2 = Vab / R2 = 0.50 amps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30x2.5 = 75 watts <p> P2 = 30x0.5 = 15 watts ; P3= 15x3.0 = 45 watts <p> Fig. 5 <p> Example 15 : In the figure shown , find the equivalent resistance between points a and b . <p> Fig. 6 <p> Solution : In the Problem , if a current flows from a to m , it has to divide at m , partially toward n , and partially downward . The part that arrives at n must also divide , partially through the 5O-resistor and partially through the 60O-resistor . The part that flows through the 5O-resistor must also flow through the 15 resistor as well , and therefore , the 5O- and 15O-resistors are in series . The first step is to simply add the 5O- and 15O-resistors to get an equivalent of 20O resistance as shown in Fig.1 . In Fig. 1 , Since n is a dividing point , the 20O and 60O resistors are in parallel .

They add up to 40O as shown in Fig. 3 . In Fig. 3 , the 40O- and the 120O resistors are in parallel because the current that arrive at m from a must divide . They can be replaced by their equivalent resistance of ( 120*40 ) / ( 120+40 ) = 30O as shown in Fig. 4 . In Fig. 4 , the 50O- and the 30O-resistors are in series because the flow through the 50O-resistor must also flow through the 30O-resistor .

( c ) 0.0 <p> Resistivity ( ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is linear and given by <p> ? T = ? 20 1 + a ( T - 20 ) <p> where ? T is the resistivity at temperature T , and ? 20 is the resistivity at 20 Celsius . The symbol ( a ) denotes the temperature coefficient of resistivity . Values of ( a ) are measured for different materials at room temperature ( 20C ) and typical values are given in Table 20.1 . <p> For a wire , when temperature increases , length-increase causes a resistance-increase while cross-section-increase causes resistance-decrease . Assuming these two effects to somehow offset each other , for tiny wires we may approximately write:RT = R20 1 + a ( T - 20 ) . With alternating currents passing through light bulb elements , there are other effects that we neglect those here for simplicity . <p> Example 16 : The resistance of a light-bulb is measured to be 18.2O when cold ( not when connected to wall 120-V outlet ) . However , the bulb is rated as a 60-watt light bulb ( This means that when hot and connected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Calculate the current it pulls and its resistance when hot . ( b ) What temperature does it have when hot ? The elements of light bulbs are made of tungsten a = 4.5x10-3 ( C ) -1 . <p> Sometimes the electric elements are connected in such a way that it is not possible to label them as being in series or parallel . This happens when there are loops or closed circuits in the system . For example , in the figure shown below , we can not say that R1 , R4 , and R3 are connected in parallel or in series . We also see that there are two loops : Loop ABCDA and Loop ABFEA.Between A and B , there are 3 branches . There will be 3 different currents in these 3 branches . Elements R1 , R2 , and battery V1 experience same current . This current is labeled I1 . Element R4 , and battery V2 experience a different current . This current is labeled I2 . The elements in the last branch ( AGB ) , R3 and V3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to calculate I1 , I2 , and I3 . To do this , we use the so-called " Kirchhoff 's Rules . " <p> KLR in Loop ABCDA : <p> -V2 + I3R3 + V1 + I1R2 + I 1R1 = 0 ( 1 ) <p> KLR in Loop ABFEA : <p> -V2 + I3R3- I2R4 + V3 = 0 ( 2 ) <p> KJR at Node A : <p> - I1 + I3 + I2 = 0 ( 3 ) <p> Fig. 7 <p> Kirchhoff 's Loop Rule ( KLR ) : <p> This rule states that the sum of voltage ups and downs in a closed loop is equal to zero . In each branch , we do n't know the direction of the current . We simply assume a direction for it . If our assumption is correct , the answer we find at the end of our calculations will be positive . If our guess is wrong , the calculations will yield a negative value for that current . The negative sign indicates that we chose a wrong direction . To write down the ups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to start from a point on the loop , go around it , complete it , and come back to that point . In two ways , a loop can be completed . 1 ) By going with the assumed direction for current , and 2 ) bygoing against the assumed direction for current . <p> If we follow the assumed direction for the current , it is like swimming with the flow of a river . It is swimming toward points of lower and lower potentials . This way going through a resistor will cause a drop in voltage ( potential ) and we give a negative sign for the amount of voltage drop . If we encounter a battery on our way , if its polarity is such that we go from ( - ) to ( + ) , we consider a positive value for its voltage , and if we go from ( + ) to ( - ) , we write down a negative value for its voltage . <p> Now , if the way we complete a closed loop is opposite to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the flow of a river or simply swimming toward points of higher elevations and potentials . This way when we encounter a resistor in the circuit , we write the potential increase across it as a positive value . For a battery , if we go through it by going from ( + ) to ( - ) , the voltage change will be negative , and if from ( - ) to ( + ) , the voltage change will be positive . A KLR is written for each loop of the above figure . <p> Kirchhoff 's Junction Rule ( KJR ) : <p> The sum of currents going toward a junction is equal to the sum of currents leaving that junction . In other words , the algebraic sum of currents at a junction is zero . A junction is the point of connection of 3 or more wires.A KJR is written at Junction A in the above figure . <p> Example 17 : In the figure shown , the directions for currents I1 , I2 , and I3 are already chosen . Find their values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 8 <p> Solution : KLR in Loop ABCDA : + 40 I3- 5 + 6 + 30 I1 + 20 I1 = 0 <p> KLR in Loop ABFEA : + 40 I3- 5 - 9 + 20 I2 + 50 I2 = 0 <p> KJR at Node B : + I1 + I2- I3 = 0 <p> Making the above equations ready for calculator , we get : <p> + 50 I1 + 0 I2 + 40 I3 = -1 <p> 0 I1+ 70 I2+ 40 I3 = 14 <p> + 1 I1+ 1 I2 - 1 I3 = 0 <p> Results of calculation : <p> I1 = - 0.0807 A <p> I2 = 0.1566 A <p> I3 = 0.0759 A <p> In the above figure , the direction of I1 must be reversed . <p> RC Circuits : <p> Circuits containing a resistor and a capacitor form the so-called RC-circuits . A typical RC circuit in charging process requires a battery as shown below . The resistance R indeed controls the speed of the charging process and depending on the capacity C of the capacitor , the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RC is called the time constant ( t ) of the circuit . t is pronounced " tau . " <p> t = RC has unit of time , in SI , seconds . <p> Current as a function of time during the charging process is an exponential function of time and is given by : <p> I = Imaxe- ( t / RC ) where <p> Imax = Vb / R <p> Fig. 9 <p> As soon as key K is closed the battery with voltage Vbfaces an empty capacitor C and a resistor R. At the very beginning , the capacitor , being empty , does not show any resistance toward filling up . Therefore at the start of the process , the only element showing resistance is R , and that decides the amount of the initial current ( I0 ) . I0 can also be shown as Imax . Maximum current occurs at the very beginning . As the capacitor fills up , its resistance goes up and the battery faces more resistance . This causes the current go down as the capacitor fills up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battery voltage . At this stage the current through the circuit approaches zero and so does the voltage across the resistor . At any given instant , Vb = VR + VC . As VC increases , the current ( I ) goes down causing VR to decrease . <p> Example 19 : In the previous example , calculate VR and VC at the given instants . <p> Solution : <p> t = 0 <p> VR = RI = ( 100 O ) ( 0.200 A ) = 20 volts <p> VC = Vb - VR = 20 - 20 = 0 volt <p> t = 1 <p> VR = RI = ( 100 O ) ( 0.164 A ) = 16.4 volts <p> VC = Vb - VR = 20 - 16.4 = 3.6 volt <p> t = 5 <p> VR = RI = ( 100 O ) ( 0.0736 A ) = 7.36 volts <p> VC = Vb - VR = 20 - 7.36 = 12.64 volt <p> t = 10 <p> VR = RI = ( 100 O ) ( 0.0270 A ) = 2.70 volts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 17.30 volt <p> t = 100 <p> VR = RI = ( 100 O ) ( 0 A ) = 0 volts <p> VC = Vb - VR = 20 - 0 = 20.0 volt <p> Test Yourself 4 : <p> 1 ) The resistance of a resistor ( a ) increases with temperature increase .

The formula for this constant speed is <p> V = f ? <p> where in SI , fis the frequency in Hz and ? is the wavelength in meters . If the properties of the medium change , then the wave speed , V , changes . For a string , the mass and length remain constant to a high degree if the string is put under tension .

Mount a rod and C-clamp on the edge of the table and use a skew clamp to connect the string vibrator to the vertical rod . <p> 4 . Mount another rod and C-clamp on the same edge ( preferably at the corner of the table ) and attach the pulley system to it . <p> 5 . Attach one end of the string to the string vibrator .

Adjust the elevations of the string vibrator and the pulley system such that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . Also , make sure that both the vibrator and pulley are at their lowest possible position to minimize the torque they exert on the rods . This guarantees a firmer set up .

Plug in the string vibrator to the electric socket and turn it on . <p> 8 . Adjust the amount of weight suspended from the string until you obtain a good standing-wave pattern . Try to develop patterns ranging from one to eight loops if possible . The meaning of the word " loop " as used here needs to be clarified . A loop is a section of string between nodes , but the point at which the string is attached to the vibrator is not necessarily a node .

The frequency of the city electric outlet is 60.0Hz , and in eachhalf-cyclethe coil ( electromagnet ) of the vibrator attracts and releases the blade . In eachcycle , the blade is attracted and released twice . Therefore , the blade oscillates 120times per second .

It is the constructive and destructive interference of light waves that cause such fringes . <p> Constructive Interference of Waves <p> The following two waves ( Fig. 1 ) that have the same wavelength and go to maximum and minimum together are called coherent waves .

These two completely out of phase waves interfere destructively . If A2 = A1 , they form a dark fringe . <p> The bright and dark fringes in the Youngs experiment follow the following formulas : <p> Bright Fringes : d sin ( ? m ) = m ? where m = 0,1,2,3 , ... <p> Dark Fringes : d sin ( ? m ) = ( m+1/2 ) ? where m = 0,1,2,3 , ... <p> The above formulas are based on the following figures : <p> Check the following statement for correctness based on the above figure . <p> Light rays going to D2 from S1 and S2 are 3 ( + ? ) out of phase ( same as being + ? out of phase ) and therefore form a dark fringe . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ( + ? ) out of phase ( same as being in phase ) and therefore form a bright fringe . <p> Note that SBo is the centerline . <p> Going from a dark or bright fringe to its next fringe changes the distance difference by + ? . <p> Diffraction Grating : <p> Diffraction grating is a thin film of clear glass or plastic that has a large number of lines per ( mm ) drawn on it . A typical grating with a poor line density is ( 250 lines ) /mm . Using more expensive laser techniques , it is possible to create line densities of ( 3000 lines ) /mm or higher . When light from a bright and small source passes through a diffraction grating , it generates a large number of sources . The very thin space between every two adjacent lines of the grating becomes an independent source . These sources are coherent sources meaning that they emit in phase waves with the same wavelength . These sources act independently such that each source sends out waves in all directions . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be found whose distance differences from these sources are different multiples of ? causing bright fringes . One difference between the interference of many slits ( diffraction grating ) and double-slit ( Youngs Experiment ) is that the former makes principle maximums with smaller intensity maximums in between .

@@21346963 @1346963/ <p> A wave is the motion of a disturbance in a medium . The medium for ocean waves is water , for example . When a string , fixed at both ends , is given a vertical hit by a stick , a dent appears in it that travels along the string . When it reaches an end point , it reflects and inverts and travels toward the other end.Fig. 1 shows the motion of a single disturbance . <p> Figure 1 <p> If you hold end A of the string ( Fig. 2 ) and try to give it a continuous up-and-down motion , with a little adjustment of the pace of oscillations , you can make at least the following waveforms : <p> Figure 2 <p> Each wave travels from A to B and reflects at B. When each reflected wave reaches point A , it reflects again and the process repeats . Of course , the up and down motion of hand keeps putting energy into the system by constantly generating waves that are in phase with the returned waves creating the above waveforms . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " standing waves , " they are actually traveling back-and-forth along the string . The subject of waves is lengthy , complicated , and mathematically very involved .

The hump can be looked at as a portion of a circle from A to B with its center at C.The hump is being pulled down by a force of magnitude2Fsinq . This pulling down force passes through the center and therefore acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toMv2/R ; therefore , 2Fsinq =Mv2/R . For small angles and in radians , sinq=q . The formula becomes : <p> 2Fq =Mv2/R ( 1 ) where M = the mass of the string segment . <p> If we calculatemass M of the hump , it results inM=2R ? . <p> This is because thelength of the hump is 2R ? and is the mass per unit length of the string . In other words , <p> = mass /length.Eqn. ( 1 ) takes the form : <p> 2Fq=2R ? v2/R ( 2 ) <p> Solving for v results in : <p> Figure 8 <p> Answer the following : <p> What isFand what isv ? Why are the angles marked as q equal ? What happens toFcosq ? What is the total downward force that is trying to bring the string to normal as the wave passes through ? How do you calculate the arc-lengthAB and its mass M ? <p> Example 3:A 120-cm guitar string is under a tension of 400N . The mass of the string is 0.480 grams . Calculate ( a ) the mass per unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of waves in it . ( c ) In a diagram show the number of(1/2) ?

This means thatat any point x and at any instant t , we wanty ( x , t ) . For harmonic waves , such equation has the general form : <p> y ( x , t ) = A sin ( kx- ? t + f ) <p> kis called thewave numberand its unit inSIism-1 . The above equation is for one dimensional harmonic waves traveling along the+xaxis . If the waves are moving along the-xaxis , the appropriate equation is : <p> y ( x , t ) = A sin ( kx+ ? t + f ) . <p> Ify = 0att = 0andx = 0 , then f = 0 . It is important todistinguishbetween the wave propagation velocityv ( along the x-axis ) and the medium 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass by the particles of the medium . The wavepropagationvelocity isV = f ? , but the particles velocity in the y-direction is vy= ? y/ ? t . The symbol " ? " denotes " partial derivative . " <p> Example 4:The equation of certain traveling waves is <p> y ( x , t ) = 0.0450 sin ( 25.12x-37.68t - 0.523 ) <p> where x and y are in meters , and t in seconds .

This is only for a very brief instant ( the gray becomes a straight line ) . <p> At t = T/2 , the opposite of t = 0 occurs . The two humps become troughs and the single trough becomes s hump . <p> In another half a period the shape of the gray ( or the sum ) become like the one at t = 0 . <p> Confirm the above explanation by looking at the different figures shown on the right ( Fig. 10 ) . <p> I <p> Figure 10 <p> Resonant Standing Waves in A String : <p> In a medium with limited boundary such as a string fixed at both ends , standing waves can only be formed for a set of discrete frequencies or wavelengths . <p> If you hold one end of a rope , say 19ft long , and tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from you , there will be a slack of 3ft in it allowing you to swing it up and down and make waves . By adjusting the frequency of the oscillatory motion you give to the end you are holding , you can generate a sequence of waves in the rope that will have an integer number of loops in it .

For a host gas spectral lines are discrete . <p> For white light entering a spectrometer the spectrum is a continuous band of rainbow colors . This continuous band of colors in a spectrometer ranges from violet to red and gives the following colors : violet , blue , green , yellow , orange , and red .

@@21346968 @1346968/ <p> In 1924 , Louis de Broglie thought that if light has the dual property of wave-particle behavior , why not matter particles such as electrons , protons , and neutrons ? He was encouraged by the work of Einstein in 1909 and used a combination of quantum theory and relativity to propose that there is a special wavelength associated with the motion ( momentum ) of each particle given by <p> In the Bohr theory of atom , the angular momentum of electron is quantized . This means that <p> Note that 2pris the circumference of the orbit of electron around the nucleus andn ? is an integer multiple of wavelength . <p> This is in agreement with the result that each electron 's orbit must be an integer multiple of a certain wavelength ! <p> Electron Diffraction : <p> In 1926 , C. L. Davisson and L. Gerner found out that electrons have also a wave-like behavior as they are bounced off an array of atoms similar to the reflection of X rays from the atomic planes of a crystal . They formed diffraction patterns . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined for an electron that is accelerated and is given speed v inside an electric field of voltage V. Such ? may be calculated as follows : <p> For each electron of mass M and charge q inside a potential difference V , just before collision with a target atom , we may set its P.E . and K.E. equal . <p> P.E . = K.E. <p> qV = ( 1/2 ) Mv2 <p> 2MqV = M2v2 or <p> Mv = ( 2MqV ) ( 1/2 ) <p> Since ? = h/Mv <p> ( 1 ) <p> On the other hand , when electrons get reflected from the surface of a metal with an atomic spacing of D , they form diffraction patterns . The positions of diffraction maxima are given by : <p> D sin f = n ? . ( 2 ) <p> For electrons accelerated under a 54-V potential difference and incident on nickel surface with an atomic spacing of D = 0.215nm , the principal maximum corresponding to n=1 occurs at f = 50 . Using the above formula ( 2 ) yields : ? = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a conclusively close result ! This is another verification of the wave-like motion of electrons . <p> Example 1 : Calculate the de Broglie wavelength for an electron that is accelerated inside a potential difference of 150 volts . <p> Solution : Using the above formula , we get : ? = 0.1 nm . This is equivalent to 1+ , the interatomic spacing between atoms in a crystal . <p> Example 2 : Calculate the de Broglie wavelength for an electron that is accelerated inside a potential difference of 54 volts . <p> Solution : Using the above formula , we get : ? = 0.167 nm . <p> Schrdinger 's Wave Equation : <p> Schrdinger thought that the same way geometric optics is an approximation to wave optics , classical mechanics may be an approximation to wave mechanics . For simplicity , we will use the one-dimensional wave equation for the motion of a wave as it moves the particles of the medium according to : <p> To verify de Broglie 's way of thinking on electron motion around the nucleus of atom , let 's consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Note that the " standing wave solution " means " non-transient " that in turn means " time-independent " or mathematically means " no change with respect to time " , and ultimately it translates to ( d/dt = 0 ) . It is also called the " steady state " solution. ? ( x ) is therefore chosen to determine the shape of the steady state solution and it is a function of position ( x ) only . <p> y ( x , t ) = ? ( x ) sin ( ? t ) . <p> Substituting this into wave equation ( verify ) , results in : <p> If U is the potential energy , then the total energy E = p2/2M+ U , we may conclude that p2 = 2M ( E - U ) , and <p> and the differential equation becomes ( verify ) : <p> This is the one-dimensional time-independent Schrdinger wave equation. ? ( x ) determines the stationary states of an atomic system when E is a constant in time . When Schrdinger applied this equation to the hydrogen atom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate boundary conditions naturally lead to discrete energy levels of the Bohr model.Heisenberg at about the same time ( 1925 ) developed a different form of quantum mechanics that later on showed equivalent results . <p> Now , the question is how to interpret the wave associated with the particle ( electron in this case ) ? De Broglie suggested that the wave might represent the particle itself , or might play a guiding role in the particle 's motion . Schrdinger suggested that a particle is really a group of waves , a wave packet , somewhat like a fuzzy powderpuff . Max Born guided by Einstein 's idea proposed that the intensity of a light wave ( that is proportional to the square of the waves amplitude ) at a given point , is a measure of the number of photons that arrive at that point . This means that the form of a wave function for electromagnetic field determines the probability of finding a photon . By analogy , Born suggested that the square of the wave function determines the probability per unit volume of finding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding the particle within volume dV <p> The quantity ? 2 is called the probability density.In one dimension , ? 2dx is the probability of finding the particle in the interval between x and x+dx . It is more likely to observe the particle wherever ? 2dx is large and less likely to observe it where ? 2dx is small . Since the particle has to be somewhere the integral of its probability must be equal to one : <p> A wave function that satisfies this condition is said to be normalized . <p> The probability interpretation of the wave function can be shown by a simple experiment . As shown in the middle column , if a large number of electrons pass through a single slit via a very narrow beam , say one electron at a time , after a while the majority will be recorded to concentrate at the center and about the centerline . A smaller fraction will accumulate fairly evenly at side regions as shown . <p> Eventually after so many electrons go under diffraction at the slit , the familiar diffraction pattern will develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall on the centerline is higher than the probability of them falling on the side lines ; however , the sum of the probabilities must equal one . <p> The quantity ? 2(x) tells us what fraction of the total number of electrons will fall at position x . <p> As another example , look at the patterns that are formed when electrons pass through two slitsas shown on the right . As the number of electrons passing through the two slits increases the separation of the bright and dark fringes becomes more apparent . <p> Classical physics is based on the principle of determinism that means : Given the initial position and velocity of a particle as well as the forces acting on it , its future course can accurately be predicted , at least theoretically . The statistical interpretation of the wave function states that one can only predict the probability of finding a particle at a given position . It is not possible to exactly determine the position of a single particle at a given time.Quantum mechanics can correctly predict the average values of physical quantities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Principle : <p> The wavelength of a wave that extends over many cycles is well-defined but its position is not . For example , if you see continuous ripples on a calm swimming pool , you will be able to measure the wavelength fairly accurately ; however , you can not exactly measure the position of the moving wave . This is shown in Figure 1 . <p> Now , let 's look at another scenario . When waves of different wavelengths interfere and add up , they can form a localized wave packet , but the wavelength is not well-defined . An example for this case is when two waves of different wavelengths interfere ( waves generated by two moving boats on a calm lake ) , they generate waveforms that appear stationary or at least appearing at the same location periodically . In this example , the position of the wave packet can be determined , but not the wavelengths . This is shown in Figure 2 . <p> Based on the above , in order to reduce the uncertainty in the position of a particle , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonably well-localized wave packet , as shown in Fig. 2 . From ? = h/p , it is clear that a spread in wavelengths ( ? ? ) results in a spread in momentum ( ? p ) . According to Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , the uncertainties in position and momentum are related by <p> ? x ? p = h ( * ) <p> It is impossible to measure both the position and the momentum of a particle simultaneously to arbitrary precisions . This inability has nothing to do with experimental skill or equipment ; it is a fundamental restriction imposed on us by nature . For a wave packet , the uncertainty relation is an intrinsic property independent of the measuring apparatus . Heisenberg arrived at this conclusion in 1927 . Here is a simplified version : <p> Suppose we want to locate an electron by bouncing a photon off of it . We should not expect to measure the position with a precision better than the wavelength of the photon used . Thus the uncertainty in the position of the electron is at least ? x = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best equal to ? . The photon may transfer some or all of its linear momentum to the electron depending on the collision and scattering angle . Thus the uncertainty in the momentum of the electron is roughly equal to the original momentum of the photonitself. ? p = h / ? . The product of these uncertainties is <p> ? x ? p h . <p> This is the same as the equation we labeled as ( * ) . To reduce the uncertainty in position ? x , a shorter ? must be used . A shorter ? means a higher f or a higher photon energy hf that means a higher momentum p of the incident photon . A higher p of the incident photon means a greater spread or uncertainty in the momentum measurement of the electron , ? p . Thus , lowering the uncertainty in locating the position ( ? x ) of electron causes the uncertainty in its momentum measurement ( ? p ) to increase . The conclusion is that one can measure either the position or the momentum precisely but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very act of measurement disturbs the system under study .

@@21346973 @1346973/ <p> Huygens in 1678 came up with the idea that light waves ( or in general waves ) propagate in the form of wave fronts . The waves generated from a source put the immediate points around that source into oscillation . Such secondary points form a wavefront . Each point of this wavefront will then act as an independent source that will send wavelets or waves in all directions . The next series of points around these secondary points will receive wavelets from many of such secondary points that will interfere and will have a resultant that is maximum in the propagation direction of the original wave . This next series of points ( the tertiary points ) form a new wavefront each point of which will again act as an independent source . The process will continue in this manner ( wavefront by wavefront ) as the waves propagate in a medium or even vacuum . Note that only electromagnetic waves propagate in vacuum . The points in vacuum are not occupied by matter ( molecules or atoms ) . We look at points in vacuum as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary points that form a wave front ( wavefront AB ) . Each point on wavefront AB acts as an independent source sending wavelets in all directions ; however , the next series of points ( the tertiary points ) form the new wavefront CD . <p> Snell 's Law of Refraction : <p> In Chapter 37 , the Snell 's law was introduced without proof . In this chapter , the wavefront concept of Huygens principle will be used to derive the Snell ' law . <p> In the following figure , wavefront AB carries the incident rays and wavefront A'B ' carries the refracted rays . Note that each wavefront is perpendicular to the rays it carries . The ray ( wavelet ) at the A end of wavefront AB arrives at the interface first . The wavefront at the B end arrives at the interface ? t seconds later because of distance BB ' . Of course , BB ' = v1 ? t where v1 is the wave speed in medium 1 . Meanwhile , the ray that arrived at A first travels a distance AA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of medium 1 . Of course , AA ' = v2 ? t where v2 is the wave speed in medium 2 . The assumption is that the speed of light in medium 2 is less than that of medium 1 . For this reason , light has to bend and get closer to the normal line if it moves slower in medium 2 . Triangles ABB ' and AA'B ' both share the same hypotenuse AB ' . The angle opposite to BB ' is the same size as ? 1 , the angle of incidence . The angle opposite to the shorter length AA ' is the same size as ? 2 , the angle of refraction . The following mathematical relations may be written : <p> Of course , if ? 1= 0 ( when incident rays are - to the interface ) , then ? 2 = 0 as well ( the refracted rays become - to the interface too ) . This is verifiable by the Snell 's formula . In such case , the waves do not appear to be refracted ; however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium . This is shown below . <p> Diffraction : <p> As was discussed in Chapter 37 , diffraction is the bending of light upon passing through apertures or passing by sharp edges . When a wavefront arrives at an opening or an aperture , each point of the opening becomes an independent source sending wavelets in all directions . The wavelets emerging from such independent sources interfere at different points of the region past the aperture causing diffraction patterns on a wall or a screen . If the aperture or the hole that a wavefront arrives at is big compared to the wavelength of the light , the diffraction patterns will not be very clear and approximates the shape of the aperture itself ; however , if the hole diameter is relatively small ( as much as a number of wavelengths ) , sharper diffraction patterns are formed . The figure on the right shows the diffraction pattern of light past through a small aperture . <p> Diffraction pattern through a small aperture <p> The bright spot at the center is called the " Poisson Spot . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in phase at the center and interfere constructively . <p> Fraunhofer and Fresnel Diffraction : <p> Fresnel Diffraction : <p> When either the source or the screen is near an aperture or an obstruction ( a sharp edge ) , the wavefronts are spherical and the diffraction pattern they form is quite complex . This is called " Fresnel Diffraction . " One case is shown on the right . <p> In this case some light enters the region of geometrical shadow . <p> The curve shows how the intensity and width of the bright fringes change . <p> When both the source and the screen are far from the aperture , the wavefront arriving at the hole is almost flat . In this case , the single slit diffraction is discussed called the " Fraunhofer diffraction . " <p> Single-Slit ( Fraunhofer ) Diffraction : <p> Fraunhofer Diffraction : <p> Fraunhofer diffraction is one in which source is far from the slit or aperture , and therefore , the wave patterns arriving at the slit or aperture are almost like straight lines . <p> In single-slit diffraction , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or width , a . Note that a single slit has a width only and not a diameter . <p> If the aperture diameter or the single slit width is large ( several times the wavelength ( ? ) ) , then the lit area over the screen fairly defines the shape of the aperture or the slit . <p> If the aperture diameter or the slit width is small and comparable to the wavelength of the light used , the diffraction patterns will be more pronounced or have better contrast . <p> If the width of the slit is a , the dependency of the maxima and minima of the produced patterns on aand ? is shown above . <p> The position of the minima of a single-slit diffraction pattern is given by <p> asin ? = m ? <p> where m = 1 , 2 , 3 ... and a is the slit width . <p> X-Ray Diffraction : <p> X-ray was discovered during Cathode-Ray experiments done by Roentgen in 1895 . It was also determined that the wavelength of X-rays are much smaller than those of visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X-rays were passed through very thin layers of NaCl and ZnS crystals , symmetric patterns were observed on photographic films . Not only this suggested that X-rays were smaller than inter-atomic distances , it also verified the wave nature of them because of the observed diffraction patterns on photographic films . <p> When X-rays pass through a crystal , they produce a pattern that is a characteristic of that crystal . <p> In 1913 , W. H. Bragg and his son W. L. Bragg suggested the following analysis : If the atoms in a crystal are orderly arranged , and X-rays can penetrate into lower layers of atoms , after reflection from lower layers , they must interfere constructively or destructively with other reflected rays resulting in interference patterns from which inter-atomic distances can be measured . The following figure shows an X-ray wavefront incident on a flat surface of a certain material . <p> One wavelet hits an atom of the top layer of the material and another wavelet penetrates in and hits a lower layer atom . The two incoming rays move together up to line segment MA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of the arriving rays . The reflected rays will also move together starting from MC up . MC must be drawn perpendicular to the reflected rays <p> The distance AB + BC is the path difference traveled between the arriving wavelets and the reflected wavelets . If they interfere constructively , they result in a pattern formation on the photographic film . The condition for recording a pattern on a photographic film is <p> Path difference = n ? ( for constructive interference ) <p> or , AB + BC = n ? , or <p> 2d sin ? = n ? ( Bragg 's Formula ) <p> where n is an integer . <p> Polarization : <p> As we already know , electromagnetic waves or light waves are generated as a result of electric charge oscillations . If the frequencies of such waves are in the visible range , then we can see them . We have also learned that electromagnetic waves are of transverse type and there are two perpendicular oscillating vectors that travel with each pulse perpendicular to its propagation direction . One is the electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other is a magnetic field vector B that is normal to the propagation direction as shown below : <p> If a charge keeps oscillating up and down as shown in this figure , then the generated pulses of E&amp;M waves travel along the x-axis as shown . Note that only the pulses traveling to the right are shown . The pulses traveling to the left and any other horizontal direction are not shown here . We know that as the electrons of atoms spin around their nuclei and make transitions to their higher orbits , they keep changing their planes of oscillation , some several hundred billion times per second or more . Therefore , the up and down vectors shown for charge q at the origin , in the above figure , is only one direction of oscillation out of some trillions possible directions of oscillation . Accordingly , the electric field vector E does change its oscillation direction the same number of times . It is the electric field vector that we concentrate on , in this chapter . For our current discussion , we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the electric effect . The following figures show 3 possible directions of oscillation that appear to be like 6 possible directions of oscillation . <p> When a light source emits light , several hundred trillions or more of such oscillation directions ( pulses ) are generated per second and come to you . If you divide a circle into 360 oscillations directions , how many of these trillions oscillations per second will you receive within each one-degree sector of the circle ? Still some trillions or more you would say . How far apart will these pulses be ? If you receive say 4.28x1014 pulses per second , then the pulses are 2.34x10-15 seconds ( 2.34 femtoseconds ) apart and you will see the result as red light . Now if there is a way to receive light in approximately one direction out of so many directions , we say that such light is polarized . It means that the electric field oscillations occur in one direction only as shown below : <p> Methods of Polarization : <p> A few methods of generating polarized light is explained below : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is incident on a transparent surface , it is partially reflected and partially refracted . If we keep changing the angle of incidence ? i , the reflection angle , ? rflkeeps changing but remains equal to ? i . The refraction angle , ? rfr , keeps changing as well , but according to the Snell 's law . There comes a critical angle of incidence ? i= ? p , at which the reflected ray is perpendicular to the refracted ray.When this happens , the reflected ray is polarized and the electric fields of its pulses oscillate in one direction only . In the following figure , the critical angle of incidence , ? p , at which this condition is satisfied is shown and ? p is calculated in terms of the refraction indices of the involving media . <p> If the reflected and refracted rays are at 90 for that special angle of incidence ? p , then from the figure it is clear that <p> ? rfl +90 + ? rfr =180 or , ? rfr = 90 - ? rfl <p> Since n1sin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p = n2 sin ( 90 - ? rfl ) or , <p> n1sin ? p = n2 cos ( ? rfl ) or , <p> n1sin ? p = n2 cos ( ? p ) or , <p> tan ? p = n2/ n1 ( Brewster 's Law ) <p> 2 ) Polarization by Selective Absorption : <p> To Be Added <p> 3 ) Polarization by Scattering <p> To Be Added <p> Chapter 38 Test Yourself 1 : <p> 1 ) According to Huygens ' principle , waves travel in the form of ( a ) particles ( b ) wavefronts ( c ) a hump-like disturbanceclick here . <p> 2 ) A wavefront is formed as a result of ( a ) wavelets oscillations on a previous wavefront ( b ) a change in frequency ( c ) a change in wavelength . <p> 3 ) Each point on a wavefront acts as ( a ) a wavefront ( b ) a wavelet ( c ) an independent source sending out waves in all directions ( d ) both b and c. click here . <p> 4 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b ) do form in matter only ( c ) form both in matter and vacuum . <p> 5 ) When a wavefront of light is incident on the interface of two transparent media at a nonzero angle with the normal line , wavelets arrive at the interface ( a ) simultaneously .

Calculate a percent error for each , using the percent error formula you used in Experiment 2 . <p> ii ) Parallel Resistors : <p> Theory and Procedure : <p> Parallel resistors experience the same voltage , but ( possibly ) different currents . This is in contrast to series resistors . A typical pure parallel circuit is shown below . The voltage ( Vab ) has to be the same for the three resistors , because they are all between the same two points of the circuit ( a and b ) . The current in each resistor is determined by the equation I=V/R . Since the voltage V is the same for each resistor ( V1=V2=V3=Vab ) , the larger the resistance R of a particular resistor , the smaller the current through that resistor . Charge or flow conservation requires that <p> I = I1 + I2 + I3 . <h> Point ais a dividing point . Current I divides at point a into I1 , I2 , and I3 . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to form I again . <p> Fig. 2 <p> Note that the voltage across each of the resistors is Vab . If we neglect the small voltage-drop across the ammeter , the voltage Vab is equal to the battery voltage Vbat . This is because there is no circuit element ( other than the ammeter ) between point a and the battery , or between point b and the battery . The ammeter ( A ) does not contribute to any significant voltage drop ; the voltage drop across an ammeter can usually be neglected . <p> For a different case , where there is a fourth resistor between point a and the battery , or between point band the battery , Vab is not equal to Vbat . This is going to be case ( iii ) in this experiment . Here , for parallel resistors : <p> Use the same three resistors R1 , R2 , and R3 . <p> Arrange a circuit as shown in Fig.2 . To measure the voltages , place the voltmeter across the junction points a and b . The voltage you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and R3 .

Note that the approximate current must be calculated first and the correct and safe mA range be selected ; otherwise , the ammeter will be damaged . Do this for each branch and record the values in ( mA ) . <p> Read the current , I , through the main branch ( between the battery and a or between b and the battery ) .

Calculate a percent error for each , using the appropriate formula as in Experiment 2 . <p> iii ) Parallel Resistors in Series with Another Resistor : <p> Theory and Procedure : <p> Fig. 3 shows a parallel portion between points a and b that is in series with another resistor between points b and c . Here , the battery voltage partially drops across the ab portion and partially across the bc portion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + Vbc <p> The voltage across resistors 1 , 2 , and 3 is the same because they are in parallel . ( The parallelism is not because they are drawn parallel to each other on paper ; it is because the current between points a and b must divide into three branches such that I = I1 + I2 + I3 . The same voltage Vab drives currents I1 , I2 , and I3 into resistors 1 , 2 , and 3 . ) <p> This balance-of-currents equation may be written in terms of voltages and resistances as : <h> I = I1 + I2 + I3 , or <p> Dividing through by Vab yields : 1 / Rab = 1 /R1 + 1 /R2 + 1 /R3 <p> Rab = 1 / ( 1 / R1 + 1/ R2 + 1/ R3 ) <p> This equation is good only for the parallel portion . To find the total resistance of the circuit , one may write : <p> Rac = Rab + Rbc where Rbc = R4 ( Rab and Rbc are in series ) <p> Once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be calculated by using Ohms law : <p> Vbat = RacI . <p> The total resistance Rac determines how much current the battery can deliver . ( The ammeter ( A ) is a low-resistance device , and its resistance may be ignored . ) The reason that Rac is the determining factor is that there are no other significant resistors between point a and the battery or point c and the battery . <p> Fig. 3 <p> When I is determined , it can be multiplied by Rab to calculate Vab . It can also be multiplied by Rac to calculate Vac as shown : <p> Vab = Rab I and Vac = Rac I <p> Now that Vab is known , Ohms law may be used again to calculate I1 , I2 , and I3 , as follows : <p> I1 = Vab / R1 <p> I2 = Vab / R2 <p> I3 = Vab / R3 <p> Use the four resistors R1 , R2 , R3 and R4 . <p> Arrange a circuit as shown in Fig. 3 . To measure the voltages , place the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then across points b and c to read Vbc . Of course , Vab is the voltage across each of R1 , R2 , and R3 , and Vbc is the voltage across R4 . <p> To measure the current , the ammeter must be placed in the line of each resistor once to read the current in that branch . Note that each branch must be opened at one of the connections and the ammeter be placed in between the open ends .

@@21346982 @1346982/ <p> Thetemperatureof an object isa measure of how cold or hotthat object is . More precisely , the temperature of an object isa measure of the average kinetic energy of the atoms and moleculesof that object . A hotter object has faster molecular vibrations . Temperature is a scalar quantity . <p> If anunmarked thermometeris placed in amixture of ice and water , the liquid level in the thermometer goes down and comes to stop at a certain level . As long as there is ice to melt , the level remains the same . When all of the ice is molten , then the liquid level starts going up . If the same unmarked thermometer is placed in pure water and heated , the mercury level in it keeps going up until water comes to boil . During the boiling process , the level remains constant again until there is no more water to evaporate.Celsius named these two fixed points as " 0 " and " 100 " and made a thermometer.The " 0 " and " 100 " are decided for experiments performedat ocean levelwherethe air pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pure substance remains constant during freezing and melting processes ( when phase changes ) . The heat absorbed or given off during melting or freezing contributes to phase change only , either from solid to liquid or from liquid to solid.The same is true for evaporation and condensation processes during which temperature remains constant . <p> Theimportant pointhere is that the melting ( also , freezing ) point of water is used to mark the " 0 " on the Celsius scale and the evaporation ( also , condensation ) point of water is used to mark the " 100 " on the Celsius scale , of course , both performed at one atmosphere of air pressure . <p> " 0 " on Celsius scale corresponds to " 32 " onFahrenheit scale and " 100 " on Celsius scale corresponds to " 212 " onFahrenheitscale . This means that pure water freezes at 32oF and boils at 212oF if the air pressure is one atmosphere . <p> Comparison Between Celsius and Fahrenheit Scales : <p> Although most calculators do the conversions between these two scales immediately , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . <p> The " 0 " on Celsius is equivalent to " 32 " on Fahrenheit , and the " 100 " on Celsius is equivalent to " 212 " on Fahrenheit . Corresponding to every " C " on Celsius , there is an " F " on Fahrenheit as shown . To develop a formula that calculates " C " for a given " F " and vice versa , we may equate the segment ratios on both scales as shown below : <p> Fig. 1 <p> Example 1 : The Fahrenheit scale reads 77oF , what is the reading on the Celsius scale ? <p> Solution:Using the formula:oC= ( 5/9 ) F- 32 ; oC= ( 5/9 ) 77-32= 25 <p> Example 2 : A temperature difference of ? C =24oC is measured between two points on Celsius scale . How much is this difference in Fahrenheit scale ? <p> Solution:100oC difference on the Celsius scale corresponds to 180oF difference on the Fahrenheit scale . Using a proportion , the difference in Fahrenheit is <p> ? F/ ? C = 180o/100o ; ? F/24o=9/5 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Example 3 : At what temperature both Fahrenheit and Celsius scales read the same temperature ? <p> Solution : To be solved by students . <p> Absolute Scales : The basis for absolute scales ( Kelvin and Rankin scales ) is the temperature at which molecular motion comes to stop . This temperature can not actually be reached ; however , with great cooling , temperatures very close to it have been reached . Experiments have shown that when a gas is cooled down , its volume decreases.At constant pressure , the volume decrease for a gas , is proportional to the temperature decrease . In other words , The ratio ? V/ ? T remains constant . That means that if V ( the gas volume ) is plotted versus T ( the gas temperature ) while pressure is kept constant , the graph is a straight line as shown below . In practice , it is very difficult to create and control the near absolute zero condition ! <p> Fig. 2 <p> Since it is practically very difficult to reach very low temperatures , we have to extrapolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the point of intersection , V = 0 . This means that the gas is so cold that its electrons are not spinning around the nuclei and do not need any space for their vibration . In other words , the no need for space meansZero Volume. -273.15oC rounded to-273oCis theextrapolated temperaturethat is set to be theZero on Kelvin scale . This makes the zero on the Celsius scale to correspond to 273 on the Kelvin scale ; therefore , <p> K =oC + 273 . <p> Parallel to the above discussion , if the temperatures on the graph are expressed inoF , extrapolation crosses the temperature axis at-460oF . This constitutes theZero onRankin Scale . We may write : <p> R =oF + 460 . <p> Heat : <p> Heat is a form of energy that transfers due to a temperature difference . <p> Units of Heat : <p> The familiar unit often heard is " calorie .

A non-Metric unit for heat energy isBtu ( British thermal unit ) .1 Btuis the amount of heat energy that can raise the temperature of1lbmof pure water by1oF . Refer to the Chart of Units . <p> Specific Heat ( c ) : <p> Different substances take different amounts of heat energy for one unit mass of them to warm up by one degree . For example , if you pour1kg of pure water ( 1L of water , because ? water=1kg/L ) in a light kettle and place it on a burner and also place1kg of ironon a same heating power burner , after the same length of time , the iron piece will be much hotter than the water . The reason is the difference in theirspecific heat.Iron takes much less heat to warm up compared to water . <p> Thespecific heat ( c ) of a substance is theamount of heat1kgof that substance takes to warm up by1oC . On this basis , thespecific heat of water is 1 kcal / ( kgoC ) . This is because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are given below : <p> cwater= 1.000 kcal/ ( kgoC ) or , cwater= 1.000cal/ ( goC ) . <p> ciron= 0.108 kcal/ ( kgoC ) or , ciron = 0.108cal/ ( goC ) . <p> cAl = 0.215 kcal/ ( kgoC ) or , cAl = 0.215cal/ ( goC ) . <p> cbrass= 0.0924 kcal/ ( kgoC ) or , cbrass= 0.0924cal/ ( goC ) . <p> Heat calculation : <p> When heat is given to a pure substance or taken from it , its temperature starts changingifphase change does not start . During aphase change ( solid to liquid , liquid to solid , liquid to vapor , or vapor to liquid ) , temperature remains constant . We will look at the following two cases : <p> In this case theamount of heatgiven or taken is obviously proportional to mass Mof the object , its specific heat c , and the temperature change ? T.The formula is therefore , <p> Q = Mc ?

" At this state when no further heat transfer takes place , it is said that " thermal equilibrium " is reached .

Heat loss is negative and heat gain is positive . The negative of heat loss is the same thing as heat gain . <p> Example 7:A 65-gram piece of aluminum at 180oC is removed from a stove and placed in 45 grams of water initially at 22oC . Find the equilibrium temperature Teq . <p> Solution : Thermal equilibrium requires that <p> - heat loss by hotter objects = heat gain by colder objects . <p> Here , the180oC aluminum is the hot object and the 22oC water is the cold one . The heat loss by aluminum must be equal to the heat gain by water . Note that the final temperature of both water and aluminum will be the same .

It is known that the iron piece has been in the oven long enough so that its initial temperature can be thought as the temperature of the oven . The iron piece is placed in 75.0 grams of water that is held by a 45.0-gram aluminum container initially at an equilibrium temperature of 25.0oC . The final equilibrium temperature of iron , aluminum , and water becomes 41.0oC . Find the initial temperature of iron ( oven ) . Assume that the whole system is thermally isolated from the surroundings . <p> Solution:Thermal equilibrium requires that <p> - heat loss by hotter objects = heat gain by colder objects . <p> -Mc Tf- Tiiron= Mc Tf- TiAl+ Mc Tf- Tiwater <p> - 225(0.108) ( 41-Ti ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> - 24.3(41-Ti) = 1354.8 ; 41-Ti=55.8 ; Ti= 96.8oC . <p> Heat Calculation Due to a Phase Change : <p> During aphase change ( solid to liquid , liquid to solid , liquid to vapor , or vapor to liquid ) , temperature remains constant . For example , when ice is removed from a freezer at say-25oC , it first absorbs some heat to become ice at 0oC.0oCis themelting temperatureof ice . At this temperature , any heat given to the ice will be consumed for melting it and not changing its temperature . During the melting process of ice ( a phase change from solid to liquid ) , the temperature remains constant at 0oC . Since temperature does not change , an equation such asQ = Mc ( Tf- Ti ) can not be usedfor heat calculation . Here the useful equation is <p> Q = M LfwhereLfis called the " latent heat of fusion . " <p> Lfis measured for different substances at their melting <p> /freezing points or temperatures . Typical values may be found in texts or handbooks . <p> Example 9 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water already at its freezing point ( 0oC ) to convert it to ice at ( 0oC ) ? The latent heat of fusion ( freezing ) for water is Lf=80cal <p> /gr . <p> Solution:In this problem , the heat calculation involves a phase change only . There is no temperature change . <p> Q = M Lf ; Q = ( 250gr ) ( 80cal/gr ) =20,000cal . <p> Example 10 : How much heat should be given to 250gr of ice at 0oC to convert it to water at 40. oC ? The latent heat of freezing <p> or melting for water is Lf=80cal/gr and the specific heat of water is 1 cal/groC . <p> Solution:In this problem , the heat calculation involves both a phase change and a temperature change . <p> Q <p> = M Lf+ Mc ( Tf- Ti ) ; Q=250(80) +250(1) ( 40-0 ) =30,000cal . <p> Example 11:How much heat should be given to 250gr of ice at-20oC to bring it to boil ( 100oC ) ? <p> Solution : This problem has3steps . A temperature change : ice from-20oC to0oC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at0oC , and another temperature change : water from0oC to water at 100oC . We need three constants : <p> 4 ) The reason for using themelting pointof a pure substance in the calibration of thermometers is that ( a ) during melting , for example , the temperature of a pure substance remains constant ( b ) it can be replicated at other similar points on this planet ( c ) both a &amp; b.click here . <p> 5 ) The reason for using theboiling pointof a pure substance in the calibration of thermometers is that ( a ) during boiling , for example , the temperature of a pure substance remains constant ( b ) it can be replicated at other similar points on this planet ( c ) both a &amp; b . <p> 15 ) The temperature at which both scales read the same number is ( a ) 35o ( b ) 55o ( c ) -40o.click here . <p> 16 ) InFig. 2 , V1is the volume at T1=100oC , and V2the volume at T2= 50oC .

The reason is that at higher temperatures , not only each molecule of an object oscillates faster , but also it requires a greater space due to its increased amplitude.Water and mercury near freezing are exceptions . Waterexpandsas its temperature decreasesfrom 4oC to 0oC . This exception has its own advantages and disadvantages . One advantage is that the density of ice becomes less than that of water causing ice to float on water . In winter , the ice over lakes and oceans protects the underneath water from freezing and preserves the underwater life . One disadvantage is the cracking of cylinder heads in engines that lack antifreeze.We may study the thermal expansion of solids , liquids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solids and liquidswill be discussed .

Note : Although the air temperature does not reach90.0oC in summer , a copper wire under sunlight can reach that temperature . <p> Solution : ? L <p> = a Li ? T = **32;563;TOOLONG =0.85 mi . <p> The final length is501mi <p> . <p> Example 17:In a clamp-shape piece of pyrex a slender steel rod is fixed as shown.At 15oC the gap between the rod and the metal contact at B is 0.050mm . At what temperature does the rod make contact with the metal at B ? For solution , assume the left side ( Point B ) to be fixed . <p> Solution : Both the steel rod and the pyrex clamp expand , but by different amounts . As the rod expands to the left , the 25.45mm-segment of pyrex shifts it to the right at a slower pace because <p> apyrex&lt; asteel . ? L = aLi ?

It was used as a visual indicator for best tuning on a desired station . When the tiny filament in a tuning eye is given a low voltage ( V1 ) , it warms up and glows red , as does an electric heater . In this heated state , the filament releases electrons . Another voltage ( V ) may be used to create an electric field in which the released electrons can be energized , accelerated , and brought into motion toward a positive dish . The negative filament , the positive dish , and the two voltage sources are shown below : <p> The positive dish-like surface is coated with a metal oxide that glows green/blue as electrons hit it . A metal cap is placed over the element which is held by three thin legs . These legs cast a shadow on the dish , making straight dark lines on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V makes the dish glow brighter . An instruction comes with each tuning-eye tube that must be followed for proper use . The following steps should be taken : <p> Connect the filament wires as indicated in the instruction to an appropriate voltage V1 . <p> Wait a few seconds for the filament to warm up and observe its reddish color . <p> Connect the other wires as indicated in the instruction to the second appropriate source and increase the voltage to the appropriate level V and observe that the dish attains a bluish or greenish color . Pay attention to the shadow cast on the dish by the caps legs and note that they are straight lines as viewed from the top of the tuning eye . <p> Connect a pre-selected solenoid ( with known number of turns per meter ) to an appropriate power supply that can provide a few amperes . An ammeter must be placed in the solenoid circuit for a more-accurate current measurement . Note that the ammeter wire must be put in its 10-Amp setting . <p> With a current of about 1A passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube so that the filament is positioned at the center of it , and observe how the legs shadows ( straight lines to begin with ) bend as the magnet is lowered . The value you later calculate for B , magnetic field strength , actually occurs at the middle of the solenoid ; therefore , make sure that the filament is precisely inside and at the center of the solenoid . <p> Adjust the dish voltageV , and the solenoid current I to get a nice curve for the shadow of each leg in the tuning eye . The radius of curvature R must be measured . Any cylindricalnon-metallic object that goes into the solenoid may be used . While holding that object inside the solenoid and looking straight down on to it and the top of the tuning eye , try to match the curvature of the shadow with the curvature of the object by adjusting V and I. <p> Try three different round objects and obtain three different sets of V , I , and R. <p> For each set , calculate B = on I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solenoid . <h> Use B , V , andR along with e to find the value of M for each set by using equation ( 4 ) . <p> Find a mean value for M using the three values calculated .

The moment of each force is equal to the product of that force and its perpendicular distance from the pivot . <p> In Fig. 1 , W3X3 is the only clockwise moment about the pivot . The counterclockwise moments about the pivot are W1X1 and W2X2 . The weight of the meter stick does not create any moment about the pivot because its weight vector passes through it .

( a ) True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in circular motion can be kept constant.Velocity is never constant in circular motion , because its direction keeps changing . Speed is constant only for uniform circular motion of a particle . As an example , when you turn a ceiling fan on , for a while , it is speeding up and therefore accelerating . During the acceleration phase , the motion is NOT uniform . When the fan reaches its maximum rpm , then each particle ( or point ) of it will have its own constant speed along its own circle of rotation . <p> Acceleration Vector : <p> In circular motion , there are two types of acceleration : " tangential acceleration " and " centripetal acceleration . " <p> Tangential acceleration ( at ) is the result of the change in the speed of the object . In uniform circular motion where speed is constant , the tangential acceleration is zero . <p> Centripetal acceleration ( ac ) is the result of the change in the direction of velocity of the object . This acceleration is never zero , because the change in direction is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure shows two wheels : one spinning at constant rpm , and one at an increasing rpm . For the left wheel at = 0 , and for the right wheel , at ? 0 . However , for both wheels ac ? 0 . Whether the wheel is turning at constant rpm or not , the centripetal acceleration is never zero . <p> Centripetal Acceleration : <p> The formula for centripetal acceleration is ac = v2/R . As was mentioned above , ac is a result of change in the direction of velocity vector with time . At this point , let 's just accept this formula and solve a numerical example on it . We will then introduce " centripetal force , " and also solve a couple of numerical examples on it , and finally investigate the reason why centripetal force as well as centripetal acceleration are directed toward the center of rotation . <p> Example 9 : A tiny rock is caught in the treads of a car tire spinning at 420rpm on a wheel balancing machine . The radius of the tire is 0.35m . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to travel circularly . <p> Example 10 : A car has a centripetal acceleration of 2.3 m/s2 as it travels along a curved portion of a road . The road has a radius of curvature of 250m . Knowing that the linear speed of the car is constant , determine ( a ) its linear speed , ( b ) its angular speed , ( c ) the angle it travels in 6.0s , and ( d ) the fraction of the circle it travels during this period . The top view of the circular motion of the car is shown . <p> Centripetal Force : Objects tend to move along straight lines unless they are forced to do otherwise . When an object is moving along a circle , it is forced to have that circular path . The force pulls or pushes the object toward the center of rotation . That is why it is called the " centripetal force , Fc . " When you tie a rock to a string and spin it above your head in a horizontal plane , your hand is constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers that is the center of rotation . If you let go of the string , the centripetal force is eliminated and the rock will no longer follow that circular path ; therefore , the cause of circular motion is the centripetal force , the force that pulls the object toward the center of rotation , no matter where the object is in its circular path . An object of mass M that has a centripetal acceleration , ac , along its circular path is therefore under a force of Fc = Mac . The formula for centripetal force becomes : <p> Fc = Mv2 / R <p> Example 11 : A rock of mass 0.22kg is attached to a string of length 0.43m and is given a circular motion in a horizontal plane at a rate of 180rpm . Calculate the centripetal force that the string exerts on the rock pulling it nonstop toward the center of rotation . Draw a circle and show M , V , R , and Fc on itas shown above . <p> Roads that are engineered ( banked ) provide a tilt ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicles from slipping off the road specially under icy conditions . The tilt in a curved portion allows vehicles to safely have a greater speed along that portion compared to an un-tilted or un-banked portion of the same radius of curvature . We are going to derive a formula for the maximum speed of the motion of a vehicle along a curved portion for two cases : ( 1 ) for an un-banked road , and ( 2 ) for a banked road . The maximum speed is the speed at which the vehicle is on the verge of slipping off the road . <p> In case ( 1 ) , the vehicle relies completely on friction , and in case ( 2 ) it relies completely on the road 's tilt and not on friction at all . The real situation is a combination of both . Case ( 1 ) is studied in the following example and the formula is actually derived in there . <p> Example 12 : An 840-kg car is negotiating a curve on an un-banked road where it has to totally rely on friction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road is 0.73 and the radius of curvature is 110m . What maximum speed can the car have for not slipping off the road ? In the first figure the car is being viewed from the back as it negotiates the road that curves to the left . In the second figure the top view is shown . <p> Motion of a Car Along an Un-banked Curved Road : <p> From the above example , we have come up with a general formula ( * ) for the motion of a car along an un-banked curved road , simply : <p> v2 = s R g <p> As you may have noticed , the mass M of the car was given , but not used in the solution . It is interesting to note that the maximum speed does not depend on the mass of the vehicle , and for a fixed radius , it depends on sonly . Of course , no one should try to drive alongside a curve at maximum possible speed ! There is no guarantee that the coefficient of static friction is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car can negotiate an un-banked curve of radius 55m at a maximum speed of 66 km/h before the danger for slipping is felt . Determine the coefficient of friction that exists between its tires and the road . <p> Motion of a Car Along a Banked Curved Road Without Relying on Friction : <p> When a vehicle travels along a banked curved road of radius ( R ) , the tilt angle of the road is the important element that determines the maximum speed . Since the normal force , N , must be perpendicular to the road , it is not parallel to the weight force , w . In this case N &gt; w .

@@21347054 @1347054/ <p> In this chapter wavelike behavior of light will be studied . There is a simple experiment that verifies light is a wave . The experiment is called the " Young 's Double-slit experiment . " Before this experiment is explained , we need to understand what constructive and destructive interference of two waves mean . <p> Constructive and Destructive Interference of Waves : <p> When two waves of the same wavelength that are in phase arrive at the same point , they completely amplify each other and the resulting wave has an amplitude that is equal to the sum of the amplitudes of the arriving waves as shown in Fig.1 . <p> When two waves of the same wavelength that are 180 out of phase arrive at the same point , they act opposite to each other and the resulting wave has an amplitude that is equal to the difference of the amplitudes of the arriving waves as shown in Fig.2.180 out of phase means when one is at its maximum , the other is at its minimum . <p> In Fig. 2 , when the two waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then the two waves cancel each other and A = 0 . <p> Coherence : <p> Two or more sources are called coherent if they have the same frequency , the same wavelength , and are in phase . <p> Young 's Double-Slit Experiment : <p> Suppose you have a small rectangular box one side of which is made of a thin sheet of metal with two parallel and very closely spaced slits cut in it . Also , suppose that there is a bright light source ( a point source ) inside the box such that light can emerge from the box through the two slits only . We further suppose that the light source is located on the perpendicular bisector of the two slits . This means that the light source is equidistant from the slits . If you are in a dark room and the only way light can come out of the box is via these two slits , you expect to see two bright lines on the wall parallel to the slits.To your surprise , you will see several bright lines form on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that light is a wave . Young was the first to explain the phenomenon . <p> Explanation : <p> The slits , ( being equidistant from the light source in the box ) , receive light waves from a single source and become coherentsources . Each slit becomes an independent source . These two independent and coherent sources send out waves in all directions . To the right of the sources , in the figure shown , there are many points at which the waves coming from these two sources are in phase and add up constructively . There are also many point at which the arriving waves combine destructively . Wherever they combine constructively , they form a bright streak of light that Young called a " bright fringe . " Wherever they combine destructively , they form a dark streak that he called a " dark fringe . " The fringe patterns , specially on a screen is shown below : <p> Fig. 4 <p> Bo is where the central bright fringe is formed . At Bo , light waves coming from S1 and S2 are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streak or a bright fringe . <p> At D1 above Bo , a dark fringe is formed . Light coming from S2 travels a longer distance than the light coming from S1 . The difference in the distance must be ( 1/2 ) ? that has made the two waves 180 out of phase . <p> At B1 above D1 , a bright fringe is formed . Light coming from S2 travels a longer distance than light coming from S1 . The distance difference must be exactly ( 2/2 ) ? or simply 1 ? that has made the two waves in phase . <p> At D2 above B1 , a dark fringe is formed . Light coming from S2 travels a longer distance than the light coming from S1 . The difference in the distance must be ( 3/2 ) ? that has made the two waves 180 out of phase . <p> At B2 above D2 , a bright fringe is formed . Light coming from S2 travels a longer distance than light coming from S1 . The distance difference must be exactly ( 4/2 ) ? or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase . <p> The above repeating arguments can go on for as many bright and dark fringes as can be made . The same argument is also true for the fringes below Bo . <p> In practice , the two sources are very close , closer than one tenth of a millimeter . The distance between the two coherent sources is shown by d . The screen is also placed at least 1m from the slits . Light rays emerging from the two slits are very closely packed . The angles that , for example , S2B1 and S1B1 make with the central line are practically equal . For the first bright fringe the angle is called ? 1 . The angle that nearly both S2B2 and S1B2 make with the central line is name ? 2 . See Figure below ( top view ) . The fringes on the other side of the central line are not shown due to symmetry . <p> Fig. 5 <p> Young 's Formula for the angle of the m-th Bright Fringe : <p> It is easy to derive a formula for the mth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ? , the wavelength of the light used . The formula is : <p> where m = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , ... <p> In the proof , note that the two angles that are labeled ? m are equal because their sides are normal to each other . <p> Let 's magnify the circled area in the above figure only for the nth bright fringe for which the distance difference <p> S2A = S2Bm - S1Bm = m ? . <p> In the right triangle S1S2A , sine of angle ? m is : <p> sin ? m = m ? /d as was expected . <p> Note that S1Bm and S2Bm are so close that arc S1A becomes perpendicular to both of them making S1S2A a right triangle . <p> Fig. 6 <p> Example 1 : The 3rd bright fringe in a double slit experiment makes an 2.4 angle with respect to the centerline .

All wavelengths in gasoline are shorter than those in air because gasoline is optically denser and slows down light. ( ? gas . = ? air / ngas .. Note that air and vacuum have very close optical properties . ) This wavelength decrease in gasoline along with the thickness of the film puts the reflected ray from B out of phase with respect to the original incident ray IA . <p> In brief , we have reflected ray 1 that is 180 out of phase with respect to IA . The Reflected ray 2 is also somewhat out of phase with respect to IA . This means that in most cases reflected ray 1 and ray 2 are somewhat out of phase . The degree of being out of phase can vary from zero to 180 depending on the angle of incidence and the thickness of the film . We should not forget that white light is also a mixture of so many different ( colors ) wavelengths for which angles of refraction differ and therefore the amount each color is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large number of reflections , refractions , and dispersions give rise to such beautiful patterns . It sometimes happens that for a certain thickness of the gasoline layer and angle of incidence a certain color is more pronounced or may be completely eliminated . That is when the reflected rays 1 and 2 are either completely in phase or completely out of phase . <p> Example 5 : To an observer looking at an angle that is almost straight down , the color of a thin film of gasoline appears bright yellow . The wave length of yellow light in vacuum is 580. nm . What are the first three possible thicknesses ( t 's ) of the gasoline film for this to happen ? <p> Solution : The assumption is that the incident rays are incident at small angles ( close to their respective normal lines ) . The wavelength of yellow light in gasoline ( n = 1.40 ) is ( ? gasoline = 580. nm / 1.40 = 413.5 nm ) . The observer sees bright yellow light . It means that both reflected rays 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that a distance difference equal to 2talong with a phase difference of 180 ( or ? /2 ) has caused the two reflected rays to be in phase again . We may write : <p> An air wedge is the space between two sheets of glass ( or transparent media ) that make a small angle with each other . As the figure shows , the actual air wedge is limited by the two solid lines . At the top line , light already in glass hits the glass-air interface for which the reflected ray 1 at A is in phase with the incident ray ( nglass &gt; nair ) . At the bottom edge of the wedge , light already in air hits the air-glass interface and the reflected ray 2 at B is ? /2 out of phase with respect to the incident ray AB ( nair &lt; nglass ) . In the air wedge , the ray travels two extra distances , one from A to B , and the other from B to C. This travel distance of 2t creates some phase difference between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phase difference ? /2 at B and the partial phase difference created by 2t give rise to possible constructive and destructive interference between typical rays1 and 2 . <p> Fig. 9 <p> Since the air gap varies linearly for different parallel incident rays , both constructive and destructive interferences occur for some of the incident rays . The result is the formation of bright and dark fringes as viewed by observers looking nearly straight down into the wedge.The condition for constructive interference is : <p> 2t + ? /2 = m ? , where m = 1 , 2 , 3 , ... , or <p> 2t + ? /2 = 1 ? , 2 ? , 3 ? , ... <p> Diffraction : <p> The bending of light waves at sharp edges and openings is called " diffraction . " From a tiny point source like S as shown , we expect to see a lit region on the wall only . <p> The following figures show the diffraction phenomenon . In Fig. 10 , light waves from source S arrive at opening AB.Each air molecule at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and becomes an independent source . It then sends waves out in all directions . The waves from these independent sources will have their constructive interferences in the R1 region with less constructive interferences in the semi-lit regions R2 and R3 . R2 and R3 regions contain bright and dark fringes and are not uniform.This is just to bring your attention to the interference of a large number of independent sources . <p> In Fig. 11 , the light passing a sharp edge at B has only one semi-lit region on the opposite wall . In both figures , it appears that sightline SB has bent its trajectory to form region R3 . <p> Fig. 10 <p> Fig. 11 <p> Interference of N Coherent Sources <p> Diffraction Grating : <p> When a large number of coherent sources interfere , interesting interference patterns form on a screen parallel to the sources . A diffraction grating is a thin film that some 5000 lines per inch is drawn on it by a special technique . When light passes through a diffraction grating , the grating becomes a place at which a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between every two lines on the grating becomes an independent source . The interference patterns of these sources can then be observed on the wall . In this case , there is a number of principal maxima ( bright fringes ) with many more weaker maxima in between . The mathematics for this study is more involved . Here we just suffice with showing the patterns and introducing the formula.The formula that calculates the angles corresponding to the mth principal maxima is similar to the one for Young 's double-slit experiment . The N coherent sources and the relative intensity of the principal maxima are shown below : <p> The formula that calculates the angles corresponding to the principal maxima is <p> where m = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , ... correspond to the central , 1st , 2nd , 3rd , and ... principal maxima . In most cases , the central , 1st , and 2nd principal fringes are bright enough to be seen , the rest are normally very dim . <p> Fig. 12 <p> As the above figure shows , the central maxima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , and third maxima on each side drop sharply . <p> Example 6 : A diffraction grating is positioned 120.0cm from a wall and forms interference fringes as a 635nm laser passes through it . The very closely-spaced lines on the grating ( film ) create many independent and coherent sources at the film as shown in the above figure . The distance between the second principal maxima to the central one measures 31.5cm . Find the number of lines per millimeter of the film . <p> To find the # of lines per mm , we need to reciprocate d. ; # of lines / mm= 1 / ( 5.00x10-3mm / line ) . <p> # of lines / mm=200 . <p> Chapter 37 Test Yourself 2 : <p> 1 ) Thin film interference occurs when ( a ) light passes through a thin plastic film ( b ) light passes through a photographic film ( c ) a thin layer of oil or gasoline is on another liquid like water.click here . <p> 2 ) The reason for thin film colorful patterns is ( a ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b ) the image of colorful objects reflected from the oil or gasoline layer ( c ) the interference of the reflected rays from the gasoline surface and the underlying water surface . <p> 3 ) At Point A , the refracted ray AB is ( a ) in phase with the incident ray IA ( b ) completely out of phase with the incident ray IA ( c ) partially out of phase with the incident ray IA . <p> 4 ) The first reflected ray A1 is ( a ) in phase with the incident ray IA ( b ) completely out of phase with the incident ray IA ( c ) partially out of phase with the incident ray IA.click here . <p> 5 ) The reasoning for Question 4 is that ( a ) gasoline ( n = 1.4 ) is optically harder than air ( n = 1.00 ) and the reflected ray A1 becomes completely out of phase ( b ) gasoline is optically softer than air , and the reflected ray A1 becomes completely out of phase ( c ) neither a nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ray BC is ( a ) in phase with the incident ray AB ( b ) partially out of phase with the incident ray AB ( c ) in completely out of phase with the incident ray AB.click here . <p> 7 ) The reasoning for Question 6 is that ( a ) water ( n = 1.00 ) is optically harder than gasoline ( n = 1.4 ) and the reflected ray BC becomes completely out of phase ( b ) water ( n = 1.00 ) is optically softer than gasoline ( n = 1.4 ) and the reflected ray BC stays in phase with ray AB ( c ) neither a nor b . <p> 8 ) At C , the refracted ray C2 is ( a ) in phase with BC ( b ) completely out of phase with BC ( c ) partially out of phase with BC.click here . <p> 9 ) If the thickness of the gasoline layer is such that it does not cause a phase difference , then rays IA and C2 will be ( a ) completely out of phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in phase . <p> 10 ) If the thickness of the gasoline layer is such that it does not cause a phase difference , then rays A1 and C2 will be ( a ) completely out of phase ( b ) partially out of phase ( c ) in phase.click here . <p> 11 ) If the thickness of the gasoline layer is such that it does not cause a phase difference , then rays A1 and C2 will be completely out of phase and destructive interference occurs in which case the gasoline surface appears dark for a person who is looking almost straight down onto it .

@@21347055 @1347055/ <p> In this chapter the " wave-like behavior " of light will be studied . There is a simple experiment thatverifies light is a wave . The experiment is called the " Young 's Double-slit experiment . " To learn about Young 's experiment , we need to have an understanding of " constructive and destructive interferences . " <p> Constructive and Destructive Interference of Waves : <p> Two waves with the same wavelength and frequency arriving simultaneously at a point in space or a medium can have an increased effect at that point or to some extent neutralizing effect . The two arriving waves interfere with each other . If they happen to be in phase at that point , the overall effect will be equal to the sum of the individual effects . This interference is called " constructive interference . " If they are out of phase at that point , the overall effect depends on how much out of phase one wave is relative to the other . The maximum neutralizing effect occurs when they are 180oout of phase that results in the greatest " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , show two extreme scenarios:1 ) the two waves are completely in Phase and 2 ) they are completely out of phase . <p> When completely in phase ( Fig. 1 ) , their amplitudes add up , and the resulting wave has an amplitude equal to A1 + A2 . <p> When completely out of phase ( Fig. 2 ) , their amplitudes subtract , and the resulting wave has an amplitude equal to A1 - A2.If the two 180o-out-of-phase interfering waves have also equal amplitudes at that point , they result in a vanished effect at that point . You have this experience with your cellular phone . Near buildings , your phone set can receive waves not only from a local cellular antenna , but also the reflection of the same wave from a nearby building . If you experience " call fading , " at a certain instant , it is because of the fact that the two waves coming to your cell phone are completely out of phase at where you are , at that instant . <p> In Fig. 2 , if the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then they cancel each other and A = 0 . <p> Coherence : <p> Two or more sources are calledcoherentif not only they have thesame frequency and thesame wavelength , but also they arein phase . <p> Young 's Double-Slit Experiment : <p> Suppose you have a small rectangular box one side of which is made of a thin sheet of metal with two parallel and very closely spaced slits cut in it . Also , suppose that there is a bright light source ( a point source ) inside the box such that light can emerge from the box through those two slits only . We further suppose that the light source is located on the perpendicular bisector of the two slits . This means that the light source is equidistant from the slits . If you are in a dark room and the only way light can come out of the box is via the two slits , you expect to see two bright lines on the wallparallel to the slits.To your surprise , you will see several bright light lines on the wall ! The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wave . Young was the first to explain this phenomenon . <p> Explanation : <p> The slits , ( being equidistant from the light source in the box ) , receive light waves from a single source and become coherentsources . Each slit becomes an independent source . These two independent and coherent sources send out waves in all directions . To the right of the sources ( slits ) , in Fig. 3 , there are many points at which the waves coming from these two sources are in phase and add up constructively . There are also many point at which the arriving waves interfere destructively . Wherever they combine constructively , they form a bright streak of light that Young called it a " bright fringe . " Wherever they combine destructively , they form a dark streak that he called it a " dark fringe . " The fringes pattern is shown below : <p> Figure 3 <p> Bois where thecentral bright fringeis formed . As shown in Fig. 3 , atBo , light waves coming from S1and S2are in phase and interfere constructively to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase at Bo is that S1Bo = S2Bo.The distance difference is zero or ( 0 ? ) . Each of S1Bo &amp; S2Bo accommodate the same number of wavelengths ( ? ' s ) in it . Since the waves that leave S1 and S2 are in phase , they will arrive at Bo , in phase as well . <p> AtD1aboveBo , a dark fringe is formed . Light coming from S2travels a longer distance than the light coming from S1 . The distance difference must be ( 1/2 ) ? that makes the two waves 180oout of phasethere . <p> AtB1above D1 , a bright fringe is formed . Light coming from S2 travels a longer distance than light coming from S1 . The distance difference must be exactly 2 ( ? /2 ) that makes the two waves in phase there . <p> AtD2aboveB1 , a dark fringe is formed . Light coming from S2travels a longer distance than the light coming from S1 . The distance difference must be 3 ( ? /2 ) that makes the two waves 180oout of phase there . <p> AtB2above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from S2 travels a longer distance than light coming from S1 . The distance difference must be exactly 4 ( ? /2 ) that makes the two waves in phase there . <p> The above repeating arguments can go on for as many bright and dark fringes as are made.The same argument is also true for the fringes belowBo . <p> Conclusion:From the above reasoning , one may conclude that it is the distance difference that is important and that <p> 1 ) for a bright fringe to form , the distance difference must be an even multiple of ? /2 , and <p> 2 ) for a dark fringe to form , the distance difference must be an odd multiple of ? /2 . <p> In practice , S1and S2 are made very close together , often much closer than one tenth of a millimeter . The distance between the two coherent sources is shown byd . The screen is generally placed at least 1m from the slits . The two rays emerging from the two slits are very closely packed . The angles that , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the first bright fringe , the angle is labeled ? 1 . The angle that nearly both S2B2and S1B2 make with the central line is labeled ? 2 . See Fig , 4 . The fringes below the central line are not shown due to symmetry . <p> Figure 4 <p> Young 's Formula for the angle of the n-th Bright Fringe : <p> It is easy to derive a formula for the angle corresponding to then-th bright fringe.The formula relates ? n , d , and ? , the wavelength of the light used . The formula is : <p> wheren = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , .... In the proof and in Fig. 5 , note that the two angles that are labeled ? nare equal because their sides are perpendicular to each other . <p> Let 's magnify thecircled area in the above figure only for the n-th bright fringe for which the distance difference is S2 A = S2 Bn-S1Bn=n ? . <p> In the right triangle S1S2A , the sine of angle ? nis : sin ? n= S2A / S1S2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringes as expected . <p> Using Bn , the n-th bright fringe on the wall , as the center of the circle for which S1Bn is the radius , arc S1A can be drawn to find the distance differenceS2 A between S1Bn and S2Bn . <p> Note that S1Bnand S2Bnare so close that arc S1A becomes perpendicular to both of them making S1S2A a right triangle . <p> Fig. 5 <p> Example 1 : The 3rd bright fringe in a double slit experiment makes a 2.4oangle with respect to the central line . The wavelength of the monochromatic light used is 480nm .

From such measurements ? n , the angle corresponding to thatn-thfringe can then be calculated using a tangent ratio as shown below : <p> Figure 6 <p> Example 3 : The distance between the 4th bright fringe to the central fringe ( on the screen ) in a double-slit experiment is 23.0mm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance between the slits is 0.560mm , determine the wavelength and frequency of the light used . <p> Solution : tan ? n =yn/D ; tan ? n = 23.0/7520 ; ? n= 0.175o . <p> sin ? n=n ? /d ; sin0.175o= 4 ? /0.560x10-3m ; ? =428x10-9m = 428nm . <p> c = f ? ; f = c / ? ; f = ( 3.00x108m/s ) /428x10-9m = 7.00x1014Hz . <p> Example 4 : If in a double-slit experiment , the slits spacing is 5.00x10-6m , and light of wavelength 655nm is used , how many bright fringes do form on each side of the central bright fringe ? <p> Solution:sin ? n=n ? /d ; sin ? **25;693;TOOLONG ; sin ? n= 0.131n . <p> Givingndifferent values , we may determine the number of possible fringes as in the following chart : <p> n <p> sin ? n <p> ? n <p> As can be seen , giving different values tonin sin ? n= 0.131n , results in7possible angles at which bright fringes occur . <p> Forn= 8 , we do n't get a fringe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 1 . <p> An easier wayto do this is to setsin ? n=1 .

As shown in Fig. 7 , the phenomenon is caused by the interference of the immediately reflected rays at A and those reflected at B. <p> The goal is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer 's eyes are in phase or out of phase . There are two deciding factors at work here : <p> 1 ) the refraction indices of air , gasoline , and water <p> 2 ) the thickness of the gasoline layer itself . <p> 1 ) The refraction index effect : <p> Ray IA hits the gasoline surface ( higher n than air ) and the reflected Ray 1 is 180o or ? /2 out of phase relative to IA . <p> AB , the refracted ray , is in phase with IA.BC is reflected at B at a lower n of water compared to gasoline . BC remains in phase with AB and therefore in phase with IA.C2 is also a refracted ray and is in phase with BC , AB , and IA . <p> Result:Ray 1 is ? /2 out of phase with IA , but Ray 2 is in Phase with IA ; thus , Rays 1 and 2 are out of phase by ? /2 and the observer sees the gasoline surface to be dark.This conclusion could be wrong ! <p> Figure 7 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but reflection at B that is at an optically softer medium occurs without a phase difference . <p> 2 ) The Film Thickness Effect : What we discussed under 1 is only half of the story ! The thickness of the film itself is another deciding factor as to whether Rays 1 and 2 will be in phase or not . We will examine a few thicknesses to get the idea . <p> i ) If thickness t of the film is ? /4 . AB + BCaccommodate 2 ( ? /4 ) = ? /2 . This means that the AB+BC trajectory itself causes another ? /2 phase difference and Rays 1 and 2 become in phase as seen by the observer.The observer sees the gasoline surface to be bright ! <p> ii ) If thickness t of the film is ? /2 . AB + BCaccommodate 2 ( ? /2 ) = ? . This means that the AB+BC trajectory does not cause any phase difference and Rays 1 and 2 will still be out of phase.The observer sees the gasoline surface to be dark . <p> iii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /4 . AB + BCaccommodate 2 ( 3 ? /4 ) = 3 ? /2 . This means that the AB+BC trajectory itself causes another ? /2 phase difference and Rays 1 and 2 become in phase as seen by the observer . The observer sees the gasoline surface to be bright and so on ... . <p> It is now clear that if the film thickness t is an odd multiple of ? /4 , both exit rays will be in phase and the observer sees the gasoline surface bright ; therefore , the condition to have bright fringes is : <p> t = ( 2k-1 ) ? /4where k = 1 , 2 , 3 ... <p> Note that ? is the wavelength of light in the film 's medium ( material ) . <p> The Wavelength and Refraction Index : <p> Figure 8 <p> Example 5:The refraction index of air is 1.00 and that of gasoline is 1.46 . The wavelength of a certain green light in air is 532nm . Find its wavelength in gasoline . <p> Solution : Using n1 ? 1 = n2 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 505nm . <p> Summary : <p> In brief , thereflected Ray 1is 180oout of phasewith respectto IA . TheReflected Ray 2is alsosomewhat out of phase with respect to IA.This means thatin most cases reflected Rays 1 and 2 are somewhat out of phase . The degree of being out of phase can vary from zero to 180odepending on the angle of incidence and the thickness of the film . We should not forget that white light is also a mixture of so many different colors ( wavelengths ) for which angles of refraction differ and therefore the amount that each color is out of phase is also different . The combination of a large number of reflections , refractions , and dispersions give rise to such beautiful patterns on soap or gasoline films . It sometimes happens that for a certain thickness of the gasoline layer and angle of incidence a certain color is more pronounced or completely eliminated . That is when the reflected Rays 1 and 2 are either completely in phase or completely out of phase . <p> Example 6 : To an observer looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a thin film of gasoline appears bright yellow.The wavelength of yellow light in air is 580nm . What are the first three possible thicknesses ( t 's ) of the gasoline film for this to happen ? <p> Solution:The assumption is that the incident rays are at small angles ( close to their respective normal lines ) . The wavelength of yellow light in gasoline is <p> n1 ? 1 = n2 ? 2 ; 1.00(580nm) = 1.40 ? gas . ; ? gas . = 414nm . <p> The observer sees bright yellow light . It means that both reflected Rays 1&amp;2 are in phase and interfere constructively . The condition t = ( 2k-1 ) ? /4 must be met . We may write : <p> Using <p> t = ( 2k-1 ) ? /4 <p> where k = 1 , 2 , 3 ... <p> Case <p> k <p> t = ( 2k-1 ) ? /4 <p> 1 <p> 1 <p> t = 1 ? /4 = 1(414nm) /4 = 104nm <p> 2 <p> 2 <p> t = 3 ? /4 = 3(414nm)/4 = 310nm <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5(414nm)/4 = 518nm <p> Air Wedge : <p> An air wedge is the space between two sheets of glass ( or transparent media ) that make a small angle with each other . As Fig. 9 shows , theactual air wedgeis limited by thetwo solid lines . At the top line , light already in glass hits the glass-air interface for which the reflected ray 1 atAis in phase with the incident ray ( nglass&gt; nair ) . At the bottom edge of the wedge , light already in air hits the air-glass interface and the reflected ray 2 atBis ? /2out of phase with respect to the incident rayAB ( nair &lt; nglass ) . In the air wedge , the ray travels two extra distances , one from A to B , and the other from B to C. This travel distance of2tcreates some phase difference between the final Rays 1 and 2 . <p> Figure 9 <p> The combination of the the ? /2 that occurs atB and the partial phase difference created by2tgive rise to possible constructive and destructive interference between typical rays1 and 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident rays , both constructive and destructive interferences occur for some of the incident rays . The result is the formation of bright and dark fringes as viewed by observers looking nearly straight down into the wedge.The condition for bright fringes ( constructive interference ) is : <p> 2t + ? /2 = k ? where k = 1 , 2 , 3 , ... or , 2t + ? /2 = 1 ? , 2 ? , 3 ? , ... <p> Example 7:Show that the above result of 2t + ? /2 = k ? is the same as the previous result of t = ( 2k - 1 ) ? /4 . <p> Solution : To be done by students . <p> Diffraction : <p> Diffraction is the bending of light upon passing through small openings or by sharp edges . Diffraction occurs in ocean waves as well . Actually , it is beneficial to first examine the diffraction concept with ocean ( machanical ) waves arriving at a jetty . One role of a jetty where boats are parked is to separate the body of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ocean . That way the parked boats receive much weaker ( in amplitude ) waves and do not bump into each other . Each jetty has a small opening to the ocean compared to its body of water . See Fig. 10 . The opening is made large enough to allow all size boats to comfortably pass through ; however , its size is much smaller than the jetty itself . <p> Figure 10 <p> As shown in Fig. 10 , the wavefronts arriving from the ocean hit the jetty like almost straight lines one after each other . See Remark 1 in Fig. 10 . The huge rocks bordering the jetty break the arriving fronts except at the opening . The straight fronts make the lump of water at the jetty 's opening oscillateup and down accordingly . The good size lump of water at the opening becomes an independent source that sends waves in all directions especially into the jetty . That lump of water being the originator of new waves is at the center of this wave generator . The new waves center is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight fronts anymore . The are very curved . See Remark 2 in Fig. 10 . If they are given a huge area to propagate in , they become more straight similar to the ones that keep coming from the ocean . The new waves into the jetty propagate in different directions compared to the waves arriving from the ocean side . For an observer looking down from a helicopter into the jetty , it appears that the ocean waves bend when they pass through the opening . The observer will call this phenomenon the " diffraction " of the ocean waves . The same concept applies to light waves as they pass through small openings or by sharp edges . <p> When light waves arrive at an opening or an aperture , each point of the opening becomes an independent source sending wavelets in all directions . The wavelets emerging from such independent sources interfere at different points of the region past the aperture causing interference patterns due to diffraction on a wall or a screen ( Fig. 11 ) . If the aperture or the hole that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light , the diffraction pattern will not be very clear and approximates the shape of the aperture ( hole ) itself ; however , if the opening 's diameter is relatively small ( as much as a number of wavelengths ) , sharper diffraction patterns are formed . <p> Figure 11 <p> The diffraction pattern ( on the wall ) of light passed through a small aperture . <p> Fresnel Diffraction : <p> When either the source or the screen is near an aperture or an obstruction ( a sharp edge ) , the wavefronts are spherical ( not straight ) and the diffraction pattern they form is quite complex . This is called " Fresnel Diffraction . " One case is shown in Fig. 12 . <p> In this case some light enters the region of geometrical shadow . <p> The curve shows how the intensity and width of the bright fringes change . <p> Figure 12 <p> Fraunhofer Diffraction : <p> Fraunhofer diffraction is one in which source is far from the slit or aperture . The wavefronts arriving at the slit or aperture are almost like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the screen depends on the aperture diameter or width , a . Note that a single slit has a width only and not a diameter . If the aperture diameter or the single slit width is large ( several times the wavelength ? , the lit area over the screen fairly defines the shape of the aperture or the slit . If the aperture diameter or the slit width is small and comparable to the wavelength of the light used , the diffraction patterns will be more pronounced or have better contrast as shown in Fig. 13 . <p> Figure 13 <p> Interference of N Coherent Sources <p> Diffraction Grating : <p> When a large number of coherent sources interfere , interesting interference patterns form on a screen parallel to the sources . Adiffraction gratingis a thin clear film that some 5000 lines per inch ( some 200 lines per mm ) is scraped on it by a special technique . See Fig. 14 . If a narrow laser beam of 1mm in diameter is incident on such grating ( normal to it ) , the laser beam will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , it is like having 200 coherent sources that each send light in all directions past the film ( grating ) to interfere . That is the trick to make N coherent sources so close to each other . The space in between every two neighboring lines on the grating that allows laser waves to pass through becomes an independent source . The interference patterns of these coherent sources can then be observed on the wall ( screen ) . The diffraction pattern is comprised of a number of principal maxima ( bright fringes ) with many more weaker maxima in between . <p> The weaker maxima in between the principal maxima are very difficult to see . Those are very weak in intensity . The mathematics for this study is more involved . Here we just suffice with showing the patterns and introducing the formula.The formula that calculates the angles corresponding to the n-th principal maxima is similar to the one for Young 's double-slit experiment . TheN coherent sourcesand therelative intensity of their principal maximaare shown below : <p> The formula that calculates the angles corresponding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2 , 3 , ... ... correspond to the central , 1st , 2nd , 3rd , and ... principal maxima . In most cases , the central , 1st , 2nd , and 3rd principal fringes are bright enough to be seen , the rest are normally dim . <p> Figure 14 <p> As Fig. 14 shows , the central maxima is very bright . The intensities of the first and second maxima on each side drop sharply . Suppose only 202 lines are involved in making only 201 coherent sources . All 201 sources will have a contribution to the central maximum . The reason is symmetry . The very middle source is the 101-th source . The beam from this source will be exactly along the centerline . Sources 100 and 102 on the grating will be equidistant from the center point on the wall and will interfere constructively . Same is true for pairs ( 99 &amp;103 ) , ( 98 &amp;104 ) , ( 97 &amp;105 ) , and so on . This means that all 201 sources are in phase ( interfering constructively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why and how the central principal maxima is the brightest . There is no guarantee that all sources will be in phase at the 1st , 2nd , or 3rd principal maximum on either side of the central one.In fact a much less number of sources are in phase at the 1st principal maximum and a much much less number of sources are in phase at the 2nd principal maximum . For 10,000 coherent source , all 10,000 are in phase at the center ( n = 0 ) , 250 are in phase at the 1st maximum ( n = 1 ) , and only 16 are in phase at the 2nd maximum ( n = 2 ) . That 's why the intensity of light drops so sharply for subsequent principal maxima . <p> Example 7 : A diffraction grating is positioned 120.0cm from a wall and forms interference fringes ( pattern ) as a 635nm laser beam passes through it .

This is not the case for a real voltage source or battery . As the current demand from a battery increases , the voltage across its terminals drops more and more from its nominal voltage . This is simply because of the battery'sinternal resistance , rthat becomes like a consumer in series with the external resistance ( or load ) . <p> Suppose your car 's battery shows 12.65 volts when it is not in use and you just measure the voltage across its terminals with a voltmeter . If you turn your car 's ceiling light on and measure the voltage across the battery again , you may measure something like 12.58 volts . If you turn the headlights on , you may measure 12.2 volts . The more current a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its terminals occurs . When an external resistance R ( load ) is connected to a battery of nominal voltage Vand internal resistance r , we may write Ohm 's law as <p> Vnom = RI + rI or , Vnom = ( R + r ) I , or I = Vnom / ( R+r ) <p> where I is the current .

The reason is the change in the speed of light . The speed of light in vacuum is 300,000 km/s , in water 225,000 km/s , and in glass 200,000 km/s . Different transparent media pose different light transmission properties . It is the change in the speed of light that makes light bend as it enters a different medium . <p> A good analogy to this optical phenomenon is when a car enters a gravel road from asphalt . If the gravel-asphalt borderline is straight and perpendicular ( - ) to the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue straight but at a reduced speed due to more friction offered by gravel . If the gravel-asphalt borderline is slanted as shown in Fig. 2 , then the car pulls to the side that offers more friction to the tire on that side . <p> Fig. 2 : Front tires face unequal frictional forces . Car slows down and pulls to the right . One of the front tires is on gravel , the other still on asphalt . <p> Light behaves in a similar manner . When a ray of light is incident perpendicularly on the interface between two transparent media , it enters the new medium without bending ; however at a different speed . Fig. 3 . <p> When light crosses the interface of two media in a slanted way , bending ( breaking ) of light or refraction occurs . Fig. 4 . <p> Fig.3Fig. 4 <p> In physics and engineering , normal line means perpendicular line . For practical reasons , angles of incidence ( i ) and refraction ( r ) are measured with respect to the normal line ( N ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and ( r ) are measured with respect to line NN , the normal to the interface . <p> Refraction Index <p> The refraction index , n , of a transparent medium is defined as the ratio of speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in that medium . The formula is <p> where the speed of light c = 300,000 km/s and v is the speed of light in the desired medium . The refraction indices for water and glass are therefore , <p> Based on this definition , the refraction index of vacuum is 1 because <p> This is a constant by definition and may be used to any desired number of significant figures . <p> Air at normal atmospheric pressure is very dilute and has a refraction index of 1.00 very close to that of vacuum . <p> nair= 1.00 <p> Snells Law of Refraction : <p> The Snells law simply relates angles i and rto the refraction indices of the two media n1 and n2 .

That means the angle it makes with the normal line in water . <p> Also find the angle of deviation ( D ) . <p> Solution:n1 = 1.00 , n2 = 1.33 , <p> i = 90.0 - 42.0 = 48.0 , r = ? <p> Using Snells law results in : n1sin i = n2 sin r , <p> 1.00 sin ( 48.0 ) = 1.33 sin(r) ; sin(r) = sin ( 48.0 ) / 1.33 <p> r = 34.0 ; D = i - r = 48.0 - 34.0 = 14.0 . <p> Procedure : <p> Click on the following applet : LONG ... . The applet shows a ray of light ( Laser-like ) coming from the top left corner . At the point of incidence on the interface it is partially reflected and partially refracted .

@@21347075 @1347075/ <p> Before writing the statement for Gauss 's law , the concept of electric flux must be understood . <p> Electric Flux : <p> If you hold a ring horizontally under rain , maximum number of rain drops pass through it ( 1 ) . If you hold it vertically , no rain drop passes through it ( 4 ) . If you hold it at some angle , some rain drops but not the maximum possible pass thorough it ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . See figures shown below . To show the orientation of the ring in space , it is better to measure the angle its normal makes with the vertical direction . Normal to the ring means the line that is perpendicular to its plane . The amount of rain passing through the ring is called the flux of rain through the ring . In each case the flux of rain through the ring is different . <p> Electric field lines may also be viewed as rain lines if we are talking about a downward electric field . The heavier the downpour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Surface : <p> The electric flux Fe of a uniform electric field E through a loop of area A is defined as Fe = E A cos ? where ? is the angle between the field lines and the normal vector , n , to the plane of the loop.An appropriate figure for this formula is shown below : <p> Note that if E is uniform that means it is not a function of space ( x , y , or z ) , the calculation of flux FE = E A cos ? is easy . If E is not uniform , such as the electric field around a point charge , then since E varies with x , y , or z , differentials and integrals must be used . <p> The figure on the right shows the flux of a uniform field E through a ring of area A. <p> FE means electric flux . <p> Symbol Fis pronounced " phi " . The SI unit for electric flux is Nm2/Coul . As can be visualized from the above picture , if the loopis turned such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines , ? becomes zero and the loop becomes vertical and the number of electric field lines passing through it horizontally becomes maximum . If ? is zero , then cos ? = 1 that has its maximum value makes FE maximum , or FE = E A. If the loop is turned such that ? = 90 , the loop becomes horizontal and no field lines pass through it that makes the flux Fe= 0because cos90 = 0 . The above figure shows the electric flux of a uniform electric field . <p> Example 1 : A student is holding a 36cm by 15cm rectangular piece of cardboard such that its surface makes a 60.0 angle with an existing upward 2500N/C electric filed as shown . If the intensity of the electric field remains constant over the entire surface of the cardboard , calculate the electric flux through the cardboard . <p> Solution : A = ( 0.36m ) ( 0.15m ) = 0.054 m2 <p> The angle that E makes with n is shown by ? in the figure . If n is normal to the cardboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are right 30.0 degrees . Thus ? = 30.0 , and <p> F =EAcos ? = ( 2500N/C ) ( 0.054m2 ) cos(30.0) <p> F = 120Nm2/C . <p> Example 2 : A 32-nC point charge is at the center of a sphere 80.0cm in diameter . Calculate ( a ) the magnitude of the electric field at any point on its surface , ( b ) the angle that the electric field at a point on the surface makes with normal to the surface at that point , and ( c ) the electric flux that passes through the entire surface of the sphere . <p> Solution : Since the point charge is at the center of the sphere , it is equidistant to all point of its surface . This makes the magnitude of the electric field the same at any of the points on its surface although the directions are different . Therefore , the solution to Part ( a ) is <p> ( a ) E = kq/r2 = 9.00x109x32x10-9/ ( 0.40m ) 2 N/C = 1800N/C . <p> ( b ) The angle that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sphere . Why ? Since the point charge is at the center , each field line is along a radius . At any selected tiny area element , the normal line is also along the radius drawn to that element . This makes E and n parallel to each other at each point on the sphere . Thus ? =0 and cos ? = 1 at any point on the surface of the sphere . <p> ( c ) With E being constant in magnitude , and cos ? = 1 for all points , the total electric flux becomes : <p> Example 3 : If the sphere in Example 2 is placed at the center of a cube that is 1.00m on each side , what flux does pass through each side of the cube ? <p> Solution : The solution is left to the students because of simplicity . <p> The electric Flux of a Non-uniform Electric Field : <p> The following figure shows the field lines of a non-uniform electric field passing through a certain surface area . Five field lines are shown along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... ? A5 . At each segment ? Ai , field has a different direction determined by its Eivector . Of course , the orientation of each area segment ? Ai is determined by its own normal vector ni . The small flux ? Fi through each ? Ai is <p> ? Fi=Ei ? Ai cos ? i <p> ( 1 ) <p> Angles ? i are not shown in order to keep the figure more clear . As can be seen , in general , the angle between n1 and E1 is not equal to angles between n2 and E2 , n3 and E3 , and so on . <p> Recall the definition of the dot product of two vectors A and B making an angle of a with each other that is A+B = ABcosa where bold letters denote vector quantities and regular letters their magnitudes . This reads as : The dot product of vectors A and B is equal to magnitude A times magnitude B times the cosine of the angle in between . Equation 1 is exactly the definition of dot product . Actually the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The results of dot product is always a scalar . Equation 1 may be written as : <p> ? Fi = Ei+ ? Ai ( 2 ) <p> In Equation 2 , because of the symbol dot ( + ) , Eiand ? Aiare shown in bold letters meaning that they are vectors . The solution to ( 2 ) is ( 1 ) where magnitudes Ei and ? Ai are multiplied by each other times the cosine of angle in between . For simplicity , we will use ( 2 ) as the flux through a typical small area segment . <p> To calculate the total flux F through surface S , all such ? Fi ( five of which are shown ) must be added . The sum is <p> F S ? Fi=S Ei+ ? Ai(3) <p> F E1+ ? A1 + E2+ ? A2 + + + + + Em+ ? Am ( 4 ) <p> where m is the number of are segments that covers surface S. <p> To find an exact value for F , the electric flux , the number of tiny area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach 0 ; in other words , ? Aimust be replaced with dA and consequently S must be replaced by ? . Equation ( 3 ) becomes <p> F = ? E + dA ( 5 ) <p> In this integral , the normal vector n is embedded in dA because A is shown in bold letter emphasizing its vector nature . Note that by defining n , the vector normal to the area segment , we are giving each area segment a direction that determines its orientation in space . The symbol dot ( + ) includes cosine of the angle in the product . <p> Gauss 's Law : <p> Gauss 's law states that the net flux through a closed surface is equal to Q/e0 where Q is the net charge entrapped in that closed surface . Another version of this statement is : <p> The flux of charge Q through a closed surface is equal to Q/e0 . A sphere , a cube , or an inflated nylon balloon of any shape is treated as a closed surface . If charge Q is entrapped inside any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed , the total electric flux by the charge through that closed surface is equal to Q/e0 . In other words , we may write from ( 5 ) <p> ( 6 ) <p> This can be easily verified for a point charge Q placed at the center of a sphere of radius R. The proof is as follows : <p> Since the point charge is at the sphere 's center , all field lines are exactly radial lines . Any selected area element dA has its normal vector n also along its radial line . This makes E and n parallel ( coincide ) at each point or element on the the sphere 's surface and thus ? =0 and cos ? = 1 . <p> Applying the closed surface integral , we get : <p> and Gauss 's law is verified.IfQ is not placed at C , then E and n will make different nonzero angles with each other at different points ( or selected area elements ) and the integral will not be that easy to evaluate ; however , the final outcome will be the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q/e0 again . The reason is that the number of electric field lines that Q can generate is limited to its amount , Q , and the permittivity of the medium , e0 , regardless of the shape of the enclosing surfaceandthe location and distribution of Q in the closed surface . What was your answer to Example 3 ? <p> Example 4 : A cube 8.0cm on each side has 15nC of point charge at its center . Find ( a ) the net flux through it , and ( b ) the net flux through each side of it . <p> Solution : The net flux through a closed surface is independent of the shape of that surface . Using Gauss 's law , the integral is equal to Q/e0 . We may write : <p> ( a ) Net flux = Q/e0 = ( 15nC ) / 8.85x10-12 C2/ ( Nm2 ) = 1700 Nm2/C . <p> ( b ) Since the point charge is at the center of the cube , the flux through each side is 1/6 of the total flux due to symmetry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 280 Nm2/C . <p> Gaussian Surface : <p> Gaussian surface is an imaginary surface that we assume around a point charge or any charge distribution . Assuming such imaginary surface is helpful in determining the way the electric field varies around a given charge distribution . Of course , any selected Gaussian surface must surround or entrap the charge distribution under study . That way the total flux is known , simply Q/e0 . If good symmetry exists in the charge distribution , and also a symmetrical Gaussian surface is selected , surface calculation becomes easy , and that facilitates the calculation of the unknown electric field . <p> Important Points in Gaussian Surface Selection : <p> 1 ) Use symmetry . <p> 2 ) Choose a Gaussian surface that is either parallel to the normal , n , or perpendicular to it . <p> 3 ) If E is parallel to n over a certain area , then the magnitude of E is constant for that portion of the area , and that makes the integration easier . If E is perpendicular to n over a certain area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area . <p> Example 5 : Determine the electric field E ( a ) outside and ( b ) inside of a spherical shell that has charge Q evenly distributed over its surface . <p> Solution : ( a ) E outside of the shell : <p> A uniformly charged shell is shown on the right with a spherical Gaussian surface selected around it such that the two spheres are concentric . Choosing the Gaussian surface concentric with the shell helps making E parallel n over the entire surface . That makes the E magnitude constant and out of the Gaussian integral . We may write : <p> ? cs E + dA = Q/e0 ( cs means over closed surface ) <p> or , E ? dA = Q/e0 , or E(4pr2) = Q/e0 , or <p> E = Q / 4pe0r2 , or E = kQ/r2 ; Note : k=1/ ( 4pe0 ) <p> ( b ) E inside the shell : <p> Looking at the imaginary or Gaussian surface assumed inside the shell , we see that there is no charge entrapped in it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to zero . <p> ? cs E + dA = Q/e0 = 0 , or E ? dA = 0 , or <p> E(4pr2) = 0 . Since r ? 0 ; therefore , E = 0 . <p> The electric field inside the shell is zero . <p> The graph of E(r) for the charged shell is shown on the right . <p> Example 6 : An empty thin metal sphere with a diameter of 8.0cm is given 49nC of electric charge . The sphere has an insulator mount and is far from other objects and charges . Determine the electric field at points that are ( a ) 3.0cm , ( b ) 7.0cm , and ( c ) 70.0cm from its center . <p> Example 7 : Determine the electric field E ( a ) outside and ( b ) inside of a solid sphere that has charge Q evenly distributed throughout its volume . <p> Solution : ( a ) E outside the solid sphere : <p> A uniformly charged solid sphere is shown on the right with a spherical Gaussian surface selected around it such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface concentric with the solid sphere helps making E parallel n over the entire surface . The calculation is similar to that of a shell ( Example 5 ) because the entrapped charge is the same as well as the Gaussian surface . <p> ? cs E + dA = Q/e0 ( cs means over closed surface ) <p> or , E ? dA = Q/e0 , or E(4pr2) = Q/e0 , or <p> E = Q / 4pe0r2 , or E = kQ/r2 . <p> ( b ) E inside the solid sphere : <p> The amount of entrapped charge in this case depends on the radius of the Gaussian surface . If r = 0 , the entrapped charge is also zero , and therefore the field is zero at the center . If r = R , the entrapped charge is the entire charge Q. For any 0 &lt; r &lt; R , The fraction of Q that is entrapped in the Gaussian surface is proportional to <p> ( 4/3pr3 ) / ( 4/3pR3 ) = r3/R3 . This means that for a Gaussian surface of radius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes : <p> ? cs E + dA = r3/R3 Q/e0 or , E(4pr2) = r3/R3 Q/e0 , or <p> E = kQ/R3 r . Since kQ/R3 is a constant , E varies linearly with r inside the solid sphere . The graph of E(r) for the charged solid sphere is shown on the right . <p> Example 8 : A solid sphere of radius 3.00cm is made of plastic and has -15nC of electric charge uniformly distributed throughout its volume . Find ( a ) the magnitude of the electric field at 1.50cm from its center . ( b ) At what radial distance from its surface the field strength magnitude is equal to the field strength you found in Part ( a ) ? <p> Solution : The sphere is solid and uniformly charged ; therefore , the use of formula E = kQ/R3 r for its internal field is appropriate . <p> ( a ) E = ( 9x109 ) ( 15x10-9 ) / ( 0.03m ) 3 ( 0.015m ) = 75,000 N/C . <p> . ( b ) The field magnitude outside the sphere is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kQ/r2 or , <p> 75000 = ( 9x109 ) ( 15x10-9 ) /r2 . Solving for r , r = .042m = 4.2cm . The distance from the surface of the sphere is therefore <p> 4.2cm 3.00cm = 1.2cm . <p> Example 9 : Determine the magnitude of the electric field at a distance r from an infinite line of charge with a linear charge density of ? C/m . <p> Solution : For an infinite line of charge , an appropriate Gaussian surface is a cylinder of length L as shown . Note that to have symmetry , the line of charge must be the axis of symmetry of the cylinder . The Gaussian surface here has 3 segments : one cylindrical surface S1 and two circular surfaces S2 and S3 . Since the line is infinitely long , at any point around the line , the direction of the electric field becomes perpendicular to the line itself , and therefore perpendicular to S1 as well . For S1 , E and n are parallel and therefore , the part of Gaussian integral over S1 becomes : <p> ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S1dA = E(2prL) ( a ) <p> For surface segments S2 and S3 , E and n are perpendicular and therefore , <p> ? S2 E + dA + ? S3 E + dA = 0 ( b ) <p> Adding ( a ) and ( b ) results in <p> ? cs E + dA = E(2prL) = Q/e0 ( c ) <p> Since ? is the linear charge density of the line , the amount of charge entrapped inside the cylinder is Q= ? L. Substituting for Q , Equation ( c ) becomes : <p> E(2prL) = ? L/e0 or , E = ? /2pe0r or , E = ( 2k ? ) /r . <p> Example 10 : The electric field at a distance of 3.0cm from a long line of charge is 240N/C . Calculate the linear charge density of the line . <p> Example 11 : Determine the magnitude of the electric field at a distance r from an infinite plane uniformly charged with a surface charge density of sC/m2 . <p> Solution : A suitable Gaussian surface for this case is a cylinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite plane of charge has electric field equally on both sides of it . The plane itself is the plane of symmetry . The bottom and top of the cylinder are adjusted to be equidistant from the plane ; therefore , E1 and E2 have the same magnitudes though different directions . With this choice n1 is parallel to E1 and n2 parallel to E2 . This makes the Gaussian integral easy for the top and bottom circular surfaces . Since E3 is perpendicular to n3 ; therefore , the flux through the cylinder 's side surface is zero that makes it even easier . The Gaussian integral for this cylinder becomes : <p> ? cs E + dA = ? S1E1dA + ? S2E2dA + ? S3E3dA <p> = E1A + E2A+ 0 = sA/e0 or , 2EA = sA/e0 or , E = s/2e0 <p> This shows that the electric field around an infinite plane of charge does not vary with distance from the plane . the reason is the lack of presence of r in the derived formula . Surfaces S1 and S2 can be selected at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same formula : E = s/2e0 . <p> Example 12 : The electric field at a distance of 60.0cm from a large sheet of charge is 3750N/C . Calculate ( a ) the charge density , and ( b ) the charge distributed over every 125m2 of this large plane , and ( c ) the field strength at 120.0cm from the plane . <p> Solution : Using the above formula , the surface charge density may be calculated as <p> Gauss 's Law Applied to Conductors : In general , the direction of electric field at any point on a surface charge whether flat or curved is perpendicular to the surface at that point . If the surface is flat and large ( theoretically infinite ) , the field lines being perpendicular to the surface become parallel to each other and make the field uniform on each side of a sheet of infinite size . Note that by a sheet of charges , we mean electric charges that are distributed over a non-conducting ( insulator ) surface . The figures emphasizing this argument are shown in Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are distributed over an infinite flat conducting surface , they all gather on one side and double the electric field strength on that side to become E=s/e0 . The field doubles compared to a non-conducting sheet because all charges gather on one side of the conductor . Part ( b ) of the above figure shows the field lines for an infinite flat conductoras well as a curved ( closed surface ) conductor . The proof of the formula in ( b ) , E=s/e0 , is left as a problem for students . The proof is similar to Example 11 with field lines passing through the top circular area only . <p> Cavity in a Conductor : <p> The figure on the right shows a conductor that has a cavity inside . If a charge like +Q exists inside the cavity , its effect appears on the outer surface of the conductor as if +Q was distributed over it . The reason is that charge +Q attracts as much as -Q on the inner surface of the cavity ( conductor ) and repels as much as +Q onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verified by applying a Gaussian surface . Since within the material of the conductor , the electric field is zero , if we assume a Gaussian surface around the cavity as shown , the net flux through this surface must also be zero . This requires a charge distribution of -Q on the inner wall of the cavity . Since the conductor is neutral to begin with , its external surface accumulates +Q . <p> Problems : <p> 1 ) A cube 20cm on each side has a 55-nC charge at its center and -25nC of charge placed on the outer edge of one of its sides . The cube is then placed inside a sphere of radius 20cm . Calculate the net flux out of the sphere . <p> 2 ) A -6.0nC point charge is placed at one corner of a cube 10.0cm on each side . Calculate the net flux through each side of it . <p> 3 ) A -9.0nC point charge is placed on one face of a cube 12.0cm on each side . Calculate the net flux through the cube . <p> 4 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is 25 degrees . Let the radius be 44cm . Calculate the arc-length opposite to this angle . <p> 5 ) Draw a sphere and show a few area elements on it as shown . It is actually helpful to repeat this drawingon paper . Show that in polar coordinates ( spherical ) , the area of each element is given by dA = R2cosfdfd ? where ( ? must vary from 0 to 2p ) and ( f must vary from -p/2 to +p/2 ) in order for dA to cover the entire surface of the sphere . <p> Note that this drawing is only for the purpose of calculating the area of sphere . Here , the lowercase letter f is just the vertical angle , and ? the horizontal angle .

As soon as the key in the circuit is closed , electrons flow from the negative pole of the battery toward the lower plate of the capacitor . They distribute over the lower plate , making it negative . At the same time , free electrons move off the upper plate and flow toward the positive terminal of the battery . This causes the upper plate to become positively charged . This process does not happen suddenly ; it takes some time . The current is greatest to begin with , and decreases as charge accumulates on the plates .

@@21347093 @1347093/ <p> We have so far discussed two behaviors of light : straight line motion ( Geometric Optics ) and the wave-like behavior and interference ( Wave Optics ) . In this chapter , the particle-like behavior of light will be discussed . In fact , the particle-like behavior is also associated with a frequency and it can not be separated form the wave-like behavior . <p> Max Planck formulated this theory that as electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom , they receive energy from the surroundings in different forms . Typical forms are : heat waves , light waves , and collision with other electrons and particles . The radius at which an electron orbits is a function of electron 's K.E. and therefore electron 's speed . Recall K.E. = ( 1/2 ) Mv2 . Each electron is also under a Coulomb attraction force from the nucleus given by F = ke2 / r2 . Furthermore , circular motion requires a centripetal force Fc = Mv2/r . We know that it is the Coulomb force F that provides the necessary centripetal force Fc for electron spin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each electron takes a certain radius of rotation depending on its energy or speed.When an electron receives extra energy , it then has to change its orbit or radius of rotation . It has to take an orbit of greater radius . The radius it takes is not just any radius.When such transition occurs , a vacant orbit is left behind that must be filled . It may be filled by the same electron or any other one . The electron that fills that vacant orbit must have the correct energy that matches the energy of that orbit . The electron that fills that orbit may have excess energy that has to be given off before being able to fill that vacant orbit.The excess energy that an electron gives off appears as a burst of energy , a parcel of energy , a packet of energy or a quantum of energy according to Max Planck . <p> The excess energy is simply the energy difference between two different orbits . If an electron returns from a greater radius orbit Rm with an energy level Em to a smaller radius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quantum of energy equal to the energy difference Em - En.Planck showed that this energy difference is proportional to the frequency of occurrence ( f ) of the released quantum or the packet of energy . The proportionality constant is h with a value of h = 6.626x10-34 J.s called the " Planck 's constant . " The packet or quantum of energy is also called a " photon . " <p> The mechanism by which photoelectric effect operates may be used to verify the particle-like behavior of light . A photoelectric cell can be made of a vacuum tube in which two metallic plates or poles are fixed . The two plates are connected to two wires that come out of the sealed glass tube and are used for connection to other electronic components . For time being , let us connect a photoelectric cell to just a galvanometer ( sensitive ammeter ) as shown in the figure below . One terminal ( plate ) in the tube may be mounted in a slanted fashion in order forthe light coming from outside to effectively shine on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrons and forms the positive pole . <p> When photons of light are sent toward the metal plate , it is observed that the galvanometer in the circuit shows the passage of a current . When the light is cut off , the current stops . This shows that the collision of photons of light on the metal surface must release electrons from the outer shells of the outermost atomic layers of the metal oxide coating . <p> Each energetic photon that collides with the metal surface , releases one electron . This released electron has some speed and therefore some K.E. = 1/2Mv2 . The atoms of the outer surface that have lost electrons , replenish their electron deficiencies from the inner layer atoms of the metal oxide . This replenishing process transmits layer by layer through the wire and the galvanometer all the way to the pole labeled " Positive . " The positive end pulls the released electrons from the negative end through the vacuum tube and the circuit completes itself . This process occurs very fast . As soon as light hits the metal plate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off , the circuit goes off . <p> Fig. 1 <p> The conclusion of the above experiment is that photons of light act as particles and kick electrons out of their orbit . This explains the particle-like behavior of light . <p> Photoelectric Effect Formula : <p> The energy necessary to just detach an electron out of a metal surface is called the " Work Function " of that metalandis shown by Wo . If the energy of each incident photon on the metal surface is hf , and the kinetic energy of the released electron is K.E. , then we may write the following energy balance for a photoelectric cell . <p> hf = Wo + K.E .. <p> According to this equation , hf must be greater than Wo for an electron to be released . Since h is a constant ; therefore , f must be high enough for the photon to be effective . There is a limit for frequency below which nothing happens . That limit happens when the frequency of the incident photon is just enough to release an electron . Such released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency called the " threshold frequency " , the kinetic energy of the released electron is zero . Setting KE = 0 and replacing f by fth , we get : <p> h fth= Wo or fth = Wo / h . <p> The above formula gives the threshold frequency , fth . <p> Example 3 : The work function of the metal plate in a photoelectric cell is 1.73eV .

Calculate a percent error for each . <p> ii ) Parallel Resistors : <p> Theory : <p> Parallel resistors experience the same voltage , but ( possibly ) different currents . This is in contrast to series resistors . A typical pure parallel circuit is shown below . The voltage ( Vab ) has to be the same for the three resistors , because they are all between the same two points of the circuit ( a and b ) . The current in each resistor is determined by the equation I=V/R . Since the voltage V is the same for each resistor ( V1=V2=V3=Vab ) , the larger the resistance R of a particular resistor , the smaller the current through that resistor . Charge or flow conservation requires that <p> I = I1 + I2 + I3 . <h> Point ais a dividing point . Current I divides at point a into I1 , I2 , and I3 . At point b , I1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 2 <p> Note that the voltage across each of the resistors is Vab . If we neglect the small voltage-drop across the ammeter , the voltage Vab is equal to the battery voltage Vbat . This is because there is no circuit element ( other than the ammeter ) between point a and the battery , or between point b and the battery . The ammeter ( A ) does not contribute to any significant voltage drop ; the voltage drop across an ammeter can usually be neglected . <p> For a different case , where there is a fourth resistor between point a and the battery , or between point band the battery , Vab is notequal to Vbat . This is going to be case ( iii ) in this experiment . Here , for parallel resistors : <p> Procedure : <p> Refresh the screen of the applet to the get the default circuit . This means that you will start with a circuit that has a 12.0-V battery connected to a 100. -O resistor . On the applet , select the resistor and click on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100. -O resistors in parallel with the existing one . Now you have a circuit that has a module of 3 parallel resistors connected to a battery . Name the top one be R1 , the middle one R2 , and the bottom one R3 . Change R2 and R3 to 200and 300 Ohms , respectively . Now you have a circuit that is similar to Fig. 2 . <p> Calculate the overall ( the equivalent ) or total resistance R by using the parallel-resistors formula shown above , and record its value in Table 2 . <p> Do not take any measurements at this point . <p> What is the voltage across each resistor or what do you expect it to be ? Write your answer in Table 2 in the space provided . <p> Now that you know the voltage across each resistor , go ahead and calculate the current through each as well as the total current . <p> Calculate the total current I by applying the battery voltageVbat to the overall resistance R .. This means : I = Vbat / R .. <p> To calculate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be divided by its resistance . Since V=RI ; therefore , I = V/R . Record your calculated values ( Accepted values ) of I1 , I2 , and I3 in Table 2 in the line for accepted values . <p> To measure the voltages , select each resistor by clicking on it , then click on the " Voltage " , read the voltage , record it , and then deselect the " Voltage " to remove the voltmeter . The voltage you read is the voltage across each of R1 , R2 , and R3 . Resistors in a parallel module have the samevoltage . This will be the measured voltage V , V1 , V2 , or V3 . <p> To measure the currents , select each resistor by clicking on it , then click on the " Amperage " , read the current , record it , and then deselect the " Amperage " to remove the ammeter . Each current you read is the current through that particular resistor , the currents are different ( I1 , I2 , and I3 ) . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a test , add I1 , I2 , and I3to see if the add up to I. <p> To read the current , I , through the main branch ( up to the dividing point ) , remove the ammeter first if it is already in one of the branches . Next , click on one of the resistors and then click somewhere near the battery ( out of the area of the resistors ) . The three resistors will be selected and the overall resistance R will be shown in a white box at the top left corner . Now , if you click on the " Amperage " , an ammeter will be placed in the main branch to read the overall current I that comes out of the battery . Record the overall current I in Table 2 . This is your measured value for the main current I. <p> Calculate all %errors and record them . <p> Repeat the above procedure for line 2 of Table 2 . <p> Data : <p> Given and Measured : <p> Trial <p> Vbat . <p> Volts <p> R1 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Total <p> R ( O ) <p> Para ( P ) <p> V1=V2=V3 <p> =Vbat <p> Volts <p> I <p> Amps <p> V/R <p> I1 <p> Amps <p> V/R1 <p> I2 <p> Amps <p> V/R2 <p> I3 <p> Amps <p> V/R3 <p> 1 <p> 12.0 <p> 100 . <p> 200 . <p> 300 . <p> Calculated <p> Measured <p> % error <p> 2 <p> 16.0 <p> 400 . <p> 250 . <p> 250 . <p> Calculated <p> Measured <p> % error <p> Table 2 <p> Calculations : <p> Knowing the given values for Vbat , R1 , R2 , and R3 , solve for R , I , I1 , I2 , I3 , V1 , V2 , and V3 , and use these calculated values as accepted values . 63729 @qwx263729 <p> Corresponding to every measured value , there is an accepted value . Calculate a percent error for each . <p> III ) Parallel Resistors in Series with Another Resistor : <p> Theory : <p> Fig. 3 below , shows a parallel portion between points a and b that is in series with another resistor between points b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the ab portion and the rest across the bc portion . It is logical to write : <p> Vbat = Vab + Vbc <p> The voltage across resistors 1 , 2 , and 3 is the same because they are in parallel . ( The parallelism is not because they are drawn parallel to each other on paper ; it is because the current between points a and b must divide into three branches such that I = I1 + I2 + I3 . The same voltage Vab drives currents I1 , I2 , and I3 into resistors 1 , 2 , and 3 . ) <p> This balance-of-currents equation may be written in terms of voltages and resistances as : <h> I = I1 + I2 + I3 , or <p> Dividing through by Vab yields : 1 / Rab = 1 /R1 + 1 /R2 + 1 /R3 <p> Rab = 1 / ( 1 / R1 + 1/ R2 + 1/ R3 ) <p> This equation is good only for the parallel portion . To find the total resistance of the circuit , one may write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R4 ( Rab and Rbc are in series ) <p> Once the total resistance Rac is determined , the main current I can be calculated by using Ohms law : <p> Vbat = Rac I. <p> The total resistance Rac determines how much current the battery can push through . ( The ammeter ( A ) is a low-resistance device , and its resistance may be ignored . ) <p> Fig. 3 <p> When I is determined , it can be multiplied by Rab to calculate Vab . It can also be multiplied by Rac to calculate Vac as shown : <p> Vab = Rab I and Vac = Rac I <p> Now that Vab is known , Ohms law may be used again to calculate I1 , I2 , and I3 , as follows : <p> I1 = Vab / R1 <p> I2 = Vab / R2 <p> I3 = Vab / R3 <p> Procedure : <p> Refresh the applet to get the default case of a 12.0-V battery in series with a 100. -O resistor . <p> Select the resistor and click on " Series Connection . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the left resistor to select it . Then click on the " Parallel connection " 2 times to make the left resistor a module of 3 parallel resistors . Now you have a module of 3 parallel resistorsin series withanother resistor . Change the module to 100 , 200 , 300ohms from top to bottom . Name these as R1 , R2 , and R3 . Name the right resistor R4 , and leave it at 100 ohms . <p> Calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel module as you did in Part 2 . Name it R123 , and record its value in Table 3 . <p> Calculate the overall resistance of the circuit R by considering R123 and R4as series resistors . and record its value . R = R123 + R4 . <p> Calculate the main current I that the battery can send out ( push through ) by applying its voltage Vbat to the overall resistance R. I = Vbat / R . Record its value . <p> Calculate the voltage V123 across the parallel module . V123= R123 I . Record its value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R4 I . Record its value . <p> Now , you have the voltage across and the resistance of each resistor . Calculate the currents I1 , I2 , I3 , and I4. and record them in Table 3 . <p> The above calculated values are the accepted values , and are what we expect to get when doing the measurements . <p> Measurements : Select each resistor and measure the voltage across it and record its measured value . Record them as V1 , V2 , V3 , and V4 . <p> Select each resistor and measure the current through it and record its measured value . Record them as I1 , I2 , I3 , and I4 . <p> To measure the main current I , all resistors must be selected at once and then the ammeter added . If you click near the battery ( away from all resistors ) , then all resistors will be selected . Measure I and record its value . 
@@21347101 @1347101/ <h> The Nature of the Atom <p> As we know , an atom has protons and neutrons at its nucleus and electrons spinning around it . The atomic space is extremely empty . In other words , the sizes of electrons , protons , and neutrons are much smaller than the size of the atom itself . If the surface of a basketball is the place where electrons of needle-tip size are spinning over , protons and neutrons of almost the same size are at the nucleus . The ratio of the radius of the atom ( the radius of the basketball ) to the radius of electron , proton , or neutron ( a needle tip ) is of the order of ( 10,000 to 100,000 ) closer to 100,000 . <p> The motion of electrons around the atom is associated with K.E. If ( v ) is the average speed of an electron as it spins around the nucleus at a certain average radius ( r ) , its K.E. = + Mv2 . An electron , being a negative charge , is also in the electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a charge q1 in the field of another charge q2 , is Ue = -kq1q2 / r , where k = 8.99X109 Nm2/C2 is the Coulombs constant . For the proton and electron of a hydrogen atom Ue = -ke2 / r . <p> It is possible to determine the where-about of the electrons around the nucleus of atoms and also the way they are oriented by solving different case-problems in an energy balancing way . This way of determining the size and shape of an " orbital " ( space around the nucleus of an atom where electrons can be traced ) is the basis for quantum mechanics calculations . Here , we are going to discuss the hydrogen atom , the simplest one . <p> Calculation of the Radius of the Hydrogen Atom , <p> The Bohr Model <p> It can be experimentally verified that it takes 13.6 eV of energy to remove the electron from a hydrogen atom when it is in its ground state ( closest to the nucleus ) . If the electron is somehow moved to higher shells , then it takes less energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the electron of hydrogen atom is in its ground state , it takes at least 13.6eV to detach it from its atom . The electron energy is the sum of its K.E. and P.E .. We may write : <p> P.E . + K.E. = -13.6 eV , or <p> - k e2 / r + + Mv2 = -13.6 eV , ( 1 ) <p> where v2 can be found by understanding that the Coulombic force between the proton and electron of the hydrogen atom provides the necessary centripetal force for the electron spin around the proton . <p> Equating the expression for these two forces yields : <p> ke2 / r2 = Mv2 / r . <p> Solving for v2 yields : v2 = ( ke2 ) / ( rM ) ( 2 ) <p> Substituting ( 2 ) in ( 1 ) changes ( 1 ) to : <p> - k e2 / r + + M ( ke2 / rM ) = -13.6 eV ( 3 ) <p> M cancels and we get : <p> - ( + ) k e2 / r = -13.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ( k ) and ( e ) , yields the value for r of <p> r = 0.53 X 10 10m . The diameter of H-atom is therefore <p> 1.06 X 10 10m . <p> Note that 1x10-10m is defined as 1 angstrom shown as 1+ <p> Here , we define another unit of length called " Angstrom " to be 10 -10 meter . This is 10 times smaller than one nanometer . For example the red and violet wavelengths that are 700nm and 400nm or , 7000 and 4000 Angstroms , written as 7000+ and 4000+ . <p> As electrons spin around the nuclei of atoms , they receive energy by many means . If an electron receives energy , its K.E. increases and therefore has to change its orbit and jump to an orbit of a greater radius . A higher energy level of electron corresponds to a greater radius for its rotation . The possible orbits are discrete positions and not continuous . The reason for this discreteness is the fact that an electrons motion must fit into a path that is an integer multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look at the following figure where 3 ? 1 and 4 ? 2 are fit into orbits of radii r1 and r2 . <p> The energy levels are discrete as well as the radii . When , for whatever reason , an electron jumps from a certain level to a higher energy level , its original energy level ( orbit ) is left vacant . That must be filled , not necessarily with the same electron , but with any other electron that can lose the correct amount of energy . When a more energized electron of the m-th level that has an energy of Em goes to a lower energy level En , its excess energy ( Em En ) appears as a photon of electromagnetic radiation that has an energy of ( hf ) . <p> Em En = hf <p> Where h = 4.14x10-15 eV-sec is the Plancks constant . That is how light is generated . <p> When hydrogen , helium , or any other gas is under a high enough voltage , its electrons separate from the nuclei of its atoms and are pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the positive ( ionized ) nuclei move toward the negative pole . During this avalanche-like motion in opposite directions , many different recombinings and separations between the electrons and nuclei occur . These transitions from many different levels to other many different levels generate so many different ( hf ) s and ( ? ) s of different colors some of which fall in the visible range . The gas becomes hot because of these transitions . An enough hot gas emits light . The spectrum of a hot ( excited ) gas is called an " emission spectrum " . The same gas , when cold , absorbs all such emissions . A cold gas has " absorption spectrum " . As a demo , we are going to observe the emission spectrum of ( H ) and ( He ) gases in our physics lab . A high voltage source for gas excitation , low pressure ( H-tube ) and ( He-tube ) , as well as a spectrometer are needed . The following equations give the radius and the energy corresponding to different layers of atoms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rn= ( 0.53x10-10m ) n2/ Z <p> En = - ( 13.6 eV ) Z2 /n2 <p> For atoms that have more than one of their electrons around them , the calculations are more difficult and involved , and require higher levels of mathematics . In such calculations , the repulsion of electrons and their interactions must be taken into consideration . <p> Chapter 40 Test Yourself 1 : <p> 1 ) In most atoms , the ratio of the atomic radius to the electron radius is close to <p> We have so far discussed two behaviors of light : straight line motion ( Geometric Optics ) and the wave-like behavior and interference ( Wave Optics ) . In this chapter , the particle-like behavior of light will be discussed . In fact , the particle-like behavior is also associated with a frequency and it can not be separated form the wave-like behavior . <p> Max Planck formulated this theory that as electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom , they receive energy from the surroundings in different forms . Typical forms are : heat waves , light waves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which an electron orbits is a function of electron 's K.E. and therefore electron 's speed . Recall K.E. = ( 1/2 ) Mv2 . Each electron is also under a Coulomb attraction force from the nucleus given by F = ke2 / r2 . Furthermore , circular motion requires a centripetal force Fc = Mv2/r . We know that it is the Coulomb force F that provides the necessary centripetal force Fc for electron spin . <p> The above discussion clarifies that , in simplest explanation , each electron takes a certain radius of rotation depending on its energy or speed.When an electron receives extra energy , it then has to change its orbit or radius of rotation . It has to take an orbit of greater radius . The radius it takes is not just any radius.When such transition occurs , a vacant orbit is left behind that must be filled . It may be filled by the same electron or any other one . The electron that fills that vacant orbit must have the correct energy that matches the energy of that orbit . The electron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be given off before being able to fill that vacant orbit.The excess energy that an electron gives off appears as a burst of energy , a parcel of energy , a packet of energy or a quantum of energy according to Max Planck . <p> The excess energy is simply the energy difference between two different orbits . If an electron returns from a greater radius orbit Rm with an energy level Em to a smaller radius orbit Rn with an energy level En , it releases a quantum of energy equal to the energy difference Em - En.Planck showed that this energy difference is proportional to the frequency of occurrence ( f ) of the released quantum or the packet of energy . The proportionality constant is h with a value of h = 6.626x10-34 J.s called the " Planck 's constant . " The packet or quantum of energy is also called a " photon . " <p> The mechanism by which photoelectric effect operates may be used to verify the particle-like behavior of light . A photoelectric cell is made of a vacuum tube in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates are connected to two wires that come out of the sealed glass tube and are used for connection to other electronic components . For time being , let us connect a photoelectric cell to just a galvanometer ( sensitive ammeter ) as shown in the figure below . One terminal ( plate ) in the tube may be mounted in a slanted wayin order forthe light coming from outside to effectively shine on it . This side forms thenegative pole.The other side collects or receives electrons and forms the positive pole . <p> When photons of light are sent toward the slanted metal plate , it is observed that the galvanometer in the circuit shows the passage of a current . When the light is cut off , the current stops . This shows that the collision of photons of light on the metal surface must release electrons from the outer shells of the outermost atomic layers of the metal oxide coating . <p> Each energetic photon that collides with the metal surface , releases one electron . This released electron has some speed and therefore some K.E. = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost electrons , replenish their electron deficiencies from the inner layer atoms of the metal oxide . This replenishing process transmits layer by layer through the wire and the galvanometer all the way to the other pole that makes it " Positive . " The positive end then pulls the released electrons from the negative end through the vacuum tube and the circuit completes itself . This process occurs very fast . As soon as light hits the metal plate , the circuit is on . As soon as light is cut off , the circuit goes off . <p> Fig. 1 <p> The conclusion of the above experiment is that photons of light act as particles and kick electrons out of their orbit . This explains the particle-like behavior of light and a verification that energy is " quantized . " <p> Photoelectric Effect Formula : <p> The energy necessary to just detach an electron out of a metal surface is called the " Work Function " of that metalandis shown by Wo . Since , according to Planck 's formula . the energy of each incident photon on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the released electron is K.E. , we may write the following energy balance for a photoelectric cell . <p> hf = Wo + K.E .. <p> According to this equation , hf must be greater than Wo for each electron to be released . Since h is a constant ; therefore , f must be high enough for the photon to be effective . There is a limit for frequency below which nothing happens . That limit happens when the frequency of the incident photon is just enough to release an electron . Such released electron has a K.E. = 0 . At the limiting frequency called the " threshold frequency " , the kinetic energy of the released electron is zero . Setting KE = 0 and replacing f by fth , we get : <p> h fth= Wo or fth = Wo/h . <p> The above formula gives the threshold frequency , fth . <p> Example 3 : The work function of the metal plate in a photoelectric cell is 1.73eV . The wavelength of the incident photons is 366nm . Find ( a ) the frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the released electrons , and ( c ) the threshold frequency and wavelength for this photoelectric cell . <p> According to de Broglie , for every moving particle of momentum Mv , we may associate an equivalent wavelength , ? describing its wave motion behavior such that <p> de Broglie Wavelength <p> where ? is called the " de Broglie wavelength . " <p> Example 4 : Calculate ( a ) the DeBroglie wavelength associated with the motion of an electron that orbits a hydrogen atom at a speed of 6.56x106 m/s , and ( b ) compare the calculated wavelength with the diameter of hydrogen atom . <p> ( b ) The diameter of hydrogen atom is 1.06x10-10m , almost equal to the calculated deBroglie wavelength in Part ( a ) . This shows why the electron of each hydrogen atom has a wavy motion around its nucleus . Note that for electron speeds higher than 6.56x106 m/s , given in this example , ? will be smaller , and a greater number of such ? ' s will fit in each circular path that electron may have around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect is another boost to the idea that energy of a system is " quantized . " The quantization of energy means that energy coming out of an atom is in discrete parcels or packets that are called quanta ( the plural of quantum ) . As was mentioned in the photoelectric effect , each packet of energy or " photon " could release one electron in the form of a collision . Each photon carries a quantum of energy or hf amount of energy . <p> In Compton effect , also called " Compton Scattering " , a high energy photon of wavelength ? collides with an electron causing the release of another photon that is less energetic ( longer wavelength , ? ' ) . Of course , the electron will be dislocated and given a higher kinetic energy and a different momentum because of the collision with the incident photon . Since photons are treated as having a mass of zero and just carry a parcel or quantum of energy , they are massless compared to electrons , and therefore scatter.For every photon an equivalent mass may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E = Mc2 ) . <p> The figure on the right shows a photon of wavelength ? that collides with an electron ( in the general case of an oblique collision ) causing the electron move sidewise through angle f while the newly emitted photon ? ' moves along angle ? . <p> The figure on the right shows a photon of wavelength ? that collides with an electron ( in the general case of oblique collision ) causing the electron move sidewise through angle f while the newly emitted photon ? ' moves along angle ? . It is easy to show that the change in wavelength ? ' - ? is given by : <p> where mo is the rest mass of electron . The quantity h/ ( moc ) = 0.00243 nm is called the Compton wavelength . <p> Classically , the target charge ( here the electron ) should oscillate at the received frequency and re-radiate at the same frequency . Compton found that the scattered radiation had two components , one at the original wavelength of 0.071nm , and the other at a longer wavelength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the material of the target . <p> This means that the collision of the incident photon ( ? ) must be with electrons that the experiment did not depend on the target material . Also since the energy of the incident photons were about 20keV , way above the work function of any material , the electrons were treated as if they were " free electrons . " <p> To derive this formula , both conservation of energy and conservation of momentum must be applied . <p> Note that the momentum of a photon may be found from the de Broglie formula <p> ? = h/Mc or Mc = h/ ? <p> The momentum of a photon is p = Mc where M is the mass equivalent of the photon energy ; thus , <p> p = h/ ? . <p> The energy and momentum balance equations are : <p> Example 5 : Photons of wavelength 5.00 + pass through a layer of thin zinc . Find the wavelength of the scattered photons for an scattering angle of 64.0 degrees . <p> As was mentioned earlier , when an electron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it moves to a greaterer radius orbit whose energy level fits that electrons energy . Such atom is then said to be in an excited state . The excited state is unstable however , and the electron returns to lower levels by giving off its excess energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation ( visible light is a small part of the E&amp;M waves spectrum ) . Max Planck showed that the frequency of occurrence ( f ) of a particular transition between two energy levels in an atom depends on the energy difference between those two layers . <p> En - Em = hf <p> In this formula En is the energy of the n-th level , Em the energy of the m-th level ( lower than the n-th level ) and h= 4.14x10-15 eV-sec is the Plancks constant . f is the frequency of the released photon . <p> Possibilities for the occurrence of electron jump from one level to other levels are numerous . It depends on the amount of energy an electron receives . An electron can get energized when a photon hits it , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or by any other means . The electron return can occur in one step or many steps depending on the amount ( s ) of energy it loses . In each possibility , the red arrow shows electron going to a higher energy level , and the black arrows show possible return occurrences . <p> Hydrogen is the simplest atom . It has one proton and one electron . Click on the following applet for a better understanding of the transitions : LONG ... . In this applet , if you click on a higher orbit than where the electron is orbiting , a wave signal must be received by the electron ( from outside ) to give it energy to go to that higher level . If the electron is already in a higher orbit and you click on a lower orbit , then the electron loses excess energy and gives off a wave signal before going to that lower orbit . <p> Also click on the following link : http : **37;824;TOOLONG and try both options of " Particle Mode " and " Wave Mode " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly on any circle and change the orbit of the electron to anywhere you wish ; however , there are only discrete orbits whose each circumference is an integer multiple of a certain wavelength . It is at those special orbits that the applet shows principal quantum numbers for the electron on the right side . <p> For hydrogen atom , possible transitions from the ground state ( E1 ) to 2nd state ( E2 ) , 3rd state ( E3 ) , and 4th state ( E4 ) are shown in Fig. 1 . The possibilities for electron return are also shown . The greater the energy difference between two states , the more energetic the released photon is when an excited electron returns to lower orbits . If the return is very energetic , the wavelength may be too short to fall in the visible range and can not be seen in the spectroscope . Some transitions are weak and result in larger wavelengths in the infrared region that can not be seen either . However some intermediate energy transitions fall in the visible range and can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from higher levels to the first orbit form the Lyman Series . <p> Transitions made from higher levels to the second orbit form the Balmer Series . <p> Transitions made from higher levels to the third orbit form the Paschen Series . <p> Transitions made from higher levels to the fourth orbit form the Pfund Series . <p> Emission and Absorption Spectra <p> A hot gas emits light because of the energy it receives by any means to stay hot . As was mentioned earlier , the received energy by an atom sends its electrons to higher levels , and in their returns , the electrons emit light at different wavelengths . The emitted wavelengths can be observed in a prism spectrometer in the form of a few lines of different colors . Each element has its own unique spectral lines that can be used as an I 'd for that element . Such spectrum coming from a hot gas is called emission spectrum . For a host gas spectral lines are discrete . <p> For white light entering a spectrometer the spectrum is a continuous band of rainbow colors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violet to red and gives the following colors : violet , blue , green , yellow , orange , and red . Light emitted from the Sun contains so many different colors ( or electronic transitions ) that its spectrum gives variety of colors changing gradually from violet to red . It contains so many different violets , blues , greens , yellows , oranges , and reds that it appears continuous . <h> When white light passes through a cold gas , that cold gas absorbs only a certain energy-level photons and let 's the remaining photons pass through . The cold gas absorbs only those photons that it can emit when it is hot . Now , if you are observing the continuous spectrum of a streak of sunlight into a spectrometer , and then place a cold tube of a certain gas in the way of sunlight before entering the spectrometer , the cold gas will absorb those photons that it can normally emit when it is hot and therefore some dark lines will appear inside the continuous spectrum you were observing before . The dark lines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the absorption ( dark ) lines happen exactly at wavelengths that the emission lines occur when the gas is hot and emissive itself . <p> 11 ) The greater the energy of a photon ( a ) the higher its speed .

@@21347110 @1347110/ <p> A mass attached to a linear spring and set into up-and-down motion performs a motion that is called " simple harmonic motion , or SHM . " We need to first study the behavior of a linear spring . <p> Linear Springs : <p> A linear spring is one for which the change in length ( ? x ) is proportional to the change in the applied force ( ? F ) . <p> ? F = k ? x , <p> where , k , the proportionality constant , is called the " spring constant . " <p> Example 1 : A linear spring has an unstretched length of 18.0cm . When it is under a load of 125N , its total length is 20.5cm . Calculate ( a ) its constant , k , and ( b ) the load that makes it 25.0cm long . <p> The Metric unit for k is N/m . <p> Example 2 : A linear spring has a length of 35.0cm when under a load of 225N and a length of 43.0cm when under a load of 545N . Find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its free ( no load ) length . <p> Solution : To be solved by students . <p> The Linear Spring Formula : <p> Note that the formula ? F = k ? x is a relation between the applied force ( to the spring ) and the change in the spring 's length . The spring force ( Fs ) is always opposite to the applied force . As the following figures indicate , <p> when Fapplied is to the right , ? x is positive , Fs pulls to the left and is negative , and <p> when Fapplied is to the left , ? x is negative , Fs pushes to the right and is positive . <p> Based on the above Fs = - k x is the formula for a linear spring . When ( x ) is positive , Fs is negative and vise versa . This fact is reflected by the ( - ) sign in the formula . Note that Fs is not the applied force , it is the force that the spring exerts . <p> Simple Harmonic Motion : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metric unit for angles , refer to the end of the chapter . ) <p> Now , picture mass M is performing a uniform circular motion in a vertical plane as shown . Its shadowon the x-axis performs a back-and-forth motion that is called simple harmonic motion . To understand the following figure , visualize that mass M moves slowly and counterclockwise on the circle ( of radius A ) , and at different positions , picture its shadow on the floor . The angular position of mass M on the circle is determined by ? . Corresponding to every ? there is a shadow position measured by x from C to H ( or O to K ) . It is possible to relate x to ? . Since ? = ? t ; therefore , x can be related to ? t . <p> The graph of x vs. ? is shown below with the assumption that at t = 0 , ? = 0 as well . This means that mass M starts its circular motion from the position for which ? = 0 . Note that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as much as length A , the radius of the circle . A , the maximum deviation from the equilibrium position , is called the " Amplitude " of oscillations . <p> Example 3 : A bicycle wheel of radius 30.00cm is spinning at a constant angular speed of 180.0 rpm in a vertical plane . Find ( a ) its angular speed in rd/s . The shadow of a bump on its edge performs an oscillatory motion on the floor . Write ( b ) the equation of the oscillations of the shadow knowing that the shadow is at its maximum at t = 0 . ( c ) determine the distance of the shadow from the equilibrium position at t = 1.77 seconds . <p> Note that your calculator must be in radians mode for the last calculation . <p> Example 4:The equation of motion of oscillations of a mass on a spring is given by x = 3.23 cos ( 12.56t ) where x is in ( cm ) and t in seconds . Find its ( a ) amplitude , ( b ) angular speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( d ) its position at t = 0.112s . <p> Solution : Comparing the given equation with the general form x = A cos ( ? t ) , it is clear that <p> Note that your calculator must be in radians mode for the last calculation . <p> Mass-Spring System : <p> As it was mentioned , when mass M attached to a linear spring is pulled and released , its up-and-down motion above and below the equilibrium level is called " simple harmonic motion . " In the absence of frictional forces , the graph of such motion as a function of time has a perfect " sine " shape . It is for this reason that the motion is called harmonic . Figure ( a ) below shows a spring that is not loaded . Figure ( b ) shows the same spring but loaded and stretched a distance ( - h ) , and Figure ( c ) shows the loaded spring stretched further a distance ( -A ) and released . It shows that the attached mass M oscillates up and down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equilibrium level . <p> Example 5:A 102-gram mass hung from a weak spring has stretched it by 3.00cm . Let g = 9.81m/s2 and calculate ( a ) the load on the spring and ( b ) the spring constant in N/m . If the mass-spring system is in static equilibrium and motionless , and the mass is pushed up by +2.00cm and released , calculate ( c ) its angular speed , ( d ) its frequency , ( e ) its period , ( f ) the amplitude of oscillations , and ( g ) the equation of motion of such oscillations .. <p> Solution : ( a ) The load is w = Mg ; w = ( 0.102kg ) ( 9.81 m/s2 ) = 1.00N <p> ( b ) ? F = k ? x ; k = ( 1.00N ) / ( 0.0300m ) = 33.3 N/m <p> ( c ) ? = SQRT ( k / M ) = SQRT ( 33.3 N/m ) / ( 0.102 kg ) = 18.1 rd/s <p> ( d ) f = ? / ( 2p ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 1 / f ; T = 0.347 sec . <p> ( f ) The 2.00cm that the mass is pushed up above its equilibrium level ( while hanging on the spring ) , becomes its amplitude . A = +2.00cm . <p> In this equation if we plug t = 0 , we get X = +2.00cm . This is correct because at t = 0 , the mass is released from X = +2.00cm . <p> Example 6:The graph of x ( the distance from the equilibrium position ) versus time ( t ) for the oscillations of a mass-spring system is given below : <p> For such oscillations , find ( a ) the amplitude , ( b ) the period , ( c ) the frequency , ( d ) the angular speed ( frequency ) , ( e ) the spring constant ( k ) if the mass of the object is 250.0 grams , and ( f ) the equation of motion for the oscillations . <p> If an object is oscillating up and down , for example , it is easy to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. at the highest and lowest points . This is simply because it has to come to stop at those points in order to change direction . It is also easy to see that velocity gains its maximum magnitude at the midpoint or the equilibrium level . We may therefore state that : <p> " In Simple Harmonic Motion , maximum speed occurs at x = 0 ( the equilibrium level or position ) , and speed is zero at the extreme ends ( x = +/- A ) . " Of course , if we use the word " Velocity " , the respective direction(s) must be determined . <p> Acceleration has a different story . At the middle ( x = 0 ) , acceleration is zero . At the extreme ends , when a spring is at its maximum stretch or compress , the spring force is at its maximum magnitude , and therefore the acceleration it gives to the attached mass is maximum . We may therefore state that : <p> " In Simple Harmonic Motion , the maximum of acceleration magnitude occurs at x = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and acceleration at the middle ( at x = 0 ) is zero . " <p> Using Calculus , if the equation for x is <p> x = A cos ( ? t ) , then v , and a are derived as follows : <p> v = ( dx /dt ) = - A ? sin ( ? t ) ; and <p> a = ( d2x /dt2 ) = -A ? 2 cos ( ? t ) . <p> Maximum v and maximum a can be determined by setting cos ( ? t ) and sin ( ? t ) equal to their maximum value , i.e. , one .

( a ) True ( b ) False . <p> Oscillations ( Part 2 : Calculus-based Approach ) <p> The general form of the equation for oscillatory motion is x = A sin ( ? t + f ) where f is called the phase angle . Angle f simply determines how far ahead or behind the oscillations are compared to x = A sin ( ? t ) taken as reference . <p> The equation of velocity can be obtained by taking the derivative of x = A sin ( ? t + f ) with respect to time ( t ) . Using v = dx/dt , the velocity v becomes : <p> v = A ? cos ( ? t + f ) <p> Comparing this equation to v = vmax cos ( ? t + f ) , results in the value of maximum speed in SHM , simply vmax = A ? . It was discussed that vmax occurs at the middle ( x = 0 ) as the oscillating object passes the equilibrium position . <p> To find the equation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that means taking the time derivative of the speed equation . Doing this , results in <p> a = -A ? 2 sin ( ? t + f ) <p> Again , comparing this with a = amax sin ( ? t + f ) , results in the value of maximum acceleration in SHM , simply amax=-A ? 2 . It was discussed that amax occurs at the end points . When x = -A , the object is ready to go to the right and the acceleration is maximum . When x = +A , the object is ready to go to the left , the acceleration has again the same highest magnitude , but toward the left , and therefore is minimum . <p> Example 8 : A 225-gram small mass is hung from a linear spring and has stretched it by 6.4cm from its no-load length . Find ( a ) the spring constant . It is then further pulled down by 3.0cm and released . Find ( b ) its angular frequency , ? , ( c ) the frequency , f , ( d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f of the resulting oscillations . <p> This makes the acceptable answer to be f = -90 . Plugging into the general form , the equation of the oscillations becomes : y = 0.03sin ( 12.4t -1.57 ) . <p> Note that the 1.57 means 1.57rd that is 3.14/2 or simply p/2 or 90 . <p> The Mass-Spring System ( Calculus-Based Approach ) : <p> Referring to the above figure for the horizontal oscillations of mass M by the linear spring k on a frictionless surface , we may think that as the mass is oscillating the force of the spring on it at any instant is <p> Fs = -kx.This varying Fs , generates a varying acceleration a in mass M that according to Newton 's 2nd law is <p> Fs = Ma . Since a = d2x/dt2 , we may write : Fs = Md2x/dt2 . We may also write : -kx = Md2x/dt2 . <p> This may be written as : Md2x/dt2 + kx = 0 or , d2x/dt2 + ( k/M ) x = 0 . <p> The solution to this differential equation gives x as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin ( ? t + f ) where <p> Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion <p> As was discussed , for a mass spring system , when mass M is at its equilibrium position , it has its maximum speed , but the spring is neither compressed nor stretched . This means that , in this case , all energy ( or the total energy of the system ) is of kinetic type and potential energy is zero . On the other hand , when mass M is at an end point , since it momentarily comes to stop , its K.E. is zero , but its P.E . is maximum , because the spring is at its maximum stretch or compress . In other words , the same total energy is of potential type in this case . This can be shown mathematically as well . It is shown below : <p> The kinetic energy , on the other hand is K.E. = 0.5Mv2 . Since v = A ? cos ( ? t + f ) , the expression for K.E. becomes : <p> K.E. = 0.5MA2 ? 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Adding Equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) gives the total energy at any given instant . It is easy to verify that this total energy is equal to the maximum P.E . that is also equal to the maximum K.E .. <p> Example 9 : Add Equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above to show that the total energy of an oscillator , at any given instant is <p> Total Energy = U + K.E. = 0.5kA2 . <p> Simple Pendulum <p> Another good example of SHM is the " Simple Pendulum . " Such device is made of a string connected to a tiny heavy and solid sphere hung from a fixed point and set into oscillation as shown . It is easy to calculate the period of oscillation of a simple pendulum ( T ) as outlined below : <p> Example 10 : <p> The length of a simple pendulum is 2.35m .

If a piece of string is cut equal to the radius of a circle and then placed on the edge of that circle as shown , the central angle corresponding ( or opposite ) to that arc is called one " radian . " <p> There is an easy formula that relates any central angle ( ? ) to its opposite arc ( s ) and the radius ( R ) of a circle . This formula is valid only if the central angle is measured or expressed in radians . <p> Example 13 : A car tire spins at 240rpm .

@@21347112 @1347112/ <h> The Nature of the Atom <p> Atoms are made of three fundamental particles:electrons , protons , and neutrons.The general shape of atoms is spherical . Each atom has a nucleus that is made of a number of protons and neutrons . The nucleus is of course at the center of the sphere of the atom . The electrons of each atom spin around its nucleus at certain radii.The size of an atom is determined by the volume or the space in which its electrons require to spin . The volume they require depends on the energies of the electrons that means their temperature that translates to their speeds . The higher the temperature , the faster electronic motion and the greater the space or volume they require to spin in.If we could bring the temperature of an atom down to absolute zero to where the electronic motion seized , each negative electron would then collapse into a positive proton at the nucleus to form a neutron . But , we have not been able to do that so far ! <p> The atomic space or volume is extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the size of the atom itself.To have an idea of the emptiness of an atom , a hydrogen atom for example , picture a sphere 6 to 7 feet in diameter . A 6-ft tall person can comfortably stand in such sphere . The majority of hydrogen atoms have just one proton at their nucleus and one electron that orbits that proton.In that6ft-diameter sphere , the nucleus proton is like the tip of a very sharp needle at the center and the orbiting electron is like the tip of a very sharp needle moving on its surface ! This shows how empty each atom is . The ratio of the radius of an atom ( the radius of the sphere in which electrons spin ) to the radius of electron or proton , or neutron is roughly 100,000 . This means 105 power . Since the formula for the volume of sphere is ( 4/3 ) pR3 , the volume of each atom is some 1015 ( that means one thousand trillion ) times greater than the volume of each electron or proton.That speaks of how empty the inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the electron collapse into the proton under the Coulomb force ? The answer is again the electron energy , simply its speed or its temperature.It is extremely hard to shrink the volume of an atom to zero by forcing its electrons into its protons although the Coulomb attraction force is present thereto help . Of course , we are not talking about a single atom . A piece of iron with a mass of 56 grams has a volume of about 7.2cm3 . In such volume there exist some 6x1023 iron atoms . We do not have any device that can compress this iron piece to a near zero volume despite knowing that each atom of it is extremely empty . It takes the gravity of a neuron star ( a black hole ) in the outer space to do that . A neutron star has so much accumulation of matter that creates an un-imaginable gravity in itself . Its gravity is so strong that it shrinks the atomic volume of other atoms that are easily attracted to it to zero . It is under such gravitational force that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's why they are also called " neutron stars . " As they attract other atoms and convert them to neutrons , they become huger neutron stars . We may think of a neutron star as real solid matter . All atoms in our planet and solar system are fuzzy and extremely empty ! <p> The motion of electrons around the nuclei of atoms is associated with K.E. If v is the average speed of an electron as it spins around its nucleus at a certain average radius r , its K.E. = ( 1/2 ) Mv2 . An electron , being a negative charge , is also in the electric field of the positive nucleus . The P.E . of a charge q1in the field of another charge q2 , is Ue=kq1q2 /r , where k = 8.99x109Nm2/C2is the Coulomb 's constant . For the proton and electron of ahydrogenatom , the potential energy is Ue=-ke2/r . One charge is +e and the other -e . <p> It is possible to determine the radius r of an atom by solving an energy balance equation . This way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( the space around the nucleus of an atom where electrons can be traced ) is one basis for quantum mechanics calculations . In quantum mechanics , probability and statistic play an important role . This is because of the extremely high speeds that electrons have in that extremely small atomic space around the nucleus.We can only calculate the probability of finding the moving electron at a desired distance from the nucleus . We can not exactly determine where it is at a given instant ! A prior knowledge of probability and statistic is a must for an interested person in this field . <p> Here , we are going to discuss the hydrogen atom that is the simplest one . <p> Calculation of the Radius of Hydrogen Atom : <p> It can be experimentally verified that it takes 13.6eV of energy to remove the electron from a hydrogen atom when the electron is in its ground state ( closest to the nucleus ) . If somehow the electron is already at a higher shell ( farther from nucleus ) , then it takes less energy to remove it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electron of hydrogen atom is in its ground state ( closest to the nucleus ) , it takesat least13.6eV to detach it from its nucleus ( atom ) . The electron energy is the sum of its K.E. and P.E . . The electron energy is negative because we have to spend energy to remove it from its nucleus . We may write : <p> P.E . + K.E. =-13.6 eV or <p> - ke2/r + ( 1/2 ) Mv2=-13.6 eV. ( 1 ) <p> In Equation ( 1 ) , we already know the values for k , e , and M. You may want to verify this by examining the terms in ( 1 ) . The only quantity we do n't have a value for is v or v2 . Knowing v2 , we can then solve for r the radius of hydrogen atom . <p> v2can be found by understanding that the attraction force between the proton ( +e ) and the electron ( -e ) is the force that provides the needed centripetal force for circular motion of the electron around the proton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The diameter of the H-atom at its ground state becomes : <p> 1.06x10-10m . <p> We define another unit of length called " Angstrom ( + ) " to be 10-10m. + is 10 times smaller than nanometer . For example the red and violet wavelengths that are 700nm and 400nmare7000 and 4000 Angstroms , written as 7000+ and 4000+ . <p> As electrons spin around the nuclei of atoms , they receive energy by many means . If an electron receives energy , its K.E. increases and therefore has to change its orbit and jump to an orbit of a greater radius . A higher energy level of electron corresponds to a greater radius of rotation . <p> The possible radii arediscreteand not continuous . This means that the radius at which electron rotates can not have just any arbitrary value . The reason fordiscretenessis the electron 's wavy motion.Electron has also a wavy motion along any circular path that it is in.At each discrete radius that electron moves , the circumference of that orbit must be an integer multiple of a certain wavelength . <p> Fig. 2 shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at radius r1 . The length of its circular path must be3 ? 1 as shown . It means that the circumference of circle r1must accommodate exactly 3 of a certain wavelength like ? 1in it . When this electron receives a certain amount of energy , it jumps to a bigger radius orbit . The new circumference must again be such that it accommodates an integer multiple of another certain wavelength in it . The possible integer multiples are:4 ? 2 , 5 ? 3 , 6 ? 4 , and so on depending on the amount of energy received . Only 4 ? 2 is shown here . <p> Figure 2 <p> The energy levels are discrete the same way that the radii are . Any radius corresponds to a certain energy level particular to that radius . Since there are many many possible radii , there are many many energy levels accordingly . When , for whatever reason , an electron jumps from a certain level to a higher energy level , its original energy level will be vacant . It will be quickly filled by another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses some energy because it fills a lower energy level . <p> In general , in filling a vacant position , an electron goes from the m-th level at energy Em to a lower n-th level at energy En.The excess energy Em- En will be released as a pulse of electromagnetic radiation or simply a photon of light . <p> Max Planck showed that the frequency f of the emitted light is proportional to this energy difference Em- En with a proportionality factor h that is named the " Planck 's Constant . " The Planck 's formula is therefore , <p> Em- En= hf. ( 1 ) <p> The value of Planck 's constant is h= 4.14x10-15eV+s . The above three paragraphs summarizes the theory behind light generation . <p> Example 1 : Convert the Planck 's constant to to its SI unit of J+s . <p> Solution : Verify that you get h = 6.626x10-34J+s by replacing eV by its Joule equivalent . <p> Example 2 : Calculate the energy of a UV ray that has a wavelength of 105nm . <p> Solution : Using Em- En= hf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacing f by c/ ? from c = f ? , we get:E = hc/ ? . Substituting the values , we get : <p> E = hc/ ? =4.14x10-15J+s ( 3.00x108m/s ) / ( 105x10-9m ) = 11.8eV <p> Emission and Absorption Spectra : <p> When a gas like hydrogen is under a high enough voltage , its electrons separate from the nuclei of its atoms and are pulled toward the positive pole of the external voltage source while the positive ( ionized ) nuclei move toward the negative pole of the source . During this avalanche-like motion in opposite directions , many different atomic formations and separations ( de-ionizations and ionizations ) between the electrons and nuclei occur . As long as the external voltage is kept on , this process continues . The transitions of electrons from many different levels to other many different levels generate many different frequencies . See Equation ( 1 ) . Different frequencies , of course , means different colorsof light.Not all the generated frequencies are in the visible range . In fact a very high percentage of them fall either in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not see . <p> Thegasbecomes hot due to such transitions.A hot gas emits light . The spectrum of a hot ( excited ) gas is called the " emission spectrum . " The same gas , when cold , absorbs all such emissions . A cold gas has " absorption spectrum . " You will observe the emission spectrum of hydrogen and helium gases in a physics experiment . A high voltage source for gas excitation , a low pressure hydrogen tube , and a spectrometer are enough to see the emission spectrum of hydrogen atoms , for example . <p> The following equations work well for the hydrogen atomfor which the number of its protons is Z = 1 . <p> rn= ( 0.53x10-10m ) n2/Z and <p> En=- ( 13.6 eV ) Z2/n2 <p> where rn is the radius of the n-th orbit or shell and En is its energy .

Note that in the formula for energy levels En , Z is the number of protons . <p> Solution : For hydrogen Z =1 . Equation En=- ( 13.6 eV ) Z2/n2 becomes : <p> En=-13.6/n2eV . For Part ( a ) we need to calculate E5- E2 and set it equal to hf according to Planck 's formula and solve for frequency f . <p> 1 ) Find the wavelength of the emitted light associated with the electron transition from shells 4 , 3 , and 2 to Shell 1 of hydrogen atom .

At any point on an equi-potential surface ( sphere ) , the potential is the same . That is the reason for the choice of word " equi-potential .

It is important to note that any radial line ( field line ) is perpendicular to all equi-potential surfaces ( circles ) around a point charge . <p> It can be shown both mathematically and conceptually that regardless of the type of charge distribution , field lines are always perpendicular to equi-potential lines.This concept may be used find the trajectory of field lines around any type of charge distribution if equi-potential lines are known . <p> Figure 2 <p> The field lines and equi-potential lines around anelectric dipoleare shown below : <p> Figure 3 <p> The field lines and equi-potential lines around two parallel plates that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equi-potential lines can be found experimentally by using a voltmeter . If we find points around a certain charge distribution that are at thesamevoltage , we may then connect those points to form an equi-potential line .

However , the equi-potentials through Points B , C , D , and E will be curved lines . <p> 7 ) Repeat steps 5 and 6 for each of Points B , C , D , and E.

@@21347128 @1347128/ <p> Recall that anywhere there is an electric charge , there exists an electric field around it throughout space . If the charge moves , the electric field ( or any field-line ) around it moves as well . The motion of the charge causes change in the electric field intensity ( E ) at any point in space that varies with distance and time.Also , recall that the motion of a charge creates a magnetic field ( B ) that is perpendicular to the direction of motion of the charge.The important aspect is that the two effects ( E ) and consequently ( B ) turn out to be perpendicular to each other and they coexist . <p> Now , if the motion of the charge is of oscillatory nature with a sinusoidalequation:y = yo sin ( ? t ) , an up-and-down motion for example , the variations of E and B will also be sinusoidal as well with equations of the type <p> E = Eo sin ( ? t ) and B = Bo sin ( ? t ) where ? = 2pf . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( no matter how far ) to oscillate accordingly , we believe that oscillations of an electric charge creates waves that propagate through space . The graphical representation of the propagation of such waves called the " electromagnetic waves " through space may be pictured as shown below.This is the way fields variations are sensed by a distant charge as the waves pass by it . <p> Note that E is much greater than B. In fact E = cB where c is the speed of light ( 3.00x108 m/s in vacuum ) . The scale on the E-axis is therefore much greater than the scale on the B-axis ( an order of 108 times greater ) . This means that the magnetic effect is much weaker than the electric effect.Also , this figure shows one propagation direction only . <p> Note that the E and B that reach a distant charge as a result of E&amp;M waves propagation cause that distant charge to oscillate accordingly.The transmission of this effect is very fast but not instant . The speed of propagation of charge oscillations , E&amp;M Waves , is measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ km/s or 186,000 miles /sec.You may put 186,000 miles on your car in 8 to10 years . Electromagnetic waves ( Light being one type of it ) travel that distance in one second ! All radio transmitters and cellular phone systems take advantage of E&amp;M waves . The trick is to mount sound waves ( voice ) onto the E&amp;M waves ( called modulation ) and send them at the speed of light ( E&amp;M waves ) . This is the maximum possible speed according to the " Einstein 's Theory of Relativity . " <p> Since c is a constant for any given medium , if f increases , then ? has to decreasein that medium . <p> Example 1 : An AC source is running at a frequency of 60.0Hz . This causes the current ( moving charges ) in wires connected to this generator to flow back-and-forth at that frequency . The charge oscillations in such wires produce E&amp;M waves that as we know propagate at the speed of light c = 3.00x108 m/s .

This means that if there is a charge at one point in space , it oscillates only 60.0 times per second as such waves keep coming to it.The shorter the wavelength , the more energetic the wave is or the more energy it carries . Shorter wavelengths are associated with higher frequencies ( c = f ? ) . Higher frequencies make a distant charge to oscillate faster ; thus , imparting more energy to that charge . <p> Example 2 : Waves transmitted or received by cell-phones have wavelengths of about 15 cm or 6.0 inches . Calculate the frequency of such waves and express it in MHz . Note that MHz means Mega Hertz or Million Hertz . <p> Example 3 : White light is a mixture of a large number of different electromagnetic waves whose wavelengths range from about 400nm ( violet ) to about 700nm ( red ) .

For E&amp;M waves , it will be ( Eo2 ) , or ( Bo2 ) , or ( EoBo ) where Eo and Bo are the maximum values of the electric and magnetic fieldsintensities.Eo= cBo . This energy transfer is expressed in units of Joules per second per meter squared through space . Since Joules per second is watt , we may say that the energy carried by a wave is expressed in watts / m2 . It can be shown that the formula for maximum energy density carried by an electromagnetic wave is either of the three following forms : <p> Io = c eo Eo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o . <p> For a continuous sinusoidal wave , we may calculate an RMS ( Root Mean Square ) value . Since ( rms ) power is 1/2 of the max. power , we may write : subscript ( o ) denotes maximum value <p> I rms = ( 1/2 ) c eo Eo2 = c Bo2 / 2o = Eo Bo/2o . <p> Example 4 : A 10-kilowatt AM radio station is tuned on by a radio set at a distance of 5.0 miles = 8.0 km from the transmitter antenna . Isotropic wave propagation in space means that waves are sent out by the transmitter uniformly in all directions . This is not really the case with actual antennas , but for simplicity here , we suppose isotropic propagation of wave energy in space . Assuming isotropic , calculate ( a ) the wave intensity ( I rms ) in watts / m2 at the 8.0-km radius , and ( b ) the magnitude of the electric and magnetic field strength ( Eo and Bo ) at that radius . <p> Solution : Visualize a huge sphere ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of energy is to be distributed over its surface .

Think for a moment . Magnetic field lines emerge from the N-pole of a magnet and enter its S-pole . Remember that magnetic poles coexist . This means that any B field-line that enters a closed surface , must exit that closed surface in order to return to back to the magnet . Investigate this by drawing a bar-magnet with its field-lines and then once put a closed surface somewhere in its field-lines and once put the entire magnet inside that closed surface and see what conclusion you can draw . By now you may have figured out the answer . <p> You are right , the net magnetic flux will be 0 . We may write the Gauss 's law for a Magnetic field as <p> Maxwell used the Faraday 's law of electromagnetic inductionas his law ( 3 ) in the following form : <p> and finally , the modified Ampere law called the " Ampere-Maxwell Law " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be satisfied for the completeness of the solution to any electromagnetic problem . The details of formulas ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are given below : <p> Faraday 's Law of Magnetic Induction ( 3 ) : <p> Once more , let 's look at Faraday 's Law of magnetic induction , simply <p> V= -dfB/dt . Note that fm or fB means magnetic flux . The greater and faster the change in fm , the greater the induced voltage , V. Recall that when a magnet is moved toward or away from a closed loop of wire such that fm through the loopchanges with time , an induced voltage develops in the loop . Fig. ( 1 ) supports this statement . <p> In Fig. ( 1 ) on the right , as the bar magnet moves to the right , the changing B induces an electric field E normal to the B that results in the current I in the wire as sensed by the galvanometer . <p> In Fig. ( 2 ) on the right , a varying current is forced into a solenoid by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The varying magnetic field B generates an electric field E normal to itself such that <p> the line integral of E+dl = -dfB/dt <p> for any closed loop as shown . The E field-lines around B in ( 2 ) are circular and the line integral of any closed loop around B results in -dfB/dt . Faraday 's formula can be shown in two forms as shown under ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) on the right . <p> The equation on the right is the 3rd equation listed under Maxwell 's equations . <p> Ampere-Maxwell Law ( 4 ) : <p> Displacement Current : <p> When a capacitor is being charged , we know that there is a varying current in the wires that connect the battery to it ; however , the current from one plate of the capacitor to the other is via electric filed lines or electric flux , fE as shown in Fig. ( 3 ) on the right . <p> Applying Ampere 's law to the wire portion can calculate the current in the wire portion for us with no problem ( Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current produces around it . Current I passes through the flat circular surface ( Fig. 3 ) that is chosen for integration , and the closed loop is the circle around it along which the integral of B+dl must equal oI . <p> Now , if we apply Ampere 's law to the dielectric section , no provision is made in Ampere 's formula for incorporating the fact that the varying electric flux in between the plates generates a measurable magnetic field.Maxwell pointed out this shortcoming by using a semispherical surface as shown in ( Fig. 4 ) for which the closed path of integration is still the same circle . As can be seen , there is no actual current I flowing through the semispherical surface . The wire ends at the left plate . The current I in Fig. 3 crosses the flat circular surface , but in Fig. 4 it does not cross the semispherical surface . This means that I = 0 for case 2 , and the same integral of B+dl equals 0 that is not true . We know that current exists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To clarify this contradiction , Maxwell named the current in between the plates as the " Displacement Current , I 'd . " He modified the Ampere 's formula as follows : <p> The second term in parenthesis is derived as follows : <p> For a parallel-plates capacitor , Q = CV and since V = Ed , we get : <p> Q = CEd . Since C = eoA/d , this makes Q = eoAE or since fE = AE , we get : Q = eofE . The rest is continued on the right . <p> Q = eofE . ( In between the plates ) <p> As electric charge Q increases on the plates , fE increases and dQ/dt becomes : <p> dQ/dt = eodfE /dt and consequently : <p> I 'd = eodfE /dt . <p> Mathematical Form of Electromagnetic Waves : <p> By applying Faraday 's as well as Ampere-Maxwell 's equations , it is not that difficult to arrive at the following form that is the form of a one-dimensional transverse wave equation propagating in the x-direction at speed c in vacuum : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kx - ? t ) and B = Bosin ( kx - ? t ) where E and B are related by E = cB . <p> Of course , ? = 2pf is the angular frequency and k = 2p/ ? is called the the " wave number . " <p> Example 5 : Show that each of the above solutions satisfy the corresponding wave equation . <p> Solution : Solution is left for students . <p> Energy Stored in a Capacitor : <p> Recall the formula for the derivation of the electric energy stored in a capacitor : <p> Ue = ( 1/2 ) CV2(6) where V is the maximum capacitor voltage during charging from 0 to V. <p> Note that V = Ed where E is the constant electric field in between the plates and d the the gap for a parallel-Plates capacitor . If there is vacuum in between the plates , <p> C = eoA/d . Substituting for C and V in ( 6 ) yields : <p> Ue = ( 1/2 ) eoE2Ad ( verify ) where Ad is the volume of the space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results in : <p> Ue/Ad = ( 1/2 ) eoE2 . The left side is the energy per unit volume in the capacitor space . It it called the " electric energy density , ue=Ue/Ad . " <p> Electric energy density : ue = ( 1/2 ) eoE2. ( 7 ) <p> Energy Stored in an Inductor : <p> In a somewhat similar way , it can be shown that the magnetic energy stored in an inductor is : <p> Um = ( 1/2 ) LI2(8) where L = on2Al and I can be solved for from the solenoid formula:B =onI to yield I = B/on . <p> Substitute for L and I in ( 8 ) show that Um = ( 1/2 ) B2/oAl . Here , Al is the volume inside the inductor ( solenoid ) and dividing both sides by Al gives us the " magnetic energy density , um " or the magnetic energy per unit volume . Show that the result is : <p> Magnetic energy density : um= ( 1/2 ) B2/o. ( 9 ) <p> Energy Transport and The Poynting Vector : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy transmission by E&amp;M waves , we will use both the electric and magnetic energy densities : Equations 7 and 9 . <p> Since E = cB = B/ ( eoo ) 1/2 , we may conclude that the instantaneous values of ueand um are equal . ( Verify ) . The total energy density is therefore <p> u = ue + um = 2ue = 2um <p> = eoE2 = B2/o= ( eoo ) 1/2EB. ( 10 ) <p> Now , within every volume Adx in space normal to the direction of wave propagation , the energy contained is dU = uAdx . The rate of change of this energy with time is , of course , dU/dt . <p> The average power incident per unit area normal to the direction of propagation is therefore <p> Radiation Pressure : <p> It can be shown that E&amp;M waves transfer energy to the surfaces they are incident on . Crooke 's radiometer ( on the right ) is a device that shows how energy is received from light when incident on the vanes of a small propeller placed inside an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it painted black and the other side white . Click on the following link for a demo : http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=cey-JBeHrww . <p> For the apparatus shown , if you send light toward the vanes in the direction you are looking at them right now , the propeller will start spinning . A person who is looking down from the top of the apparatus , will see it spin counterclockwise . As it spins , you see the black sides of the vanes on the right and the white sides on the left . The black sides absorb the incident light energy , but the white sides reflect it . " The light energy received by the black vanes causes counterclockwise rotation as viewed from the top . The energy received by the white vanes get almost completely reflected or sent back . " This reasoning is because of the observation we make on the basis of the counterclockwise rotation from a top view . You may verify this by trying the above link . <p> It is important to note that the momentum change for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black vane . One may erroneously conclude that the rotation will be clockwise ; however , the momentum transfer or exchange is not between two mechanical objects like two billiard balls . It is between the electromagnetic waves ( considered to be of zero mass ) and a mechanical object like the vanes . Also , each reflected photon from any of the white vanes is not the same photon that was incident on it before collision . The interpretation of the process requires more detailed analysis . <p> <p> The linear momentum ( p ) that an electromagnetic wave carries is related to the energy it transports by <p> If the energy of an incident E&amp;M wave is fully absorbed upon perpendicular collision on a nonreflecting surface , the above equation can calculate its imparted momentum to that surface . On the other hand , if the energy of the incident E&amp;M wave is fully reflected , its imparted momentum is <p> To find the radiation pressure , we may calculate the force that such momentum transfer exerts on a surface .

" The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For now , the above is sufficient to give you an idea of wavelength and standing waves . <p> Types of Waves : <p> There are two classifications : one classification is : mechanical and electromagnetic . <p> Mechanical waves require matter for their transmission . Sound waves , ocean waves , and waves on a guitar string are examples .. <p> Electromagnetic waves can travel both in vacuum and matter . If light could not travel in vacuum , we would not see the Sun . Light is an electromagnetic wave . Radio waves , Ultraviolet waves , and infrared waves are all electromagnetic waves . <p> Waves can also be classified as transverse and longitudinal . ( See Figure ) <p> For a transverse wave the disturbance direction is perpendicularto the propagation direction . Water waves are transverse .

It is clear that frequency and period are reciprocals . <p> T = 1 / f <p> Also recall the useful relation between the frequency ( f ) and the angular speed ( ? ) . ? = 2p f. ? is the number of radians per second , but f is the number of turns ( cycles ) per second .

Since each wave source generates ( f ) wavelengths per second and each wavelength is ( ? ) units of length long ; therefore the wave speed formula is : <p> v = f ? . <p> Example 1 : The speed of sound waves at STP conditions is 331 m/s . Calculate the wavelength of a sound wave which frequency is 1324 Hz at STP conditions . <p> A stretched string fixed at two points and brought into oscillations such as a violin string has waves on it that keep going back-and-forth between the two fixed points .

The hump can be looked at as a portion of a circle from A to B with its center at C. The hump is being pulled down by a force of 2Fsinq .

The wave propagation velocity is V = f ? , but the particles velocity in the y-direction is vy = ? y / ? t . <p> Example 4 : The equation of certain traveling waves is y ( x , t ) = 0.0450 sin ( 25.12x -37.68t - 0.523 ) where x and y are in meters , and t in seconds . Determine the following : ( a ) Amplitude , ( b ) wave number , ( c ) wavelength , ( d ) angular frequency , ( e ) frequency , ( f ) phase angle , ( g ) the wave propagation speed , ( h ) the expression for the medium 's particles velocity as the waves pass by them , and ( i ) the velocity of a particle that is at x=3.50m from the origin at t=21.0s . <p> When two harmonic waves of equal frequency and amplitude travel through a medium in opposite directions , they combine and the result is a standing wave . <p> If the equation of the wave going to the right is <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one going to the left is <p> A sin ( kx + ? t ) , <p> we may add the two to obtain the equation of the combination wave ( Gray ) as <p> y ( x , t ) =A sin ( kx - ? t ) +A sin ( kx + ? t ) <p> Using the trigonometric identity : <p> sin A+sin B = 2sin ( A+B ) /2 . cos ( A-B ) /2 , <p> we get : <p> y ( x , t ) = 2A cos ( ? t ) * sin kx <p> In this equation , sinkxdetermines the shape of the standing wave and <p> 2A cos ( ? t ) determines how its amplitude varies with time . <p> Resonant Standing Waves on A String : <p> If the medium in which standing waves are formed is infinite , there is no restriction on the wavelength or frequency of the waves . In case of a bound medium , such as a string fixed at both ends , standing waves can only be formed for a set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of a rope , say 19ft long , and tie the other end of it to a wall 16ft away from you , there will be a slack of 3ft in it allowing you to swing it up and down and make waves . By adjusting the frequency of the oscillatory motion you give to the end you are holding , you can generate a sequence of waves in the rope that will have an integer number of full loops in it . For any frequency ( f ) , there is a corresponding wavelength ( ? ) such that v = f ? . <p> It is very clear from this equation that , since the waves speed , v , in a given medium is constant , the product f ? is also constant , and if you increase the frequency , the wavelength of the waves in the rope has to decrease . Of course , for resonance , the values of such frequencies , as was mentioned , are discrete , and so are their corresponding wavelengths . All you need to do is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full number of loops in the rope between you and the wall . It is also clear from Example 2 that each loop is one half of the wavelength in each case . When the entire length of the rope is accommodating one loop only , it is called the fundamental frequencyand that is the lowest possible frequency for that rope under that particular tension . <p> The subsequent 2-loop , 3-loop , 4-loop , and ... cases are called the 2nd , 3rd , 4th , and .... harmonics of that fundamental frequency . They are shown on the right . <p> From the above figure , at resonance , the length L of the string is related to the number of loops or ? /2 as follows : <p> Example 5 : Find the frequency of the 4th harmonic waves on a violin string that is 48.0cm long with a mass of 0.300grams and is under a tension of 4.00N . <p> Solution : Take the appropriate partial derivatives and verify by substitution . <p> Energy Transport on a String : <p> As a wave travels along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by point , or dx by dx .

@@21347143 @1347143/ <h> The Nature of the Atom <p> Atoms are made ofthree fundamental particles:electrons , protons , and neutrons.The general shape of atoms is spherical . Each atom has anucleus that is made of a number of protons and neutrons . The nucleus is of course at the center of the sphere of the atom . The electrons of each atom spin around its nucleus atcertain discrete radii.The size of an atomis determined bythe volume or the space in which its electrons require to spin . The volume they require depends on theenergies of the electronsthat meanstheir temperaturethat translates totheir speeds . The higher the temperature , the faster electronic motion and the greater the space or volume they require to spin in.If we could bring the temperature of an atom down to absolute zeroto where the electronic motion is seized , eachnegative electronwould then collapse into apositive protonat the nucleus to form aneutron . But , we have not been able to do that so far ! <p> The atomic space or volume is extremely empty : <p> The size ofelectronismuch smallerthan the size of theatom itself.To have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , picture a sphere 6 to 7 feet in diameter . A 6-ft tall person can comfortably stand in such sphere . The majority of hydrogen atoms have just one proton at their nucleus and one electron that orbits that proton.In that6ft-diameter sphere , the nucleus protonis like thetip of a very sharp needleat the center andthe orbiting electronis like thetip of a very sharp needle moving on its surface ! This pictures how empty each atom is.Theratio of the radius of an atom ( the radius of the sphere in which electrons spin ) to the radius of electron or proton , or neutronis roughly100,000 . This means 105power . Since the formula for the volume of sphere is(4/3)pR3 , the volume of each atomis some1015 ( that means one thousand trillion ) times greaterthan thevolume of each electron or proton.That speaks of how empty the inner atomic space is . <p> One might ask why does n't the electron collapse into the proton under the Coulomb force ? Theanswer isagain theelectron energy , simply its speed or its temperature.It is extremely hard to shrink the volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protons although theCoulombattraction force is present thereto help . Of course , we are not talking about a single atom . A piece of iron with a mass of56 gramshas a volume of about7.2cm3 . In such volume there exist some6x1023iron atoms . We do not have any device that can compress this iron piece to a near zero volume despite knowing that each atom of it is extremely empty . It takes the gravity of aneuron star ( a black hole ) in the outer space to do that . Aneutron starhas so much accumulation of matter that creates an un-imaginable gravity in itself . Its gravity is so strong that itshrinks the atomic volumeof other atoms ( that are easily attracted to it ) to zero . It is under such gravitational force that negative electronsandpositive protonscombine to formneutral neutrons . That 's why they are also called " neutron stars . " As they attract other atoms and convert them to neutrons , they becomehuger neutron stars . We may think of aneutron star as real solid matter . All atoms in our planet and solar system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrons around the nuclei of atoms is associated withK.E . If vis the average speed of an electron as it spins around its nucleus at a certain average radiusr , its K.E. = ( 1/2 ) Mv2 . An electron , being a negative charge , is also in the electric field of the positive nucleus . TheP.E.of a chargeq1in the field of another chargeq2 isUe=kq1q2/r , where k=8.99x109Nm2/C2is theCoulomb 's constant . For the proton and electron of ahydrogenatom , thepotential energyisUe=-ke2/r . One charge is+eand the other-e . <p> It is possible to determine theradius r of an atomby solving an energy balance equation . This way of determining the size and shape of an " orbital " ( the space around the nucleus of an atom where electrons can be traced ) is one basis forquantum mechanics calculations . Inquantum mechanics , probability and statistics play important roles . This is because of the extremely high speeds that electrons have in that extremely small atomic space around the nucleus.We can only calculate the probability of finding the moving electron at a desired distance from the nucleus.We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! A prior knowledge of probability and statistics is a must for an interested person in this field . <p> Here , we are going to discuss the hydrogen atom that is the simplest one . <p> Calculation of theRadiusofHydrogen Atom : <p> The Bohr Model of Hydrogen Atom : <p> It can be experimentally verified that it takes 13.6eV of energy to remove the electron from a hydrogen atom when the electron is in its ground state ( closest to the nucleus ) . If somehow the electron is already at a higher shell ( farther from nucleus ) , then it takes less energy to remove it from its nucleus or atom . This means that if the electron of hydrogen atom isin its ground state ( closest to the nucleus ) , it takesat least13.6eVto detach it from its nucleus ( atom ) . The electron energy is the sum of its K.E. and P.E .. Theelectron energy is negativebecause we have to spend energy to remove it from its nucleus . We may write : <p> P.E . + K.E. =-13.6 eV or <p> - ke2/r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Equation(1) , we already know the values fork , e , andM . You may want to verify this by examining the terms in(1) . The only quantity we do n't have a value for isv . Knowingv2 , we can then solve forrtheradius of hydrogen atom . <p> v2can be found by understanding thatthe attraction forcebetween the proton ( +e ) and the electron ( -e ) is the force that provides the needed centripetal forceforcircular motion of the electron around the proton.SeeFig. 1 . <p> Figure 1 <p> r=0.53x10-10m.The diameter of the H-atom at its ground state becomes : <p> 1.06x10-10m . <p> We defineanother unit for lengthcalled the " Angstrom " to be10-10m . Angstromis10 times smaller thannanometer . <p> For example thered and violet wavelengthsthat are 700nm and 400nmare7000 and 4000 Angstroms . <p> As electrons spin around the nuclei of atoms , they receive energy by many means . If an electron receives energy , itsK.E.increases and therefore has to change its orbit and jump to an orbit of a greater radius . Ahigher energy level of electron corresponds to a greater radiusof rotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radius at which electron rotates can not have just any arbitrary value . The reason fordiscretenessis the electron 's wavy motion.Electron has also a wavy motion along any circular path that it is in.At each discrete radiusthat electron moves , the circumference of that orbit must be an integer multiple of a certain wavelength . <p> Fig. 2shows two of such radii . Suppose an electron is orbiting at radiusr1 . The length of its circular pathmust be3 ? 1as shown . It means that the circumference of circler1must accommodateexactly3of a certain wavelength like ? 1 in it . When this electron receives a certain amount of energy , it jumps to a bigger radius orbit . The new circumference must again be such that it accommodates an integer multiple of another certain wavelength in it . The possible integer multiples are:4 ? 2 , 5 ? 3,6 ? 4 , and so on depending on the amount of energy received . Only 4 ? 2is shown here . <p> Figure 2 <p> Energy levels are discretethe same way that the radii are . Any radius corresponds to a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many many possible radii , there are many many energy levels accordingly . When , for whatever reason , an electron jumps from a certain level to a higher energy level , its original energy level becomesvacant . It will be quickly filled by another electron . The electron that fills the vacant position , loses some energy because it fills a lower energy level . <p> In general , in filling a vacant position , an electron goes from them-thlevel at energy Em to a lowern-thlevel at energyEn.The excess energy Em- En will be released as a pulse of electromagnetic radiation or simply a photon of light . <p> Max Planck showed that the frequencyfof the emitted light is proportional to this energy differenceEm- Enwith a proportionality factorhthat is named the " Planck 's Constant . " The Planck 's formula is therefore , <p> Em- En= hf. ( 1 ) <p> The value of Planck 's constant is h=4.14x10-15eV+s .

Substituting the values , we get : <p> LONG ... <p> Emission and Absorption Spectra : <p> When a gas likehydrogenis under a high enough voltage , its electrons separate from the nuclei of its atoms and are pulled toward the positive pole of the external voltage source while the positive ( ionized ) nuclei move toward the negative pole of the source . During this avalanche-like motion in opposite directions , many different atomic formations and separations ( de-ionizations and ionizations ) between the electrons and nuclei occur . As long as the external voltage is kept on , this process continues . The transitions of electrons from many different levels to other many different levels generate many different frequencies .

In this chapter , the particle-like behavior of light will be discussed . In fact , the particle-like behavior is also associated with a frequency and it can not be separated form thewave-like behavior ( Quantum Optics ) . <p> Max Planckformulated this theory that as electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom , they receive energy from the surroundings in different forms . Typical forms ofreceiving energyare:heat waves , light waves , and collision with other electrons and particles . The radius at which an electron orbits is a function of electron'senergythat means electron 's speed as well as its distance from the nucleus . Recall that K.E. = ( 1/2 ) Mv2 . Each electron is also under aCoulomb attraction forcefrom the nucleus given byF = ke2/r2 . Furthermore , circular motion requires acentripetal force Fc= Mv2/r.We know that it is theCoulomb forceFthat provides the necessary centripetal forceFcfor the electron rotation about the nucleus . <p> The above discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain radius of rotation depending on its energy or speed.When an electron receives extra energy , it then has to change its orbit or radius of rotation . It has to take an orbit of greater radius.The radius it takes is not just any radius.The radii of rotation for any electron orbiting a nucleus are discrete values.When such transition occurs , a vacant orbit is left behind that must be filled . It may be filled by the same electron or any other one . The electron that fills that vacant orbit must have the correct energy that matches the energy of that orbit.The electron that fills that orbit may have excess energy that has to be given off before being able to fill that vacant orbit.The excess energy that an electron gives off appears as aburst of energy , aparcel of energy , apacket of energythat is calleda " quantum of energy " according toMax Planck . <p> The excess energy is simply the energy difference between two different orbits . If an electron returns from a greater radius orbitrmwith an energy levelEmto a smaller radius orbitrnwith an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy differenceEm-En.Max Planckshowed that this energy difference is proportional to the frequencyfof that particular transition .

E= 5.5eV . <p> The Photoelectric Effect : <p> The mechanism by whichphotoelectric effect operates may be used toverify the particle-like behavior of light.Aphotoelectric cellcan be made of avacuum tubein whichtwo metallic plates or polesare fixed . The two plates are connected to two wires that come out of the sealed glass tube and are used for connection to other electronic components . For time being , let us connect a photoelectric cell to just agalvanometer ( sensitive ammeter ) as shown in Fig. 3 . One terminal(plate) in the tube may be mounted in aslantedfashionin order forthe light coming from outside to be effectively received by it . This side forms thenegative pole.Theother side that collects orreceives electronsforms thepositive pole . <p> When photons of light are sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the galvanometer in the circuit shows the passage of a current . When the light is cut off , the current stops . This shows that the collision of photons of light on the metal surface must release electrons from that surface . The released electrons must be from the outer shells of the outermost atomic layers of the metallic plate . <p> Each energetic photon that collides with the metal surface , releases one electron.This released electron has some speed and therefore some K.E. =1/2Mv2 . The atoms of the outer surface that have lost electrons , replenish their electron deficiencies from the inner layer atoms of the metal oxide or the nearby free electrons . <p> This replenishing process transmits layer by layer through the wire and the galvanometer all the way to the pole labeled " Positive . " <p> Figure 3 <p> The positive end pulls the released electrons from the negative end through the vacuum tube and the circuit completes itself . This process occurs very fast . As soon as light hits the metal plate , the circuit is on . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The conclusion of the above experiment is that photons of light act as particles and kick electrons out of their orbit . This verifies the particle-like behavior of light . <p> The Photoelectric Cell Formula : <p> The energy necessary to just detach an electron out of a metal surface is called the " Work Function " of that metalandis shown byWo . If the energy of each incident photon on the metal surface ishf , and the kinetic energy of the released electron isK.E. , then we may write the following energy balance for a photoelectric cell : <p> hf = Wo+ K.E. <p> According to this equation , hfmust be greater thanWofor an electron to be released . Sincehis the Planck 's constant ; therefore , fmust be high enough for the photon to be effective . There is a limit for frequency below which nothing happens . That limit happens when the frequency of the incident photon is just enough to release an electron . Such released electron has aK.E. = 0 . At the limiting frequency called the " threshold frequency " , the K.E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacingfbyfth , we get : <p> h fth= Wo <p> or <p> fth= Wo/h . <p> The above formula gives the threshold frequency , fth . <p> Example 3 : The work function of the metal plate in a photoelectric cell is 1.73eV . The wavelength of the incident photons is 366nm . Find ( a ) the frequency of the photons , ( b ) the K.E. of the released electrons , and ( c ) the threshold frequency and wavelength for this photoelectric cell . <p> Solution : <p> ( a ) c = f ? ; f = c/ ? = ( 3.00x108m/s ) / ( 366x10-9m ) = 8.20x1014Hz . <p> ( b ) hf = W0+ K.E. ; K.E. =hf - W0 <p> K.E. = ( 4.14x10-15eV+s ) ( 8.20x1014s-1 ) -1.73eV =1.66eV . <p> ( c ) fth= Wo/h ; fth=1.73eV/ ( 4.14x10-15eV+s ) =4.18x1014Hz . <p> ? th=c/fth ; ? th= ( 3.00x108m/s ) / ( 4.18x1014Hz ) = 718nm . <p> Wave-Particle Duality : <p> According tode Broglie , for every moving particle of momentumMv , we may associate an equivalent wavelength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broglie Wavelength : <p> where ? is called the " de Broglie wavelength . " <p> Example 4 : Calculate the de Broglie wavelength associated with the motion of an electron that orbits a hydrogen atom at a speed of 6.56x106m/s . <p> Solution:Using ? =h/Mv , we may write : <p> ? LONG ... 1.11x10-10m . <p> The Compton Effect : <p> TheCompton effectis another boost to the idea thatenergyis " quantized . " The quantization of energy means that energy coming out of an atom is in discrete parcels or packets that are called quanta ( the plural of quantum ) . As was mentioned in thephotoelectric effect , each packet of energy or " photon " could release one electron in the form of a collision . Each photon carries aquantum of energyorhf amount of energy . <p> In Compton effect , also called the " Compton Scattering " , a high energy photon of wavelength ? collides with an electron causing the release of another photon that is less energetic ( longer wavelength , ? ' ) . Of course , the electron will be dislocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different momentum because of the collision with the incident photon.Since photons are treated as having a mass of zeroand just carry a parcel or quantum of energy , they are treated as mass-less compared to electrons , and therefore scatter.For every photon an equivalent mass may be calculatedaccording to the Einstein mass-energy conversion formula ( E = Mc2 ) . <p> Fig. 4 shows a photon of wavelength ? that collides with an electron ( in the general case of an oblique collision ) causing the electron move sidewise through anglefwhile the newly emitted photon ? ' moves along angle ? . It is easy to show that the change in wavelength ? ' - ? is given by : <p> Figure 4 : <p> whereMois the rest mass of electron . The quantityh/ ( Moc ) =0.00243nm is called theCompton wavelength . <p> Classically , the target charge ( here electron ) should oscillate at the received frequency and re-radiate at the same frequency . Compton found that the scattered radiation had two components , one at the original wavelength of 0.071nm , and the other at a longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the material of the target . <p> This means that the collision of the incident photon ? must be with electrons and the experiment did not depend on the target material . Also since the energy of the incident photons were about 20keV , way above the work function of any material , the electrons were treated as if they were " free electrons . " <p> To derive this formula , both conservation of energy and conservation of momentum must be applied . <p> Note thatthe momentum of a photonmay be found from thede Broglieformula <p> ? = h/Mcor , Mc= h/ ? <p> The momentum of a photon isp = McwhereMis themass equivalent of the photon energy ; thus , <p> p = h/ ? . <p> The energy and momentum balance equations are : <p> Example 5:Photons of wavelength 5.00angstrompass through a layer of thin zinc . Find the wavelength of the scattered photons for an scattering angle of 64.0 degrees . <p> As was mentioned earlier , when an electron in an atom receives some energy by any means , it moves to a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such atom is then said to be in anexcited state . The excited state is unstable however , and the electron returns to lower levels by giving off its excess energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation.Max Planckshowed that thefrequency of occurrence fof a **27;979;TOOLONG two energy levels in an atom depends on theenergy differencebetween those two layers . <p> En- Em= hf <p> In this formulaEnis the energy of the n-th level , Emthe energy of the m-th level ( lower than the n-th level ) and h=4.14x10-15eV-sec is the Planck 's constantandfthe frequency of the released photon . <p> Figure 5 <p> Possibilities for the occurrence ofelectron jumpfrom one level to other levels are numerous . It depends on the amount of energy an electron receives . An electron can get energized when a photon hits it , or is passed by another more energetic electron that repels it , or by any other means . Theelectron returncan occur in one step or many steps depending on the amount of energy it loses . In each possibility , thered arrowshows electrongoing to a higher energy level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the applet , if you click on a higher orbit than where the electron is orbiting , a wave signal must be received by the electron ( from outside ) to give it energy to go to that higher level . If the electron is already in a higher orbit and you click on a lower orbit , then the electron loses excess energy and gives off a wave signal before going to that lower orbit . <p> You can put the mouse on the applet near or exactly on any circle and change the orbit of the electron to anywhere you wish ; however , there are only discrete orbits withcircumferences each of which is an integer multiple of a certain wavelength . It is at those special orbits that the applet showsprincipal quantum numbers ( on the right side of the applet ) . <p> For hydrogen atom , possible transitions from the ground state E1 to 2ndstate E2 , 3rdstate E3 , and 4thstate E4 are shown inFig. 1 .

Fig. 1 shows a small object of mass m that is connected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horizontal plane at constant linear speed , v. Note that the velocity is not constant . This is because of the fact that the direction of velocity keeps changing in circular motion .

Learning objectives should be a statement that is directly measurable . <p> More complex competencies contain multiple learning objectives . A competency such as Media Literacy is so broad in scope that it might contain multiple levels of learning objectives . The highest level objective might include " Awareness of Advertising Techniques , " which might be broken down into sub-objectives of its own . You can do this by creating multiple levels of learning objectives , or by creating sub-competencies ( one competency nested beneath another ) . <h> Activities <p> Note starting with version 9.2 of Learning Environment , you no longer create separate activities in the Competencies tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Activities are what you use to evaluate learning objectives . They are the content and assessments in the course , that measure a person 's completion of a learning objective . Some activities can be set as required to achieve the learning objective . You can use multiple activities to evaluate a learning objective . Users must pass all the required activities associated with a learning objective to complete it . <p> In Learning Environment , activities can be quizzes , surveys , dropbox folders , discussion topics , content topics and modules , and grade items . Or they can exist as a manual assessment activity tied to a rubric . This gives you the opportunity to use existing tools to assess learning objectives and the flexibility to draw on other forms of assessment , such as an in-person demonstration . <p> Activities are the only elements that are actually graded . To complete an activity , a user 's assessment must meet the minimum required level for that activity . This means competencies have no grades or levels of achievement " they are either complete or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person achieves the highest levels on all activities , while another meets only the minimum thresholds ; in the competency model , both are equal . You can think of competencies as an inventory of skills or knowledge a person has , rather than a measure of how good someone is at something . <h> Levels of Objective Association <p> When associating a learning objective to a course item , there are several levels of association you can assign : <h> Association only ( no evaluation method stored ) . <p> Use this level to track the alignment of a course item to a learning objective without any evaluation .

@@21347150 @1347150/ <p> The temperature of an object is a measure of how cold or hot that object is . More precisely , the temperature of an object is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the atoms and molecules of that object . A hotter object has faster molecular vibrations . Temperature is a scalar quantity . <p> Temperature Scales : <p> Four temperature scales are commonly used.Fahrenheit and Rankin in theAmerican system of units , and Celsius and Kelvin in the Metric System . <p> Fahrenheit and Celsius are regular scales . Rankin and Kelvin are absolute scales . <p> Fahrenheit and Celsius Scales : <p> If an unmarked thermometer is placed in a mixture of ice and water , the mercury level in the thermometer goes down and comes to stop at a certain level . As long as there is ice to melt , the level remains the same . When all of the ice is molten , then the mercury level starts going up . If the same unmarked thermometer is placed in pure water and heated , the mercury level in it keeps going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , the level remains constant again until there is no more water to evaporate.Celsius named these two fixed points as " 0 " and " 100 " and made a thermometer.The " 0 " and " 100 " are decided for experiments performed at ocean level where the air pressure is one atmosphere . <p> Experiments have shown thatthe temperature of a pure substance remains constant during freezing and melting processes ( when phase changes ) . The heat absorbed or given off during melting or freezing contributes to phase change only , either from solid to liquid or from liquid to solid.The same is true for evaporation and condensation processes during which temperature remains constant . <p> The important point here is that the melting ( also , freezing ) point of water is used to mark the " 0 " on the Celsius scale and the evaporation ( also , condensation ) point of water is used to mark the " 100 " on the Celsius scale , of course , performed at one atmosphere of air pressure . <p> " 0 " on Celsius scale corresponds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 " on Celsius scale corresponds to " 212 " on Fahrenheit scale . This means that pure water freezes at 32 F and boils at 212 F if the air pressure is one atmosphere . <p> Comparison Between Celsius and Fahrenheit Scales : <p> Although most calculators do the conversions between these two scales immediately , it is worth knowing how one measure can be converted to the other . <p> Fig. 1 <p> Example 1 : The Fahrenheit scale reads 77 F , what is the reading on the Celsius scale ? <p> Example 2 : A temperature difference of ? C = 24C is measured between two points on Celsius scale . How much is this difference in Fahrenheit scale ? <p> Solution : 100C difference on the Celsius scale corresponds to 180F difference on the Fahrenheit scale . Using a proportion , the difference in Fahrenheit is <p> ? F / ? C = 180 / 100 ; ? F / 24 = 9/5 ; ? F = 24 ( 1.8 ) ; ? F = 43F . <p> Example 3 : At what temperature both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solution : To be solved by students . <p> Absolute Scales : The basis for absolute scales ( Kelvin and Rankin scales ) is the temperature at which molecular motion ceases and stops . This temperature can not actually be reached ; however , with great cooling , temperatures very close to it have been reached . Experiments have shown that when a gas is cooled down , its volume decreases.At constant pressure , the volume decrease for a gas , is proportional to the temperature decrease . In other words , The ratio ? V/ ? T remains constant . That means that if V ( the gas volume ) is plotted versus T ( the gas temperature ) while pressure is kept constant , the graph is a straight line as shown below : <p> Fig. 2 <p> Since it is practically very difficult to reach very low temperatures , we have to extrapolate the graph to cross the temperature axis . Of course , at the point of intersection , V = 0 . This means that the gas is so cold that its electrons are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their vibration . In other words , the no need for space means Zero Volume.The temperature ( -273C ) is chosen to be the Zero on the Kelvin scale . This makes the zero on the Celsius scale to correspond to 273 on the Kelvin scale ; therefore , <p> K = C + 273 <p> Parallel to the above discussion , if the temperatures on the graph are expressed in F , extrapolation crosses the temperature axis at -460F . That constitutes the basis for the " Rankin Scale . " We may write : <p> R = F + 460 . <p> Heat : <p> Heat is a form of energy that transfers due to a temperature difference . <p> Units of Heat : <p> The familiar unit often heard is " calorie . " One calorie ( 1cal ) is the amount of heat energy that can raise the temperature of 1gram of pure water by 1C . Parallel to this definition is that of kilocalorie ( kcal ) . <p> 1 kcal is the amount of heat energy that can raise the temperature of 1kg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat energy is Btu ( British thermal unit ) .1 Btu is the amount of heat energy that can raise the temperature of 1lbmof pure water by 1F . Refer to the Chart of Units . <p> Specific Heat ( c ) : <p> Different substances take different amounts of heat energy for one unit of mass of them to warm up by one degree . For example , if you pour 1kg of water ( 1 liter of water , because ? water = 1 kg/L ) in a light kettle and place it on a burner and also place 1kg of iron ( the volume of which is about 1/8 of a liter ) on a same heating power burner , after the same length of time , the iron piece will be much hotter than the water . The reason is the difference in their specific heat . Iron takes much less heat to warm up compared to water . <p> The specific heat ( c ) of a substance is the amount of heat 1kg of that substance takes to warm up by 1C . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kcal / ( kg C ) . This is because of the way kcal was defined . The specific heat of a few elements are given below : <p> cwater = 1.000 kcal / ( kg C ) or , cwater = 1.000 cal / ( g C ) . <p> ciron = 0.108 kcal / ( kg C ) or , ciron = 0.108 cal / ( g C ) . <p> cAl = 0.215 kcal / ( kg C ) or , cAl = 0.215 cal / ( g C ) . <p> cbrass = 0.0924 kcal / ( kg C ) or , cbrass = 0.0924 cal / ( g C ) . <p> Heat calculation : <p> When heat is given to a pure substance or taken from it , its temperature starts changing if a phase change does not start . During a phase change ( solid to liquid , liquid to solid , liquid to vapor , or vapor to liquid ) , temperature remains constant . We will look at the following two cases : <p> 1 ) Heat calculation for temperature change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Heat Calculation When Temperature changes Only ( No Phase Change ) : <p> In this case the amount of heat given or taken is obviously proportional to mass ( M ) of the object , its specific heat ( c ) , and the temperature change ( ? T ) . The formula is therefore , <p> Q = Mc ? T. <p> Example 4 : Calculate the amount heat that must be given to 2.14 kg of iron to warm up from 24.0C to 88.0C . <p> When a few objects at different temperatures are brought into contact with each other , after a while , they arrive at the same temperature that is called the " equilibrium temperature . " Clearly , in the process , hotter objects lose heat while colder objects gain heat . According to the law of conservation of energy , the heat that hotter objects lose must be equal to the heat that colder objects gain . The state at which all objects have arrived at the same temperature and no further heat transfer takes place is called " thermal equilibrium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that involve thermal equilibrium processes : <p> - heat loss by hotter objects = Heat gain by colder objects <p> A ( - ) sign is placed on the left side of the equation to make it mathematically correct . Heat loss is negative and heat gain is positive . The negative of heat loss is therefore a positive number and can be set equal to the heat gain . <p> Example 7 : A 65-gram piece of aluminum at 180C is removed from a stove and placed in 45 grams of water initially at 22C . Find the equilibrium temperature ( Teq ) . <p> Solution : Thermal equilibrium requires that - heat loss by hotter objects = heat gain by colder objects.To each side of the equation a Q = Mc ? T must be applied . Note that the final temperature of both water and aluminum will be the same . We may either call this final temperature Tf orTeq , the equilibrium temperature . <p> Example 8 : A 225-gram piece of hot iron is removed from an electric oven at an unknown temperature . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oven long enough so that its initial temperature can be thought as the temperature of the oven . The iron piece is placed in 75.0 grams of water that is held by a 45.0-gram aluminum container initially at an equilibrium temperature of 25.0C . The final equilibrium temperature of iron , aluminum , and water becomes 41.0C . Find the initial temperature of iron ( oven ) . Assume that the whole system is thermally isolated from the surroundings . <p> During a phase change ( solid to liquid , liquid to solid , liquid to vapor , or vapor to liquid ) , temperature remains constant . For example , when ice is removed from a freezer at say -25C , it takes some heat to first become ice at 0C. 0C is the melting temperature of ice . At this temperature , any heat given to the ice will be consumed for melting and not temperature change . During the melting process ( a phase change ) , the temperature remains constant at 0C . Since temperature does not change , an equation such as Q = M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for heat calculation . Here the useful equation is Q = M Lfwhere Lf is called the " latent heat of fusion . " Lfis measured for different substances at their melting/freezing points or temperatures . Typical values may be found in texts or handbooks . <p> Example 9 : How much heat should be removed from 250 grams of water already at its freezing point ( 0C ) to convert it to ice at ( 0C ) ? The latent heat of freezing for water is Lf = 80 cal/gr . <p> Solution : In this problem , the heat calculation involves a phase change only . There is no temperature change . <p> Q = M Lf ; Q = ( 250 gr ) ( 80 cal/gr ) = 20,000 cal . ( 2.0x104 cal . ) <p> Example 10 : How much heat should be given to 250gr of ice at 0C to convert it to water at 40 . C ? The latent heat of freezing/melting for water is Lf = 80 cal/gr and the specific heat of water is 1 cal/gr C. <p> Solution : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change and a temperature change . <p> The remaining heat is 25200cal - 18000cal = 7200 cal . This heat warms up water from 0C to Tf . <p> Q = Mc ( Tf - Ti ) ; 7200cal = ( 225gr ) ( 1 cal/grC ) ( Tf- 0C ) ; <p> Tf - 0.0C = 7200 / 225 = 32C ; Tf = 32C . The final result is 225 grams of water at 32C . <p> Chapter 12 Test Yourself 1 : <p> 1 ) The temperature of an object is ( a ) the heat that object contains ( b ) a measure of how hot or cold that object is ( c ) a measure of the average K.E. of the atoms and molecules of that object ( d ) both b &amp; c.click here <p> 4 ) The reason for using the melting point of a pure substance in the calibration of thermometers is that ( a ) during melting , for example , the temperature of a pure substance remains constant ( b ) it can be replicated at other similar points on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 5 ) The reason for using the boiling point of a pure substance in the calibration of thermometers is that ( a ) during boiling , for example , the temperature of a pure substance remains constant ( b ) it can be replicated at other similar points on this planet ( c ) both a &amp; b . <p> 15 ) The temperature at which both scales read the same number is ( a ) 35 ( b ) 55 ( c ) -40. click here <p> 16 ) In Fig. 2 , V1 is the volume at T1 =100C , and V2 the volume at T2 = 50C .

The reason is that at a higher temperature , not only each molecule of an object oscillates faster , but also it requires a greater space due to its increased amplitude . As an exception , water , for example , expands when its temperature decreases from 4C to 0C . This exception has its own advantages and disadvantages . One advantage is that the density of ice becomes less than that of water causing ice to float on water . In winter , the ice over lakes and oceans protects them from further freezing and preserves underwater life . One disadvantage is the cracking of cylinder heads in engines that lack antifreeze.We may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gases separately . In this chapter , expansion of solids and liquids will be discussed . The expansion of gases will be studied in Chapter 14 . <p> 1 . Expansion of Solids : <p> Solids expand in all directions.For a wire or a slender rod , expansion occurs mainlyin one dimension . For a plate , expansion occurs in two dimensions . For a solid object , expansion occurs in three dimensions.For solids , we define the " the coefficient of linear expansion . " The same coefficient will be modified and used for surface expansion as well as volume expansion . <p> Linear Expansion : <p> Experiments have shown that when a wire or slender rod is heated , the change in length ( ? L ) is proportional to its initial length L i , the change in temperature ? T , and a coefficienta that depends on its material . This proportionality may be written as : <p> ? L = a Li ? T where a is called the " the coefficient of linear expansion . " <p> Of course , ? L = Lf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Solving for a results in:a = ? L / ( L i ? T ) . The unit for ain SI is C-1because ? L and L i have units of length and cancel each other . Write this formula with a horizontal fraction bar and verify the unit for a . <p> Based on this last formula , amay be stated as the change in length per unit length ( ? L /Li ) per unit change in temperature ( ? T ) or <p> ? L / ( L i ? T ) . <p> Example 15 : <p> A copper wire is 1000.0m at 0C and 1001.7m at 100C . <p> Find its coefficient of linear expansion , a . <p> Solution : The change in length is ? L = 1.70m . <p> This change is over 1000m , the change in length per unit length is <p> ? L / L i = 1.7m / 1000m = 1.7x10 -3 dimensionless . <p> This occurs for 100C of temperature change . <p> The change in length per unit length per unit change in temp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

Find its final length when the temperature is 90.0C . The coefficient of linear expansion for copper is 17x10 -6 C-1 . Note that in summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; however , a copper wire under sunlight can reach that temperature . <p> Example 17 : In a clamp-shape piece of pyrex a slender steel rod is fixed as shown . At 15C the gap between the rod and the metal contact at B is 0.050mm . At what temperature does the rod make contact with the metal at B ? For solution , assume the left side ( Point B ) to be fixed . <p> Solution : Both the steel rod and the pyrex clamp expand , but by different amounts . As the rod expands to the left , the 25.45mm-segment of pyrex shifts it to the right at a slower pace because <p> apyrex &lt; asteel . ? L = a L i ? T ; <p> 0.050mm = ( 24 - 3.3 ) 10-6 ( 25.4mm ) ( Tf- 15C ) ; <p> Tf = 110C . <p> Fig. 4 <p> Surface Expansion <p> Again , the change in surface area ( ? A ) is proportional to the initial area ( A i ) , a constant that we may call " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in temperature ( ? T ) . It can be shown that the coefficient of surface expansion is twice that of linear expansion or simply ( 2a ) . We may write : <p> ? A = Ai(2a) ? T. <p> For a square sheet of length Li that is warmed up by ? T , each side of it gets a final length of Lfsuch that <p> ? L = a L i ? T or , <p> Lf - Li = a L i ? T or , <p> Lf = Li + a L i ? T or , <p> Lf = Li ( 1 + a ? T ) . <p> The initial area is Li2 and the final area becomes Lf 2 . <p> But , Lf 2 is : <p> Lf 2 = Li 2 ( 1 + a ? T ) 2 or , <p> Lf 2 = Li 2 ( 1 + 2a ? T + a 2 ? T2 ) . <p> Fig. 5 <p> since a is small , a 2 is much smaller and can be neglected ; therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ( 1 + 2a ? T ) or , Af = Ai ( 1 + 2a ? T ) or , <p> Af -Ai = 2aAi ? T or , ? A = 2a Ai ? T. <p> Therefore , the coeff. of area expansion istwice the coeff. of linear expansion , a . <p> Example 18 : Calculate the change in the area of an aluminum roof ( 25m x 62m ) when its temperature changes from -3.0C and 57.0C . <p> Once more , the volume expansion , ? V of a solid is proportional to its initial volume Vi , the change in temperature ? T , and a constant that we may name coefficient of volume expansion . This constant proves to be 3a ; therefore , <p> ? V = Vi(3a) ? T. <p> Example 19 : Calculate the volume expansion for a chunk of steel that has a volume of 35,000cm3 and its temperature changes from -15C to 85C . <p> For liquids , we think of volume expansion only . Again , experiments have shown that the volume expansion , ? V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vi , the change in temperature ? T , and a constant called the " coefficient of volume expansion of the liquid , . " Typical values for may be found in Table 1 . <p> The formula for the thermal expansion of liquids is therefore : ? V = Vi ? T. <p> Solving for yields : = ? V / ( Vi ? T ) . This means that is the change in liquid volume per unit volume per unit change in its temperature . <p> Example 20 : A kettle contains a gallon ( 3875 cm3 ) of water at 21C . It is brought to boil at 99C . Calculate the final volume of the water in it . <p> 12 ) The term Lia ? T is therefore ( a ) the overall change in length ( b ) the change in the initial length ( c ) both a &amp; b . <p> 13 ) The reason we may simply use 2a for the area expansion of a solid sheet is that , in the derivation , the term ( ?

It allows us to cope by giving us the skills to know when we need information and where to locate it effectively and efficiently .

For example , Walmart.com is the consumer site , and WalmartStores.comis the Corporate site . A couple of Web sites to find appropriate corporate Web sites are Yahoo Finance and Google Finance . When looking for investor information , you may need to use a website 's " Site Map " to find the Corporate information .

@@21347179 @1347179/ <p> Work ( W ) : Work is defined as the product of parallel force and distance . W = Fll x . Flldenotes the component of force F that is parallel to displacement , x . <p> The SI unit for work is Nm called " Joule " , and the American unit is " lb-ft . " <p> If the direction of F is parallel to that of x , the work done is simply W = F xas in the following example . <p> Example 1 : Find the work done by force F = 25N in pushing the block a distance of 14m . <p> If an object placed on a horizontal surface is pushed or pulled by force F as shown below , the component of F that is parallel to x does useful work.The component perpendicular to x does no work . <p> Example 2 : A block is pulled a distance of x = 24m from A to B as shown via force F = 45N that makes a 30.0 angle with the horizontal surface . Calculate the work done by F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 45N , Fll= 45N cos ( 30.0 ) = 39N . <p> W = Fll x ; W = ( 39N ) ( 24m ) =940 Nm or , W = 940 J. <p> Example 3 : In the figure shown , find ( a ) the magnitude of F such that the block slides at constant speed to the right . ( b ) Find the work done by this force if the displacement is 38 m . <p> Example 4 : In Example 3 , find the work done by the frictional force , Fk , within the same distance . <p> Solution:Fk acts opposite to x ; therefore , it does negative work . In other words , it consumes energy . <p> Wfriction = Fk x ; W = ( -45N ) ( 38m ) = -1700 J. <p> Energy : Energy is defined as the ability to do work.Energy and work are expressed in same units . Typical units are , Joule and lb-ft , as were mentioned above . Other units are : Calorie and kilocalorie ( that you will learn in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be discussed under electric energy ) . The abbreviations for these units are:cal , kcal , and eV . <p> Types of Energy : Energy ( the ability of doing work ) exists in different forms such as mechanical , electric , nuclear , light , chemical , etc ... . In this chapter , mechanical energy will be discussed only . Heat energy is also a topic of Physics I that will be discussed in Chapter 12 . <p> Mechanical Energy:Kinetic energy , Gravitational potential energy , and elastic ( spring ) potential energy are forms of mechanical energy and will be discussed under this topic . <p> I ) Kinetic Energy ( K.E. ) : Kinetic energyis the energy that a mass ( an object ) has because of itsmotion . As long as an object moves or has some speed , it has kinetic energy.K.E. is proportional to mass ( M ) and proportional to the square of velocity ( v2 ) . Its formula is : ( without proof in this course ) <p> K.E. = ( 1/2 ) Mv2 <p> Example 5 : Calculate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a ) at 10.0m/s , ( b ) 20.0 m/s , and ( c ) 30.0 m/s . <p> As can be seen , the car 's kinetic energy varies with the square of velocity ( v2 ) . <p> II ) Gravitational Potential Energy ( P.E. ) : This energy is the type that an object has due to its elevation with respect to a reference level . This energy is significant when objects are in the vicinity of planets , stars and other heavenly masses . Gravitational P.E . is proportional to the acceleration of gravity ( g ) of the planet or star , the mass of the object , M , and its elevation ( h ) from a reference level . Its formula is therefore , <p> P.E . = Mgh . <p> Example 6 : A rock of mass 6.1 kg is raised to the top of a building 13 m high . Calculate its gravitational P.E . with respect to the ground . <p> Example 7 : In the figure shown , a 95-kg crate is pushed up on an incline that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a 31 angle with the horizontal floor . Calculate the P.E . of the crate with respect to the floor when it reaches the top of the incline . <p> Example 8 : A swimming pool is on the top of a hill at an average elevation of 150m from a certain ground level . The swimming pool has dimensions:15m X 25m X 2.4m and is full . The mass density of water is 1.000 ton/m3 . Determine ( a ) the P.E . of the water in the pool with respect to that level . If the pool is allowed to empty to the ground level , ( b ) how much energy is at most available for use ? If a generator uses this energy for electricity production , and the overall efficiency is 62% , ( c ) how much electric energy will become available ? <p> Example 9 : A 750-kg car is traveling at a velocity of 72 km/h eastward and on a level road . Determine ( a ) its initial kinetic energy ( K.E. ) i . If this car is slowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b ) its final ( K.E. ) f . ( c ) How much is the change in its kinetic energy and where does this energy go ? <p> This energy is consumed by force of friction ( brakes force , for example ) that acts opposite to the direction of motion . In fact , it is the work done by force of friction . Most of this energy converts to heat and warms up the brakes . Friction does negative work . <p> Example 10 : In Example 8 , the work done by force of friction is -112,000J . Use the work formula to calculate the force applied by friction if brakes were used within a distance of 56m . <p> 18 ) A car in neutral with a certain initial velocity , can go up a hill by ( a ) gaining K.E. and losing P.E . ( b ) gaining P.E . and losing K.E. ( c ) none of a or b.click here <p> 19 ) When the speed of a car is doubled , it K.E. ( a ) doubles ( b ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speed of a car is tripled , it K.E. ( a ) triples ( b ) becomes 9 times greater ( c ) quadruples . <p> Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem : <p> This theorem simply states that " the work done by the net force acting on a mass is equal to the change in the kinetic energy of that mass . " <p> The mathematical formula for this theorem is : ( SF ) x = ? ( K.E. ) . <p> ( SF ) x = ( K.E. ) f - ( K.E. ) i . <p> The previous two examples combined show an application of this theorem . In Example 8 , the change in the kinetic energy of the car was calculated . In Example 9 , the work done by the net force was involved . The change in K.E. were set equal to the work done by force of friction , from which the force of friction was calculated . This shows that when energy is lost in one form , it appears in another form . One side of this formula calculates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a distance x . The other side shows the change in the K.E .. Both sides are expressed in units of energy , however . <p> Example 11 : A 900. -kg car traveling at 15m/s changes its speed to 25m/s in a distance of 50. m due to a net force . Calculate ( a ) the net force , and ( b ) the engine force if the frictional forces add up to 1400N . <p> Example 12 : A boy pushes a 45.0-kg sled ( including his friend in it ) from rest for a distance of 12.0m with a horizontal and constant force of 165.0N . The frictional force between the sled and snow is 55.0N . Calculate ( a ) the work done by the boy on the sled , ( b ) the work done by the frictional force on the sled , ( c ) the work done by the net force on the sled , and ( d ) the speed of the sled at the end of the 12.0-m distance . <p> This law states that " Energy is conserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one form to another " . Of course , this is true from the Universe point of view . From our point of view , when energy is converted to heat via friction , it is a loss . For example , when we push a heavy crate up a ramp ( or incline ) onto a truck , we do some work . Part of the work stores as P.E . in the elevated crate , and the remaining work converts to heat due to friction . It is not difficult to experimentally verify that <p> the work done on the crate = the P.E . stored in the crate + the work consumed for friction . <p> From our point of view , the work consumed for friction is a loss . From the Universe point of view , the work consumed for friction returns to nature in the form of heat and there is no loss . <p> Conservation of Mechanical Energy : <p> In the absence of frictional energy losses , the total mechanical energy of a system remains constant.We can always write down an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process in which mechanical energy changes from one form to another , even if some energy is lost due to friction . The following examples apply the law of conservation of energy to a system or an object.Conservation of energy requires total energy to remain constant . <p> Example 13 : In the figure shown , neglecting friction , find the speed of the 750-kg car at the bottom of the hill . Suppose the car is put in neutral and starts from rest from the top of the hill . <p> Conservation of mechanical energy requires that <p> Total Energy at A = Total Energy at B. <p> ( K.E. ) A + ( P.E. ) A = ( K.E. ) B + ( P.E. ) B. <p> ( 1/2 ) MVA2 + M g hA = ( 1/2 ) MVB2 + M g hB . <p> Since VA = 0 and also hB = 0 , we get : <p> M g hA = ( 1/2 ) MVB2 . <p> M 's cancel and we get : <p> g hA = ( 1/2 ) VB2 . <p> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Example 14 : In the figure shown , if 120,000J of energy is consumed by frictional forces , find the speed of the 750-kg car at the bottom of the hill . Suppose the car is put in neutral and starts from rest from the top of the hill . <p> In this case , part of the available energy will be wasted by friction . <p> Conservation of mechanical energy requires that <p> Total Energy at A - Wfriction = Total Energy at B. <p> ( K.E. ) A + ( P.E. ) A- Wfriction = ( K.E. ) B + ( P.E. ) B. <p> ( 1/2 ) MVA2 + M g hA-120,000J = ( 1/2 ) MVB2 + M g hB . <p> Since VA = 0 and also hB = 0 , we get : <p> M g hA-120,000J = ( 1/2 ) MVB2 . <p> Not every term has M ; therefore , M 's do not cancel . <p> ( 750 ) ( 9.8 ) ( 45 ) J - 120,000 J = 0.5(750kg)VB2 . <p> 562(m/s)2 = VB2 . <p> VB= @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown , find ( a ) the work done by the frictional force on the car as it coasts down the hill in neutral , ( b ) the energy loss due to friction , and ( c ) the speed of the 750-kg car ( VB ) at the bottom of the hill . <p> Example 17 : Calculate the amount of work or energy that a 4.50hp electric motor can deliver in 10.0 hours . <p> Solution : P = 4.5hp = ( 4.50 ) ( 746 watts ) = 3360 watts or ( J /s ) . <p> P = W / t ; W = Pt ; W = ( 3360 J/s ) ( 36,000s ) = 1.21 x 108 J. <p> Efficiency : When a device receives power from a source , it does not deliver all of it in the intended form and converts a portion of it to other undesired forms . This makes a device to be less than 100 percent efficient . For example , a typical car receives chemical energy in the form of gasoline . The purpose is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion is way below 100 percent . A good portion of the original combustion of gasoline in the cylinders coverts to undesirable heat that has to be transferred to the ambient . Only in the winter time part of it is used to heat up the interior of the car . Electric motors have much better efficiencies . They normally return more than 90% of the electric power delivered to them in useful power . However , the generation of electricity itself is not very efficient . Most power plants have efficiencies of under 50 percent . A good nuclear power plant is about 45% efficient . Early coal plants were hardly 20% efficient.Efficiency of a device is defined as the ratio of power output to the power input for that device . <p> Eff. = Pout / Pin . <p> Example 18 : A 1.25hp electric pump with an efficiency of 92.5% is used to perform 1.40 Mega Joules of work . ( a ) How long does it take for the electric pump to do the job ? ( b ) If it was 100% efficient , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric pump means it draws 1.25hp of electric power from the source . It generally can not give back all of it . Make sure that you write the formulas with horizontal fraction bars . <p> Example 19 : Calculate ( a ) the necessary power to empty a swimming pool with dimensions ( 12m ) ( 25m ) ( 2.4m ) by pumping its water to an average height of 3.5m in 2.5hrs . The mass density of water is 1000. kg/m3 . ( Hint : The power you calculate is the power that the electric pump has to deliver to water ) . If the efficiency of the electric pump used is 88% , calculate ( b ) the electric power that the electric motor pulls from the power source . <p> This means that power is equal to force times velocity ( if both of force and velocity are in the same direction ) . This concept is very familiar . Suppose you want to drive your car at a constant 3000rpm . If you are driving up a hill at 3000 rpm , you must gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater force between the tires and the ground . If you are driving on a flat and horizontal road , 3000rpm can give your vehicle a higher velocity because a smaller force is needed between the tires and the road on a horizontal road . As you see the product of velocity and force is a constant if a constant power is available . When P is constant , the product F+v is constant . When a greater F is needed , a smaller v is attainable and vice versa . <p> Example 20 : A car is using 56hp of its total power . When it is going up a steep hill , a force of 4200N is needed for constant velocity motion of it up that hill . When it is traveling along a level and horizontal road , a force of 1200N is needed for its constant velocity motion . Find the velocity of the car in each case . <p> 1 ) According to Work- K.E. theorem , the work done on mass M by the net force within a distance x is equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M ( b ) the change in the potential energy of mass M ( c ) change in the elevation of mass M. <p> 2 ) When a car moving at velocity V1 uses an engine force Fe within a distance x to change its velocity to V2 , the work done by the engine force is ( a ) Fe x ( b ) V22- V12 ( c ) 1/2MV22.click here <p> 3 ) In Question2 , if the friction force acting on the car is Ff , the work done by the friction force on the car is ( a ) V22- V12 ( b ) 1/2MV22 ( c ) - Ff x.click here <p> 4 ) The work done by the net force acting on the car in Question 2 is ( a ) Fe- Ffx ( b ) MV2 ( c ) both a &amp; b . <p> 5 ) The change in the K.E. of the car in Question 2 is ( a ) ( 1/2 ) MV22- ( 1/2 ) MV12(b) ( 1/2 ) M V22- V12(c) both a&amp;b . <p> Problem : A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The driver speeds it up to 25.0m/s within a distance of 125m . The frictional forces add up to 2800N . Use the Work-K.E. theorem to answer the following questions : <p> 6 ) The change in the K.E. of the truck is ( a ) 6250J ( b ) 250,000J ( c ) 500,000J.click here <p> 7 ) The work done on the truck by the net force acting on it is ( a ) 0 ( b ) Ma ( c ) 250,000J . <p> 8 ) The net force acting on the truck in the x-direction is ( a ) 5000N ( b ) 2000N ( c ) Mg . <p> Problem : A 750-kg car traveling at an initial speed of Vi in the positive x-direction is brought to stop in a distance of 50.0m by applying brakes . The magnitude of the brakes force is 7500N . Note that when brakes are applied , usually the engine force drops to zero ( gas pedal is released ) .

The road becomes uphill and you suddenly become curious as to how high up the hill your car might go if you put it in neutral and let it come to stop on its own . Suppose that you have a good estimate of energy losses due to frictional forces and that is 85500J . Answer the following questions : <p> 18 ) Before starting the uphill and with respect to the horizontal road , your car has ( a ) P.E . only ( b ) K.E. only ( c ) both P.E . and K.E.click here <p> 20 ) In the absence of friction , at any intermediate point before your car comes to stop , the total energy ( P.E . + K.E. ) of your car would be ( a ) constant ( b ) increasing ( c ) decreasing.click here <p> 21 ) In the absence of energy loss due to friction , the P.E . of your car at the highest point it can go , will be equal to ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its K.E. at the starting point ( c ) neither a , nor b . <p> 22 ) The car 's K.E. at the start of the hill is 292500J.

At normal power , in going up a hill , a force of 15000N must be delivered to the tires to maintain a constant velocity .

When preparing a presentation , first consider developing a lengthier and more complete Word file to most effectively convey the information . Then from that document develop a PowerPoint slideshow highlighting bullet ' points and an outline of the ideas in the live presentation . <h> Step One : Establish the Slide Layout <p> PowerPoint contains a collection of pre-set accessible slide layouts . In order to ensure that the slideshow is maximally accessible use these pre- set templates when constructing the slideshow. - The correct slide layout is probably the most significant step that can be taken to ensure that the slideshow will be accessible . To use a pre-set slide layout , in the- Home tab , choose- New Slide , then pick one of the layouts that makes sense for that slide . <p> Important Note : - Refrain from adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for another area of text on a slide is to either choose a different layout with additional Content Placeholders , or simply add additional Content Placeholders . Adding another Content Placeholder takes more effort than adding a Text Box , but it helps you avoid accessibility problems . If your slide needs additional placeholders , add new placeholders . <h> Step Two : Other Slide Design Considerations <h> Slide Design <p> Use the built-in designs offered in PowerPoint , however please know that not all of these design options have accessible ' color contrast or other design elements . Please ensure that whatever design is chosen meets all the design considerations discussed in this section . <p> To access these design choices , go to the Design tab , and scroll through the options . The number of choices may be expanded by using the drop down menu highlighted below .

To ensure the contrast used is sufficient , refer to the free tools provided on the References page . <h> Animations and Transitions <p> Avoid animation and automatic slide transitions since they : <p> Can be distracting , <p> Can cause screen readers to re-read slides , <p> Can read parts of the slide out of order , and/or <p> May not give users enough time to read slide content . <h> Data Tables <p> In PowerPoint , rows and columns can be styled so they appear as data tables , but one can not add content in a way that will be identified by a screen reader . If the slideshow contains more than the simplest tables , consider saving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adobe Acrobat Pro . <h> Embedded Multimedia <p> If a video is embedded in the PowerPoint slideshow , ensure that it is captioned , and that the player controls are accessible. - If an audio only file is embedded , ensure a transcript is included . <h> Step Three : Use Slide and Outline Views <p> To ensure that the Title and body text are identified correctly in each slide , choose the Outline view . In this view the text and the order in which it will be read by a screen reader can be seen . Text can also be changed directly in the Outline view . Notice that tables , graphics and pictures will not show in Outline view . Any text not in Content Placeholders ( text placed in text boxes ) or in the notes ' section will not appear in the Outline view .

@@21347233 @1347233/ <p> In Chapter 4 , the kinetic of straight line motionwas discussed whereSF = Mawas thekinetic equation.SFwas the net force or the cause of motion , Mor mass was treated as a measure of resistance toward straight line motion , andathe acceleration caused bySF . <p> Here , in Chapter 9 , the kinetic of rotationwill be studied whereST =Iais thekinetic equation for rotation . Here , STstands for the net " torque " that is the cause of rotation , Iis a measure of resistance of an object toward being rotated , andais the angular acceleration caused by the net torqueST . <p> Rotational kinetic deals with thecause of rotation that is torque . In order to cause rotation in an object , torquemust be applied . If the applied torque causes rotation , the relation between the applied torque and the pace of generated rotation is the basis of rotational kinetic . If rotation does not occur , the applied torque is often referred to as the " moment " or the " bending moment . " The first topic to study is " the moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a force . " <p> Torque or Moment of a Force : <p> When a force is applied to the handle of a wrench ( normally perpendicular to it ) , the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the center of the bolt is called the " torque " or the " moment " of that force . Mathematically , torque is the product of a force and a perpendicular distance , or torque is the product of a perpendicular force and a distance.Torque may be eitherclockwise(cw) , orcounterclockwise(ccw) . By convention , ccw is usually taken to be positive , and therefore cw torque is negative . Because of having direction , torque is a vectorquantity . <p> The SI unit for torque is Nm . In both American systems , torque is expressed in ft-lb . <p> The following figure shows the same force F applied to different points of a wrench handle . It shows how torque varies from maximum to zero if the perpendicular distance varies from maximum to zero.If you were to open the bolt shown , you would n't push the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would naturally do it as shown in ( 1 ) , correct ? <p> Example 1:In the figure shown , find thetorque offorceFabout pointA , the point at which the beam is fixed into the wall . <p> If more than one force is generating torque on an object , thenthe sum of torquesorthe net torqueshould be calculated . <p> Example 2 : In the figure shown , find thenet torqueof the forces shown about pointA , the point at which the beam is fixed into the wall . <p> In this problem the overall torque , bending moment , or tendency of rotation is clockwise as the ( - ) in -11.5Nmindicates . <p> Example 3:In the figure shown , find thenet torqueof the forces shown about pointB , the point at which the beam is fixed into the wall . <p> In this problem the torque , bending moment , or tendency of rotation is clockwise as the ( - ) in-25Nmindicates . <p> Example 4:In the figure shown , find thetorque offorceF = 25N at 54oabout pointA . Hint : Resolve the force into two components : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As you may have noticed , it is possible to draw a perpendicular line from PointAto vector25N sin54o . The length of the perpendicular line becomes1.6m . If you decide to draw a perpendicular line fromAto vector25N cos54o , you need to first extend the vector from its tail to the left . Doing this makes the extension to pass throughA . PointAfalls on the extended vector and makes the perpendicular line to have a length of0 . <p> Example 5:In the following 4 figures , determine ( a ) the case for which the torque of the 10-N force is maximum and explain why . ( b ) What is the value of torque about point D in Fig. 4 ? ( c ) How do you determine the perpendicular distance d ? <p> Solution : ( a ) The case inFig. 1 , has the maximum torque because the magnitude of the applied force is the same for all cases , but the perpendicular distance inFig. 1is the greatest . That makes the torque inFig.1 maximum . <p> ( b ) Zero , because the perpendicular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findd , the line of action of the applied force must be extended , and then from the desired point a line segment be drawn perpendicular to it as shown in Figures 1 through 3 . <p> An object is said to be inrotational equilibriumif thenet torqueacting on itis zerothat means ST = 0 . The torque sum may be taken about any single point on the object or out of it . It is usually taken about a point at which the calculation of perpendicular distances is convenient.ST = 0means that the sum of CW torques equals the sum of CCW torques ; in other words , the total CW tendency of rotation is equal to the total CCW tendency of rotation . <p> Example 7:In the figure shown , findFsuch that the seesaw is in rotational equilibrium . <p> Solution : To begin with , the seesaw just by itself ( without the loads ) is in rotational equilibrium . This is because of the uniformity of the wood plank . The weight of the plank is distributed evenly throughout its length . The weight of its left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case , we may solve the problem without incorporating the weight of the plank . Taking ccw to be positive , we may write : <p> ST = 0 ; +F(2.0m) - ( 430N ) ( 3.5m ) = 0 . ; F = 750N . <p> Example 8:In the figure shown , assume that the beam is weightless and find the unknown forceFthat brings the seesaw in rotational equilibrium . <p> Thecenter of massof an object is the point that all of its mass can be assumed to be concentrated at . For geometrically symmetric objects , such as rectangular boxes , spheres , cylinders , etc. , geometric centeris easily determined . Geometric center is the same thing as the center of symmetry . If the material of an object is uniformly distributed throughout its volume to where it has the same mass density everywhere , the geometric center and the mass center are the same point in that object . In the above two examples , this was the case where the geometric center of the seesaw plank was indeed its center of mass as well.For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same point as the mass center is . <p> For a uniform and rectangular plank of wood , the geometric center or mass center is at its midpoint . It means that all of the mass of such plank can be assumed to be concentrated at its geometric center or its middle . This is specially helpful in the following example : <p> Example 9 : In the figure shown , an8.0-m long 550-N uniformplank of wood is pivoted2.0m off its middleatPto form an unbalanced seesaw . It is then loaded with a 420-N force as shown . Find the magnitude ofFthat keeps the plank in rotational equilibrium . <p> Solution : Note that the 550N force in the figure is the weight of the beam that is shown at G , its middle . Using point P as the reference for summing up the torques , we get : <p> ST = 0 ; F ( 1.0m ) - ( 550N ) ( 2.0m ) - ( 420N ) ( 5.0m ) = 0 ; F = 3200N . <p> Example 10:In the figure shown , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction forceFthat the crate exerts on the lever atB . <p> Solution : As the 300N force pulls end A of the lever to the right , end B wants to move to the left . The crate on the floor stops it and exerts the reaction force F onto it ( to the right ) as shown . The lever will be in rotational equilibrium if no rotation occurs . Taking ccw to be positive and summing the torques acting on the lever ( about point C ) and set it equal to zero for equilibrium , we get : <p> STC = 0 ; -300N(2.0m) + F ( 0.50m ) = 0 ; F = 1200N . <p> Chapter 9 Test Yourself 1 : <p> 1 ) To cause rotation in an object about an axis , ( a ) a force that goes through that axis must be applied ( b ) a force that does not go through that axis must be applied ( c ) a torque must be applied ( d ) b &amp; c.click here . <p> 2 ) Torque is defined as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel distance ( b ) a force and a perpendicular distance ( c ) a force and an angle . <p> 3 ) When the line of action of a force passes through the point about which torque is to be calculated , ( a ) the perpendicular distance is zero ( b ) torque is maximum ( c ) clockwise rotation occurs.click here . <p> 4 ) When the line of action of a force passes through the point about which torque is to be calculated , ( a ) that force does not generate any torque ( b ) that force either pulls that point or pushes it ( c ) both a &amp; b . <p> Problem:A1/2-inch water pipe made of copper has a length of 1.00m and is horizontally fixed into a concrete wall at its left end .

What is left to learn here is the mass moment of inertia ( I ) . <p> Mass moment of Inertia ( I ) : <p> Consider a thin ring of massM and radius Rthat is attached to a vertical rod via a number of ( say 3 ) weightless spokes as shown inFig . A.Also , consider another ring that has the same massMbut a radius of 2Rand with weightless spokes as inFig . B. <p> If each vertical rod ( axis of rotation ) , Figures A &amp; B , is held with two fingers and twisted with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be felt that it takes 4 times more torque to twist the system with M at 2R than it takes to twist the system with M at R. <p> This can be measured ( verified ) by experiment and proved mathematically . In Fig . B , if a ring of radius 3R is used instead , keeping the same mass , the task of rotation becomes 9 times more difficult ; in other words , it would take 9 times more torque to accelerate the ring with M at 3R than it takes to accelerate the system at the same rate with M at R. What this means is that the resistance toward rotation of mass M is proportional to the square of radius ( R2 ) . <p> The resistance toward rotation of a thin ring is called the " mass moment of inertia ( I ) of the ring . " It is mathematically written as <p> I = MR2 . <p> The same way that , in straight line motion , the M of an object is a measure of its resistance toward being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotational motion , the I of an object is a measure of its resistance toward being angularly accelerated and <p> ST = Ia . <p> Mass Moment of Inertia of a Thin Ring : <p> The mass moment of inertia of a thin ring about itscentroidal axisis given by <p> I = MR2 . <p> The " centroidal axis " is an axis that is perpendicular to the plane of a ring and passes through its center . The vertical rods in the above figures are centriodal axes . <p> Mass Moment of Inertia of a Solid Disk : <p> A solid disk of radiusRmay be thought as a combination of infinite number of thin rings which radii range fromzero toR.Of course , as we go from the inner rings to the outer ones , each ring has more mass as well as a greater radius that makes its corresponding ( I ) increasingly greater . To find the total ( I ) for all rings , calculus must be employed and integration performed . The result is:I = ( 1/2 ) MR2 . Again , this is good only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Notethat for a solid disk , Mis several times greater than that of a thin ring of the same radius and material . <p> Example 11:A1.50-kg thin ring is connected to weightless spokes of length45.0 cmand then attached to a vertical rod ( axis ) that is free to rotate as shown inFig . Aabove . The apparatus is initially at rest . The vertical axis is then given a twist by a constant net torque of 6.08Nmfor a period of2.00 seconds . Find ( a ) the angular acceleration of the spinning ring , and ( b ) the angle it travels within the2.00-sec.period . Assume frictionless rotation . <p> Solution : ( a ) The mass moment of inertia ( I ) , or the resistance toward rotation for a ring is I = MR2 . <p> I = MR2 ; I = ( 1.50 kg ) ( 0.45 m ) 2 ; I = 0.304 kg m2 ( in SI ) . <p> ST= Ia ; 6.08Nm = ( 0.304kg m2 ) a ; a = 20.0 rd/s2 . <p> ( b ) q= ( 1/2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rd . <p> Example 12:A 255-kg solid disk of radius 0.632m is free to spin about a frictionless axle-bearing system in a vertical plane as shown .

If you hold the mouse on the mirror itself where it crosses the main axis , you can move it left or right and place it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focal length for it . If you place the mouse on F and move it left or right , the focal length changes and so does the radius ( or the location of C accordingly because R = 2f ) . As you move F , the concavity of the mirror changes . The more concave a mirror gets , the shorter its focal length becomes . We are going to think of ( mm ) as the unit of length in this experiment ; therefore , if the applet says f = 100.0 , it means f = 100.0mm . On this basis , each square on the applet is 20mmX20mm . <p> Important : In the Mirror 's Formula , all distances are measured from the mirror itself for the formula to predict correctly . <p> Experiment : <p> Part 1 , Concave Mirror ( Converging Mirror ) : <p> Make sure that the converging mirror is exactly in the middle ( 20 squares on the left and 20 squares on the right of it ) . Set F ( the Focal Point ) at120mm , or let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure it reads f = 120mm . <p> Place the mouse at the tip of the object ( the red arrow ) and make its height equal to 4 squares or 80.0mm .

Check the values of y ( the object height ) , and do on the top to assure their correctness . <p> Measure ( Estimate ) the position of di on the applet and record your estimate in Table 1 . Estimate the height of the image , y ' , on the applet and record your estimate in Table 1 . These will be your measured values . In estimation , each square has a length of 20.0mm . <p> Use the given values of do and f to calculate the expected di . This will be the accepted value for di . Use this di and do to find the magnification , M. Then use the magnification , M to calculate y ' ( the image height ) . This will be the accepted value for y ' . Record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object height of y = 80.0mm , and f = 120mm , repeat the above steps for the following do values : do = 240.0mm , 170.0mm , 130.0mm , 121.0mm , 119.0mm , and 70.0mm . Note:In cases that the image goes out of screen , just calculate the accepted value for di and y ' , and leave the space for the measured values blank and do not calculate their respective %errors . <p> Part 2 , Convex Mirror ( Diverging Mirror ) : <p> Change the mirror to a convex one by clicking on the " Convex Mirror " in the top left dropdown window . A convex Mirror appears . With the mouse , place the mirror exactly at the16th square from the right side of the screen . The screen is 60squares wide . Now , there must be exactly 16 squares to the right of the mirror and 44 to its left . <p> Move the virtual focal point F to 8 squares from the mirror such that f = 160.0mm . This places the virtual center of the mirror at the rightmost edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure the applet reads the same . Of course , you know that the focal point and focal length of a convex mirror are both virtual . The f to be used in calculations is actually f = -160.0mm . <p> Keeping the object height still at y = 80.0mm , move the object to 3 squares from the mirror at do = 60.0mm . Double-check your readings for f , do , and y . <p> Again , measure ( estimate ) di and y ' . These will be your measured ( estimated ) values . <p> Using do , f , and y , calculate the accepted values for di , M , and y ' . <p> Finally calculate the necessary %errors . <p> Keeping the same object height of y = 80.0mm , and f = -160.0mm , repeat the above steps for the following do values : do = 120.0mm , 230.0mm , 320.0mm , 500.0mm , and 720.0mm .

It applies to some devices , and does not apply to others . Ohms law applies when the ratio V/I is independent of the current I. <p> Procedure : <p> i ) Multi-meters : <p> Multi-meters can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and electricresistance . In addition , multi-meters may be capable of other functions , but for now , we will concentrate on the measurement of these three physical quantities . In this experiment , we will learn how to read a multi-meter when it is on the following settings : <p> -Resistance setting <p> -dc Voltage setting ( Battery ) <p> -ac Voltage setting ( City electric outlet ) <p> -dc Current setting ( Battery ) <p> -ac Current setting ( City electric outlet current type ) <p> Note that " dc " stands for direct current ( a current that does not change direction ) , and " ac " stands for alternating current ( a current whose direction changes ) . <p> ( a ) Resistance Measurement : <p> Place the meter on its highest Resistance setting . Then connect each of its terminals to one end of a ceramic resistor . For reading a resistance , it does not matter which terminal is connected to which end of the resistor . If no reading is displayed , lower the setting until a reading is obtained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one setting in the ohm range . Use the one with the best number of significant figures . Repeat this procedure until all resistances are measured and the values of the resistances are written down . Next , use a Color Codes Chart to determine the resistances of the same resistors . Compare the results for each resistor and calculate a percent difference using the following formula : <p> ( b ) DC Voltage Measurement : <p> To read a fixed voltage such as that across the terminals of a battery , a voltmeter must be set in an appropriate range in its " --V " settings . This is a symbol for dc voltage . Set the multi-meter at the appropriate safe range for measuring the voltage across the dc power source . The appropriate safe range is determined by looking at the maximum voltage a power supply or a battery can offer . For example , a 12 V car battery can supply at most 14 volts and the appropriate range on the meter is the 20 V setting . If we choose the 2 V setting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connect the terminals of the power source to the appropriate terminals of the multi-meter ( Positive to Positive , and Negative to Negative ) . The Negative on the meter is also labeled as " COM " for common . Increase and decrease the voltage of the source , and observe how the readings on its meter as well as those on the multi-meter change . Try to adjust the voltage , as read from the meter on the power supply , to 2 V , 4 V , and 7 V , as closely as you can . Each time , read the same voltages from the multi-meter . For each , calculate a percent difference by using equation ( 2 ) . <p> ( c ) AC Voltage Measurement : <p> Under the supervision of your lab instructor , set the multi-meter to its 200 V ac setting . The ac setting on the multi-meter is shown as " V " . Make sure that one wire is connected to COM and the other to POS on the multi-meter . Next , insert the wires ( with needle-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For ac measurements , it does not matter which wire goes into which terminal . ) Write down the ac voltage you read . If you see some fluctuations , it is because of the changes in demand by all users . Users keep turning off and on different electric devices . <p> ( d ) Direct Current Measurement : <p> Measuring current is different from measuring voltage . For voltage , we say " voltage across a power source or a resistor , " but for current , we say " current through a source or a resistor . " Suppose you want to measure the voltage across R1 in the following circuit : <p> Fig. 1 <p> To do this , you need to first set the multi-meter to the appropriate dc voltage setting and then connect its terminals to points a and b ( across the resistor ) as shown in the following figure : <p> Fig. 2 <p> We say that the voltmeter is connected across the resistor . <p> In order to measure the current , the circuit must be opened ( disconnected ) first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be placed into the circuit as shown in Fig. 4 . Note that an appropriate ( safe ) current setting must be selected because the multi-meter is now being used as an ammeter . First , the circuit is opened . <p> Fig. 3 <p> Next , the ammeter is placed into the circuit . <p> Fig. 4 <p> Now that you have paid attention to the way a multi-meter measures current , connect the power source ( turned off ) , a 100 O resistor , and a multi-meter ( set at an appropriate current setting ) in series as shown above ( Fig. 4 ) . <p> The appropriate current setting can be determined by estimating the amount of current , in amperes , that goes through R1 , by dividing the voltage ( 5 V ) by the resistance ( 100 O ) . The result is 0.05 A. Multiply by 1000 to convert to milliamperes ( mA ) . We get 50 mA . Any range on the multi-meter that can measure more that 50 mA will be safe . Some multi-meters may have 100 mA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you are sure of the correct milliamperes setting , and also sure that the power source gives the desired voltage , turn on the power source and read the current displayed by the ammeter . If the displayed current is close to 50 mA , you have done it right . <p> Calculate a percent error between the current you read from the ammeter ( Measured value ) and the calculated value ( Accepted value ) of 50 mA . The formula for percent error is <p> It is important to always remind yourself of the way current is to be measured . The circuit or branch through which the current is to be measured must be opened first , and then the ammeter must be inserted into that branch . <p> ( e ) Alternating Current Measurement : <p> Some multi-meters are capable of measuring alternating currents and some are not . If they are designed to do so , the method of using them for this purpose is similar to measuring dc . However , " clamp ammeters " are used to measure ac . AC measurements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohms Law ( The main experiment ) <p> Arrange a circuit as shown in Fig. 5 . Note that the voltmeter reads the voltage across R , and the ammeter reads the current through R. If you change the rheostat setting , the total resistance will change , and with a relatively fixed voltage ( supplied by the battery ) , the current I will change . The change in the current I through R causes the voltage across R to change . However , you will see that the ratio V/ I remains constant . <p> Fig. 5 <p> Move the slider on the rheostat to five different positions , and for each position , measure the voltage across and current through R , and write down their values in the following table : <p> Rheostat Position <p> Current I ( A ) <p> Voltage V ( volts ) <p> R = V / I ( O ) <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> 5 <p> Mean <p> Plot the results on a V versus I graph .

@@21347256 @1347256/ <p> A few tuning forks , a mallet , a resonance tube apparatus , and a calculator <p> Theory : <p> Sound is a longitudinal wave that travels at a speed of v = 331m/s at STP conditions . A longitudinal wave is one that oscillates parallel to its propagation direction . The way an induced disturbance travels in a slinky is a longitudinal wave motion . At a frequency ( f ) that we speak or sing ( Audio range : 200Hz 2000 Hz ) , the wavelength ( ? ) of a sound wave is in the range of ( 150cm 15cm ) . This may be verified by using the wave speed formula : <p> v = f ? <p> Resonance of Sound Waves in Open and Closed Tubes : <p> In music , a tube open at both ends is called an open tube , and a tube open at one end only forms a closed tube as shown below : <p> Maximum deviation of a wave from equilibrium is called amplitude . For a sound wave , maximum deviation can only occur at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right length , this happens and is associated with an intensified loudness called resonance . This is because of the fact that at an open end , air molecules are free to oscillate back and forth . At a closed end , air molecules are not free to perform wide oscillations . In other words , closed ends can form nodes and open ends can form antinodes . <p> The following figures show how maximum and minimum oscillations occur at open and closed ends for a certain wavelength at different tube lengths : <p> Note that , for simplicity , representation of transverse waves are used to show states of maximum and minimum oscillation at open and closed ends . Sound waves ; however , are longitudinal and oscillate back and forth parallel to the tube 's length and not up and down as shown . These figures only indicate where maxima and minima occur . <p> As can be seen from the above figures , the length of a tube must be multiples of ? /4 for an anti-node ( maximum ) to occurat its any open end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the tube 's length is an even multiple of ? /4 , each open end forms an anti-node and resonance is heard . <p> For a closed tube ( right figure ) , when the tube 's length is an odd multiple of ? /4 , resonance occurs . <p> In this experiment , a closed tube will be used . It will be seen that when the length of the tube is an odd multiple of a certain length , the tube is in resonance and intensified sound is heard . <p> At this point , it is suitable to repeat the definitions of wavelength and frequency . <p> Wavelength : Wavelength , ? , is defined as the distance from one peak to the next one on a wave . Of course , in general , wavelength is the distance between two successive points on a wave that are in the same state of oscillation . <p> Frequency : Frequency , f , is the number of waves ( full ? s ) generated per second . <p> Procedure : <p> 1 ) Obtain a resonance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows a variable length closed pipe , as shown below . <p> Fig. 1 <p> 2 ) Hit a tuning fork of a known frequency with the rubber end of the mallet to make it oscillate . This should be done away from the pipes opening so that it does n't  hit the glass tube causing it to break . While one student is holding the oscillating fork at about + to1 inch from the pipes opening , another student may pull the piston 's handle out and increase the pipe length until resonance is heard . A few trials and adjustments may be needed to locate the best length of the pipe at which the loudest possible sound can be heard . <p> 3 ) Read the pipes length from the meter-stick and record it as L1 .

One empirical rule states that when 0.6D ( D = pipe 's internal diameter ) is subtracted from each of L1 and L2 , the ? found from each of L1 and L2 gives great results in the calculation of the speed of sound . By subtracting L1 from L2 , the 0.6D 's are cancelled automatically , and there is no need to measure the inner diameter of the tube and subtract it from each of L1 and L2 . <p> 7 ) Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used to find the measured value for v , the speed of sound.Of course , f is the frequency of the tuning fork used . <p> 8 ) For accepted value of v , the empirical formula v(T) = 331 + 0.6T m/s may be utilized .

@@21347268 @1347268/ <h> Experiment 9 <h> Introduction to the Oscilloscope <p> To learn how to operate an oscilloscope and use it for signal analysis of different parts of an electronic circuit <p> Equipment : <p> A laboratory oscilloscope , two function generators , a few regular connecting wires , and a few oscilloscope connecting wires <p> Theory : <p> Traditionally , an oscilloscope is made of a cathode-ray tube ( CRT ) in which a heating element at the back end of it releases electrons . These electrons are accelerated toward the front end of the tube due to a high positive voltage . A collimator first makes a narrow beam of the accelerating electrons . The front ( screen ) of the tube is coated with a phosphor and becomes luminous when high-speed electrons collide with it . A narrow beam of electrons arriving at the screen leaves a bright spot at its center . Between the negative end ( cathode ) and the positive end ( anode ) , there are two pairs of deflection plates . Each pair consists of two parallel plates similar to a parallel-plate capacitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other in a vertical position ( see Fig. 1 ) . When the horizontal pair is connected to a fixed voltage , it imposes a uniform and vertical electric field to the traveling electrons that are to pass between its plates , causing them to deflect in the vertical direction . If the vertical pair of plates is connected to a fixed voltage , it imposes a uniform and horizontal electric field to the traveling electrons that are to pass between its plates , causing them to deflect in the horizontal direction . Therefore , by adjusting the voltage across these two pairs of plates , it is possible to guide the electron beam in any desired direction , and therefore control the position of the bright spot on the screen . <p> Fig. 1 : A schematic diagram of an oscilloscope <p> If the horizontal pair is given a sinusoidal voltage , the spot performs a sinusoidal motion on the screen in the vertical direction . If the frequency of oscillations is a few cycles per second ( Hz ) , the up-and-down motion can be followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 Hz or more , only a vertical line will appear to the eyes , as shown in Fig. 2 . <p> The same would be true in the horizontal direction if a sinusoidal voltage were applied across the vertical pair of plates of the oscilloscope ( see Fig. 3 ) . <p> Sweep : <p> In order to be able to show real sinusoidal signals or graphs on the screen , each oscilloscope has a built-in sweep function that causes the spot to move in the horizontal direction . The role of the sweep function is to move the spot from left to right at a desired constant speed , and return it to the left almost immediately . This is done by the sweep function in the oscilloscope . There is a knob on every oscilloscope that allows users to select a sweeping speed . If a sweep of 5 seconds is selected , for example , it takes the spot 5 seconds to travel horizontally from left to right . If a sweep of 1 second is selected , the travel time will be 1 second . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sinusoidal voltage of frequency 1 per second is given to the horizontal plates ( vertical motion ) , the oscilloscope then draws one cycle of a sinusoid across the screen every second , as shown in Fig. 4 . <p> Fig. 4 : Sweep Frequency = 1/sec . Vert . Oscill . Frequency = 1/sec . <p> Fig. 5 : Sweep Frequency = 1/sec . Horiz .. Oscill . Frequency = 3/sec . <p> If the frequency of the vertical oscillations is 3 per second , then 3 cycles appear in the width of the screen , as shown in Fig. 5 . At a low frequency ( 1/s or 3/s ) of the vertical motion , only the drawing process of figures 4 and 5 appears on the screen in every sweep . <p> To see a non-vanishing waveform in each sweep , both the vertical and the sweep frequencies must be at least 20 per second ( 20 Hz ) . That way , before a drawing vanishes , another one replaces it , and it appears continuous to our eyes . <p> Function Generator : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few types of functions at different frequencies . Typical functions are : sinusoidal , rectangular , and saw-tooth . These are shown below : <p> A function generator may be set at different frequencies by the self-explanatory knobs or buttons on its console . Another knob is usually provided for fine adjustments . In the absence of an equipment manual , you may address your questions to your lab instructor . <p> Procedure : <p> A. Features <p> Make sure that the oscilloscope is connected to the power outlet . Locate the power on/off switch on the oscilloscope and turn it on . Wait a few seconds for the filament to warm up and cast a bright spot on the screen . <p> Locate the knob that adjusts the brightness , and make the spot visible , but not too bright , by changing the intensity of the beam . <p> Locate the focus knob , and focus the spot . <p> Locate the knob that sets the sweep function rate . Turn it step by step and observe how the sweep speed changes . When the sweep speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your eyes . You can also notice the quick return of the spot back to the right after each sweep . <p> Set the sweep function to zero , causing the spot to be stationary . Locate the knob that adjusts the horizontal position of the spot , and bring the spot to the middle . Also locate the knob that adjusts the vertical position of the spot , and bring the spot to the origin of the existing coordinate system on the screen . <p> Step by step , increase the sweep frequency . Try all possible speeds . Also decrease the sweep frequency step by step , and set the sweep at the frequency of 1/s . <p> Obtain a function generator . Examine its function types as well as possible frequencies . Connect it to an electric outlet and turn it on . Use the special cable that connects the function generator to the oscilloscope and make the connection . Set the generator at the frequency of 1/s and select the sine function shape . <p> On the oscilloscope locate the knob that adjusts the amplitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limits of the screen . Of course , oscilloscopes can be calibrated to read the correct voltage . For now , a qualitative study of how oscilloscopes operate is the main purpose of this experiment . After this adjustment , you should see that the spot draws a full sinusoidal cycle on the screen every second . <p> 9 . If you change the frequency of the function generator to 2/s or 3/s , 2 or 3 cycles will be drawn on the screen every second . <p> Set the sweep function at 100/s , and at the same time set the function generator at 100/s as well . You will see that a single-cycle display appears almost stationary after some minor adjustments . <p> Set the function generator at 300/s with the sweep function still at 100/s . You should observe 3 full cycles ( almost stationary ) , after some minor adjustments . <p> Try other frequencies of both the sweep function and the function generator , and write down your observations . Record these observations in your lab report . <p> B. Lissajous Figures <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voltage is connected to the horizontal motion , interesting curves appear that are called n++Lissajousn++ figures . <p> Disable the sweep function by setting it to a ZERO sweep . <p> Connect another function generator to the horizontal motion terminals . <p> Set the frequencies of both function generators ( vertical and horizontal ) equal , at 100 Hz , for example . Make sure that the oscillations in both directions are within the display .

( c ) If you hold the N-pole of the magnet and approach the loop by its S-pole what current direction do you expect ? ( d ) when you pull your hand back what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts and then to check your answerclick here . <p> Inductors : <p> An inductor is a coil of wire.We have already learned thatany current carryingcoilhas magnetic properties . In fact , an inductor is a device that stores magnetic energy . <p> Inductors Resist or Respond to Current Changes : <p> Any time the current in an inductor is set to change , the inductor resists that change by developing an opposing voltage . As soon as a coil is connected to a battery , the current in the circuit changes from0toIby an amount ? I. The current change ? Icauses a ? Bthat causes a flux change ? Fmin the coil . The flux change ? Fmcauses a voltage to develop across the coil other than the battery voltage.The developed voltage has an opposite polarity compared to the battery voltage ( Lenz 's law ) . Experiment shows that the shorter the connection time ? t , the greater the developed opposing voltage across the coil . If we show the change in the applied current per unit of time as ? I/ ? t , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write the proportionality of the two as <p> VL= L ( ? I / ? t ) <p> whereL the " self-inductance " of the inductor is the proportionality constant.Ldepends on the physical characteristics of the inductor.Lactually depends on the number of loops per meter of the inductorn , its lengthl , its loop cross-sectional areaA , ando . The formula for self-inductanceLis <p> L =on2Al <p> TheSI unit forLis O-s called " Henry . " <p> o=4p x 10-7Tm/Ais of course , the permeability of vacuum . <p> Figure 9 <p> The opposing voltage developed by the battery does not last longer thanthe connection time.The connection time is a very small fraction of a second . As soon as the current in the inductor stabilizes and does not change with time , the opposing voltage drops to zero and the inductor behaves as if it does not exist . This is simply because inductors usually have small ohmic resistances and do not cause significant voltage drops in circuits . For this reason , inductors can be used asshort circuitsfor non-varying currents . In brief , theopposing voltage that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? I/ ? t . <p> Example 6 : An 8.0cm long inductor has 1600 loops and adiameterof 4.0cm . Its resistance is 2.4O . Find ( a ) its self-inductance , L.It is connected to a 12V battery and the connection time is known to be 0.0040 seconds . Determine ( b ) its final current , and ( c ) the opposing voltage it develops during connection . <p> Solution : Note thatnis the number of loops per meter or simply theN/lof the inductor . Heren= 1600/0.080m = 20,000 loops/meter . <p> Example 7 : A 250mH inductor is in series with a 5.0O resistor , a key , and a 10.0V battery . The key is turned on and during the current jump from0toits stabilized amount , an opposing voltage of 43.0V is measured . Find the connection time . See the figure shown below . <p> Solution : <p> When current stabilizes , the inductor acts as if it does not existsbecause of its negligible ohmic resistance . The only resistance in the circuit will therefore be only the 5.0O resistor when current stabilizes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10.0V/5.0O = 2.0A . It means current changes from0to 2.0A . <p> UsingVL=L ( ? I/ ? t ) &amp; solving for ? tyields : <p> ? t =L ( ? I/V ) = 0.250H ( 2 - 0 ) A/43.0V =0.012s . <p> Figure 10 <p> This means that the opposing voltage of 43.0V does not last more than 0.012s . It quickly goes to that peak ; then gone ! <p> Alternating Current : <p> When a rectangular loop of wire is spun in a uniform magnetic field , the developed current in the loop moves back and forth in a push-pull manner . The result is called the " alternating current " because the direction of the current keeps alternating or reversing with time . At aconstant angular speed ? , the way current in the spinning coil changes with time is asinusoidal function of time.It means that its mathematical equation is either asineor acosine function of time . The following figures show the variations : <p> Figure 11 <p> Explanation : <p> Suppose the loop starts turningCCWfrom a vertical position with its normal to the loopn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotation , the angle thatnmakes withBis ? = 90o . At this initial vertical position , the magnetic flux through the loop is zero ( cos90o= 0 ) . As the loop turnsCCWto the horizontal position , the normal to the loop ( vectorn ) becomes vertically downward where its angle withBwill be ( ? = 0o ) , and the flux through the loop becomes maximum ( cos0o= 1 ) . Past 90o , the horizontal loop rotates to become vertical . During this 2nd quarter rotation , flux decreases and becomeszerowhen the loop is vertical again at ? =180o.Past180o , the loop 's orientation reverses causing currentIto change direction.Past180o , normal to the loop n starts becoming upward and opposite to B resulting in negative flux . This makes the loop current change direction resulting in an alternating currentthat changes direction every half turn with an equation of the form : <p> V = Vmaxsin ( ? t ) . <p> The graph on the right showshowthe generated voltage across the loop changes with angle ? : V = Vmaxsin ? . <p> Since ? = ? t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This equation gives the loop 's voltage variation as a function of time . <p> Figure 12 <p> The Derivation ofV = Vmaxsin ( ? t ) : ( OPtional ) <p> The voltage generation is the result of the flux changedFmthrough the loops of a coil during time intervaldt . ApplyingFaraday 's law : <p> V = - dFm/dt where Fm= NBAcos ? and ? = ? t , we get : <p> V =-dNBA cos ? t/dt =NBA ? sin ? t. or , <p> V =NBA ? sin ( ? t ) . <p> We write this as V = Vmaxsin ? where Vmax=NBA ? . <p> Note that d/dtcos ( ? t ) = - ? sin ( ? t ) . The factorNBA ? is a constantand is nothing but themaximum voltage , " Vmax . " <p> Question : InV =NBA ? sin ( ? t ) , what would you come up with if you try to find the maximum value ofV ? Of course , you know thatN , B , A , and ? are constants for a certain generator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you determine the maximum value ofVifNBA ? is constant ? <p> Example 8 : The equation of the alternating voltage we get at city electric outlets isV = 170 sin(377t)whereVis expressed involtsandtinseconds . Determine the ( a ) maximum voltage , ( b ) angular frequency , ( c ) frequency , ( d ) period , and ( e ) maximum current if a 12O electric iron is in use . <p> Solution : ( a ) Comparing V = 170 sin(377t)with V = Vmaxsin ( ? t ) , we get : <p> ( a ) Vmax= 170volts ; ( b ) ? = 377rd/s . <p> ( c ) ? = 2pf ; f = ? /2p ; f = 60.0Hz . <p> ( d ) T = 1/f ; T = ( 1/60 ) s ; ( e ) Vmax= R Imax ; Imax = 170V/12O = 14A . <p> Example 9:The rotor winding of an AC-generator is a rectangular coil ( 42cm by 75cm ) that contains 4000loops and rotates in a uniform magnetic field of 0.025T at 3600rpm . Calculate ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equation of its alternating voltage . <p> Solution : ? =3600 ( rev/min ) = 3600 ( 6.28 rd ) / ( 60s ) = 377rd/s . <p> ( a ) Vmax=NBA ? ; Vmax= 4000(0.025T) ( 0.42m ) ( 0.75m ) ( 377rd/s ) = 12,000V . <p> ( b ) V=12,000sin(377t) whereVis involtsandtinseconds . <p> Average Voltage , Average Current , and Average Power : <p> Both voltage and current inAC sourcesare sinusoidal . We may calculate amean valuefor each inone cycle . As you know , a sine function is positive in1/2cycle and negative in the next half cycle.The mean value in each cycle is mathematically zero . Mathematically , the negative half completely cancels the positive half . Of course , ZERO does not reflect the actual value.We know that the overall voltage , current , and power ca n't be zero . One method of calculating theactualmean value for voltage , for example , is to firstsquare its values in each segment , then find the mean value of the squares , and finally take the square root of that mean value . This way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to result in a zero mean value.This method is called " root mean squaring " and such value is called the " root mean square ( rms ) . " <p> On the right , look at the graphs of current and voltage each shown for 2 full cycles.Although the voltage and current are both positive in half cycle and both negative in the next half cycle , their product , the power , remains positive as shown.Using calculus , it is easy to show that therms power is 1/2 of maximum power . <p> Prms= ( 1/2 ) Pmax. ( 1 ) <p> The proof will follow after using thisPrmsto come up with relations forVrmsandIrms . <p> The factor1/2in Eq . ( 1 ) , may be written as : <p> Figure 13 <p> Look at the mean Power that calculus proves to be 1/2 of the max. power . <p> SinceP = VI , we may writeEq. ( 1 ) as <p> VrmsIrms= 0.707 x 0.707 VmaxImax <p> This may be broken intotwo productsas : <p> Vrms = 0.707 VmaxandIrms= 0.707 Imax. ( 2 ) <p> Example 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AC-source . Determine ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) thermsvalues of power , voltage , and current , respectively , ( d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) , the corresponding max values , respectively , and ( g ) the in-use resistance of the light bulb . <p> Solution : ( a ) The 100watt itself isan rms value . Electric devices designed for AC sources are labeled with theirrsm power.Also , the 120VAC itselfis the rms value of voltage . This means that the answers to Parts ( a ) and ( b ) are already given . <p> ( a ) Prms=100w ; ( b ) Vrms=120V . <p> ( c ) Irms= Prms/Vrms= 100w/120V = 0.833A . <p> ( d ) Pmax=2Prms= 200w ; ( e ) Vmax=Vrms/0.707 = 170V . <p> ( f ) Imax=Irms/0.707 = 1.18A . <p> ( g ) Vmax= RImax ; R =170V/1.18amp = 144 O. <p> Transformers : <p> A transformer is an electric device that is used to increase or decrease the voltage of varying sources ( mainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very closely packed and share the same iron core . Sharing the same iron core means sharing the same magnetic fluxFmas well.One coil is called theprimary sideand the other , thesecondary side . When avarying voltageis given to the primary side , an outputvarying voltagedevelops at the secondary side.The input voltage must vary with time . This makes the magnetic fieldBdeveloped at the primary coil vary with time , accordingly . The changes inBcause changes in fluxFm . The changes inFmare sensed or picked up by the secondary coil . As a result avarying voltagedevelops at the terminals of the secondary coil . If the number of loops of the secondary coilNs is more than that of the primary coilNp , it results in a voltage increase at the secondary side and the transformer is called a " step-up transformer . " <p> For actual transformers the voltage ratio still equals the loops ratio ; however , the reciprocal of the currents ratio does not equal the loops ratio . <p> Example 10:For atransformer that is assumed to be ideal , Np= 200and Ns= 3400loops . Its primary side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1.70A . Find the output voltage as well as the output current . <p> Solution:Always : Vs/Vp= Ns/Np ; Vs/7.00 = 3400/200 ; Vs=119V . <p> Currents ratioif ideal : Is/Ip= Np/Ns ; Is/1.70 = 200/3400 ; Is=0.100A . <p> Example 11:Anactualtransformer has Np = 1200and Ns = 100loops . The primary is connected to a 120V AC-source . It draws 2.50A from the source . Find the ( a ) output voltage ( b ) the output current if it were ideal , and ( c ) the efficiency of the transformer if the actual output current is 27.0amps . <p> Solution : ( a ) Vs/Vp= Ns/Np ; Vs/120= 100/1200 ; Vs=10.0V . <p> ( b ) Is/Ip= Np/Ns ; Is/2.5 = 1200/100 ; Is=30.0A . <p> ( c ) The ideal current is(Is)ideal= 30.0Aand only(Is)actual= 27.0A is delivered by this transformer . It is therefore 27/30 = 90.0% efficient . We could also calculate the input and out put powers and then find the ratio as shown below : <p> Eff. = Pout/Pin ; Eff. =27.0A(10.0V)/ ( 2.50A ) ( 120V ) =90.0% . <p> Test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ) a coil of wire ( b ) a closed loop of wire ( c ) an open loop of wire ( d ) a &amp; b.click here . <p> 3 ) An inductor has usually a small ohmic resistance .

@@21347288 @1347288/ <h> Experiment 12 <h> The Line Spectra <h> ( Rydberg Constant ) <p> The objectives are(1) to use the emission spectrum of hydrogen atom in order to verify the relation between energy levels and photon wavelength , and ( 2 ) to calculate Rydberg Constant:R = 1.097x107m-1 . <p> Equipment : <p> A computer with Internet connection , a calculator , a few sheets of paper , and a pencil <p> Theory : <p> When an electron in an atom receives some energy by any means , it moves to a greater radius orbit with an energy level equal to that electron 's energy . Such atom is then said to be in anexcited state . The excited state is unstable however , and the electron returns to lower levels ( orbits ) by giving off its excess energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation ( a photon of light ) . Max Planckshowed that thefrequency fof a **27;1137;TOOLONG two energy levels depends on theenergy differencebetween those two levels given by <p> En- Em= hf <p> where Enis the energy of then-thlevel , Emthe energy of them-thlevel ( lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the emitted photon . <p> Possibilities for the occurrence ofelectron jumpfrom one level to other levels are numerous . It depends on the amount of energy an electron receives . An electron can get energized when a photon hits it , or is passed by another more energetic electron that repels it , or by any other means . Theelectron returncan occur in one step or many steps depending on the amount ( s ) of energy it loses in different steps . In the above figure , for each possibility , thered arrowshows an electrongoing to a higher energy level , and the black arrows show possible return occurrences . <p> Hydrogenis the simplest of atoms . It hasone protonandone electron . This means that although there are so many transitions associated with that single electron of each hydrogen atom , heavier atomsthatcontain more electronswill have much more possible transitions . <p> Note : There are three new links that need to be added to the JAVA safe list : <p> In the above applet , if you click on a higher orbit than where the electron is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electron ( from outside ) to give it energy to go to that higher level . If the electron is already in a higher orbit and you click on a lower orbit , then the electron loses excess energy and gives off a wave signal before going to that lower orbit . <p> Also click on the following LONG ... and try both options of " Particle Mode " and " Wave Mode " . You can put the mouse on the applet near or exactly on any circle and change the orbit of the electron to anywhere you wish ; however , there are only discrete orbits with circumferences that each can accommodate an integer multiple of a certain wavelength . It is at those special orbits that the applet showsprincipal quantum numbersfor the electron on the right side of the applet . <p> InFig. 1 , possible transitions fromground stateE1to other states are shown for hydrogen atom . This simply means:E1toE2 , E1toE3 , E1toE4 , and so on . <p> The possibilities forelectron returnare also shown . The greater the energy difference between two states , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns to lower orbits.If the return is very energetic , the wavelength may be too short to fall in the visible range and can not be seen in spectrometer . <p> On the other hand , some transitions areweakerand result inlarger wavelengthsin theinfrared regionthatcannot be seen either . However , there are some intermediate transitions that fall in thevisible rangeandcan be seen . <p> A hot gas emits light because of the energy it receives by any means to stay hot . As was mentioned earlier , the received energy by an atom sends its electrons to higher levels , and in their returns , the electrons emit light of different wavelengths . The emitted wavelengths can be observed in aprism spectrometerin the form of a few lines of different colors.Each element has its own uniquespectral linesthat can be used as anIDfor that element . Such spectrum coming from ahot gasis called the " emission spectrum . " For ahot gasspectrallines are discrete . <p> For white lightentering a spectrometerthe spectrum is a continuous band of rainbow colors . This continuous band of colors in a spectrometer ranges from violet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue , green , yellow , orange , and red . Light emitted from the Sun contains so many different colors ( or electronic transitions ) that its spectrum gives variety of colors changing gradually from violet to red . It contains so many different violets , blues , greens , yellows , oranges , and reds that it appears continuous . <h> Whenwhite lightpassesthrough a cold gas , that cold gas absorbsonlya certain energy-level photons and let 's the remaining photons pass through.The cold gas absorbs only those photons that it can emit when it is hot . Now , if you are observing the continuous spectrum of a streak of sunlight into a spectrometer , and then place a cold tube of a certain gas in the way of sunlight before entering the spectrometer , the cold gas will absorb those photons that it can normally emit when hot and therefore some dark lines will appear inside the continuous spectrum you were observing before . Thedark linesare called the " absorption spectrum . " It is very interesting to see that the absorption ( dark ) lines happen exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hot and emissive itself . <p> The " Mini Spectroscopy " Applet appears . At the very top it has a dropdown window that allows you chose different hot gases.First Select the hydrogen gas . The very top picture is what you see of hot ( excited ) hydrogen if you view it through a spectrometer . All a spectrometer does is that it passes the received beam of light through a prism causing different colors to separate . It has a scale installed in it that allows the viewer to read the wavelengths of each spectral line in **30;1166;TOOLONG = 10-9m and 1Angstrom = 10-10m . <p> 1 ) Read the exact values of the wavelengthsfrom thepeaks on the second diagramand record them . If you place the mouse on the second diagram an move it , a vertical line appears and helps you locate the peaks exactly and read the wavelengths exactly . If the top figure does not show you the dark blue and the violet colors clearly , click on the following applet and you will see them more clearly : <p> 5 ) Click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other atoms.Why do other atoms have more transitions ( spectral lines ) in the visible region ? Give this an explanation as part of your conclusion . <p> Data : <p> Given:Raccepted= 1.097x107m-1 . <p> Measured : The hydrogen visible wavelengths are : <p> ? 62= nm , ? 52= nm , ? 42= nm , ? 32= nm . <p> ? 62means the ? corresponding to transition from n = 6 to n = 2 . <p> Calculations : <p> Use theBalmer Seriesequationto calculateRfor each of the measured wavelengths .

@@21347295 @1347295/ <p> The Biology 1110 Scientific Paper will constitute 40 points of your lab grade . In preparing to write your scientific paper , take very thorough notes about each part of the experiment , answer all questions , and carefully record all results . This will help you in writing your scientific paper . Your instructor will give you a list of experiments that will be acceptable for your scientific paper . This scientific paper will be in standard scientific paper format . The text should be 3-5 pages in length , and double-spaced TYPED ( using a normal size type ) . Depending on the number of tables or figures you present , your paper may be longer . <p> In order to provide you with feedback and guidance on your progress , your instructor will require you to submit a draft version of the paper prior to turning in your final report . The instructor will not grade the draft and will NOT edit the draft for you regarding spelling , grammar , and sentence structure . In checking the draft , your instructor will be looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have included . You alone are responsible for ensuring that your sentences are clearly written , grammatically correct , and contain no spelling errors . The draft must be typed , have text in all sections , include data , and references . Failure to submit the draft will reduce the possible points that can be earned for the paper from 40 to 30 . <p> Your paper should consist of the following parts : 1 . Title page- a statement of the question or problem your paper addresses , 2 . Abstract- paragraph that summarizes your experiment and findings . 3 . Introduction- background and significance of the problem , 4 . Materials and Methods- a description of the experiment , and the materials needed to perform the experiment , 5 . Results- presentation of your data , 6 . Discussion- interpretation of your results , and further implications , 7 . References- materials you used in writing your paper . You must provide the heading for each section . Place the title of each section against the left margin of the page , in all capital letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Writers use the introduction to move ALL readers to the same level . Some readers may have no knowledge of your subject . The introduction should give them sufficient information to understand the purpose and significance of your project , and the results you obtained . <p> In the introduction , you will give background about your subject . For example , if you were writing a paper on cell membrane function , you would include in your introduction a description of types of transport across the cell membrane , why this is necessary to cell function , and any other bits of information the reader might need before proceeding . <p> The introduction should also clearly state the purpose of the project . The writer needs to let the reader know what hypothesis was being tested . There are many ways to state it , but if all else fails , you could include ; " The purpose of this project was to ..... " In the introduction , use the past tense to refer to your own work ; use the present tense to refer to work you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Materials " is exactly as the name implies . In this section , you should list all of the materials used and step-by-step directions on how to perform the experiment . From your paper , a reader should have sufficient information to be able to repeat your exact experiment . It will be tempting for you to just copy the procedure section from your lab manual . DO N'T DO IT ! The lab manual is not written in scientific paper format . The materials and methods section should be written in paragraph form , using the past tense . <p> Your first paragraph will contain a list of materials needed to complete the experiment . The following paragraphs will describe the procedure . When writing this paper , assume that you are an independent researcher writing for other independent researchers . NEVER refer to the students , the class or the teacher . Do not use sentences such as " The teacher will provide the students with solution X " or " The students will work in groups of four . " This information is irrelevant . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section is knowing how detailed to be . Remember that your lab manual is written as a teaching resource , not as a scientific paper . In the procedure section of the lab manual , there may be information that is not necessary to include in the scientific paper . For example , it would not be necessary to inform the reader that you used wax marking pencils to label the tubes . It is also not necessary to describe STANDARD procedures such as preparing a wet mount or using a microscope . <p> A scientific paper will NOT include instructions for how to use equipment either . For example , if you were using a spectrophotometer to read the absorbance values of a particular sample , you would just describe the type of sample being measured , the control used , and the wavelengths of light at which the sample was measured . You would not include instructions for which buttons to push , and when . Other researchers in other labs might not have the same brand or model spectrophotometer , making that information irrelevant . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory by reading the manufacturer 's instructions . <p> In the materials and methods section , do not describe expected results , or failed attempts . It would not be helpful to the reader to know that on your first try , you goofed , and added the wrong solution to tube A. <p> Results <p> In this section you will describe the results you obtained , without making analysis or explanation . You will include charts , graphs , drawings , or tables to help compile and present the data you obtained . <p> For example , if you were writing a paper on cell membrane function , you would describe exactly what happened to the Elodea after adding the salt solution or distilled water . You might want to draw a picture of the cell as it appeared after adding the solution . In scientific papers , numbers are most useful . Any time you can use numbers to express results , your work is more valid . Try to express your data in terms of numbers as often as possible . For example , you might compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after adding the salt solution and you might time the reaction , and record that data . You could even create a table showing the differences at different times and among different cells . The visual presentation of data allows the reader to quickly reference and sort your results . <p> Always be sure to label and title any chart , graph or drawing that you might use , and refer the reader to it in the text of the paper . For example , the first illustration you use might be labeled " FIGURE 1 : The effect of hypertonic solutions on the Elodea . " <p> While tables , graphs , and illustrations are critical to the result section of the paper , you must also have some text in this section . The text guides the reader from figure to figure , describing what the figure is showing . The text points out interesting trends in the data . Do not include a chart or graph without referring to it in the text of the result section . The result section describes what results were obtained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data in this section . For example , if you were writing about cell membrane function , your result section would show how the size of the central vacuole increased in hypotonic solutions , so much so that the animal cells exploded . You would point out how long it took for this to occur , if the trend was the same in plant cells , and what happened with hypertonic solutions ( using charts and graphs ) . Yet you would NOT try to explain why it happened . You would not try to discuss the osmolarity , the relative concentration of solutes to solvents . That information would belong in the conclusion section . <p> Conclusion <p> In this section you explain " WHAT " your results mean , why you obtained them , and your basis for this understanding . In the conclusion you would refer the reader to the original problem or question that the research was intended to solve . Using the same cell membrane example , in the conclusion you would explain why the cell size decreased after adding the salt solution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your conclusion . You should also describe why the results you obtained are important , and what the broader implications might be . Often one bit of scientific research brings up interesting questions that could lead to other research . <p> References <p> At the end of your paper , you should list any references you used to help you understand the subject area of your paper , or any references that provided information related to the subject . Your references will be most useful in writing the introduction and conclusion . These are the parts of the paper where you provide the reader with relevant background information related to your subject , and where you speculate as to the further implications or impact that your new knowledge provides . You will NOT find articles , or books that describe the exact experiments that you performed , but you WILL be able to find information related to the subject . For example , you will not be able to find articles discussing the use of catechol oxidase to examine enzyme function , but you should be able to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of odd titles . They may contain valuable information . For example , an article titled " Manufacturing Beer " might have a section where enzymes involved in beer making are discussed . <p> You must have at least three outside references . Of course you will use your textbook , and lab manual , but you should have three other references from other sources . The purpose of this exercise is to allow you to become familiar with the library and what resources are available . Please maintain perspective as you search for references . The reference section is just one part of the overall paper , and we certainly do not want you to spend an inordinate amount of time ( 2-3 hours should be sufficient to find adequate references ) on this section . You must include a copy of your references with your paper . <p> Following are categories of available sources for you to use . You must cite a reference from two of the three categories . This ensures that you have examined a variety of formats . <p> I. Books <p> You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library , which contain pertinent information . This online catalog can be accessed from the PSCC library web page via the PSCC home page from any campus or from home . As you are searching the card catalog , you will want to be general as you enter the SUBJECT . Once again , do not expect to find information on catechol oxidase , try ENZYMES or PROTEINS , or CELLS . Use general terms to search for books . You are not expected to read the entire book . Use the index to find the page(s) that relate to your subject . PLEASE BE COURTEOUS TO OTHER STUDENTS . SINCE MANY STUDENTS ARE COMPLETING THIS ASSIGNMENT AT THE SAME TIME , REFRAIN FROM CHECKING THE BOOK OUT . WHILE IN THE LIBRARY , FIND THE RELATED PAGE OR PAGES , AND MAKE A COPY . You must print or copy at least one page from the reference with the information that you are using in your paper and include with your paper . <p> II Journal Articles <p> Journal articles can be found using the online database available from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These can be accessed from any campus or from home . Descriptions of the type of information found in the various databases are given , and you are welcome to search any for related journal articles . Some of the better databases for science are ACCESS SCIENCE , BIOLOGY DIGEST and the GENERAL SCIENCE Collection . <p> If you have trouble finding or using these databases , ask the reference librarian , or from home call 539-7107 . Remember that you must print or copy at least one page from the reference with the information that you are using in your paper and include with your paper . <p> III . Internet References <p> Your third possibility for finding a reference is the Internet . Be prepared for an enormous amount of information . It might take a while to find something appropriate . Remember that some websites are credible and some are not . While Wikipedia often has good information , since it can be edited or revised by anyone , you cant always trust it . When using website , it is best to use a website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Citing References <p> Wherever you are using information you obtained from the reference in the body of the paper , cite the author 's name and year of the publication in parenthesis at the end of the sentence or paragraph . If you use the author 's name in the sentence , put the year of the publication in parenthesis after the name . Here is an example of what this would look like in the body of your paper : <p> The macrophage is a large cell derived from monocyte blood cells . It can remove foreign particles in the blood stream by phagocytosis . In the immune response , the macrophage is required for the generation of T-helper cells ( Golub , 1981 ) . <p> There is no single format for the citation of references at the end of the paper . Scientific journals use different formats , and these change periodically . In this paper , we ask you to use the APA citation format found the latest edition of the Harbrace Manual . You probably have your own copy if you took English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in science articles because it emphasizes the date of publication by placing it after the authors name . The date of publication is very important in science as new findings might alter previous interpretations . <p> Final Suggestions <p> Here are final suggestions in writing your paper . While this is changing to some degree , it is best to avoid the use the first person in your scientific writing . Instead of saying " I then added five ml of one percent trypsin to my cells " It is better to say something like this : " The cells were treated with five ml of one percent trypsin . " Use the past tense in your paper . Use the metric system instead of English units of measurements . For numbers ten or lower , write out the word . When using scientific names , be sure to capitalize the genus name , and underline both genus and species names .

" When force is not used , and instead distance , x , velocity , v , and time , t are used to solve for acceleration ( Chapter 2 equations ) , the study of motion is called kinematics . <p> " A nonzero net force SF acting on mass M generates an acceleration a in that mass such that SF = Ma . " <p> In verifying this formula or simply verifying the kinetic equation , we may write it as SF/M=a . In the course of experiment , you will show that if the ratio of the net force , SF , to the total mass being moved Mtotal or M+m is kept constant , the acceleration remains constant as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = a is valid , calculate it from the kinematics equation:x = ( 1/2 ) at2 + vit as well to show that both a 's will turn out the same . <p> In Fig. 1 , assuming no friction , the hanging mass m can cause motion for both m and M. The force of gravity on m is F = mg . This force has to move a total mass of m + M. In the absence of friction , F = mg is the only force causing motion . In this case mg is the SF . <p> Using Newton 's 2nd Law : <p> SF = ( Mass ) ( Accel. ) , we may write : <p> mg = ( m + M ) a or , <p> a = mg/ ( m + M ) . <p> Fig. 1 <p> In Fig. 2 , assume friction is present for M only because it has to slide on the top of the horizontal table . Since N = w in magnitude for M , we may write or N= Mg . <p> The force of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mg . Here the net force , SF , causing motion is mg - Mg . The total mass to be moved is m+M . This makes the acceleration a = ( mg - Mg ) / ( m+M ) . <p> Using Newton 's 2nd Law : <p> SF = ( Mass ) ( Accel. ) , we may write : <p> mg - Mg = ( m + M ) a or , <p> a = ( mg - Mg ) / ( m + M ) . <p> Fig. 2 <p> Procedure : <p> Click on the following link : http : **37;1198;TOOLONG . Note that masses in the applet are in ( grams ) . For ease of calculation , suppose they are given in kilograms ( kg ) and ignore the grams . This is not going to affect the results because as you see in both of the above figures the grams or kilograms cancel in the numerators and the denominators of the equations for acceleration , anyway . <p> Part A:No Friction <p> For the first 9 trials , set the coefficient of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the applet must be reset . Follow the values for M given in the Table below . Run the applet for the values given in the first row . In the first row , both M and m are given . Calculate the " Measured a " based on these values . Also , record the " Accepteda " from the applet . Find the % error using the %error formula you used in the previous experiments . <p> For rows 2 through 9 , in each row , use the given M and keep running the experiment for different values of m that you choose until you get the same acceleration as you obtained for the first row . The applet calculates the accepted value of acceleration for you , each time . <p> The applet uses x = ( 1/2 ) at2+vit with vi = 0 and x replaced by s . Solving for a results in a = 2s/t2 as used by the applet . This can be observed on the applet and used ( or recorded ) each time to make that sure the acceleration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from <p> a = ( mg - Mg ) / ( m+M ) and record under the column " Measured a " , must turn out to be the sameor very close , each time .

@@21347305 @1347305/ <p> Linear Momentum is defined as the product of mass and linear velocity . Pushing an object to the right , results in a reaction to the left . A rifle ( attached to a cart ) fired to the left makes the rifle move to the right as shown : <p> It is easy to both mathematically and experimentally verify that <p> Mb Vb = MrVr . This means : " Momentum to the left " = " Momentum to the right . " <p> The product MV , or linear momentum is an important quantity in physics . <p> Momentum is a Vector : <p> MV is a vector , because velocity is a vector . This requires momentum to have direction . <p> Example 1 : A solid ball of mass M1 = 0.15kg is rolling to the right at speed V1 = 4.0m/s and another ball of mass M2=0.35kg is rolling to the left at V2 = 6.0m/s . Find ( a ) the momentum of each ball and ( b ) the net momentum . <p> Example 2 : A baseball of mass 0.120kg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 m/s and it returns to the right at 63 m/s after getting struck by a bat . Calculate the change in its momentum . <p> Solution : Recall that ? is used to denote change and it means a final value minus its initial value ; therefore , we need to calculate ? ( MV ) = MVf - MVi . <p> Impulse ( I ) is the product of force and a time interval . Mathematically impulse ( I ) is shown as F ? t . For example , if a grocery cart is pushed with a constant force of 44N to the left for 25 seconds , the impulse of the pusher on the cart is <p> I = F ? t ; I = ( - 44N ) ( 25s ) = -1100 Ns . <p> Note that Impulse and momentum have same units . The unit of momentum MV is ( kg m/s ) . <p> So is the unit of impulse : ( Ns ) = ( kg m/s2 ) ( s ) = kg m/s . <p> Equivalence of Impulse and Linear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse of force F during time ? t on mass M is equal to the change in the linear momentum of mass M , simply , <p> F ? t = ? ( MV ) ; F ? t =M Vf-MVi or , <p> Impulse = Change in Momentum . <p> Proof:Starting with Newton 's 2nd law ( for a single force ) : ( Make sure to write all down as you proceed using horizontal fraction bars ) . <p> F = Ma , replacing a by ? v/ ? t , and multiplying thru by ? t , results in : <p> F = M ? v/ ? t ; F ? t = M ? v ; F ? t = M ( vf - vi ) ; F ? t = Mvf - Mvi . <p> and the equivalence of Impulse and change in linear momentum is verified . <p> Example 3 : A stationary train car of mass 12,000kg gets hit by another car moving to the right and is pushed with an average force of 4500N for a period of 4.2s . Find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A 0.150-kg base ball is thrown horizontally to the left by a pitcher . Its velocity just before getting hit by the bat is 15 m/s to the left and after the strike becomes 45 m/s to the right . Find ( a ) the change in velocity ? v , ( b ) the change in momentum M ? v , ( c ) the impulse of the bat on the ball , and ( d ) the average force of the bat on the ball if the contact time is 0.020s . <p> ( c ) According to the equivalence of impulse and linear momentum , F ? t = 9.0 kg m/s as well . <p> ( d ) F ? t = + 9.0 kg m/s ; F ( 0.020s ) = + 9.0 kg m/s ; F = + 450N . <p> Conservation of Linear Momentum : <p> It is easy to show that when a system of particles go through collisions with each other , the total momentum remains constant . To prove this , let us consider the head-on collision of only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight line . Also suppose that both balls have the same size . The following figure shows solid spheres A and B with masses M1 and M2 move at velocities V1 and V2 toward each other along the same line . There are 3 stages : before collision , during collision , and after collision , as shown : <p> The total momentum before collision is : M1V1 + M2V2 ( V1 and V2 are velocitiesbefore collision ) . <p> The total momentum after collision is : M1 u1 + M2 u2 ( u1 and u2 are velocities after collision ) . <p> During collision , each ball acts as a wall for the other . In fact , each ball act as a baseball bat for the other and imparts an impulse on the other ball . <p> According to Newton 's 3rd law , the impulse of ball A on ball B must be equal to the impulse of ball B on ball A , but in opposite direction . One impulse is FAB ? t , and the other -FBA ? t . Forces are equal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write:FAB ? t = M2u2 - M2V2 and FBA ? t = M1u1 - M1V1 . <p> Since FAB ? t = - FBA ? t ; therefore , M2u2 - M2V2 = - ( M1u1 - M1V1 ) . <p> Rearranging yields : M1u1 +M2u2 = M1V1 + M2V2 . <p> This simply shows that <p> " Total momentum after collision = Total momentum before collision ; " <p> in other words , linear momentum is conserved . <p> Example 5 : A 1.00-kg toy car moving to the right at 1.40 m/s is hit from behind with a 0.500-kg piece of dough thrown horizontally also to the right at 3.60 m/s that causes the car and dough combination move faster . Calculate the speed of the car-dough combo , knowing that the dough sticks to car . <p> Solution : Total momentum after collision must be equal to the total momentum before collision . This results in : <p> Example 6 : A 4.50-kg rifle is fixed on a 1.50-kg cart so that its barrel points horizontally to the right . The cart can roll with negligible friction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a remote control device and shoots a 45.0 gram bullet to the right As a result the rifle itself moves to the left at 2.50 m/s . Calculate the bullet exit speed . <p> Solution : Total mom . after collision must be equal to the total mom . before collision . Since before firing ( or collision ) , both the bullet and rifle are at rest , total momentum before firing is zero . According to the law of conservation of linear momentum , the total mom . after firing must also be equal to zeroas well.This means that : <p> MbVb + MrVr = MbVb + MrVr ; ( Note that Mr is not just the mass of rifle , it is the mass of rifle and cart ) . <p> 1 ) Momentum is ( a ) a scalar ( b ) a vector ( c ) sometimes a vector and sometimes a scalar.click here <p> 2 ) Momentum is defined as the product of ( a ) Force and a time interval ( b ) force and mass ( c ) Mass and velocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that ( a ) mass is a vector ( b ) velocity is a vector ( c ) neither a , nor b . <p> 4 ) If your car including you has a mass of 800-kg and is moving at ( 25 m/s , North ) , the momentum of your vehicle is ( a ) 20,000 kg m/s ( b ) 20,000 kg m/s , North ( c ) neither a , nor b.click here <p> Problem : Suppose you are in outer space far from planets and stars ( almost zero gravity ) .

The reason is the fact that test charge is defined as a small positive charge . When test charges are placed around a positive charge , they will be repelled and move radially outward . On the contrary , when test charges are placed around a negative charge , they will be pulled radially inward . The field lines for a single positive and a single negative point charge when each acts alone are shown in the following figure : <p> Fig. 1 <p> Equipotential surfaces are necessarily spheres centered at the point charge . At any point on an equipotential surface ( or sphere around a single point charge ) , the potential is the same . That is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In two dimensions ( on paper ) , equipotential surfaces become equipotential lines ( for example , spheres become circles ) . It is important to note that any radial line ( field line ) is perpendicular to all equipotential surfaces ( spheres ) around a point charge . It can be shown both mathematically and conceptually that regardless of the type of charge distribution ( whether single point charge , two point charges , a dipole , or any form of charge distribution ) , field lines are always perpendicular to equipotential lines . This concept may be used to draw field lines around any type of charge distribution if equipotential lines are first determined . <p> Fig. 2 <p> The field lines and equipotential lines around an electric dipole are shown below : <p> Fig. 3 <p> The field lines and equipotential lines around a charge distribution similar to that of a parallel-plate capacitor are shown below : <p> Fig. 4 <p> Equipotential lines can be found experimentally by using a voltmeter and finding points around a certain charge distribution that are at the same voltage ( electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they may be connected to form the equipotential lines .

In the small horizontal window of the applet ( on the top right side ) , you may move the tiny vertical bar to the right or left to change the size and the sign of the charge(s) you want to place on the applet 's screen .

Then click on the dark area once ( where proportionally the left point is ) . A red spot or ( + ) sign will appear that shows the existence of +1 unit of charge . You can immediately see the equipotential lines as concentric red circles around the single ( +1 ) unit of charge with white electric field lines drawn radially outward . The applet does not place arrowheads on the white field lines . " Pay attention to the way each field line crosses each equipotential line .

Do this by adjusting the charge selection window to ( -1 ) unit . Then click on the dark area once ( where proportionally the right spot in Fig. 5 ( a ) shows ) .

Fig. 8a shows an unloaded ( unstretched ) spring.Fig. 8bshows the same spring but loaded and therefore stretched as much as ( -h ) .

Note that the lower end of the spring is used as the " equilibrium level or position " for our study of the oscillations . We could have chosen any other level and kept it consistent in all figures . <p> Example 6:A 102-gram mass hung from a weak spring stretches it by 3.00cm . Let g = 9.81m/s2and calculate ( a ) the load on the spring and ( b ) the spring constant in N/m . If this mass-spring system is initially in static equilibrium and at rest , and the mass is pushed up by +2.00cm and released , calculate its ( c ) angular speed , ( d ) frequency , ( e ) period , ( f ) the amplitude of oscillations , and ( g ) the equation of motion of such oscillations . <p> In this equation , if we plugt= 0 , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 , the mass is pushed up toX =+2.00cmand released . <p> How To Determine The Type of Sinusoidal Equation ? <p> Suppose you have astop watchin one hand and with the other hand you can change the position of a mass that is hanging from a linear spring and put it into oscillation . Visualize a mass hanging from a linear spring that is initially at rest . Suppose you do the followingfourexperiments : <p> 1 ) You push the mass slightly up to+Aand release it exactly at the instant you turn the stop watch on ( t = 0 ) . Since att = 0 , the mass is at its maximum position ( +A ) , the equation of its oscillations will have acosine form : <p> X = +Acos ( ? t ) as shown in the left figure below . <p> 2 ) You pull themass slightly down to-Aand release it exactly at the instant you turn the stop watch on ( t = 0 ) . Since att = 0 , the mass is at its lowest position ( -A ) , the equation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ) as shown in Fig. 9 . <p> Figure9 <p> 3 ) You strike the mass from underneath in theupward directionat the instant you turn the stop watch on ( t = 0 ) . Since att = 0 , the mass is at its equilibrium position , x = 0 , with an upward initial speed enough to reach the intended ( +A ) , its equation of motion has asine form:X =+Asin ( ? t ) as shown in the left figure below . <p> 4 ) You strike the mass from its top in thedownward directionat the instant you turn the stop watch on ( t = 0 ) . Since att = 0 , the mass is at its equilibrium position , x = 0 , with a downward initial speed enough to reach the intended ( -A ) , the equation of its oscillations has a(-)sineform:X = -Asin ( ? t ) as shown in Fig. 10 . <p> Figure 10 <p> 5 ) If you either pull the mass down or push it up , but not release it , instead give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its equation of oscillations will not have any of the above four forms . It will have the general form below with a phase angle , f , that in general is neither0norp/2 . We do not go into more details on this topic here . <p> X = Asin ( ? t +f ) <p> Example 7:The graph of x ( the distance from the equilibrium position ) versus time ( t ) for the oscillations of a mass-spring system is given in Fig. 11 . <p> Figure 11 <p> For such oscillations , find ( a ) the amplitude , ( b ) the period , ( c ) the frequency , ( d ) the angular frequency , ( e ) the spring constant , k , if the mass of the object is 250grams , and ( f ) the equation of motion for such oscillations . <p> Solution : ( a ) A= 2.00cm ; ( b ) T= 2(0.125s) = 0.250s <p> ( c ) f =1/T ; f= 4.00 Hz ; ( d ) ? = 2pf ; ? = 2p(4.00/s) = 25.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ( 1/2 ) ; ? 2= ( k/M ) ; k =M ? 2 ; k = ( 0.250kg ) ( 25.1rd/s ) 2 ; k =158N/m . <p> ( f ) x= Asin ( ? t ) ; x=2.00cmsin(25.12t) . From the graph , the given graph is asinefunction . <p> Linear Velocityand Acceleration in Simple Harmonic Motion : <p> Velocity : If an object is oscillating back and forth on a frictionless surface as shown in Fig. 12 , it is easy to see that itsvelocity becomes zero at the extreme ends ( a ) and ( c ) . This is simply because it has to first come to stop at the end points before it can return . It is also easy to see thatvelocity gains its maximum magnitude at the midpoint or the equilibrium position ( b ) . We may therefore state that : <p> Acceleration : As shown above , at the middle ( x = 0 ) , a = 0because the spring is neither stretched nor compressed , Fs= 0 . At end points , when the spring is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its maximum magnitude , and therefore the acceleration that it gives to the attached mass is maximumin magnitudeas well . We may therefore state that : <p> Using the given equation , substituting fort , and putting thecalculator in " Radians Mode , " we get : <p> **27;1361;TOOLONG . <p> Energy Stored in a Linear Spring : <p> As a spring is stretched or compressed further and further , it stores more and more energy . To calculate the energy stored in a linear spring , we need to calculate the work done on it by the pushing or the pulling force.The work done on a spring equals the energy stored in it . This is simply the energy conservation law . <p> Work calculation is easy ! Just multiply forceFby displacement ? x . Of course , when we did that in Chapter 6 , Fwas usually aconstant force . <p> For a spring , Fvaries withx . Fortunately , for alinear spring , F varies linearly with x . <p> When you stretch a spring beyond its free length , the change in length goes from0toxas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To calculate the workWor the energy storedU , just multiplyF/2byx . <p> W= ( F/2 ) x or U = ( 1/2 ) Fx .

This means that , in this case , all energy ( or the total energy of the system ) is ofkinetictype andpotential energy is zero . On the other hand , when massMis at anend point , since it momentarily comesto stop , itsK.E. is zero , but itsP.E. is maximum , because thespring is at its maximum stretch or compress . In other words , the same total energy is of potential typein this case . This can be shown mathematically as well . It is shown below : <p> Let U denote the potential ( stored ) energyin the spring:U=0.5kx2 . Since <p> x =A sin ( ? t+f ) , the expression forU becomes : <p> U=0.5kA2sin2 ( ? t +f ) .

@@21347353 @1347353/ <p> Objects generally expand due to increase in their temperatures . There are few exceptions . For example , water expands at freezing causing ice to be less dense than water and float . Conversely , when ice is heated up , its volume shrinks . This is true for water up to 4C . Following is a brief explanation of the thermal expansion of solids , specially for linear expansion that applies to wires and thin rods . <p> Thermal Expansion of Solids : <p> Coefficient of Linear Expansion ( a ) : <p> The coefficient of linear expansion , a , is defined as the change in length per unit length per unit change in temperature . Mathematically , <p> Procedure : <p> 1 ) Fill the water heater to about 2/3 and turn it on to bring water to boil . <p> 2 ) Measure the initial length , Lo of the expansion rod by a meter stick to the best possible estimate and record the result in ( mm ) . <p> 3 ) Place the linear expansion apparatus on the table and insert an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fixed end . <p> 4 ) Mount a strain gauge at the other end of the rod such that it is barely in contact with it . <p> 5 ) Place a thermometer in the appropriate hole on the apparatus ( through an appropriate rubber bushing ) to where its bottom is in contact with the rod . <p> 6 ) By turning the outer rim of the strain gauge , it can be adjusted to zero . It is difficult to have the free end of the rod to barely touch the strain gauge , and at the same time have the gauge adjusted to zero . To solve this problem push the gauge slightly toward the free end of the rod to where it does not reads zero . It really does n't  matter what it reads , as long as it is slightly passed zero , it assures you of being in contact with the rod and it will dothe job . Watch the gauge for possible changes in length of the rod due to possible temperature changes . When the gauge is not changing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ti . <p> 7 ) When water starts boiling and producing a good amount of steam , connect the boiler to the apparatus via its rubber hose . As soon as steam reaches the rod , you will see its expansion by observing the gauge . However , as steam reaches the apparatus , it condensates . If there is a good flow of steam into the apparatus , we may think that , at condensation , the temperature of the system is equal to the condensation temperature of water ( nearly 99 C , in the Lab ) . The rod may not exactly be at that temperature , because its ends lose heat to the ambient . The rod temperature read by the thermometer ( placed in the apparatus ) , may be used as the final temperature , if equilibrium is reached.Equilibrium is reached when at a good flow of steam , the thermometer reading is constant and the gauge is not showing any further expansion . Record the final temperature , Tf , and the final gauge reading , Rf. 
@@21347354 @1347354/ <p> The motion of a particle along a straight line at a constant acceleration is called the " Uniformly Accelerated Motion . " <p> In this chapter , we need to first define velocity and acceleration as was done in Chapter 1 . <p> Velocity : Velocity is defined as the change in displacement per unit of time . Note that both velocity and displacement are vector quantities . Speed is defined as the change in distance per unit of time . Here both speed and distance are scalar quantities . The average speed ( v ) is mathematically shown as : <p> Example 1 : A car travels a distance of 350 miles in 5.0 hours . Find its average speed . <p> Acceleration : Acceleration is defined as the change in velocity per unit of time . Again , note that both acceleration and velocity are vector quantities . Both the magnitude of acceleration and speed are scalar quantities . <p> Note:In motion along a straight line and in one direction , the directions of velocity and acceleration do not change . This allows us to comfortably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vector values . <p> Example 2 : A car 's speed changes from 15m/s to 25m/s in 5.0s along a straight road . Find the acceleration of the car during this period . <p> Motion:When the relative position of a particle with respect to a reference point changes with time , the object is said to be in motion . For convenience , the reference point may be chosen to be the origin , O , in a set of x-y coordinates system . <p> Equation of Motion : Equation of motion is defined as the relation between space and time , or simply , x and t . <p> The Equation of Motion of Uniformly Accelerated Motion : <p> For motion along a straight line and at constant acceleration , a , the equation of motion has the form : <p> The proof of the above equation will be given and discussed later . Right now , let 's just accept this equation . There are 2 terms on the right side of it . Verify that each term must have unit of length because the left side is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metric system , for example , and show that each term is in meters . <p> Example 3 : A car traveling along a straight road at 8.0m/s accelerates to a speed of 15.0m/s in 5.0s . Determine(a) its acceleration , ( b ) the distance traveled during this period , ( c ) its equation of motion , ( d ) the interval of validity of this equation , and(e) the distance traveled at t = 2.0 s . <p> Solution:We have so far learned the following equations : ( Rewrite them , but with horizontal fraction bars ) . <p> Any object that moves along a straight line and at constant acceleration , has an equation of motion in the form : <p> x = ( 1/2 ) at2 + vit . The equation of motion of this car can be found by substituting the constants in the equation . <p> The constants are:vi = 8.0m/s and a = 1.4m/s2 . The equation of motion becomes : <p> ( c ) x = ( 1/2 ) ( 1.4 ) t2 + 8.0t or x = 0.7t2 + 8.0t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = t = 5.0s only . <p> ( e ) x(2) = 0.7 ( 2.0 ) 2 + 8.0 ( 2.0 ) = 18.8m 19m <p> Example 4 : A cyclist traveling at 30.0m/s along a straight road comes uniformly to stop in 5.00s .

( c ) are the answers in Part ( b ) equal ? If not why ? What should be the pace of motion for such distances to be equal ? <p> Solution : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 0 <p> x(1) = 3.4(1)2 + 2.1(1) = 5.5m <p> x(2) = 3.4(2)2 + 2.1(2) = 17.8m <p> x(3) = 3.4(3)2 + 2.1(3) = 36.9m <p> x(4) = 3.4(4)2 + 2.1(4) = 62.8m <p> x(5) = 3.4(5)2 + 2.1(5) = 95.5m <p> ( b ) d1 is the distance traveled in the 1st second . d2 is the distance traveled in the 2nd second , and so on . <p> d1 = x(1) - x(0) = 05.5m - 00.0m = 5.5m <p> d2 = x(2) - x(1) = 17.8m - 05.5m = 12.3m <p> d3 = x(3) - x(2) = 36.9m - 17.8m = 19.1m <p> d4 = x(4) - x(3) = 62.8m - 36.9m = 25.9m <p> d5 = x(5) - x(4) = 95.5m - 62.8m = 32.7m <p> ( c ) As can be seen from Part ( b ) , the distances traveled in subsequent seconds become greater and greater . What is this telling us ? Is it because the motion is an accelerated one ? Ans. : ..... . If your answer is " Yes " , you are right . In accelerated motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> An Equation With No Apparent Time Element <p> Sometimes , in solving problems , we may run into situations where time ( t ) is not given . It is possible to combine the equations of distance and acceleration to find an equation that is explicitly independent of time . Look at the following two equations that we already know:a = ( vf -vi ) / t and x = ( 1/2 ) at2 + vit . If ( t ) is solved for from the 1st equation and substituted into the 2nd equation , the following equation will be resulted : <p> vf2- vi2= 2ax ( explicitly independent of time ) <p> Students are encouraged to try the algebra and derive this equation as explained above . <p> Example 6 : During take off , an airplane travels 960m along a straight runway to reache a speed of 65m/s before its tires leave the ground . If the motion is uniformly accelerated , determine its ( a ) acceleration , ( b ) elapsed time , ( c ) equation of motion , and ( d ) its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth are under a gravitational pull toward the center of the Earth whether falling or not . This gravitational pull imposes an acceleration of 9.8m/s2 on all objects nearby the Earth and the acceleration vector is always toward the Earth 's center . Since falling objects move along straight lines and accelerate as they move , the following equations apply : Note that these equations are valid only if air resistance can be neglected . This is true for objects that are tiny , solid , and dense . <p> It is better to take the origin to be the point of release , or the starting point . Also , if downward is taken to be the ( + y ) axis , then g that is in the same direction of +y becomes positive ( g = +9.8 m/s2 ) . On this basis , since the rock moves downward it has a positive velocity at any given instant . Its direction of motion always agrees with the ( + y ) axis . <p> In the following example , it is easy to show that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight upward are the same . Also , the throwing speed and the striking speed are the same . Note : Assume ( + y ) to be upward as usual . This way , since g acts downward , it is then negative compared to the upward + y .

@@21347366 @1347366/ <p> A computer with internet connection , a calculator ( The built-in calculator of the computer may be used. ) , a ruler , a few sheets of paper , and a pencil <p> Theory : <p> Archimedes principle states that when a non-dissolving object is submerged ( or partially inserted ) into a fluid , the fluid exerts an upward force onto the object called the buoyancy force , B , that is equal to the weight of displaced fluid . We may write : <p> B = ( Vobject ) ( Dfluid ) <p> Where D = ? g is the weight density of the fluid.B is the weight of displaced fluid . <p> The Mass Density ( ? ) of Water : <p> Historically , 1gram , was defined to be the mass of 1cm3 of pure water at 4.0C . This means that ? water can be written as follows : <p> The Weight Density ( D ) of Water : <p> If we name the weight of 1gram to be 1gram force ( gf ) ; therefore , <p> Procedure : <p> To verify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be measured . For barge 's safety measures , let 's load a barge such that only 3/4 of it is to go under water in each experiment . In other words , find the measured value of the load for 1/4 of the barge to be above water surface . Also , by calculation , find the accepted value of the load for 1/4 of the barge to be above water surface . <p> Click on the following applet : LONG ... . A barge will appear . You can change the volume of the barge by clicking on the top slider in the applet . The height of the barge remains constant at 4cm . The base area of the barge can be changed from 3cm2 to 7 cm2 . This makes the volume of the barge to change from 12cm3 to 28cm3 . Our first choice of fluid is , of course , water . <p> Before starting this experiment , make sure that you have understood the mass density and weight density of water as explained under " Theory " , above . <p> Case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This means that this barge can provide a maximum buoyancy force of 12 gram force ( 12gf ) . If its total weight becomes 12 gram force , it will be on the verge of sinking . Since we want it to be only 3/4 in water ( or 1/4 out of water ) , only 3/4 of its volume must be used to provide buoyancy . ( 3/4 ) x(12cm3) = 9 cm3 . Therefore , the maximum downward force must be 9 gram force . Out of this 9 gram force load , 5 gram force of it is its own weight . This means that only 4 gram force of load it can carry if only 3/4 of it in in water . The accepted value for the allowable load in this case is 4gf . To find the measured value of the allowable load , click on the " set " button . The magnet in the applet puts the barge in water . Under " cargo , " select 1 gram force increments and click " Add Cargo . " Add enough cargo until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barge is out of water . If with " eye-balling " you are happy with your estimate of the 1/4 of height being out of water , count the number of gram forces of load and record it as your measured value in Table 1 . Calculate a %error . As you load the barge , the barge goes down . Water level goes up and overflows into the measuring tube on the left . The tube measures the volume of displaced liquid . <p> Set the barge volume to 16cm3 . Estimate the maximum buoyancy that brings the barge onto the verge of sinking . Next , calculate 3/4 of it . Then , calculate the accepted value of the load you can place in it considering the barge 's own weight . Finally run the experiment by loading the barge until you are pleased with your eye-estimation of 1/4 of the barge being out of water . Count the number of gram forces you put in the barge . Record this as your measured value , and calculate a %error . <p> Repeat the above steps for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barge volume . <p> Case II : Alcohol <p> Since the weight density of alcohol is 0.8 gf /cm3 , only 0.8 gram force of load is allowed for every cm3 of alcohol displacement . For example , if you choose a barge volume of 12cm3 , the downward force that brings the barge onto the verge of sinking is ( 12 cm3 ) ( 0.8gf/cm3 ) = 9.6 gf . For 3/4 submersion , the max. downward force on the barge is ( 3/4 ) ( 9.6gf ) = 7.2gf . Since the barge itself weighs 5.0gf ; therefore , the safe load is only 2.2gf . This is your accepted value of safe load for 3/4 submersion . The measured value for 3/4 submersion can be done by running the applet for the alcohol option . Repeat the steps as you did for water and record the values in the Table . <p> Repeat this experiment for all possible volumes for the barge . <p> Case III : Mercury <p> The weight density of mercury is 13.55 gf /cm3 . If you choose V = 12 cm3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verge of sinking is ( 12cm3 ) ( 12.55gf/cm3 ) =162.6gf rounded to 160gf . Again , this is the calculated , or expected , or accepted value .

In Fig. 5 , the voltmeter reads the voltage across R , and the ammeter reads the current through R. If you change the ( variable resistor ) rheostat setting , the total resistance will change , and with a fixed voltage ( supplied by the battery ) , the current Iwill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through R causes the voltage across R to change , too . You will ; however , see that the ratio V/ I will remain constant . <p> First , you need to practice with the applet to get familiar with the way it works . Although the applet reads " Combination of Resistors " as its title , it is very suitable for this experiment . To begin with the applet shows a 12.0-V battery in series with a 100.0-O resistor . <p> 1 ) Let 's first change it to a 10.0-V battery connected to an 80.0-O resistor by typing in these values in the applet . Go ahead and make the changes . After each single change , you must hit the " Enter " key . <p> 2 ) If you click on the tab that says " Series Connection " , it places another 80.0-O resistor in series with your first 80.0-O resistor . Go ahead and try it . Whichever resistor that you click on now , it gets highlighted that means it is selected . Go ahead and select the left resistor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the " Parallel Connection " tab . This places an 80.0-O resistor in parallel with the left one . <p> 4 ) Change the top left 80-O to 190O and the lower left 80O to 75O . Also change the right 80.0-O to 35.0O . Now , you have a module ( made up of a 190 and a 75 in parallel ) that is in series with a 35-O resistor . <p> 5 ) Click on the " Refresh " key to bring the applet to its original mode of a 12.0-V battery in series with a 100. -O resistor . <p> 6 ) Place an ammeter in the circuit by clicking on the " Amperage " button on the applet . Note that an ammeter must always be in series with the element that it is supposed to measure the current through . <p> Fig. 5 <p> 7 ) Place a voltmeter across the resistor by first having it highlighted and then click on the " Voltage " button . A voltmeter will appear across the 100 . O resistor If the 100-O resistor is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( electric pressure ) drop across that 100. -O resistor and the voltmeter you just placed across it will read the same voltage as the battery voltage . <p> 8 ) Remove the voltmeter and the ammeter by deselecting them on the applet . <p> 9 ) Place another 100. -O resistor in series with the first one by clicking on the " Series Combination " key . <p> 10 ) Place a voltmeter across the left 100. -O resistor by first selecting it and then selecting the " Voltage " square . <p> 11 ) Place an ammeter in the circuit by selecting the " Amperage " square . Now that there are two similar resistors , each resistor drops the voltage by 6.00 volts . The voltmeter shows a voltage of 6.00 volts across the left 100. -O resistor . Since the total resistance is now 200 . O , the current in the circuit is V/R = 12V/200O = 0.0600Amps as read by the ammeter . Check the calculation for correctness . Of course , if you multiply the 0.0600A current by the 100 . O resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left resistor as is also experimentally read by the blue voltmeter . <p> At this point you should have a circuit on the applet that has the same structure as the circuit in Fig. 5 . You are now familiar with the use of the applet and ready to do the experiment . Keep the circuit as it is on the applet <p> Performing the Experiment : <p> 1 ) Name the left resistor Rs , and change it to 125O . Let Rs be the resistor under study . Also , change the battery voltage to 10.0 volts . Use the right resistor as your rheostat , the variable one , or the one we want to change . Let us change the resistance of the right resistor a few times and each time record the current through Rs as well as the voltage across Rs to see if the V/I ratio for Rs remains constant . You may use the values given in Table 1 , under the " Rheostat Resistance . " For example , as Trial 1 suggests , change the resistance of the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the current and voltage for Rs from the applet 's ammeter and voltmeter and record them in the appropriate columns of Table1 . As a check , quickly calculate the V/I ratio and verify that it is very close or equal to 125O . Record all results ( both measured and calculated ) to 3 decimal places . This could go to 6 significant figures . <p> 2 ) Repeat this procedure for each of the remaining 4 rows of Table 1 . For each row , after changing the rheostat resistance on the applet , record the I and V read by the meters , calculate Rs from the V/I ratio and record it in Table 1 . <p> 3 ) Calculates the mean value of Rsin the last column of Table 1and record it in the bottom right corner . This is the measured value for Rs . The accepted value of Rs is of course 125O , the value we knew from the beginning . <p> 4 ) Calculate a %error on Rs using the following %error formula : <p> 5 ) Repeat steps 1 through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value for Rsbetween say 80O to 200 O , and another 5 rheostat values ranging from 95O to 160O .

K.E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as expected . <p> Example 11:A 900kg car traveling at 15m/s changes speed to 25m/s in a distance of 50m due to a net force . Calculate ( a ) the net force , and ( b ) the engine force if the frictional forces add up to 1400N . <p> Solution : ( a ) UsingWork-K.E. theorem <p> : ( SF ) +x = ( K.E. ) f - ( K.E. ) i ; <p> SF(50m)= <p> 1/2(900) ( 25 ) 2-1/2(900) ( 15 ) 2 ; SF=3600N . <p> ( b ) SF = Fe- Ff ; 3600N = Fe- 1400N ; Fe=5000N . <p> Example 12:Starting from rest , a boy pushes a 45.0-kg sled ( including his friend in it ) through a distance of 12.0m with a horizontal and constant force of 165N . The frictional force between the sled and snow is 55.0N . Calculate ( a ) the work done by the boy on the sled , ( b ) the work done by the frictional force on the sled , ( c ) the work done by the net force on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sled at the end of the 12.0m distance . <p> This law states that " Energy is conserved . It is neither created nor destroyed . It only converts from one form to another . " Of course , this is true from theUniverse point of view . From our point of view , when energy is converted to heat via friction , it is a loss . For example , when we push a heavy crate up a ramp ( or incline ) onto a truck , we do some work . Part of the work stores as P.E.in the elevated crate , and the remaining work converts to heat due to friction . It is easy to experimentally verify the following energy balance : <p> The work done on the crate=the P.E.stored in it +the work consumed by friction . <p> Fromour point of view , the work consumed by friction isa loss.From theUniverse point of view , theworkconsumed by frictionreturns to the Universein the form of heat and there is no loss . <p> Conservation of Mechanical Energy : <p> In the absence of frictional energy losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can always write down anenergy balancefor a system that goes under a certain process during which its mechanical energy changes from one form to another , even if some energy is lost due to friction . The following examples apply the law of conservation of energy to a system or an object.Conservation of energy requires total energy to remain constant . <p> Example 13:In the figure shown , neglecting friction , find the speed of the 750-kg car at the bottom of the hill . Suppose the car is put in neutral and starts from rest from the hill top . <p> Solution:Conservation of mechanical energy requires that <p> Total Energy at A = Total Energy at B. <p> ( K.E. ) A+ ( P.E. ) A= ( K.E. ) B+ ( P.E. ) B. <p> 1/2MVA2 + MghA=1/2MVB2 + MghB . <p> Since VA= 0 and also hB= 0 , we get : <p> Mg hA=1/2 MVB2 . <p> M 's cancel : g hA =1/2 VB2 ; <p> 2g hA= VB2 ; VB= 30m/s . <p> Example 14:In the figure shown , if120,000Jof energy is consumed by frictional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the hill . Suppose the car is put in neutral and starts from rest from the hill top . <p> Solution:Conservation of mechanical energy requires that <p> K.E.A+ P.E.A - Wfric. = K.E.B+ P.E.B <p> 1/2MVA2 + MghA - 120,000J=1/2MVB2 + MghB . <p> Since VA= 0 and also hB= 0 , we get : <p> Mg hA-120,000J=1/2MVB2 . <p> Not every term has M ; therefore , M 's do not cancel . <p> 750(9.8) ( 45 ) J - 120,000J= 0.5(750kg)VB2 . <p> 562(m/s)2 = VB2 ; VB= 24 m/s . <p> In this case , part of the available energy at A is be wasted by frictional forces . <p> Example 15:In the figure shown , for the 750kg car in neutral , find ( a ) the energy consumed by the 300N frictional force on the car as it coasts down the hill a distance of 400m , and ( b ) its speed at the bottom of the hill . <p> Example 16:An electric motor is capable of delivering 7.2 Million Joules of work in one hour and and 400. seconds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hp . <p> Solution : P = W/t ; P =7.2 x106J /4000s = 1800 J/s =1800 watts . <p> P = 1.8kilowatts ( kw ) ; P = ( 1800/746 ) hp ; P = 2.4 hp . <p> Example 17:Calculate the amount of work or energy that a4.50hpelectric motor can deliver in10.0 hours . <p> Solution:P =4.5hp = ( 4.50 ) ( 746 watts ) = 3360 watts . <p> P = W/t ; W = Pt ; W =3360J/s ( 36,000s ) =1.21 x 108J . <p> Efficiency : When a device receives power from a source , it does not deliver all of it in the intended form and converts a portion of it to other undesired forms . This makes a device to be less than 100 percent efficient . For example , a typical car receives chemical energy in the form of gasoline . The purpose is to convert it to kinetic energy . The efficiency of this conversion is way below 100 percent . A good portion of the original combustion of gasoline in the cylinders coverts to undesirable heat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter time part of it is used to heat up the interior of the car . Electric motors have much better efficiencies . They normally return more than 90% of the electric power delivered to them in useful power . However , the generation of electricity itself is not very efficient . Most power plants have efficiencies of under 50 percent . A good nuclear power plant is about 45% efficient . Early coal plants were hardly 20% efficient.Efficiencyof a device is defined as theratio of power output to the power inputfor that device . <p> Eff = Pout/Pin . <p> Example 18:A 1.25hp electric pump with an efficiency of 92.5% is used to perform 1.40 Mega Joules of work . ( a ) How long does it take for the electric pump to do the job ? ( b ) If the pump is ideally 100% efficient , how long does it take ? <p> Solution : A 1.25hp electric pump means it draws 1.25hp of electric power from the source . It generally can not give back all of it . Make sure that you write the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 0.925 =Pout/1.25hp ; Pout= 0.925(1.25hp) =1.16hp . <p> ( a ) P = W/t ; t =W/P ; t = 1.40x106J/ ( 1.16x 746 watts ) = 1620 sec . <p> ( b ) P = W/t ; t =W/P ; t = 1.40x106J/ ( 1.25x 746 watts ) = 1500 sec . <p> Example 19:Calculate ( a ) the necessary power to empty a swimming pool with dimensions ( 12m ) ( 25m ) ( 2.4m ) by pumping its water to an average height of 3.5m in 2.5hrs . The mass density of water is 1000kg/m3 . ( Hint:The power you calculate is the power that the electric pump has to deliver to water ) . If the efficiency of the electric pump used is 88% , calculate ( b ) the electric power that the electric motor draws from the power source . <p> Solution : The formula for the volume of a rectangular pool isV =w l h.Here , V =720m3 . <p> Massdensityr=M/V ; M =rV ; M= ( 1000 kg/m3 ) ( 720 m3 ) =720,000kg . <p> ( a ) P = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pool water equals the weight of water w ; therefore , F =w = Mg , andx is the height that the water must be lifted to . <p> The formulaP = W/tcan be written asP = Fx/tbecauseW = Fx . As we know x/tis just velocity v ; therefore , <p> P=F v <p> This means thatpower is equal to force times velocity ( if both of force and velocity are in the same direction ) . This concept is very familiar . Suppose you want to drive your car at aconstant rpmof 3000 . If you are driving up a hill with the engine at 3000rpm , you must gear down and drive at a lower velocity because you need a greater pushing force between the tires and the ground . If you are driving on a flat and horizontal road , 3000rpm can give your vehicle a higher velocity because a smaller pushing force is needed between the tires and the road on a horizontal road . As you see the product of velocity and force is a constant if a constant power is available or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vis constant . Whena greaterFis needed , a smallervis attainable and vice versa . <p> Example 20:A car is using 56hp of its total power . When it is going up a steep hill , a force of 4200N is needed for constant velocity motion of it up that hill . When it is traveling along a level and horizontal road , a force of 1200N is needed for its constant velocity motion .

This elevation gives an initial potential energy to the car . If you want the initial potential energy to be zero , you need to start the car from zero elevation . Zero Elevation , is 20m lower . It is the borderline of the grid . Now click " Reset , " and then click on the incline you just drew . It will turn red . It means it is " selected .

Select a mass of 500kg and an initial speed of 40m/s , and calculate the initial K.E .. Run the applet and double-check your result with the value shown on the information bar and assure its correctness . If you start the applet , you will see that the car climbs the incline until it runs out of K.E. energy . If you look at the value of P.E . on the information bar , you will see a P.E . greater than expected . This applet has some glitches in it . The P.E . can not be more than the initial K.E. You can also change the simulation speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key allows you to stop the simulation momentarily for taking or recording your readings . <p> You may try some examples of your own before starting the actual experiment .

@@21347434 @1347434/ <p> 1 . Students should display the ability to identify leaves using a dichotomous key . <p> 2 . Students should verify the accuracy of their results by consulting with another leaf/tree identification reference . <p> 3 . Students should understand the basic methodology of creating a scientific collection . <p> Procedure : <p> Collect 5 leaves ( FROM TREES ) and identify their GENUS ( or a closely related Genus ) using a dichotomous key on the web for this exercise . This collection will be worth 40 points making each leaf worth 8 points . You will be graded on the presentation of your leaves as well as an outline of your use of a dichotomous key to identify a Genus for each leaf . All tree Genuses may not be identified by the key you use so the key may tell you the leaf is from a Genus you know is incorrect . THATS OK , the point is - you are to demonstrate your ability to use a dichotomous key to arrive at an identification of the leaves . <p> Dichotomous keys to use ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection ) : <p> You should be able to identify your leaves with one of the following keys . Note these are both supported by Virginia schools so hopefully the trees identified in them are similar to what wed find here in East Tennessee . <p> You should click on the numbers and letters to work your way through the key . <p> Check for an email containing links to the keys which will allow you to just click on them to follow . <p> Once you have identified a Genus for each leaf with a dichotomous key , consult a tree/leaf identification book and verify that the dichotomous key guided you to the correct Genus . If the dichotomous key was inaccurate , indicate the correct Genus provided by the leaf identification book you consult . There will be some leaf identification books on reserve at the library of each campus . Leaf identification books should also be available at the public libraries . <p> Required Leaves : <p> 1 . A pinnately or palmately compound leaf ( attached to a very small piece of branch ) . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look for the axillary buds . Each LEAF will have an axillary bud associated with it , but leaflets will not . <p> 4 . A simple leaf with a toothed or lobed margin . This can be from the same Genus of trees as your simple with attachments , but MUST be from a different species . <p> 5 . Some type of needle-like leaves from a cone producer . <p> You will need to collect at least two leaves that are attached to a branch to illustrate your successful collection of simple leaves with alternate or opposite attachment . You need to collect an entire compound leaf , not just a leaflet , which is attached to a small section of the branch so that opposite or alternate attachment of the leaves is clear . Your collection should include the five required leaves period , " spares " will not be accepted/considered during the grading process . <p> Extra Credit - you may earn up to five points of extra credit on this assignment . <p> 1 . You should PRESS your leaves . You can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 pieces of newspaper and inserting it into a thick **32;1776;TOOLONG . It takes about a week for the leaves to dry sufficiently . <p> 2 . You should SEAL your leaves in plastic . Leaves may be inserted into plastic sleeves ( designed to go into notebooks ) or may be covered by clear contact paper . <p> 3 . You should LABEL your leaves . Your leaves should be labeled with : <p> a. which of the five required leaves is represented . <p> b. the Genus , as identified by the key , of the trees from which you collected the leave . <p> c. the specific place or area where you collected your leaves ( for example - PSTCC main campus ; Tyson Park , Knoxville , TN ; 102 Kingston Pike , Knoxville , TN ) . The idea is anyone should be able to locate the trees from which you collected your leaves . " Behind grannys house " is not specific enough and the date on which you collected your leaves . <p> d. a step-by-step explanation of how you used the dichotomous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) AND a reference for the key you used ! <p> e. verification of the results of the key and a reference for the leaf identification guide you consulted ; include the page number from the reference for each verification . <p> f. your lecture instructors name <p> There should be a sample leaf collection in each lab that you can look at to see what a good/bad leaf collection looks like . There should be comments included with the samples so you 'll know what the instructors will be looking for
