This quickly became a " magic box " for American anglers , and changed their fishing methods . Since this revolution for anglers , Lowrance has developed an impressive range of advanced but nonetheless reasonably priced , and easy to use fishfinders , combined fishfinders/GPS and GPS+WAAS map plotters capable of being adapted to several different markets . <p> Approximately one million Lowrance products are now being sold every year . One important reason for this success is the extent of the product range . And it is equally important that the Lowrance brand has become associated with more innovations , new patents and distinctions than any other brand in the marine electronics industry .

Please click on Contact Us and select Returns-RMA on the dropdown list and be sure to include your original Order No . <p> To select the transducer that 's best suited to your needs , you need to consider the transducer 's operating frequency , cone angle , and type of installation . <p> Frequency - Most of the sonar units that we sell accessories for operate at 200 kHz ( kilohertz ) . Some models use 50 kHz . A few are dual frequency capable , meaning they can use both 50 and 200 kHz transducers . Typically , high frequency ( 200 kHz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure and targets . They excel at showing minute details of the underwater world . 50 kHz units have much greater depth penetration capability , but show less definition . 50 kHz transducers also usually have a much wider cone angle than 200 kHz transducers . <p> You must match the transducer 's frequency to the sonar unit . For example , a 200 kHz sonar unit requires a 200 kHz transducer . <p> Cone Angle - A transducer 's cone angle determines its coverage area of the underwater world . The wider the cone angle , the greater the area that 's covered . We offer a variety of 200 kHz transducers with either a wide ( 20 ) or narrow ( 12 ) cone angle . The 50 kHz transducers come with a 35 cone angle . And the dual frequency transducers come with both a narrow ( 12 ) 200 kHz and a 50 kHz cone angles . <p> Generally , use a wide cone angle for fishing shallow to medium depths . The narrow cone penetrates to deeper depths , but shows less fish and structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your sonar units depends on its transmitter power , receiver , sensitivity , frequency , transducer and transducer installation . Other things that effect depth capability are : water conditions and type , ( all sonars will show deeper depth readings in fresh water than salt ) and bottom conditions . <p> Types of Transducer Installation - Most of our permanent-mount transducers are designed for high-speed operations . For the best results , the transducer should be placed where a smooth , undisturbed flow of water will pass across the face of the transducer at all boat speeds . Read your transducer 's owner 's manual before installing the transducer ! <p> Transom Mount - The transom-mount transducer is the most popular , and it 's generally the easiest to install . The Skimmer transducer design performs best when it is slightly below the boat 's hull . A plastic transducer is recommended on aluminum or steel-hulled boats to avoid potential electrolysis problems . <p> Mounting the transducer on the transom is recommended for outboard and stern-drive ( I/O ) powered boats only . Transom mounting is ideal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will prevent damage if the transducer strikes an object . <p> Make certain that the chosen location does n't interfere with the boat 's trailer . DO NOT mount the transducer directly behind the ribs , or thru-hull fittings . Typically , on aluminum boats , mounting the transducer between two ribs works best . On all hulls , mount the transducer at least one foot away from the engine 's lower unit . This helps to prevent air bubbles from the transducer interfering with the propeller . <p> Periodically wash the bottom of the transducer with soap and water to remove any oil film or growth that may collect . Oil and dirt reduce the transducer 's sensitivity and can even prevent its operation . <p> Shoot-Thru-Hull Mount - In this installation , the transducer is bonded to the inside of the hull with epoxy . Ideally , the transducer is placed in the aft third of the hull close to the centerline . The signal " shoots through " the hull with some loss of signal strength . This installation must be made in an area of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air bubbles or separated layers . If the hull is of multi-layer or " sandwich " construction , you will have to remove the inner layer of fiberglass and the wood or foam core to expose the outer layer of the hull . This type of mount is recommended only with 200 kHz transducers . <p> Bolt-Thru-Hull Mount - In this type of installation , a hole is cut in the hull and the transducer is mounted through the hull by means of a threaded shaft and nut . If the boat hull has a dead rise higher than 10 degrees , fairing blocks made from wood or plastic must be fabricated so that the transducer will mount in a completely vertical position . The TH-FLW P5 model does not require a fairing block . <p> On in-boards , the transducer must be installed ahead of the propeller , shaft(s) , and engine water intake(s) . <p> If the boat 's hull is made of steel or aluminum , use a plastic transducer to prevent electrolysis problems . <p> Trolling Motor Mount - The PD-W " pod " transducer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has two slots for a hose clamp ( which must be purchased separately ) .

@@4625406 <h> AIS 101 <h> About AIS <p> The marine Automatic Identification System ( AIS ) is a location and vessel information reporting system . It allows vessels equipped with AIS to automatically and dynamically share and regularly update their position , speed , course and other information such as vessel identity with similarly equipped vessels . Position is derived from the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) and communication between vessels is by Very High Frequency ( VHF ) digital transmissions.There are a number of types of AIS device as follows : <p> Class A transceivers.These are similar to class B transceivers , but they are designed to be fitted on large vessels such as cargo ships and large passenger vessels . Class A transceivers transmit at a higher VHF signal power than class B transceivers and therefore can be received by more distant vessels , and also transmit more frequently . Class A transceivers are mandatory on all vessels over 300 gross tonnes on international voyages and certain types of passenger vessels under the SOLAS regulations . <p> Class B transceivers.Similar to class A transceivers in many ways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance requirements . Class B transceivers transmit at a lower power and at a lower reporting rate than class A transceivers . <p> AIS base stations.AIS base stations are used by Vessel Traffic Systems to monitor and control the transmissions of AIS transceivers . <p> Aids to Navigation(AtoN) transceivers . AtoNs are transceivers mounted on buoys or other hazards to shipping which transmit details of their location to the surrounding vessels . <p> AIS receivers.AIS receivers will generally receive transmissions from class A transceivers , class B transceivers , AtoNs and AIS base stations but do not transmit any information about the vessel on which they are installed . <h> RS35 is also an AIS Receiver <p> Static and dynamic vessel data There are two categories of information transmitted by an AIS transceiver : static and dynamic data . The vessels dynamic data , which includes location , speed over ground ( SOG ) and course over ground ( COG ) , is calculated automatically using the installed AIS antenna . Static data is information about the vessel which must be programmed into the AIS transceiver . This includes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign ( if available ) Vessel typeVessel dimensions In most countries the operation of an AIS transceiver is included under the vessels marine VHF licence provisions . The vessel on to which the AIS unit is to be installed must therefore possess a current VHF radiotelephone licence which lists the AIS system , vessel Call Sign and MMSI number .
