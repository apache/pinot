This beautiful construction features several layers of rye bread filled with everything from liver pate , olives , shrimp , ham , egg , mayonnaise , caviar , cucumber and more .

From since I can remember I was always interested in making things " cutting things up , painting , playing with coloured water , sending hand-made cards to my family . In high school I started buying black and white photographic books and magazines and I had an amazing art teacher who would share her personal works with me and tell me about the galleries she would visit and her love of Brett Whiteley . I would skip Biology classes and sneak in to the art rooms to spend an extra 45 minutes on my paintings . <p> What drew you towards mixed media and photography as your key outlets ? It 's just a natural expression for me and what I am attracted too . I love the mix and the fact that it 's like a puzzle " using layers and being able to move things around until you get it just right . It allows me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets , use 3D elements , draw , add text , use texture , experiment with colours or filters or reflection and find a way to make it all come together . <p> We are very excited to check out your collaboration with Westfield Chermside ! When you agree to an exhibition of this size , what is the first step you take in planning it ? The first steps were to review the large proportions of the spaces I had been given to use . It was such an exciting and dynamic space but I also wanted the quality of my work to not be diluted at that scale . The total floor plan layout , the interior colour and materials scheme as well as the journey of my works were all important first steps before any new works were created . It takes a lot of planning and consideration to envision up to the final layer of 3D elements before even beginning the artworks . It helped to print out all the plans and artworks in proportion and do layouts on the floor so I could physically move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Can you give us any hints as to how the exhibition will take shape ? The exhibition will have the beautiful feel of an intimate timeline where viewers can experience past works that are familiar , alongside dynamic new pieces " taking everyone- on a journey of progression and growth through my art . The works will be invigorating and enveloping at that size " allowing you to see , feel and fall into the images using both scale and 3D elements to highlight key themes and ideas . <p> What concepts have you drawn upon as inspiration for this project ? I 've drawn upon my ideas of beauty , desire , love , glamour , confidence , strength , uniqueness , pride and letting your emotions talk and come to the surface . I like the idea that the images are an orgy of simplicity where one can see the pretty surface and enjoy it or delve further in and a read more of the story just like with any human interaction or meeting . I 'm exploring how we form friendships or relationships , who we are drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life we can only be surface with . Each image will have a different trigger from one person to the next , but the images are beautiful compilations and arrangements of initial attraction and desire that we are so well-trained to see and take on . <p> The worlds of fashion and art have an almost symbiotic relationship . In what ways do the two intersect in your work ? Fashion is another form of art . It uses colour , texture , composition to create an image , drawing on allure and desire to evoke an emotional response . Fashion is a huge influence on me as a woman and as an artist " both the garments and the vehicle of magazines and boutiques that are used to sell or display . For women especially " fashion shapes our whole confidence , body image and our complete external persona from when we are very young , so I find it is often a reference point for me to create my works .

I love exploring the concept that beauty is only skin deep " that we should n't keep our voices hidden and that love and self-love begins on the inside and have no relevance to the exterior . I want to explore the idea that it is ok to enjoy beauty to love beautiful things but to also find the beauty in the unexpected , in someone opening themselves up , in a dark corner , in a thrown away package or a piece of rubbish that might be beautiful for its washed out colour " if nothing else. - <p> Are there any aspects of the world around you that you would love to reinterpret through art , but are yet to do so ?

@@24787847 @4787847/ <h> Niseko , Japan <p> As an avid surfer and snowboarder , the idea of the perfect uncrowded wave or the waist-deep powder experience was starting to appear a distant memory . Summers spent fighting crowds for waves along the coastline of Australia were now the norm . And snowfalls in Australia and New Zealand , whilst enjoyable , did not live up to the buckets of powder snow I had once experienced in Whistler , Canada . Whether snowboarding or surfing , I was on the search for locations that could satisfy my cravings for the two sports I loved yet got little time to experience or enjoy to their full potential . In 2003 , I heard about a snow resort in Japan called Niseko . At the time , the idea of snowboarding in Japan was not really on my radar . But soon it was hard to resist Niseko 's reputation for receiving some of the highest and best powder snowfalls in the world and the promise of uncrowded slopes . <p> It took me several years to make it to Niseko , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heaven " a snowboarder 's paradise . If your dream is to spend winter season upon winter season in one of the most stunning landscapes in the world , waist-deep in the fluffiest powder snow on Earth , and immersed in a wonderful cultural experience , Niseko , Japan is the place to make those dreams come true . <p> Located on the northern island of Hokkaido in Japan , Niseko is undoubtedly destined to become one of the chic resorts of Asia , following in the footsteps of global resorts such as Aspen and Whistler . Due to its stunning location and weather streams that come from Siberia rather than from eastern Japan , Niseko is blessed with a consistently high snowfall producing impressive amounts of dry powder snow . The snow is literally fluffy and light with very little moisture content . With up to 15 metres of fresh powder snow every season , falling daily , this compares favourably to the 13 metres recorded at even the snowiest resorts in North America and Europe . <p> The best way to get to Niseko is to fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's New Chitose Airport . ( Note that Haneda airport is the domestic airport in Tokyo whereas Narita is the international airport . ) The flight from Haneda to Chitose takes about two hours and from Chitose Airport you can reach Niseko either by car , bus or train . It takes between two and three hours to get there depending on your mode of transport , but be warned that the bus does not run in the summer season . <p> Hirafu Village is the main village for the three ski resorts in the area , Niseko-Hirafu , Hiagashiyama , and Annupuri , of which Niseko-Hirafu is the largest . Hirafu is a charming small village and you can enjoy wandering around the streets with snow banks raising way above your head . The heart and soul of Hirafu Village is the Seicomart Convenience Store located on the main intersection in town .

To top it all off , I soon found out that Niseko Hirafu is one of few places in the world that offers seven-day-a-week night skiing until 9:00 pm " so no need to rush to the slopes in the morning . <p> At night , the village comes alive and is transformed from a cloud of white to a magical wonderland of brightly coloured lanterns and lights beaming from the oddest of locations . The smell of fireplaces fills the frosty air and people hustle and bustle from restaurants to bars whilst families build snowmen and revel in snowball fights . <p> Kutchan is the nearest town servicing Niseko Hirafu . You can find ski and board shops , cafes , 100-Yen shops and a large Max Value Supermarket . Only 20 minutes away by car , there are regular buses that take you into Kutchan . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to come by and when you do they most likely will not take foreign cards .

While you 're there , pop into Cafe Kaku and say hi ' to Jo the Californian monk and hang out in his cosy cafe . It offers the best place for a great espresso and wood-fired pizza . <p> After a hard day 's powder riding , a visit to the Yukoro Onsen is a must . Traditionally a secret local thing , visitors are now discovering the recuperative powers of the Onsen . If you do n't mind being nude with your friends and soaking in some hot thermal waters ( men and women in separate baths ) this is the place to be .

Nine times out of ten these creations are sketchy at best , but every now and then we can strike gold using the genius combination of laziness , necessity and luck . As it turns out , some of the world 's most beloved cuisines were the result of accidents " from potato chips to cereal , we 've picked five of our favourite food flukes from history . <p> Ice-cream conesAs well as being convenient and delicious , ice-cream cones were created on the spot as a quick-fix solution . It was 1904 at the St. Louis World 's Fair where a man named Ernest A.

The year was 1853 and George Crum was dealing with some serious sass from a gent who kept sending his French fries back , claiming that they were too thick . George ran out of patience and sliced the potatoes razor thin , fried them until crisp and covered them in extra salt .

The year was 1905 , and a young Frank Epperson had unwittingly left a cup filled with powdered soda , water , and a stirring stick on his San Francisco porch . Low overnight temperatures caused the mixture to freeze , and Frank 's Epsicle ' was created .
