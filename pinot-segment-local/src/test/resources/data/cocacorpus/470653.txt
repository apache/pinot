These buildings are located in some of Vancouver 's most desired neighbourhoods and come with a pretty sweet lifestyle and great history . One of the reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heritage loft apartment is simply because when developers convert the buildings from offices or warehouses to residences they try to keep as much of the original facade and interiors as possible so it is nearly impossible to dig deeper basements to accommodate more parking stalls . <p> Our advice to you is do n't let parking be an issue you ca n't overcome .

As realtors , a big part of our job is building and managing relationships , which got us to thinking about how the idea of a bully translates into our daily work . Namely , we see the term used when referring to bully offers . <p> In the current and highly competitive market , it 's common practice for a listing realtor to set a date ( typically a week from when the property was listed on MLS ) for offers to be reviewed by their seller . This allows ample time for the property to be marketed , and for potential buyers to come through an Open House . <p> Cue the bully offer , which is an offer that is submitted before the set dates , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they get the chance to look at any others . Of course , in order for this to work , the offer has to meet a few conditions : <p> 1 ) It will have to be high enough above the list price so as to convince the seller not to wait for other offers . <p> 2 ) The seller must agree to look at the offer , thus nulling the original set offer date . A seller can choose not to look at the bully offer , and wait until the set day as planned . <p> 3 ) The offer will need to be subject free , and a bank draft or deposit cheque will need to be on hand . <p> If a seller decides to look at a bully offer , their agent is obligated to notify every agent who has booked a showing and inform them of the change of plan .

Simply put it is the fear of the unknown . If there is a time-sensitive motivating factor behind the sale of the property ( a relocation , the purchase of a new property that closes in a month , etc ) , a bully offer with a price above asking puts all the pesky what-if ' scenarios that run through a sellers ' head to rest . There is no sure-fire way to know what will happen on offer day or if the property will go into multiples . A bully offer provides a guarantee , but it is at the expense of other potentially higher offers . <p> Is it wise to accept a bully offer as a seller ? There 's no blanket answer " it will all depend on the type of property you are selling , the neighbourhood that it 's in , the current market , and other factors .

@@47457616 @957616/ <h> BLOG <h> SEVENS <p> It is hard to believe that it was seven years ago that a fresh new real estate brokerage entered the scene . That 's right , Blu Realty was born 7 years ago today March 1st . The concept at the time was simple real estate can be really boring . Let 's make it fun . <p> I was four years into my career at the time . I had tried a few Brokerages in town , but they were all pretty much the samebeige , dull , old school . In my previous life , I had worked as a video game designer for Radical Entertainment . Our office was fun . Dogs ran freely . We had pool tables , foosball , and a gym . And we all worked towards the same goal . When I realized that did n't exist in our industry , I set out on a mission to make it happen . Around the same time , I adopted Lenny - a 7 year old hound/shepherd/lab cross and I was n't about to leave him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . So , with a couple other like-minded realtors ( and Lenny ) , we blazed our own path and created an office that was like no other : fun and collaborative , yet professional and sophisticated . Blu was spawned . <p> THE EARLY YEARS <p> With our funky little boutique down in Yorkville , we managed to dial in the fun and collaborative part right away . We had Lenny at the front door greeting everyone as they came in , the environment was sexy , we were young , we were hungry , and in my opinion we were causing waves in the industry . It was almost like an experiment - put a bunch of fun , driven , and ambitious folks together and see where we can go ( It helped that I was reading Good to Great by Jim Collins at the time ) . It was exciting and we were growing . <p> THE TEENAGE YEARS <p> Soon we grew out of our space and it was time to move on . We opened our Cambie location in 2010 and we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure . Slicker , fancier office . The team grew and the brand evolved . Yet , the concept was the same - Lenny 's warm welcoming face at the front and a bunch of hard working professionals in the back . However , when the lease was up , we realized we were surrounded by a bunch of big box stores and we did n't feel at home . Once again , it was time to move on . <p> HERE AND NOW <p> We were lucky enough to find our awesome current location at 86 Kingsway last year . That 's when I donned the overalls , picked up the hammer and got to work on making the space home . We are now fully settled and could n't be happier . Although the west side is nice , we are much more at home in East Van . And as Lenny gets a little older the shorter commute suits him just fine . For him , this has been a 49 ( dog ) year adventure . And to be honest , it feels a little like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we were the rebels of the industryBreaking the rules and having fun . Then we hit our development years , where we really started to dial things in . And now , just like Lenny , we are little greyer , a bit more mature , but still wagging our tails and having a ton of fun . <p> WHAT " S NEXT ? <p> This industry is changing all the time and we will do our best to blaze the trail once again . We will be launching our new site this year , adding to our already amazing team , embarking on some fun new concepts , and getting the word out that Blu Realty is really where its at . But most of all , we will continue to foster an environment that keeps us smiling , keeps us laughing , and keeps people coming in to give Lenny lots of love up front ... because after 50 years on the job , he deserves it ! 98367 @qwx508367

@@47457630 @957630/ <h> BLOG <h> #52 - 1425 LAMEY 'S MILL ROAD <p> So you 're in the market for an apartment . Something in the West End , perhaps . Maybe something with a view . You 've done your research ; you know roughly what it 's going to cost you . But then , you come across a listing that 's well under market value . If this is the case , you 've likely stumbled upon a leasehold agreement property . <p> What exactly is a leasehold agreement , you might ask ? A leasehold agreement grants you the exclusive rights to occupy a property for a limited period of time ( typically between 50 and 99 years from the onset ) . In Vancouver , these properties are most commonly owned by the City of Vancouver , but are also owned by the federal government , universities , Indian Bands and even private individuals . So when you are purchasing a lease , you are buying the rights to the property for the period ( or remaining period ) of the lease agreement as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Vancouver , you can most often find leasehold apartments sprinkled around the West End and False Creek , and leasehold houses and duplexes on Vancouver 's Westside in Point Grey and on the University Endowment Lands . To the right buyer , snagging a leasehold property in such an expensive locale can be an awesome deal . <p> While it 's true that a leasehold purchase may not exactly equate to the classic dream of home ownership , that does n't mean it ca n't be a great opportunity . Leasehold properties tend to be located in desirable areas , and are almost always cheaper than purchasing the freehold equivalent . Given the lower price point , you might be able to buy into a better lifestyle than you could otherwise afford " this could mean living in a more popular area , being closer to amenities and attractions that are important to you , or maybe buying a larger or nicer unit . For obvious reasons , leasehold properties do n't generally make for the best purchase if we are speaking strictly in investment terms , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money over time . <p> Allow us to explain . Leasehold properties hold intrinsic value in their rent equivalents . Given that buying a leasehold property gives you the right to occupy the unit in today 's dollars , the value of this rent equivalent will increase over time as all things do ( although at a lesser rate than a freehold property would ) . <p> The important thing to remember is that as the lease gets closer to its expiry date , the market value of the property as a whole will diminish . This is because of the uncertainty for leasehold owners when a lease expires . If a lease agreement is renewed , it will be done in current-day dollars , which will almost certainly represent an increase in price . If the lease is not renewed , you will be paid fair market value for your asset , but you will have to move on and out to somewhere else . <p> There can also be uncertainty with regards to financing . Banks will generally ask for a hefty down payment ( 25-30% ) when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expiry date of a lease when determining the amortization period for a loan . So , the fewer years left on your loan , the shorter the amortization period will be . For this reason , leasehold properties tend to be popular with individuals who have already built up equity elsewhere . <p> All this talk throwing your head for a loop ? The most important thing to consider when buying a leasehold property is the amount of time left on the lease when you purchase it , relative to the amount of time that you intend to hold the property for . If you 're planning on selling the property in the future , make sure that there are at least 25-odd years left on your lease by the time that you do . This will allow the property to be reasonably marketable to another buyer . If you 're planning on living in the property , ask yourself if you 'll be willing to pay an increased price or to move on and out when the lease eventually expires . <p> Leasehold properties are n't for everyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Aimed at raising awareness and preventing bullying among children and adolescents in school , Coast Capital will donate $1 to the CKNW Orphans ' Fund for every positive message shared on social media with the hashtag #pinkshirtpromise . As realtors , a big part of our job is building and managing relationships , which got us to thinking about how the idea of a bully translates into our daily work . Namely , we see the term used when referring to bully offers . <p> In the current and highly competitive market , it 's common practice for a listing realtor to set a date ( typically a week from when the property was listed on MLS ) for offers to be reviewed by their seller . This allows ample time for the property to be marketed , and for potential buyers to come through an Open House . <p> Cue the bully offer , which is an offer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bullying ' the seller into accepting their offer before they get the chance to look at any others . Of course , in order for this to work , the offer has to meet a few conditions : <p> 1 ) It will have to be high enough above the list price so as to convince the seller not to wait for other offers . <p> 2 ) The seller must agree to look at the offer , thus nulling the original set offer date . A seller can choose not to look at the bully offer , and wait until the set day as planned . <p> 3 ) The offer will need to be subject free , and a bank draft or deposit cheque will need to be on hand . <p> If a seller decides to look at a bully offer , their agent is obligated to notify every agent who has booked a showing and inform them of the change of plan . Bully offers usually come with a very short irrevocable , in order to prevent other buyers from putting together an offer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to our next point " what might compel a seller to accept a bully offer ? Simply put it is the fear of the unknown . If there is a time-sensitive motivating factor behind the sale of the property ( a relocation , the purchase of a new property that closes in a month , etc ) , a bully offer with a price above asking puts all the pesky what-if ' scenarios that run through a sellers ' head to rest . There is no sure-fire way to know what will happen on offer day or if the property will go into multiples . A bully offer provides a guarantee , but it is at the expense of other potentially higher offers . <p> Is it wise to accept a bully offer as a seller ? There 's no blanket answer " it will all depend on the type of property you are selling , the neighbourhood that it 's in , the current market , and other factors . That being said , many bully offers end up being less than what would have been paid on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable properties are almost certain to go into multiple offers , which is what is ultimately going to get you top dollar as a seller . <p> As a result , we usually advise our sellers to play by the rules , and not to succumb to the tantalizing allure of the bully offer . Nevertheless , bully offers are a reality of the real estate industry , so the most important thing that you can do is to work with an experienced agent who will be able to provide the best advice given your situation .

We 're already feeling the effects of one of many heat waves this summer , which means finding ways to keep cool in your home . And since few homes ( especially condos ) here in Vancouver are AC equipped , here are some tips for staying cool during the dog days of summer . <p> 1 . AC all day <p> Buy a portable AC unit . They are easy to install and can be moved from room to room . Not ideal for a house , but perfect for a townhouse . <p> 2 . Keep the peeping toms out <p> Closing the blinds in rooms that are exposed to direct sunlight will keep your home a few degrees cooler and provide you with the added bonus of being able to walk around in the buff . Or , if you 're a sci-fi fan you can purchase shiny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay even cooler inside and people will think you 're conducting <p> 3 . Become a fan of fans <p> But you better do it quickly . As soon as it starts to get warm , the mad rush to buy fans begins and before you know it they 'll all be sold out . Stylish Dyson fans can be found at The Bay . <p> Keeping a window open at night , with a rotating fan on full blast is a great way to cool <p> the house down once the sun sets . Also , your hair blows around which makes you look like your in a music video . <p> 4 . Put another shrimp on the barby <p> If you have a back yard or patio , try doing as much of your cooking outside in a barbecue . Keeping your stove and elements off inside keeps the heat down . Plus you get to barbecue and have friends over . Also , cold beer . <p> 5 . Hire a man servant <p> A man servant can follow you around all day with a fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this sounds like a bad , expensive idea . See tips 1-4 above , instead . 98367 @qwx508367

@@47457739 @957739/ <h> BLOG <h> RAILTOWN ON THE RISE <p> We explored the historic Railtown hood this past week in a real foodie fashion with our friend Bonnie at Off the Eaten Track . A culinary walking tour was the perfect way to get to know a neighbourhood in our opinion , a little food , a little wine but the best part was getting to know the owners of each establishment , and learning the history of the neighbourhood . <p> We visited some of the neighbourhood 's gems and one of the most inspiring was the H.A.V.E cafe . A cafe by store front but the back was full of hope , it 's a culinary training school that provides foodservice job training and work opportunities to those who experience barriers to employment . H.A.V.E.s students are youth and adults facing mental and physical disabilities , poverty , addiction and homelessness . It was so admiring to see an established chef like Amber , who worked in some of the finest restaurants and hotels in Vancouver to give her time to run this program with the success rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are planning on their second location in North Vancouver by this summer . Amber blessed us with her tasty tomatoe soup and grilled cheese sandwich during our short visit . Not often do we like to say " this is the best we 've ever had " but we might have to pull that card with her tomatoe soup . It 's been her seceret weapon for the past 20 years . We wish the H.A.V.E . cafe a world of luck ! <p> Next stop , Vancouver Urban Winery , known for their tap wines and amazing atmosphere . They keg wines from mostly the Okanagan and a few occasional overseas wineries who requires this method . We really like the idea of tapping wines to help eliminate waste especially for a restaurant business where they run through wine like water . Of course they stick in their lane and they do n't mess with the oak aged wines that are not meant to breath . These guys are also known for their long table dinners , impressive parties and weddings . <p> Find them : 55 Dunlevy Ave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6:00pm . <p> On to one of the neighbourhood 's favourite cafe , Railtown Cafe .
