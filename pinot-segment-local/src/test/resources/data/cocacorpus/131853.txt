@@98005559 @2205559/ <h> 4 Ways to Manage Unstructured Data with ECM <p> According to IDC " a technology-focused research firm " the amount of global data created and replicated annually will reach 44 zettabytes ( or 44 trillion gigabytes ) by 2020 . <p> Much of this data " including emails , photographs , video , social media content and text documents " is unstructured , meaning that it has no identifiable structure ( like a spreadsheet or database has ) . <p> The information contained in unstructured data is not always easy to access and identify because it is not as easily queried as information categorized in a database or spreadsheet . Because it is often difficult to access , unstructured data can be a liability in the event of an audit or lawsuit . <p> Here are four ways that an enterprise content management ( ECM ) system can help manage unstructured data so that it is accessible , searchable , available and relevant . <h> Accessible Content <p> In order for unstructured data to be managed , it must first be accessible from a centralized location . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content to be stored in the same repository , including : <p> Text documents <p> Spreadsheets <p> Emails <p> PDFs <p> Photos <p> Videos <p> Special design files <p> And more <p> Not only is this content accessible from a centralized location , but it can be opened in its native application ( ( i.e. , a Microsoft Word document will open in Microsoft Word ) " making it easier to read and more usable . <p> An ECM repository allows for centralized storage of different types of content . <p> Learn the different ways to capture unstructured data in an ECM repository in this two-part series : Part 1 and Part 2 . <h> Searchable Content <p> Browsing through folders does not always lead to finding the required information , since sometimes what you need is buried deep within a single document . With an ECM system , once unstructured data is stored in a centralized repository , it becomes easily searchable . <p> ECM systems can run optical character recognition ( OCR ) on any documents with text , such as Microsoft Word files or PDFs , allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to OCR , all documents stored in an ECM repository have metadata applied to them . Applying metadata , which is data about data , makes content easy to categorize and analyze . <h> Available Content <p> Unstructured data is only useful if it is readily available . In today 's society , more and more employees are accessing documents through a mobile device as opposed to a laptop or desktop computer . It is therefore imperative that all content be accessible and searchable from a smartphone or tablet in order for it to be useful . <p> A mobile ECM application makes this possible by allowing the content to be retrieved from any device , and by pushing notifications to the user whenever a document needs attention . <p> An ECM mobile application allows an employee to take action on documents from any device . <h> Relevant Content <p> Just because content is centralized , searchable and available does n't make it useful . Data has to be relevant in order for it to really have an impact on projects or decisions . One way to make sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date . <p> Automatic versioning in an ECM system allows for different versions of the same file to be saved in one place , ensuring that whenever an employee opens the file , he is looking at the most recent version . Since all of the document versions are tracked , comments , notes and information about why changes were made are also accessible if anyone wants to see what decisions led to the final version . <p> An ECM system allows for automatic versioning of documents . <p> Learn how the DCD Group is using versioning to manage project documentation here . <h> Unstructured Data Transformed <p> When unstructured data is accessible , searchable , available and relevant ( i.e. , provided within context ) , it is transformed into information that an organization can use to make better decisions , respond to client requests and ensure transparency . An ECM system allows organizations to harness the power of unstructured data to improve their performance . <p> But what about when you no longer need regular access to all that data ?

@@98005560 @2205560/ <h> 5 Reasons to Manage Contracts with Document Management Software <p> Contract management can be a paper-heavy and time-intensive process due to excessive contract length , revisions and approval steps . In addition , contracts must be stored in an easily accessible place so that they are available for reference at any time until they expire or are renewed . Here are five reasons why a document management system is a great tool for contract management . <h> 1 . Decreased Costs <p> Storing contracts in an electronic repository results in decreased storage , printing and courier costs . Contracts can be shared by email or through an online web portal " eliminating the need to ship huge packets of paper . They can also be signed electronically , eliminating printing completely . <p> For example , Arquivo Digital manages contracts for vehicle financing in Brazil . By automating contract management , contracts can be scanned in at any location " including the depths of the Amazon jungle " and accessed immediately through an online portal . <p> Electronic content management systems can make contracts accessible even from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Control <p> It is possible to store all versions of the same contract in one document , ensuring that the newest version is always the one being accessed and revised . Different levels of contract access can be granted to different individuals . For example , the legal counsel will be able to edit the contracts while the records manager may only be able to read the content . <p> For example , Fairfield Industries uses an ECM system to manage valuable contracts related to seismic equipment . The system gives the organization the ability to provide the landman with instant access to the documents he needs " while still protecting confidential information in compliance with regulations . <h> 3 . Improved Accountability <p> Electronic contracts stored in a repository can be accessed from any computer or mobile device . Making contracts so easily accessible leads to improved accountability over stipulations and conditions , since a contract can be viewed at any time . For example , United Road Towing scans all documents related to towed vehicles into an ECM repository and makes them available to its customers through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all related documents on the same day as the tow , eliminating any confusion regarding the conditions of the tow . <h> 4 . Increased Productivity <p> Reviewing and approving contracts is faster when an electronic contract arrives in your email inbox rather than a hard-to-sort stack of paper delivered via a courier service . Even if the recipient is out of the office , he can review and sign the contract from a mobile device . <p> Digitized contracts can be signed electronically . <p> Automating contract management helped the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center decrease processing time from six to eight weeks to one to two weeks per contract . Once scanned into the ECM repository , contracts are automatically assigned to staff members according to contract type and routed to various parties for simultaneous review , eliminating bottlenecks . <h> 5 . Simplified Records Management <p> Electronic contract storage simplifies records management in multiple ways . Records managers can be automatically notified when a contract is close to expiration , so that they can earmark it for renewal or automatic archival . <p> Keeping contracts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as appropriate retention can be applied automatically . Stewart Enterprises juggles different regulations for its contracts and facilities across the country . Storing contracts in an electronic repository allows the company to track and store documents in compliance with these regulations while still giving employees access to the documents they need to work with a client 's file . <p> Are you convinced that automated contract management can make your life easier ?

If they 're working with physical documents that are being scanned in , it may be easiest for them to open up the existing document in the repository , and click on the Scanning button in the toolbar .

Before you jump into your Workflow implementation , however , it is vitally important to diagram your business processes to ensure that they are as simple , logical and consistent as possible . <h> Why should I diagram my business process ? <p> A business process diagram is a roadmap for implementation " it outlines the expected outcome and provides something concrete to build from . <p> Diagramming a business process : <p> Makes it possible to look at the big picture and take into account all types of potential scenarios . <p> Helps you research and understand your process thoroughly so that you can see how it can be changed or improved when automated . <p> Produces a visual aid that everyone can agree on " ensuring that everyone is on the same page . <p> Helps you reduce upfront errors and prevent unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business process ? <p> There are three steps to diagramming a business process : <p> Create an initial diagram based on upfront discovery . <p> Gather the additional requirements . <p> Incorporate those requirements into the diagram . <p> If need be , repeat steps 2 and 3 until everyone is satisfied with the end result . <p> Create an initial diagram based on upfront discovery . <p> An initial diagram is a general overview of what the stakeholders think the business process looks like . This is the general diagram that you will be " fleshing out " throughout the diagramming process . Before crafting this diagram , sit down with stakeholders to come up with initial , high-level steps in the business process . <p> Here is an example of an initial diagram for a purchase order generation process : <p> Gather the additional requirements . <p> Gathering requirements consists of obtaining information about the business process from the people involved in each step , such as end users , stakeholders , administrative assistants and department heads . <p> During requirements gathering phase , you may discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current office workflow is exceedingly frustrating . You can also find out how tasks are actually completed as opposed to how they are supposed to be completed . <p> Answer these questions during requirements gathering : <p> What is the overall goal of the business process ? <p> What triggers the start of the process ? <p> What signals the end of the process ? <p> What are the activities in each step and who is involved in each activity ? <p> Are there any alternate routes in the process ? <p> Make sure you use specific terminology when questioning users and have them explain ambiguous phrases . <p> Examples : <p> " File " can mean a single document or a packet of individual documents . <p> " Sending " a document can mean e-mailing it , saving it on a network folder or transporting the hard copy . <p> Some other commonly misunderstood and misused terms include : <p> Bring in/store . <p> Can/cannot access . <p> Review . <p> Receive . <p> Notify . <p> Process . <p> Diagramming business processes is the perfect opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ask yourself : <p> Are there any steps in the process that seem redundant ? <p> Is there a certain part of the process that can be reconfigured to be more efficient ? <p> Do n't  be afraid to make changes to the current process and incorporate those into your diagram . <p> Incorporate those requirements into the diagram . <p> Once you 've gathered the requirements , incorporate them into your diagram by fleshing out each step . Do n't  make assumptions even on little things such as the format of a date field " a diagram is useless unless it is detailed , correct and comprehensive . <p> Show this diagram to the stakeholders and end users to make sure that they are satisfied with the finalized process . Revise the diagram until everyone is satisfied with the final version , but make sure that you keep the goal of the process in mind the entire time . Remember that this diagram should be finalized when it shows a process that achieves this goal and not necessarily when every user or departments wish is fulfilled . <p> The final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed than the initial diagram : <h> Rethink the current process <p> Purchasing Laserfiche provides a great opportunity to perfect and streamline existing processes to make them as smooth and efficient as possible .

@@98005585 @2205585/ <h> Question <h> Question <h> Is there a way to remove an electronic document via Workflow and/or the Client ? <p> We have a workflow process setup for a client that provides them with an Excel template that they use to create a quote , then use Snapshot/Generate pages to image the quote . The generated pages and the electronic file end up in the same Laserfiche document at this point . After the quote is imaged , the electronic file is no longer needed and we would like to move the electronic file to an backup/archive folder which we have setup already . I have not been able to find a way to separate out the electronic file without creating duplicate copies of the pages and copying the metadata to it . The problem with that is the workflow instance is running under the original Laserfiche document that has the electronic file attached to it and not the new document that contacts the pages . <p> Part two of this question , is there a way to remove an electronic file via the Laserfiche Client ? <h> Answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi Brian , <p> Short answer : yes , it 's possible to accomplish both things ! <p> 1 . For separating out the electronic file from its pages and moving them to different locations , you could approach this in a couple of ways . I would use Workflow to first move the document to where you want the archived copy to be housed . Then I would use a combination of the workflow activities Create Entry , Move Pages , Copy Metadata , and Create Link : <p> These would essentially create a shell for the document 's pages , then move the pages out of the entry that has the electronic file component and into the new shell , copy the original metadata to this new entry , and then associate the two entries with a link so that they can be easily referenced together . Note , however , that the document composed only of the pages will not retain information from the original such as creation date or business process history . <p> 2 . To delete an electronic file from the client , select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Files . This will leave you with the pages , metadata , etc. associated with that entry . <p> Thanks , that is pretty much exactly how I am doing it now . This does essentially work , but the business process history is lost and is essentially on the wrong document . The document with the pages is what will be viewed often and although the workflow is finished , it would be nice to know it was run and all of the steps , dates , etc. it ran . I did n't have the create link in there , which would at least let them reference back to the electronic file ( which contains the business process info ) , which I think I will add that and should suffice . Thanks ! <p> Another option would be for you to use Workflow to copy the entry , move the copy to the archival location , delete the copy 's pages ( if you want the archived version to only have the electronic file component and not pages ) , and then link the two together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version . However , Workflow ca n't delete electronic files for you , so the original entry would have both the pages and the electronic file in it unless a user manually deletes its electronic file . <p> If there 's only one business process instance on the original document ( and that 's also the instance where the copy gets created ) , you can use the Associate Entries activity to also attach the new doc to this business process . Then the history will show on it too . <p> We have a similar scenario where a " flat " PDF and edible PDF are created . The " flat " PDF is routed around for approval , while the edible PDF is waiting in the wings for additional sensitive information that will be added at the end of the business process . Once the routing and approvals are complete , the edible PDF is downloaded and attached to replace the " flat " PDF . We need to retain the business process details , and keep the edible PDF with the sensitive information . Is there an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to avoid multiple versions of the document . <p> And as a side note , what are the mechanics of the business process details ? Are they a part of the electronic file and that 's why replacing it deletes it ? <p> You should not need to use the aforementioned techniques at all in your case . If you simply replace the electronic file ( in this case , replacing the existing " Flat " PDF with the editable PDF ) using the Attach Electronic Document activity you should retain all of your Business Process Details . <p> The reason the solution Kelsey mentioned in the selected answer will not have the Business Process History associated is because it creates a completely new document in Laserfiche , rather than making changes to an existing document . Changing the associated electronic file is not the same as creating a new separate document . <p> Metadata ( information about the document , from Fields and Tags to Version History and Business Process History ) <p> If you create a new document by copying an existing document , you carry over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some metadata . Specifically , Templates , Fields , Tags and Digital Signatures are all copied , but Version History and Business Process History are not . <p> You can think of it as metadata that is assigned ( a Signature or a Tag ) is included , but metadata about the history of the document is not . This is like how the name of a document is copied , but not the creation date .

Could n't be simpler . Nothing in SQL is changed so no need for concern there . Repository will require a re-index as part of the upgrade but again this is wizard based and very straight forward .

We have configured our approval workflow however ca n't work out how to get the " Update Word Doc " activity to work , the resulting file can not be attached to an email for some reason and we can not work out how to save the file produced to the student folder in Laserfiche . <p> Attached is a copy of our workflow - do we need to add some other activities to achieve the desired result ? <h> Answer <p> I created a new entry , I modify the Template word document from Inside the workflow server and save the result with the attach electronic document activity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description , the document is saved for further use by worflow activity . that means you need to use an activity that will use that update activity .. so I use the attach electronic doc activity after the update and it works for me . <h> Replies <p> Correction you need to add the 2 activities , the first one is " create entry " and the second is " attach electronic document " , the second activity will add to your new created entry an electronic document ( copy of your word template ) . And from there you will be able to use that entry to update the word document and send it by email <p> Thanks for your help Rene , i incorporated your suggestions into the workflow , but the Update word doc function does n't seem to updating the word doc and there is an option to convert to a PDF , which just seems to write xml connection string data out to the PDF . <p> Your suggestion of creating an electronic document does create a doc , but just the Update Word doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not played with this new feature yet , but just thinking . Did you make your entry file the word Template ? when you do the update word doc activity , did you choose the good entry to do the modification , maybe your entry is not the word Template but the forms save file ? <p> means you seem to do a search for a document in the student folder , but I did not see any find entry to look for the word Template that you want to modify . So you need to find the word Template and use that find entry as the source of your update word doc activity and also use it in the email4 activity as the source entry to send it by email .

Progress is nil , and the potential for self-destruction is almost comical . Glassdoor is an employer review site that reveals the best " and worst " companies to work for . Employees at low rated companies frequently mention " poor communication " and " disorganization " in their reviews , which are key indicators that collaboration is lacking . Not coincidentally , several of these companies have also been rated poorly by their customers . Here are four ways an organization can drive interdepartmental collaboration , which can ultimately improve customer service . <h> 1 . Focus on the Main Goal <p> In BOOM ! : 7 Choices for Blowing the Doors Off Business-As-Usual , authors Kevin and Jackie Freiberg point out that firefighters , police forces and other first responders rarely get caught up in " tribalistic " or fragmented behavior when working together because there is no confusion as to what their goal is : saving lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works toward a shared goal . Its no longer about every department for itself " its about working together to accomplish the larger enterprise mission . <h> 2 . Start from the Top <p> A culture of collaboration ultimately begins with the leadership team . According to leadership development consultant Susan Cucuzza , collaboration can turn into competition when it is n't managed well . " Because collaboration consists of interdisciplinary groups trying to come together , intended collaboration can turn into whose idea is better , whose solution should be followed and who is smarter , " says Cucuzza . Having departmental leaders step up to oversee collaboration is a great start . Cucuzza argues that even informal or unofficial leaders can be a huge help in determining who needs to be involved , helping everyone understand the benefits of collaborating and identifying the overall goal . <h> 3 . Whiteboard the Collaborative Processes <p> A large part of understanding how departments fit together to achieve the organizations mission is knowing what and how a department contributes to a process . Several companies that have gone through company-wide system updates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams and departments together to understand multi-department tasks . Extensively " whiteboarding " every process was helpful for two reasons : <p> With the entire team in the room , everyone was able to see how every role contributed to each process . <p> Everyone involved had a chance to provide input on how to make the process better and to officially agree on how new processes would work . <p> Of course , it is n't necessary to wait for a system overhaul to get to know the departments around the organization . Bringing teams together is a proactive way to give departments the opportunity to learn about each other and discover : <p> What other departments do . <p> What tasks require which departments . <p> How departments support each other . <p> What pressures , roadblocks and barriers other departments face in carrying out the enterprise mission . <h> 4 .

( The IT department at Hanover County only provides support . ) Here are some of my strategies for planning , designing and implementing your very first Laserfiche Workflow . <p> " I know it can seem scary , but you can do it ! " <h> Before you start designing <p> 1 . Sit down and make a list of ideas of processes within your department or organization that you would like to automate . Remember to start simple . <p> " Sometimes the small workflow is as important as the big , flashy one . " <p> Our first workflow dealt with obtaining Statutory Assessment Worksheets , routing them to managers for approval and then routing them to the records folders for storage and retention . <p> 2 . Determine the goal of your workflow . Your goal should be specific . In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminate redundant printing of Statutory Assessment Worksheets . " Ask yourself if you are automating a process or trying to solve a problem . <p> If you see or experience an actual breakdown in the efficiency of the current process , then you should first solve the problem before automating the process . <p> 3 . Do your research and take advantage of the multitude of resources available to all Laserfiche users : <p> The many white papers available on the Support Site provide specific details on various aspects of the workflow design process . <p> Your VAR is also an excellent resource . I put my VAR on speed dial and called them whenever I ran into problems or lost my confidence . <h> Diagram your process <p> Once you 've determined the process and the goal and educated yourself on workflow design , it is time to actually diagram the process . <p> Gather all of the stakeholders in one place and come up with a diagram of how the business process should look . When designing my first workflow , I invited the managers who are responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager to join me . I drew out the whole process on a piece of paper and we discussed all of the detailed steps together , going into such specifics as how the manager would prefer to approve the worksheets ( with a template field or a personal stamp ) . <p> Remember that it is ok to change or revise current processes in order to make your workflows as efficient as possible . Sometimes you may think that the process works one way , but in reality , there are certain steps you may have skipped . <p> " Time spent diagramming upfront will more than pay itself back later . " <p> It is important that you do not skimp on the planning phase . The more you put into the actual design of the session , the better the end result . When constructing my workflows , I spend more time planning than actually designing . <h> Design the workflow <p> Once you have finalized your actual diagram and gone through as many changes as necessary , it is time to stat designing your actual workflow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities . Here are some things to keep in mind when designing your workflow : <p> You must have Workflow Designer actually installed on your computer or on the computer where you want to design the workflow . <p> It is a best practice to create a user account for Laserfiche Workflow in the Administration Console . This user will be the one performing all of the automated tasks when the workflows actually run . <p> One of the most important parts of designing workflows is specifying the starting rules " what conditions will invoke the workflow . When setting up your starting rules , make sure to follow these guidelines : <p> Exclude the Workflow user from being able to initiate workflows in order to prevent " runaway workflows " workflows that that keep initiating themselves in an endless loop . <p> Make the entry type ( document , folder , etc. ) and path as specific as possible in order to prevent the workflow from starting when you do not want it to . <p> Remember , if you start designing and lose your confidence , just call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come and sit with me for the day while I designed my first workflow . Just having him there boosted my confidence . <p> Design as much as you want since you can always delete and start over . <p> Do n't  be afraid to publish what you 've designed . You must first publish the workflow before creating the starting rule . <p> The most important thing to remember is : <p> " Test and test again " even VARs need a few tries to get things working 100% . " <p> I had to test my first workflow at least 15 times before I got it to work exactly as I wanted . You can create sample documents and then run them through the workflow as you are designing it to make sure that the workflow functions as expected . It is much safer to test on sample documents than actual live data . <h> Now that you 've completed your first workflow <p> Unveil your first workflow to your users , as well as your boss . Make sure you do n't  tell them that it was n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workflow as needed . Simply make the changes you want in the Laserfiche Workflow Designer and republish until you are fully satisfied . After my first workflow went live , I had to revise some of the e-mail activities because , after seeing the actual process in action , we determined that they could be optimized . <p> Pat yourself on the back and move on to the next one !

Do n't  despair . Here are five steps to help you migrate from one ECM system to another . <h> 1 . Take inventory of your current system <p> There is a good chance that your current ECM system has existed for quite a while . Perhaps it was even installed before you started working at your organization . The first step in your migration is to evaluate the current system and take inventory of everything that you 'll have to migrate . Ask yourself these questions : <p> How many documents will need to be migrated ? - What types of documents are they ? <p> Are there any workflows that need to be rebuilt ? <p> Is the metadata from your current systems database easy to export ? <p> Also , if you have any other systems integrated with your current ECM system , find out how those integrations are configured . <h> 2 . Figure out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clean up your existing content and see what youd like to improve in your new ECM system . To figure out what needs to be changed , ask yourself these questions : <p> Are you currently storing unnecessary documents or files ? Are there any files that are n't  being stored but that you 'd like to store ? <p> Can you optimize your folder structure ? <p> Are you storing all the information that you need in your metadata or are there different types of information that youd like to store ? <p> Are there any other systems with which youd like to integrate ? <p> Can you improve your workflows ? Are there additional business processes that youd like to automate ? <h> 3 . Create the new folder structure , document templates and workflows <p> Once you 've created a vision for your new ECM system , you must prepare it for migration by setting up the folder structure , document templates and workflows. - This is also the time to set up the appropriate security settings . Watch this video to learn how Acenden was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , set up security and use workflows to create its folder structure . <h> 4 .

@@98005621 @2205621/ <h> 5 Things I Wish I 'd Known About Organizing My Repository <p> A disorganized ECM repository can lead to wasted time , reduced productivity and employee frustration . Here are five things to keep in mind when setting up an organized repository . <h> 1. - Set up a comprehensive folder structure <p> When designing your folder structure , start with a broad category at the top level and split it into subfolders of more narrow subcategories . Each folder should have only one purpose . Store related documents in the same folder in order to quickly find documents later . For example , even though the Property Transfers Division at Fresno County deals with 33 different documents , it only has 19 folders in its directory . <p> Fresno Countys Property Transfer Divisions folder structure . <h> 2 . Stick to a naming convention <p> Folder and document names should be clear , consistent and avoid abbreviations or codes . In this way , employees will know where to find what they need and where to save appropriate documents . For example , the City of Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its documents according to the standard naming convention of " Document Type " Last Name " First Name . " <p> City of Mount Pearls naming convention . <h> 3. - Design templates efficiently <p> There should not be as many document templates as documents . Too many templates can cause user confusion when scanning or importing new content into the repository . Reduce the number of document templates by looking for commonalities among all the document types and consolidating different documents into one template . If all other metadata is the same , a " Document Type " list field can serve to distinguish one document from another . For example , the Fresno County Property Transfers Division discovered many pieces of information that all of the document types shared . This led it to create a single Property Transfers template for its 33 different document types . <h> 4. - Configure appropriate security <p> Appropriate security is key to maintaining an organized repository . To prevent users from making many copies of the same document , moving documents into incorrect folders or accidentally deleting something important , grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs . To maintain an uncluttered repository , do not allow users to create documents at the root folder level but instead assign each user a personal folder within which they have full rights to create and delete documents . Once those documents are finalized or ready for review , the user can simply start a Laserfiche Workflow business process to send the document on its way . <h> 5. - Take advantage of automation <p> Maintaining a comprehensive folder structure , consistent naming convention and efficient templates can be time consuming if done by hand . Automation can keep the repository organized while taking the burden off users . Laserfiche Workflow can assign the appropriate template , rename documents and folders based on field values and create the appropriate folders . For example , as part of its permitting process , the City of Newport Beach , CA , uses Laserfiche Workflow to populate each permits metadata , rename it and route it to the correct folder for storage . <p> In addition to helping keep your repository organized , automation can help streamline your business processes .

The sooner documents are saved in the system , the sooner they can be used , filed to retention standards and audited . <p> Here are a number of capture strategies to improve enterprise-wide compliance and information transparency . <h> If You 're Dealing with Paper Documents <p> Most organizations , even those that have an ECM system , still receive and process a lot of paper documents . Laserfiche has five quick ways to get these physical documents into the repository : <p> Laserfiche Scanning is ideal for capturing single documents or mixed batches of documents that do n't require much metadata entry . This capture method is perfect for scanning incoming correspondence ( i.e. , pieces of mail ) . <p> Laserfiche PhotoDocs allows you to convert photographs into electronic documents . It is ideal for use with books , unusually sized documents such as receipts or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrolls . <p> Laserfiche PhotoDocs is perfect for scanning book pages into Laserfiche <p> Laserfiche Quick Fields is used to process a large number of documents and automate the associated data entry and classification . For example , it can be used by an accounts payable department for scanning batches of incoming invoices or checks and automatically populating the metadata . <p> Laserfiche Import Agent moves documents from specified network folders into the Laserfiche repository " either continuously or on a set schedule . For example , a teacher can scan student documents onto a network drive from a scanner in her classroom and Import Agent will import these documents into the appropriate Laserfiche folders every night . <p> Laserfiche Connector can automatically launch Laserfiche Scanning from a third-party application so that the appropriate document can be scanned . For example , a financial advisor can use this tool to scan a new customer 's document from the customer relationship management ( CRM ) system directly into Laserfiche . The document 's metadata is automatically populated with customer information from the CRM reducing potential errors associated with manual data entry . 9785 @qwx869785 9781 @qwx869781 9780 @qwx869780 9783 @qwx869783

@@98005644 @2205644/ <h> Best Practices in Records Management <p> Laserfiche Records Management Edition ( RME ) functions as an integral part of a well-designed records management program . It has easily configurable components that fit all of your organizations business needs . Here are some tips and tricks for both records managers and administrators for ensuring a smooth RME implementation . <h> Records Manager <p> The role of a records manager is to manage the records of an organization according to a formal plan . One of the obstacles records managers face is that retention schedules may not provide explicit instructions . This gray area can be used to your advantage by allowing a bit of leeway when setting up cutoff instructions . <p> A cutoff instruction determines when a record is eligible for cutoff ( eligible to enter retention ) . There are seven different cutoff instructions in Laserfiche , but we will focus on the three most popular : <p> Time-based cutoff : When a retention schedule is triggered based on a time-based cycle period ( such as monthly or weekly ) . <p> Event-based cutoff : When an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggers a retention schedule . <p> Time + Event-based cutoff : Triggered when an event occurs , but the records are only eligible for cutoff after a subsequent time-based cycle period . Basically , this cutoff collects all of the records for which retention was triggered by an event and gives them all the same starting date for future eligibility calculations . <p> It is a best practice to use either a Time-based or Time + Event-based cutoff . When it comes time for final disposition , all the records with the same cutoff eligibility date will be eligible for disposition on the same date , enabling you to process hundreds of records in one batch instead of one record at a time . Most regulations specify a minimum retention period , so keeping a record a few weeks longer in order to process it with other records should not be a problem . <p> Reuse instruction definitions <p> Many records management instruction definitions are similar . For example , there is usually a standardized archive location , general standard retention times for basic handling and so on . Creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reuse them across record types and keep the number of unique instructions to pick from to a minimum , making records management much more efficient . <p> For example , let 's use the following physical retention schedule for a university and convert it to RME . <p> The easiest way to do this is to reuse some of the elements . The color-coded items are the ones that we can group together . <p> From this we can create two different cutoff instructions : <p> Time-based : Academic Year . <p> Time + Event-based : An event + Academic Year . <p> We can also create three retention schedules : <p> 1 year , then destroy . <p> 6 years , then accession to " Academic Registry " . <p> 3 years , then destroy . <h> Laserfiche Administrator <p> The Laserfiche administrators role involves creating , configuring , securing and maintaining the enterprise content management system . Here are some suggestions to make this system easy to maintain , from a records perspective : <p> Determine which documents are records . Not every document is considered a record , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records folder . <p> Organize your records series on a broad level , such as by department or by content type and year , and the records folders at a more specific level , such as by month or employee name . <p> In addition to making your records retention easier to apply , organizing your records in this way imposes a limit on how many records can be stored in a particular folder . For example , there is a limited number of records that can be stored in the folder corresponding to the month of May in the year 2011 . This will prevent your system from infinite growth , which could negatively affect performance . <p> Use Laserfiche Workflow to route your records to the correct storage location in the Laserfiche repository based on either the field values Laserfiche Quick Fields extracts from them or the field values a user manually enters during scanning . This alleviates users from having to remember where different types of documents are stored in Laserfiche . It also saves the records manager from having to manually store each document themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your metadata fields and it will automatically name and store your records for you . <p> Implement transparent records management ( TRM ) . TRM allows records managers and general users to have their own repository views and still have access to the same content . <p> In the above screenshot the records managers folder structure is on the left and the users folder structure is on the right . The records managers folder structure is functional and allows him to store all of his records in a way that will maintain compliance with the published retention schedules and aid the administrator in setting up security . The users folder structure is more logical and provides an intuitive way to find content . In order to make TRM possible , Laserfiche Workflow automatically stores the original documents in the appropriate location in the overall records management structure while creating shortcuts in other folders that general users have access to . <p> Automatically create records management items , such as cutoff instructions and retention schedules , from an Excel spreadsheet with the Records Series Setup Utility . 9785 @qwx869785 <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9780 @qwx869780 9783 @qwx869783 
@@98005646 @2205646/ <h> OmniPage OCR <p> Images that contain clearly printed or typed information can be converted to text files through a process called OCR ( Optical Character Recognition ) . The process in Quick Fields is known as OmniPage OCR . Once text has been extracted from an image , it can be stored and associated with the image in Laserfiche . <p> Many of the image enhancements available in Quick Fields are designed to improve the results of OmniPage OCR . For example , if the documents to be scanned in the session have been photocopied many times , they may have gray , speckled backgrounds or characters with gaps in them . You could configure a session that uses Despeckle to clean up the extra pixels in the background and Smooth to even out the shapes of the characters . <p> Where in the Quick Fields session you will use OmniPage OCR is determined by what you plan to accomplish with it . OmniPage OCR is very resource-intensive and can be slow if the image quality is poor , the image was scanned improperly , or if memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a prerequisite for some processes , such as Auto Annotation . OmniPage OCR is only available in Pre-Classification Processing , Page Processing , and Storage Processing . It can not be used as an Identification process . If you want to use a process that depends on OmniPage OCR on a particular document class , you will probably want to use OmniPage OCR in Page Processing for that document class before the other process . If none of the other processes used in the session depend on OmniPage OCR , you can use it in Storage Processing , where it will be applied while the documents are sent to Laserfiche , even if this is scheduled to occur at a later time . This helps you save time during processing . <p> Example : Ernest is configuring a session to process letters sent to the State Tax Board pertaining to tax audits . He wants to use Auto Annotation to redact any social security numbers found in the letters . In Page Processing , he configures OmniPage OCR and then Auto Annotation so text will be extracted from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security number . <p> Example : Bertram is configuring a session that will process patient surgery records by looking up the patient identification number in a database and populating the Laserfiche fields with additional information from the database . He wants to extract the text from the entire document , but does not need to do so during processing . He configures the session to use OmniPage OCR in storage processing , so that the time-consuming work of extracting the text will take place when the documents are sent to the Laserfiche repository , which will happen at night . <p> In the Tasks Pane , select OmniPage OCR . Under More Options , you can select Wizard to display more information about each property or Skip Wizard to display the properties all at once without additional information . <p> Page Range : When configuring this process in Page Processing or Storage Processing , you will be prompted to select a page range . In other stages , default settings will be automatically applied . When selecting a page range , you can select all pages or specify particular pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select All Pages . <p> To apply it to selected pages , select Pages and specify pages and/or page ranges . The starting and ending numbers in a range determine the first and last pages in the range . <p> Language Selection : Select a language to help optimize the character recognition . <p> Decolumnize : Select Decolumnize to convert multiple columns of generated text into a single column . Clearing the check box will preserve column formatting in the OCRed text , even if that separates words and sentences . <p> Optimization : Specify an optimization style . There is generally a trade-off between speed and accuracy . <p> Speed : Reduces the amount of time it takes to OCR . Generated text may be less accurate . Choose this option if you are more concerned about the speed of your Quick Fields session than about having a few errors in the generated text . <p> Standard : Neither optimum speed nor optimum accuracy , but between the two . Choose this option if you want the generated text to be fairly accurate , but have more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maximum amount of time to run . <p> Accuracy : Increases OCR quality . Processing time will also be increased . Choose this option if you must have the most accurate text possible and are not concerned about how long it takes to run the Quick Fields session or have only a few documents to process . <p> Auto Rotate : Enable Auto Rotate to temporarily rotate images to an orientation suitable for OCR . After the OmniPage OCR process is performed , the image will return to its original orientation . <p> Optional:To preview how this enhancement will affect scanned images and OCRed or extracted text , test processes . For the best results , add a custom sample image before testing . Adjust and test until you are satisfied with the results . <p> To see the results of the OCR process , click the Text Pane button to display the text .

@@98005652 @2205652/ <h> 3 Ways to Ensure Timely Contract Renewal <p> Every organization needs to maintain contracts , and managing them can be a full time job . An essential part of contract management is being aware of contracts up for renewal and renewing them as soon as possible to avoid disrupting business . Here are three ways to ensure timely contract renewal . <h> 1 . Store contracts in an electronic repository <p> It is easier to locate contracts when they are not stored in massive file cabinets or on employees desks . Digitizing contracts and storing them in a repository makes them easy to track . <p> In addition to providing an electronic repository , enterprise content management ( ECM ) systems like Laserfiche have the ability to add metadata to documents . It is possible to add the contracts expiration date as a metadata field , making all expired or soon-to-expire contracts viewable with one simple search . <h> 2 . Receive automatic notifications when a contract is up for renewal <p> Even though searching for contracts in your ECM system is easier than browsing through file cabinets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this search . An ECM system with business process automation capabilities can automatically perform this search on a regular basis and email the designated contract reviewer a list of any contracts that need attention . <p> Contracts can also be moved to an " Expiring Contracts " folder so that reviewers can see all contracts up for renewal at a glance . If these contracts are n't renewed or confirmed as expired within a designated timeframe , the system can automatically send a follow-up email to remind reviewers about pending contracts . <h> 3 . Use electronic signatures <p> Once the contracts up for renewal have been identified , an employee can electronically send them to the appropriate parties for review and signatures . Not only will this save money on postage , but it will also eliminate additional scanning and reduce printing and transit time . <p> ECM systems like Laserfiche can be integrated with electronic signature tools , which allow authorized employees to securely send contracts directly from the repository to the appropriate party to obtain electronic signatures . ( Contracts can only be accessed or signed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Once those contracts have been signed , the system automatically saves the signed version in the repository . 9785 @qwx869785 9781 @qwx869781 9780 @qwx869780 9783 @qwx869783

Goal <p> The goal of document management is efficiency . Approving documents faster , reducing manual data entry and automating recurring tasks are some of the many functions of document management that work toward this goal . <p> On the other hand , the goal of records management is compliance . A well-oiled records management system helps organizations avoid penalties when regulators , auditors and other governing bodies come calling . <p> Document management and records management do share a goal of business continuity .

@@98005678 @2205678/ <h> How to use Regular Expressions in Laserfiche Quick Fields <p> Regular expressions ( also known as Pattern Matching expressions ) are a way of defining patterns in information by using special symbols . In Laserfiche Quick Fields , these expressions can be used to identify documents or extract information in order to properly populate fields or set the document location in the Laserfiche repository . Different types of characters , such as word characters , decimal numbers and whitespaces , are represented by particular symbols . <p> These processes can be performed on the documents text , name , field values or data from a third-party data source . Before using any of the processes on the documents text , you must first extract this text from the document using one of the text extraction processes provided by Laserfiche Quick Fields . <p> Please note that in order to use regular expressions in Laserfiche Quick Fields , the Pattern Matching add-on is required . <h> The scenario <p> For the purposes of this article , we are going to use the example of a medical clinic that regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms , lab results and insurance cards . All of the patient records have the following template assigned to them : <p> Here is how we can use regular expressions in conjunction with Pattern Matching , Substitution , Auto-annotation , Token Editor and Text Identification within a Quick Fields session to process these medical records . <h> Pattern Matching <p> The Pattern Matching process looks for a specified pattern within a user-defined value and converts this information into a token that you can then insert into a field to store as part of the documents metadata . <p> Example : When scanning in patient records at a medical clinic , you have to extract " Patient I 'd " from a different place in each document . You know that " Patient I 'd " always follows the same pattern of three letters followed by a dash and five digits . When processing this paperwork with Laserfiche Quick Fields , you can use Pattern Matching to pick out this I 'd from the text and insert it into a corresponding template field . <p> You can perform Pattern Matching on either the document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would like to perform it on the document text . We can use two different patterns here that will give us the same result : <p> www-ddddds <p> w3-d5s ( Instead of specifying the individual characters , list their quantity in curly brackets . ) <p> Since " Patient I 'd " can appear anywhere on the document , we will make sure to search the entire document and not just a certain section . <p> Detailed , step-by-step instructions for configuring Pattern Matching can be found in the Online Help Files . <h> Substitution <p> The Substitution process allows you to find and replace words in page text or tokens using regular expressions . It is useful for correcting errors or changes made during OCR . <p> Example : When processing the " New Patient Information Sheet , " phone numbers are sometimes OCRed with spaces in between the dashes . In addition , the phone numbers on the form are written with parentheses around the area code , but in order to facilitate searching , they need to be stored in an xxx-xxx-xxxx format instead . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convert them into the xxx-xxx-xxxx format when inserting them into the template field . <p> In order to configure the Substitution process , you will first need to search for the following pattern : ( ( ddd ) ) s* ( ddd ) s*-s* ( dddd ) <p> The colored parentheses signify match groups " groups of information to be used in the actual substituted pattern . You can use these match groups in the substitution by clicking the " Insert Group " button and then choosing the groups in the order that you would like them displayed along with anything else you may want to include . In this case , we want to include a dash : $1-$2-$3 <p> If the Substitution process finds text that matches the first pattern , it will replace it with the second pattern : ( 310 ) 344- 0989 will become 310-344-0989 . <p> Detailed , step-by-step instructions for configuring a Substitution process can be found in the Online Help Files . <h> Auto-Annotation <p> Auto-Annotation adds Laserfiche annotations to text that fits a certain specified pattern . The annotations will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to the text associated with an electronic document ( but not the electronic document itself ) . <p> Example : Due to patient privacy laws , any time a Social Security Number appears on a document , it needs to be redacted . You can configure an Auto-Annotation process to search for a Social Security Number and redact it automatically . <p> We can use the following pattern : d3-d2-d4 <p> Detailed , step-by-step instructions for configuring the Auto-Annotation can be found in the Online Help Files . <h> Token Editor <p> In Laserfiche Quick Fields , you can use regular expressions to extract specific patterns of information from tokens . You can use regular expressions to modify the token 's value in the Token Editor . <p> Example : Every patient is assigned a primary care physician . This information is stored in the Medical Clinic Database where each " Patient I 'd " corresponds to the full name of the doctor . In order to facilitate searching , you would like to store only the doctors last name in the " DoctorName " field . You can configure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the database , and then use the Token Editor to extract only the last name . <p> First , set up the Lookup process per the instructions specified in the Online Help Files . In this scenario , Lookup will return the doctors name as a token named % ( LookupPrimaryDoctor ) . Now we will configure this token to extract only the doctors last name . <p> Find the " Doctor " field in the Document Properties view in the Tasks Pane and insert the % ( LookupPrimaryDoctor ) token . Select it , right-click on the selection and choose Token Editor . <p> We will use a regular expression to modify the retuned value . In this case the pattern will be : s(w+)$ This pattern extracts only the last word in the token . In this case , it is the doctors last name . <p> When we modify our token to include this expression , it will now read : % ( **25;302;TOOLONG ( w+ ) $ &gt;# ) <p> If the doctors name is listed in the database as " Sara M Klein " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klein " . <h> Text Identification <p> Example : All lab results are going to have " Laboratory " somewhere in the title , but because these documents may come from different labs and be in different formats , we want to set up a Text Identification process that searches the top half of the document for the word " Laboratory " and then classifies the document as lab results . In addition , sometimes the font used results in spaces between the letters when the document is OCRed so we want to account for that in our pattern . <p> In this case , you can use this pattern : Ls ? As ? Bs ? Os ? Rs ? As ? Ts ? Os ? Rs ? Ys* <p> Detailed , step-by-step instructions on configuring Text Identification can be found in the Online Help Files . <h> Additional resources <p> A much more in-depth analysis of regular expressions , along with a regular expression reference and some frequently used patterns can be found in this comprehensive white paper : Pattern Matching and Token Formatting in Quick Fields 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to download the white paper . 9785 @qwx869785 <h> Capture Strategies in Laserfiche <h> Best Practices in Laserfiche Security 9780 @qwx869780 9783 @qwx869783

How do I get the template field values from the document ? <h> Answer 9782 @qwx869782 <p> replied on April 20 , 2015 <p> Hi Richard ! You can use Find Entry to get the document that resides in the folder that you are working with . Something like this : <p> Then you can use Retrieve Field Values to get the field you want from that document ( here I 'm getting some field called " Student I 'd " ) ; be sure to select Other Entry for the source , and point to the entry you found with Find Entry : <p> Finally you 'd use the token you got from Retrieve Field Values to move your folder to some location : <p> This sample assumes that you know the exact document that you want the fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TheDocument " ) . You can also use a Search Repository activity in order to construct a more advanced search query that can be used to pick up a specific document based on some search . Or you could also use Find Entries to get all the entries inside the folder and go through them one by one to find the template field you need . You can also use tokens inside Find Entry to help find the document you need . There are tons of ways to get this done ! <h> Replies <p> Thank you for the suggestions . Unfortnately I do not know the document names in the folder , I have tried what you suggested using a wild card , find entries , nothing seems to return an entry with the template fields . <p> Try using a Find Entries activity and point it towards your folder by specifying the " at " property of Find Entries , and make sure to select Documents from Filter Entries . Then , add a For Each Entry activity and point it towards the Find Entries activity . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of referencing the Find Entry activity using Retrieve Field Values , point it to the " Current Entry " of the For Each Entry , as pictured here : <p> Then add a Conditional Sequence to specify that you should only move the entry if you actually found the field with your Retrieve Field Values . You can do that this way : <p> It may also be more efficient to use a Search Repository with a more specific query here . For example , you can replace Find Entries with a Search Repository that only gets entries that have that field ( though you 'll still need the For Each Entry ) : <p> I tried to do the find entries and point it to the folder but it still does not return any entries , so it does not get any field values for me to move it to the appropriate folder .

There 's no filtering , all entries of the specified type will be returned . <p> Note that the description under the Find Entries in your screenshot says " Find Entries in the folder : " . Currently Find Entries does n't support wildcard characters ... though the Search Repositories activity exists for that . <p> There is likely something else wrong with the setup , as it should n't be more complicated than this . Things to check : <p> 1 ) Name of the folder matches exactly ( check to make sure spaces match exactly ; use the browse button to select your folder , just to be safe ) <p> 2 ) Make sure Documents is selected under " Filter Entries " <p> 3 ) Make sure the Workflow 's connection profile is pointing to the right repository . <p> 4 ) I know it sounds silly , but make sure there are entries in the folder before you call Find Entries ( in case , for example , the entries are created or moved into the folder by a workflow ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connection Profile 's user actually has access rights to those documents . ( right click the entry , select Access Rights , and check the Effective Rights for the user that you specified for your connection profile in Workflow ) . <p> 6 ) As Miruna suggested above , if your documents are in subfolders , you should use the Search Repositories activity instead of the Find Entries activity . Creating a custom search is quite simple actually , and it gives you added flexibility : Go to the Laserfiche Client and perform a search that returns the files that you expect Workflow to find . Then , under Customize Search , select " Advanced " . You will see a textbox with the " advanced search syntax " , which you can use directly in the Search Repositories activity . <p> The advantage of using this method is that you can make your search more complex and specific , such as making sure that that the entries contain the field , or the template , etc . <p> There are no sub folders , the documents are directly under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the new location but the fields that it is to retrieve from the documents are not being retrieved , so it is placed in a folder without using the field values to place it in specific documents . As an example the template field expense describes the expense , such as meals , it is supposed to move the folder to the location , Archive Expense reportsEmployee NameMeals <p> It gets the entry which is the employee name but does not create the sub folder meals , just places the folder under the employee name .

@@98005683 @2205683/ <h> Tips and Tricks in the Laserfiche Client <p> The Windows and web clients , and server form the core of Laserfiche . Here are some creative ways to augment the Laserfiche experience with custom shortcuts and column profiles , annotations and templates . <h> Customize Laserfiche Shortcuts <p> It is possible to create a Laserfiche Windows client shortcut that will automatically run a specific search query or open a particular repository , folder or document within Laserfiche . <p> The shortcut can be modified to include command line parameters : <p> -W " Uses Windows Authentication as login credentials <p> -L " RepositoryName " " Opens the specified repository <p> -EEntryID " Opens the specified entry upon login . Must be used with the -L parameter <p> -S " SearchQuery " " Opens and runs the search criteria <p> Example : The duties of an admissions clerk in the admissions department of a university include reviewing new graduate and undergraduate applications . These applications all have the Needs Review tag assigned to them . The clerk may want to create a shortcut on the desktop that automatically launches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need review . <p> In order to create this shortcut , the clerk uses the -W , -L " RepositoryName " and " S " SearchQuery " command line parameters . The search query must be written in advanced search syntax , which can be generated by running a search in the Laserfiche Windows client and enabling the Advanced Search option . <p> The easiest way to generate advanced search syntax is to run a search and enable the Advanced Search option <p> Once the clerk copies the advanced search syntax , she right-clicks on the Laserfiche shortcut on the desktop and selects Properties . The line that says Target points to the location where the Laserfiche Windows client is installed , which may vary depending on settings and the operating system . In this case it reads : " C : Program Files ( x86 ) LaserficheClientLF.exe . " <p> Since it is a best practice to log into Laserfiche with Windows Authentication , the clerk needs the -W parameter in addition to the -L and -S parameters . Keep in mind that quotation marks in command line parameters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark . <p> Here is what the final command line will look like when appended onto the original Target : <p> Double-clicking on the shortcut will automatically open Laserfiche and run the specified search . <p> Double-clicking on the shortcut opens Laserfiche and runs the specified search <h> Save Column Profiles <p> Laserfiche allows customization of the column display for each folder by creating and saving column profiles . Once created , a user can switch between them quickly . <p> Example : The admissions clerk would like to quickly sort the college applications by major in order to simplify the review process . Sometimes she needs to contact an applicant to clarify something in his or her application . In this case , she 'd like to view the contact information quickly . The clerk can create two column profiles " one that lists the application type and major and the other that lists contact information " and switch between them as the need arises . <p> To create a column profile , the clerk opens the pending applications folder , right-clicks anywhere in the column headers and selects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The clerk scrolls down the list and unchecks the columns that she does n't want , and checks the columns that she wants to view . <p> To create a column profile , check and uncheck the fields to display <p> To save this column profile , the clerk right-clicks in the column header and selects Load/Save Columns " Save . Once the clerk names the profile and clicks OK , it is saved . <p> The clerk can create a second column profile by following the same directions , with this one showing the contact information for the various students . After saving it , she 'll be able to quickly switch between column views by right-clicking in the column headers and selecting Load/Save Columns along with the profile name . <p> It is easy to switch column profiles <h> Rejuvenate Annotations <p> With Laserfiche it is possible to- use tokens to create dynamic stamps , include hyperlinks in sticky notes and quickly locate annotations within a multi-page document . <p> Dynamic Stamps <p> As part of the application review process , the admissions clerk must stamp the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the current date . Here is how to create this kind of dynamic stamp . <p> Open the application in Laserfiche and navigate to the Annotations " stamp " more menu . <p> Click on Add and select Create Custom Stamp . <p> Give the stamp a name such as Reviewed Today that will make it easy to remember . <p> Type in the stamp text : " Reviewed on " and then click the little arrow to select the Date token . <p> The Stamp Manager includes various ways to create and customize a stamp <p> Back in the Stamp Manager , select the color , click Apply Stamp and then click on the place in the document where the stamp should appear . <p> The custom dynamic stamp as applied to a document <p> Next time the clerk wants to use the stamp , she can simply select it from the Stamp menu . <p> Hyperlinks in Sticky Notes <p> During the review of an application , the clerk wants to note down a website that has more information about an applicant . Once she starts typing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is be created automatically . <p> Websites are automatically hyperlinked in sticky notes <p> Locating Annotations <p> While reading through a multi-page application essay , the clerk is called to a department meeting . She wants to quickly save her spot so that she can come back to that page later . The clerk can do that by placing a sticky note on the current page . <p> When she comes back from the meeting , the clerk opens the Annotations Pane and double-clicks on and the sticky note . The document opens to the correct page . <h> Refine Working With Templates <p> In order to prevent scanner operators from having to manually select a template each time they scan content into Laserfiche , an administrator can specify a default template . <p> To set a default template , simply navigate to Tools " Options " New Documents " Import Profile and select the template in the Import Defaults section . It is also possible to use the parent folder 's template . <p> Selecting a default template makes scanning faster <p> In order to simplify the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % ( Parent ) token inside a field to automatically pull information from the parent folder 's template . <p> Example : Once a graduate or undergraduate application is reviewed , it is moved to the Student Records folder where a subfolder is created for each applicant . A student I 'd is then automatically generated and inserted in the folder 's Student I 'd field . In order to simplify populating the student I 'd in the application document 's template , the clerk can set the default value of this field to the % ( Parent ) token . <p> This way , and the next time the clerk views the document 's metadata , it will be filled with the student I 'd pulled from the folder 's template . 9785 @qwx869785 <h> Capture Strategies in Laserfiche <h> Best Practices in Laserfiche Security 9780 @qwx869780 9783 @qwx869783

Any help would be appreciated . I am running 9.2 version of laserfiche <p> I 'm assuming you 're moving it within the domain . Yes , you can physically move the server and as long as the client applications can still resolve the location of the server either by name or by IP , they 'll still work . I 'd recommend stopping any services that are connected to it that may be on different machines during the time LFS is being moved ( like Workflow or Forms or Import Agent ) . <p> I expect that the clients attached the repository by name , not by IP .

Am I naive to think it worked before , or should it work in 9.1 and something 's amiss ? <h> Answer <p> I wanted to clarify some things regarding this topic of using folder tunneling and searching for shortcuts . <p> The scenario is that there exists a source document in which a user only has the read access right on it . The user does not have the browse access right on the source document . <p> In another location in the repository that said user does have full access to , there exists a shortcut back to the source document . Manually browsing to the shortcut and accessing the document through it works just fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expect when performing a search for the document and expecting the shortcut to return in the search results . <p> Up to and including Laserfiche 9.0.3 : <p> 1 .

Searching by text only will NOT return the shortcut <p> Starting with Laserfiche 9.1.0 : <p> 1 . Searching by field only will NOT return the shortcut ( regression ) <p> 2 . Searching by entry name only will NOT return the shortcut ( regression ) <p> 3 . Searching by text only will NOT return the shortcut <p> The bug specifically for the change in behavior with regards to field and entry name searches starting in 9.1.0 is what we have on record , but I do n't have an eta yet for when that may be addressed . <p> We are experiencing the same issue with Version 8.31.625 . So what is the Fix ? If I do not give users browse rights to the Records Management Folders the users can not search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the client . <p> The whole premise of Transparent Records Management is to not give users Browse rights to the Records Management Folders . <p> I 'm not aware of any issues in 8.3 . The only issue is that starting in 9.1 , the users will need browse on the document itself in order for the shortcuts to return in search results . Again , the consequence is that the search results will now contain both the document and its shortcut . <p> Support has confirmed that the bug dates back to my client 's version of Laserfiche in 8.3.1 . As a workaround we granted access to the documents not RM folders . oddly enough when a user searches for documents they only get the shortcuts and not the original in their hitlist so all is right with the world for now . <p> I have this exact issue . I opened up the RM folder to full access , have the options setting for " Resolve Shortcuts " selected but still no search results . I am searching logged in as an admin with full permissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any word on the progress of fixing this bug ? Is the intention to have a patch released in the near future ? If so , what is the timeline ? This issue is affecting usability in production , and assigning browse rights to 100,000 's of records with varying degrees of security considerations is not ideal . <p> There is no eta for when this will get addressed . As it currently stands , users will need browse and read rights on the entries themselves in order for the shortcuts to get returned in search results . Workflow can be used to handle the assignment of access rights . <p> This effectively puts a halt to client upgrades who use Transparent Records Management because any that were built prior to this bug will need their security redesigned . They will either need independently secured record series folders or we 'll have to put all documents through workflow to create the unique document security . Additionally , this adds considerable time to new deployment as we now have to build in extra security , extra RM folders , and additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there an updated time frame ? <p> Beau : It is definitely a bug , but I 'm not actually sure it would have that much impact on the existing security in a TRM environment . The bug is that searching by field only or entry name only where the user does not have browse on the source document will not return results . You do not need to assign browse to each individual document , in many cases the tunnel setup will already have browse in addition to read within the tunneled security - so long as it 's present post-tunneling and inherited into the source documents , that 's fine too . You would already have needed to provide the tunnel in the first place , so I 'm not sure where additional independently secured Record Series come into play . I may be missing a nuance here and I agree it certainly is a bug , but I wanted to clarify exactly what the fundamental impact is . <p> An example where this comes into play is if I have a Records Series for " 1000-01 Contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this example these all carry the same retention for this customer and thus are stored in the same folder . The Finance department maintains these so they can see them all . Purchasing can see the Contracts &amp; Bids but not checks . All internal employees can see the PO 's &amp; Invoices but not the Checks , Contracts &amp; Bids . So we have 3 different views of the documents maintained in a single records series . <p> Currently the users have Read permissions only on the documents in RM and can access them either via the Shortcuts in their regular LF folders or with a search because Read permissions allow the documents to be searchable in the old versions . If we go to upgrade them then we have several options : <p> Leave it setup the way it is <p> The documents will not be searchable via a field search ( our user 's most common method of searching ) <p> Grant these 3 groups both browse and read permissions to all documents in the current Record Series <p> They will be able to search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to see every document in the record series if they run a search that any of the other documents qualify for <p> Setup separate Record Series for each of the document types <p> Allows the Browse &amp; Read permissions to be set to allow docs to be searchable <p> Keeps documents independently located to control access <p> Requires additional setup for Record Series &amp; security <p> Requires additional work when destroying records as they are spread out now <p> Does not account for granting permissions to specific documents such as only contracts that apply to your department ( we could previously do this by creating a shortcut in the department 's folder which would then be searchable ) <p> Setup workflow to assign document level permissions <p> Allows the Browse &amp; Read permissions to be set to allow docs to be searchable <p> Keeps documents independently located to control access <p> Requires additional setup for Workflow to manage permissions <p> Requires all documents to go back through Workflow when security changes are made so that they will be assigned the new permissions <p> With the old method we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in a tough spot where we have to create extra steps to manage security and thus makes the application less dynamic . For small setups they may never notice this change however for large clients this will create considerable extra work . If this is something that will be fixed in the near future then it is better to hold off than to expend extra time redesigning environments for a bug . Is there a time frame on when we can expect this resolved ? <p> Since upgrading to 9.1.1 this issue has surfaced for us . Any updates on this ? Justin , read your response above but do not understand your explanation of how to resolve . Unless you have other suggestions I have to either open my Records Management folders to users ( give them browse ) or tell users to search the Records Managment folders for their documents and not the user folders , which totally bypasses the use of shortcuts and TRM . " Resolve shortcuts " in options has no affect . Thank You <p> You can use access rights scoping to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent folder without given them access to browse or read the folders themselves . Then the prior searches should work fine . <p> Any update on when this will be fixed ( patch or 9.2 ) ? There have been situations where someone ran a search and it returned documents they should not have had access to because we 'd had to grant them the Browse permission to the Documents Only in an RM folder so their field searches would work . This has caused us to have to rebuild their workflow to assign additional permissions to the documents themselves that are stored in RM ( beyond the permission already setup for the folder structure where the shortcuts are stored ) . Then after making this change to workflow we had to refile ten of thousands of documents so they would inherit there new document level security based on their document type . If this is to be permanent then we can add that into our scope for new projects but if this will be resolved soon then that wont be necessary . <p> Beau - I checked with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this area of code and hopes to have it for 9.2 but it apparently has some technical complications such that he 's not 100% certain just yet .

We had hoped to include it in the 9.2 release but we felt it was best to be a bit conservative about deploying it given the potential internal scope . <p> We are in a holding pattern with moving any more records to TRM and have told users to use the " shortcut " entry type ( in Webaccess ) when performing searches so they do n't see the originals in RM , but you ca n't force it . If they are full users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told them to only click on the shortcuts . How are you all handling this situation ? <p> Our situation is double complexity because we use Weblink internally for casual access via groups from AD , so as we started moving records into TRM and creating their shortcuts , did not realize they could no longer search the documents , because WebLink does not have the " resolve shortcuts " unlike webaccess and full client . Anyone else out there using it this way ? <p> Just an afterthought , but is there a possibility to restrict the users results to shortcuts only via the admin utility in either webaccess or full client for certain groups ? <p> This issue is scheduled to be fixed in the new search processor for the next release of Laserfiche . Note that this is not the soon to be released 9.2 SP1 , but rather the next actual release in the version 9 line . We 'll keep you posted as we get closer to having an ETA . <p> I 'm noticing when I do a template search I 'm getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duplicated . Is that part of this issue ? I would think that the template search should only show the records , not the shortcuts , but either is fine just not both . I 'm on 9.2.1 . I do have resolve shortcuts on because we 're hiding the actual records and just using TRM to show shortcut folders , so other searches do n't work without this option enabled . <p> The issue in this thread stems from users not wanting both the actual document and the shortcut appearing in the search results so they went about this by removing the " browse " access right on the document . <h> Replies <p> I know this is an old thread but has this been fixed ? We have a client running the current version and are wanting to do metadata searches on shortcuts ( they do n't  have access to the master routing folder ) . Doc name searches work but fields do not . A few of the pieces of information they wish to search on are not in the doc name nor does adding them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name which may or may not make sense to different groups of users looking at the docs ) . <p> Thanks Justin . Is this the new accepted way of thinking hence forth , before I go fixing my existing RM folder access rights ? <p> Just to recap for others , and please correct me if I 'm wrong . On the records management parent folders access rights , the scope should be set to " Documents only " with browse turned on . Opening the subfolders ' access rights ' of that parent and ' showing inherited rights ' does not show up specifically in the trustee list from the parent like I normally thought it would ; however the rights are inherited down . <p> Now when this user performs a search of the user folder , the resulting shortcut is shown and the user is able to open and edit as necessary . Furthermore , the user still only sees the user folders when browsing the folder lists .

Be prepared . A list of all companies in attendance should be available before the fair . Peruse this list and decide which companies you are interested in talking to . Research these companies and their current job openings to help tailor your introduction and conversation . Make sure that your resume is polished , and print more than enough copies to distribute . <p> 2 . Tune in to Twitter . Many recruiters are making an effort to broadcast via Twitter which career fairs they will be attending and will often highlight different jobs or types of candidates they 're excited to meet at a fair . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at our table ( hint , hint ! ) , so make sure to follow the companies you 're interested in ! <p> 3 . Dress the part . Although dressing professionally is becoming less common in the tech industry , it is still an important part of making a good impression . Once you are invited to subsequent onsite interview rounds , you can begin to take that company 's culture into account and dress to communicate more of your personality . Business casual or more formal options like a suit will help you to feel confident . <p> 4 . Get acclimated . Once you enter the hall , walk around to get a lay of the land . Locate the booths of the employers you are interested in . Note how each employer is set up and how long their line is so that you can plan out your time at the fair . <p> 5 . Start strategically . Inevitably , the first conversation you have may feel slightly awkward . Save the companies you are most interested in until after you have practiced once or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient . Long lines can offer you insight . Take your time in line to reread through the employer 's description and listen to what is happening in front of you . <p> 7 . Give the company rep a firm ( but not too strong ! ) handshake . This sets a professional tone and shows confidence . Practicing your handshake with a friend may seem strange , but it 's worth it ! Once the handshake is out of the way , remember to keep smiling and maintaining eye contact throughout your conversation . <p> 8 . Introduce yourself clearly . Career fairs are often very loud , so speak up and introduce yourself briefly . Take 30 seconds or less to explain why you approached their table ( this is a great time to showcase some of your research on the company 's available positions , mission , latest developments , etc . ) . Levo League put together this helpful graphic to help you piece together your opening pitch . <p> 9 . Have your resume handy . Your resumes should be easily accessible ( not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be ready to hand over a copy after introducing yourself so that we can quickly and easily begin talking about your background . <p> 10 . Stash the swag ! We love when you are excited about the giveaways that we have , but they should never be the focal point of your visit to the booth . Politely ask for or accept the goodies you are offered and then put them away in the bag or purse you brought with you . <p> 11 . Listen carefully to the recruiter . Make a quick note about your conversation after you leave the table and make an effort to follow up with them within 48 hours ( or at a time specified during your conversation ) . <p> 12 . Ask for a business card- we have them for a reason ! The back of a business card is a great place to jot your notes from tip #11 so that your notes and contact info for each company stay together .

Document management can also help reduce paper use in accounts payable , as well as limiting printing in general . " If all entities that did business with the University of Houston System ( UH ) were paid via ACH , the university could save $100,000 per year , " notes UH president Renu Khator .

Some schools , such as St. James Catholic School in Gulfport , Miss. , are taking the opportunity to move to Chromebooks , which are no-frills notebook computers that cost $200 , as compared to a traditional desktop running Microsoft Windows , which generally cost about $1,000 .

@@98005709 @2205709/ <h> Answer 9784 @qwx869784 <p> replied on June 12 <p> Hi Adarsh , <p> I recently came across this same issue , saving the associated document(s) to a folder of each entry within a collection . What I thought would ( should ? ) be a simple task turned into a bit of work so I will share what I did . If anyone knows an easier way to do this I would love to see it ! <p> I want to input X number of users , create a folder with that users name and place the corresponding documents into the users folder from the form submission . <p> First my simple test form ready to be submitted : <p> Once the form is submitted I save the form and documents ( CollectionFile ) to an incoming Repository folder and then call my workflow . <p> As I iterate over each file submitted I will use two tokens , % ( **26;409;TOOLONG ) and % ( **26;437;TOOLONG ) <p> % ( **26;465;TOOLONG ) is a bit misleading , it is not a folder path into the repository but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted 2 users in this example I will get 2 paths CollectionFile1 and CollectionFile2 <p> With 2 users submitting 2 files each the full iteration over the File Collection would iterate 4 times : % ( **26;493;TOOLONG ) % ( **26;521;TOOLONG ) CollectionFile1 doco1 <p> CollectionFile1 doco2 <p> CollectionFile2 doco4 <p> CollectionFile2 doco5 <p> So you can see ( ? ) that the docs for CollectionFile1 are for the first user in our collection , and CollectionFile2 are for the second user in our collection ( and on CollectionFileX for x user ) <p> Jumping back up to the ' For Each Row ' action ... I know the iteration number that I am on and the user it corresponds to so in step 5 I use that token % ( ForEachRowIteration ) to do a conditional to see if my CollectionFileNUMBER matches the % ( **26;549;TOOLONG ) <p> If it does , I know this file belongs to the % ( ForEachRowUsername ) but first I have to find the file in the repository with step 6 , now that I know the name of the file . LF:Name= @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " &amp; LF:LOOKIN= " LFICHEtmptest " <p> However since I am also iterating over every file every time , I may have already moved the file so I do another conditional to make sure my search result found the file . Step 7 <p> If so I can move the file into the folder I created with the Create Entry activity , step 8 . <p> Hope that made a little sense ...... happy to explain more if needed . <p> This workflow is not the most efficient since it will iterate over and search for files even after they have been moved . You can improve efficiency by indexing tokens , etc but this was my test workflow and I think it explains the idea better than a more complicated flow . <p> The other caveat is if two files are uploaded with the same name you will have to do a little more work to determine which file is which ! <p> In practice we are using a little more efficient workflow , putting fields on our submitted documents to help with searches and trying to determine duplicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an easier way to do this but this does work .... <p> For files with duplicate names you could start a search for filename ( 1 ) , filename ( 2 ) ... until a match was found when the original name was not found . It seems that files are uploaded and named in the order they were submitted in but what have to confirm that . You could also check the incoming folder to see if there are any remaining files and send a notification to process them manually since everything submitted should be moved . Assigning field values to the documents when they are saved would help out here when determining if they all moved . <p> For all the work it took putting this together we had to abandon it since our customer has a need for pages to be generated from the incoming attachments . Attachments submitted via a form do not have an option to have pages generated or is there a way within workflow to do this .

The token is like **27;605;TOOLONG <p> But that token only works in attachment name and fields , not in the document path . I filed a feature request for that . <p> For now , one possible solution is to set the value in attachment metadata fields , then use Workflow to move attachments to destination folder according to the field value .

One way to encourage others to adopt Laserfiche is to demonstrate a clear return-on-investment ( ROI ) . Here is how we created a cost-benefit analysis to help justify further investment in Laserfiche by other departments within PSALM Corporation . <h> What information do you need to create a cost-benefit analysis ? <p> In order to create an effective cost-benefit analysis , you need to know your pre-Laserfiche process . Ask yourself these questions : <p> How many employees dealt with documents on a daily basis ? <p> On average , how many documents were retrieved , copied , scanned and stored daily ? <p> How long did it take to process those documents ? <p> What were your expenses ? <p> Onsite/offsite storage . <p> Printing ( paper and ink ) . <p> Labor costs of employees . <p> Think about your transition to Laserfiche . Consider : <p> How much did your Laserfiche implementation cost ? <p> Software . <p> Licensing . <p> Hardware . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( retrieving , scanning , copying and storing ) ? <p> 2 . In each section , we inserted one column for expenses associated with the pre-Laserfiche practice and another column for the expenses post-implementation . <p> 3 . In order to calculate the post-implementation expenses , we used an Efficiency Rate ( a rate by which time or expenses were reduced after implementation of Laserfiche ) . We obtained this rate from a consulting firm and then modified it based on our own experience . The Efficiency Rate varied by process . <p> 4 . We used the Efficiency Rate to calculate the new expenses as follows : <p> Example : To analyze the cost of off-site storage we took into account both the monthly cost of renting the storage facility and the cost of document retrieval . Since we are now only storing 25% of all hard-copies of documents in the facility , we used an Efficiency Rate of 75% . We calculated the post-Laserfiche expense by using the formula described above . <p> 5 .

With dozens of people participating , such a process can include a lot of coordination . To demonstrate the capabilities of Laserfiche at a recent user group meeting , I automated the whole gift assigning process with Laserfiche Forms and Laserfiche Workflow . <h> The process in a nutshell <p> The Secret Santa process at Chesterfield County works as follows : <p> Every employee who wishes to participate submits a Laserfiche Form that asks for their gift preferences . <p> Once all participants have submitted the questionnaires , the Secret Santa coordinator starts a Laserfiche Workflow business process that randomly assigns a participant to each list . <p> Each participant is notified by email of the person that they are assigned to purchase a gift for . <p> Once the gift is purchased , the responsible person changes the value of the metadata field and the business process ends . <p> If the gift is n't purchased in five days , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the scenes <p> There are actually three separate Laserfiche Workflow business processes that run behind the scenes . <p> Workflow 1 <p> This Laserfiche Workflow business process does the following : <p> Creates tokens that will be used to assign random gift givers to gift recipients . These tokens are used in the script later on in the workflow . <p> Finds all submissions without any giver assigned . <p> Uses a special Flag field to make sure that no one is assigned to purchase a gift for himself . <p> Generates a random number using an SDK Script . This number is used to match the recipient to the giver . <p> Populates the submissions metadata fields with the name of the assigned giver . <p> Here is what the script looks like . The tokens " maxrandom " and " randomnumber " must be created first with the Create Tokens activity . <p> Here is what the whole workflow looks like : <p> Workflow 2 <p> Once all of the givers are assigned , this Laserfiche Workflow business process iterates through each submission and launches the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workflow is responsible for the various notifications .

@@98005726 @2205726/ <h> 5 Ways to Support Case Workers with Mobile Technology <p> A case worker 's primary goal is to provide quality , personalized care for clients in need of public assistance . But with as many as 80 geographically dispersed clients to juggle each month , case workers can get bogged down with paperwork , cutting into the time they can spend on home or court visits . <p> A remotely accessible enterprise content management ( ECM ) system allows any case worker with a smartphone to focus less on administrative work and more on the needs of clients . <p> Here are five ways to support case workers with mobile technology and ECM . <h> 1 . Access Client Files from the Field <p> The ability to access client information on a mobile device saves the case worker countless hours in client visit preparation . One study found that case workers without mobile technology spend 50-80% of working hours on administrative tasks . The study also found that mobile technology adoption could result in a 45% increase in productivity . <p> Instead of printing , filing and schlepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can simply access the ECM repository to view , edit and save documents on site . <h> 2 . Stay Up to Date on Cases <p> Remote access to an ECM system allows case workers to stay current on all client cases and work-related tasks " no matter where they are . For example , case workers can receive automatic notifications when they 've been assigned a new case or check the progress of a client-related process ( such as a service request ) . <p> With increased visibility into their workloads , case workers no longer have to visit headquarters just to find out what needs to be done . This helps case workers stay in the field where they 're most valuable . <h> 3 . Keep Case Documents Secure <p> Sensitive client documents like birth certificates and social security forms should be readily available , but only to those who are authorized to handle them . Case workers must consider security as much as convenience when selecting a mobile system for case management . <p> ECM systems can be customized so that users only see the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also be protected from unauthorized modification or deletion , and high-quality ECM systems even let managers see when someone attempts to open a restricted document . <h> 4 . Submit Information on the Spot <p> With ECM , case workers can upload images and documents directly from their smartphones . The submitted information can then be stored in a specified folder that can only be viewed by authorized users of the ECM system . <p> Getting information directly from the point of contact ( such as a visit with a foster child ) to a secure electronic repository leaves less room for error or lost files . This is especially crucial if a child becomes the subject of a child maltreatment trial in which the case worker must provide evidence to an attorney . <h> 5 . Expedite Processing Time <p> Along with documents and images , electronic forms can be submitted remotely . An ECM system with automation capabilities can instantly send a form to the appropriate person for review and approval , drastically reducing the time it takes to process benefits , reports and other case management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a client may be in jeopardy , faster processing time becomes far more than a convenience . <p> Case management in the public sector requires frequent points of contact between case workers and clients . Mobile technology like electronic forms , camera-enabled smartphones and ECM make these meetings easier and more productive . <p> See how other organizations have improved productivity in and out of the office by downloading the free guide to Laserfiche Mobile " the on-the-go ECM solution . 9785 @qwx869785 
@@98005727 @2205727/ <h> Question <h> Question <h> Applying Retention to Folders <p> I know that retention can be applied to a record series and a record folder ; however , is it possible to set a retention on a regular folder ? <p> I would like to take advantage of retention and cutoff settings ; however , the repository I inherited is set up with folders rather than records folders . Unfortunately , the Records drop down menu is greyed out for regular folders . Am I going to have to change everything to a record folder ? <h> Replies <p> You are going to have to set up a Record Series and apply the RM attributes ( Cut off/Retention Schedule , etc ) . and then migrate your data to them from your other folders . You can move the files manaully or write a WF to perform the move for you . <p> It is common that user may interact with files in the Regular Folder view , and those documents then be sent to the Record Series once they are deemed to be official Records , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access . This way you are n't all users access directly to the Record Series , typically just the Records Managers . <p> Suggest you also check out Answers and the Support site for Records Management Best Practices before you take the plunge . <p> thank you for your response . I guess the issue that I have with setting up the Record Series separate from the records themselves ( and using shortcuts ) is that it creates its own issues . <p> For instance , when doing a title search , you get two hits : the shortcut and the document itself . When not doing a title search , you return the original document , which confuses the user if they 're using the search to figure out where to file . <p> If you know of a solution to this , then maybe this is a route I would take ; but I think it becomes unnecessarily complicated/inefficient . I will review RM best practices , however , to assist me . <p> Because of the complexities of retention requirements and usual lack of end user knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RM to set up incoming folders for new documents and let workflow file them based on metadata . This ensures that the documents get placed under the correct record series ( as long as the metadata is correct ) and places a shortcut in the correct location under the standard folder structure . <p> If you set up the security the right way , you users will only find the files in the folders they have access to , and not the record series , but if they click on the shortcut in their folders , it will allow them to open the file . <p> This is typically done so you do n't end up with everybody having a copy of the same files in their individual folders and being able to limit the files that people can see . Also , there is just one document ( the record ) , that the different departments are pointing to . <p> If you want to allow them instead to search in the record series and have no files in their own folder , that can be done as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not recommended as Best Practice .. <p> With your suggestion , the limitation is searching by a document 's content . Because a shortcut does n't have content to search ( i.e. , text , ocr 'd content ) and because the original document would be secured - how could someone search ? <p> Hi Robyn , when you set up the Record Series you have to add the Users to them , but set their rights to Browse and Read and " Documents Only " . This way they will not see the Record Series but when they do a Context search it will also include those documents in the Record Series and return just the documents , not the shortcuts <p> Thanks , Steve ; however , if they then use tools such as " open containing folder " or the " path " column to find related documents or find out where the ideal filing location is : it wo n't work . <p> This is why it 's ideal to have documents in one location , rather than splitting it . I thought a " central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than creating two repositories . <p> I 'm not sure why Laserfiche decided to build the system this way . What you 're describing may be best practice for the way Laserfiche was built , but other EDRM systems do n't function this way . Finalizing a record should be at the record level where a built-in workflow changes it to read-only , it stays in its original folder , and retention begins on that one record within it 's immediate parent folder 's retention . This is a feature I really hope Laserfiche develops in the next few years . <p> Hi Rob , I was just giving examples , as I 'm unaware of your environment or requirments . You do n't have to follow the example above and I would fall back to Laserfiche 's Best Practice document . From my experience , Record Managers may have different ways of organizing documents or a required to follow a filing system that is governed by an organization such as a municipality , which is why Laserfiche allows this level of functionality . <p> You have to define your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their rights and privileges and then determine the best way to set up your system . Unfortunately , to get the value and functionality that a Record Series , you have to migrate your documents into a record series . <p> If you want to give your users the ability to search , read , open files directly in the records series , you can do that all of that with Laserfiche , it simply a matter of how you chose to configure the system . <p> Yes . You 're exactly right . I guess I just wish there was more flexibility in the system to allow my vision to be configured without having records series throughout . When I look for solutions , the approach you 've suggested is a common one - I am just of the opinion that it 's not a great one . My frustration is n't directed at you , but at this limit of my imagination , really . I really do appreciate you taking the time to respond and provide guidance .

@@98005729 @2205729/ <h> Permissions and Rights Node <p> This node , under Security in the Workflow Administration Console , allows you to define the general permissions a user or group has for accessing Workflow features . You can also grant or deny rights to specific workflows . <p> Security rules and hierarchy <p> Permissions and rights can only be granted to Active Directory users , not to Laserfiche users . <p> After assigning permissions and rights for a user or group , you can later remove the permissions and rights . <p> General Permissions <p> Permissions are either given or absent , and they are absent by default . If a permission is absent for a user or group they will not have the permission unless they are part of a group that has been given the permission . Show me an example . You can have one or more of the following permissions . <p> Example : Judy was not given permission to create workflows , and because that permission is absent , she can not create workflows . Later , Judy joins the IT group , which does have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create workflows is still absent for Judy personally , because the IT group has permission to create workflows , Judy does as well . <p> Manage Trustees : Allows you to add , modify , and delete the security settings for users and groups in this node . With this permission , you can change users and groups ' permissions and rights . <p> Note : Removing this permission from yourself may be irreversible because you will no longer be able to modify your own security settings ( including this permission ) . An administrator will have to restore the permission to your account . <p> Create Workflows : Let 's you create and publish new workflows . <p> Delete Workflows : Let 's you delete existing workflows if you have Editor rights to the workflows . <p> ADO Access : Access ADO.NET tables for reporting , bypassing normal security . Note that this permission effectively grants the Search Workflows permission and Viewer right to all workflows via the reporting tables . <p> Workflow Rights <p> Workflow Rights are specified per workflow . Users and groups can have one of the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups have Viewer rights for all workflows . <p> Editor : Can view , modify , and delete a workflow . <p> Viewer : Can search for and view a workflow . This right effectively makes a workflow read-only . <p> No Access : Can not search for or view a workflow . Users with No Access to a workflow will not be able to see that the workflow exists . <p> Note : A user with Manage Trustee permissions will be able to see all workflows when viewing or modifying security settings regardless of having No Access to some or all workflows . <p> If a user is given different rights than a group the user is part of , the user 's specific rights will take precedence . If a user is not given any rights specifically , but is part of two or more groups with different rights , the more restrictive rights will be applied to the user . Show me an example . <p> Example : Ralph has Editor rights to Workflow 2 , and he is part of a group that has No Access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rights of his group . <p> Ralph is not given any specific rights to Workflow 3 ( he has the default Viewer rights ) , but he is part of two groups that have different rights to Workflow 3 . One group has Editor rights and the other has No Access to Workflow 3 . Because Ralph was not given any specific rights to the workflow , he will have the more restrictive right ( i.e. , No Access ) to Workflow 3 . <p> Hierarchy <p> Administrators have all permissions and Editor rights to all workflows . You can not delete the only user or group with Administrator privileges because you must have at least one Administrator . <p> Users or groups not listed in this node will have the default permissions ( none ) and rights ( Viewer ) unless they are part of a group listed in this node . <p> If a permission conflicts with a right , the more restrictive of the two takes precedent . Show me an example . <p> Example : Bill has the general permission that allows him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights to Workflow 1 . Even though Bill has the general permissions to delete , he can not delete Workflow 1 . Susan does not have the general permission to delete workflows . Even though she has editor ( full ) rights to Workflow 1 which would normally allow her to delete the workflow , she can not delete it because of her general permission settings . <p> Note : By default , all users are part of the Everyone group which has Administrator ( full ) permissions and rights . If a user is part of the Everyone group and the Everyone group has administrator privileges , you can only restrict their rights , not their permissions . Because permissions can not be denied , only absent , the user 's absent permissions will default to the permissions granted to the groups the user is in . In this case , if the user is part of the Everyone group , they will have full ( administrator ) permissions . To avoid this situation , make another user or group an administrator and remove the administrator setting from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have full permissions and rights and everyone else will have no permissions and Viewer rights , unless otherwise specified . <p> In the Workflow Administration Console'sConsole Pane , expand the Security node . <p> Select Permissions and Rights . The node will list of all the Windows and Active Directory users configured to have Workflow permissions and rights . <p> Tip : You can refresh this list to reflect recent changes by clicking the Refresh link below Permissions and Rights in the Actions Pane . Alternatively , right-click the Permissions and Rights node and select Refresh . <p> To add a new user or group <p> In the Console Pane , select the Permissions and Rights node . Alternatively , select any user listed in the center Details Pane when the node is selected . <p> Click New User in the Actions Pane , or right-click and select New User . <p> Tip : You can search for workflows by typing a workflow name in the text box that says Search for workflows . Click the red X to clear a search . <p> In the Rights column choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights to the workflow . <p> Editor : The user or group can change and/or delete the workflow . <p> Viewer : The user or group can open the selected workflow but not make any changes to it . <p> No Access : The user or group can not search for or see that the workflow even exists . <p> Configure all desired workflow rights for the user or group . <p> Click OK . <p> Tip : You can modify these rights at any time by selecting the user in the Details Pane and clicking Workflow Rights in the Actions Pane . <p> To delete a user or group from this node <p> In the Details Pane , select the user or group you want to delete permissions and rights for . <p> In the Actions Pane , click Delete . <p> Note : Removing a user or group does not delete it from your machine or active directory .

It has the ability to do what you are looking for . It can import files from a particular folder and then move them to another folder when it 's done . However , it 's made to work in an automated fashion so you 'd have to craft rules that would fit into your environment and the way users do their work . <p> If it had to be done from Workflow , I suppose it might be possible to write a script to do the move , if the user that Workflow runs as had the appropriate permission on the network share . <p> I 've never done this in Workflow , but theoretically you could use a Script Activity . Anything you can do in . NET you can do in Workflow using scripts . I do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be able to do all the standard file I/O operations . You could write the code directly in the script window or build a custom DLL that you call . <p> There 's not enough room here to write a full tutorial , but you 'll probably need a developer if you want to go that route . Otherwise , I 'd recommend seeing if Import Agent can satisfy your needs . It would be an extra purchase , but it will probably cost less when all is said and done than going the scripting route . <p> Nicholas - I have a custom activity available that allows workflow to move , copy , rename , and/or delete Windows files from a UNC path or mapped drive . The free 30 day demo is available for download at http : **30;661;TOOLONG . I am slowly adding custom workflow activities to my ' Qfiche Toolkit ' and the FileIO activity is just one of them .

If you could provide some information as to what would need to be done , or point me in the right direction , that would be great . <p> Nicholas - If you do n't want to purchase the Qfiche custom activity then I would probably stick with a workflow script activity to try to make this work . To try to build a custom activity yourself requires some additional tools ( Visual Studio ) and development experience . <p> I would start with the MSDN references that Devin mentions above ( file I/O operations ) . The Qfiche custom activity uses that same set of IO methods listed in that reference . I would also suggest that if you are planning on moving the file I would actually copy it to the target directory and then delete the source file instead of using the IO move method . It is my experience that this approach has fewer problems with OS file locking than the move method . <p> Yep , the actual code to move the file ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only two lines of code with a couple of parameters each . The majority of the rest of the code is error handling and setting up for the move . The key to tying the workflow ' move ' script with your client PDF import is to capture the original PDF filename so that you can use it in your script . It sounds like the target and source folder names will not change frequently so you could ' hard code ' them in the script as constants or variables early on and then do some type of concatenation with the PDF filename to reference the actual file at move time . Perhaps passing the PDF filename to the script via a token as you mention . <p> Well I know I am fairly new to laserfiche but I do have a fair amount of development experience . Is there any tutorials I can look at . To start , how would I go about integrating a script activity into the workflow ? <p> Nicholas - There are two types of script activities available in the Workflow Designer .

Once you have the script editor open you can use the Help menu item to see some script examples .

@@98005736 @2205736/ <h> What is Business Process Automation ? <p> Business process automation ( BPA ) is an organizational transformation that aims to drive efficiency , provide transparency and facilitate compliance for repeatable processes . Organizations use automation in many forms " from simple employee onboarding to complex accounts payable processes " to eliminate the need for employees to route paper from one physical location to another for recording , work processes or approvals . With today 's leading automation software , any manual paper process can be automated to achieve these goals . Key elements to identify a process for automation : <p> The process requires consistency across the organization <p> The process is repeatable <p> The process needs to be free from error , every time <p> It is n't just about replacing paper with PDFs " business process automation aims to make processes more cost-efficient , streamlined , error-proof and transparent . With automated processes in place , organizations save time and ensure best practices are implemented to improve overall operational efficiency . Below are three common business processes and how organizations drove positive change through automation : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College of EngineeringProcess challenge : - The college committed to an initiative that would increase enrollment by more than 65 percent by 2025 . This meant the college needed to hire new employees to manage the influx of students while keeping costs down . The legacy HR onboarding process , however , was paper-driven and time-intensive . If the college was going to meet its goal , it needed to eliminate inefficiencies and streamline employee onboarding. - <p> Automating HR onboarding with Laserfiche enabled the College of Engineering to hire more than 3,400 employees in a little over one year . Other departments have also begun reengineering their own processes and sharing successes campuswide . The new system has created a new culture of collaboration and innovation for the most efficient processes possible . <h> Accounts Payable <p> Example : City of Boca RatonProcess challenge : - The City of Boca Raton 's accounts payable process relied heavily on paper invoices and copies being manually routed . Sometimes paper copies would be misplaced or delayed on someone 's desk , leading to unpaid invoices and upset vendors . Chasing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee time that could be better spent elsewhere . <p> With its automation , the city tracks all invoices from the moment they are received through the final payment . The city significantly reduced processing errors while boosting customer satisfaction as a result of a faster and more efficient process . <h> Contract Management <p> Example : Heifer InternationalProcess challenge : - Heifer International aims to lift 4 million families out of poverty by 2020 . To do so , the nonprofit organization needed to increase efficiency and facilitate easier collaboration across its teams and partners worldwide . With documents bu ilt up from 70 years of work and hundreds of contracts requiring review per project , Heifer needed to centralize information and streamline contract management processes to help more people , faster . <p> Heifer team members worldwide can now collaborate on projects that help families " whether they are in Arkansas or Nepal . Legal contract reviews are streamlined , expediting the execution of projects including delivery of food and supplies .

@@98005759 @2205759/ <h> Question <h> Question <h> Adding LFDS users to a repository <p> Hi - We register our users within LFDS ( v10 ) via Windows AD accounts . When we wish to grant these global users access to a specific repository , it becomes a bit confusing for me . Do we simply add a new user in the Admin Console by specifying New Windows Account User ? I would have thought there was a selection to pick from the existing LFDS user pool , rather than search the full AD database - it seems like a disconnect . <p> Also , if we are adding " global " users from LFDS , must I first allocate " Repository Named User Licenses " ? I was led to believe that parameter was only for licenses created in and restricted to that repository . When we licensed the repository , we kept that number very low - expecting that all users would be managed in LFDS and then granted access to the specific repositories required . <p> Thanks in advance for the info . I recognize this is a basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear answer in the Admin Guide or other posts . <p> Do we simply add a new user in the Admin Console by specifying New Windows Account User ? Yes ; in LFDS , the license is allocated to the Windows user but in LFS ( through the Admin Console ) access to the repositories is granted . This is because the same Admin Console is used for Rio ( which has LFDS ) and non-Rio ( which do n't ) versions of the Laserfiche suite , so it can not only poll the LFDS user pool . Also this avoids the situation where a license might have been allocated in LFDS to a user which is no longer in Active Directory , while LFDS has not yet been synced with AD . <p> If we are adding " global " users from LFDS , must I first allocate " Repository Named User Licenses " ? No ; adding " global " Laserfiche users from LFDS is achieved through the " New Laserfiche Directory Account " node in the Admin Console and works similarly to adding a new Windows or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in the Admin Console you will trust these users with access to the repository . Your understanding of the Repository Named Users is correct . <p> Thanks for your thorough response . Unfortunately , it seems like the answers to #1 and #2 conflict with each other , unless I misunderstand you ( which is likely ! ) . So , if my plan calls for me to add users in LFDS and then trust them to a repository ( so that I can add a user to &gt;1 repository without consuming &gt;1 license ) , how do I do the second step in the Admin Console , by ( i ) adding a Windows Account user , or ( ii ) adding a Laserfiche Directory user ? <p> Currently , I am able to add Windows Account users , but I can not add Laserfiche Directory users . When I try to add , I find that the " Locations " field is not populated , and I ca n't seem to change that . Is that a field that should auto-populate via communication with LFDS ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi Steven , it might be the unfortunate choice of terminology . In the Admin Console , " Laserfiche Directory Account " refers to the " Laserfiche users " added in LFDS , the ones which show up with an orange circle in the list of Accounts in LFDS . When adding a new Laserfiche Directory Account , the " from this location " field should be filled with " lfds " and read-only . If this is blank , there may be an issue . <p> So , by " Laserfiche users " in LFDS , do you mean users created in LFDS , not linked to an AD account ? If so , we do not have any of those ( yet ) . All of our users ( so far ) originate from an AD pool , and are created in LFDS as " Windows Active Directory Users " , the ones with the blue dot . Knowing that , how do I add them into a repository without consuming additional licenses beyond the one they already took in LFDS ? <p> If the answer is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Admin Console within the repository , that 's OK , I can do that . But , they come in with " False " attribute as " Named User " , and when you open the Properties there is no toggle to go " Full " , as you would see if you created a " New Repository User " . <p> Is that behavior what you would expect to see ? <p> And BTW , the Locations field for " Laserfiche Directory Users " is blank . <p> In LFDS you can verify that they have a Full license assigned ? If so , there may be a communication issue between LFS and LFDS . Try restarting the Laserfiche Server and see if the license status of these AD users updates to a full license . At this point I would also recommend you reach out to your reseller for additional troubleshooting . <p> Thank you , James , for all the info . Yes , they are Full users in LFDS . I will reach out to our VAR for support on this issue . <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer the above question , repeated here - if we have global users created in LFDS as Windows AD users , how do I add them to individual repositories ? Is it by adding " New Windows Account Users " from within the Admin Console ( as opposed to " New Laserfiche Directory User " ) ?

We are able to pull an export from our HR software that we are uploading to a SQL database . Within the export we have all of our Active employees and who their supervisors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person fills out the form , we look to see who their supervisor is and then do a second lookup for that unique identifier to grab their network username . Since we are using that username as the same username in Laserfiche , we are looking to see if we can then assign a task based on that value . I 'm working on that part today , so I 'm not sure if it works . If this works it might help you get around creating a user task for each person and instead assigning dynamically , at least for the first part of your workflow . <h> Replies <p> Armando , we just finished being able to assign a task to a user based on what employee is filling out the form and who their supervisor is . It is integrated with our HR software doing a database lookup . If you want more information , feel free to contact me . <p> You can assign user tasks to variables . If you know the appropriate approver 's username and you can put that value into a field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task . This would greatly simplify your process model and reduce the routing complexity .

As for SomeHexValue , you 'll need to use the correct value for that volume . You can find this by querying the vol table in the database and getting the value stored in the localid column for that particular volume . <p> Once the VOLUME.ID file has been modified to use the correct volume name and hex i 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try changing the fixed path again .

We have tried this kind of thing before and never been able to move a volume without a bunch of extra work . I want to understand what should be done so I can avoid this . <p> The main cause of this type of issue is if the VOLUME.ID file is missing . If the volume did have the VOLUME.ID file and you were changing the fixed path to a new location that is empty , then there should n't have been any issues ( with the presumption that the Laserfiche Server service account has read/write permissions to the new location ) . <p> If you find that there are other volumes in the repository that do not have a VOLUME.ID file as well , you can use the steps above to make one for them . <p> To get more information about this process , perhaps you can also test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and import a document or two into it . Then change the fixed path to a new empty folder . The Laserfiche Server should disable the volume while it moves the files automatically . After the move is completed , re-enable the volume . <p> Did you move the volume first in Windows Explorer and then try to update the volume path in the Laserfiche Administration Console ? That may be why you 're getting that error message . <p> If the volume files are already in **30;1010;TOOLONG but the path in the Laserfiche Administration Console is **26;1042;TOOLONG , then you can do the following : <p> In Windows , rename the **30;1070;TOOLONG folder to LONG ... <p> Create a new blank folder , **30;1102;TOOLONG <p> In the Laserfiche Administration Console , change the volume path to **30;1134;TOOLONG <p> Now in Windows , look in **30;1166;TOOLONG and see if there is a volume.id file .

@@98005775 @2205775/ <h> Three Ways to Improve a Laserfiche Form with JavaScript <p> Creating a form with Laserfiche Forms does n't require any coding knowledge , but users can enter their own custom JavaScript and CSS to add powerful functionality . Here is how JavaScript can be used with Laserfiche Forms to perform calculations , split a form into tabs and duplicate information by checking a box . <p> Keep the following in mind while reading the rest of the article : <p> Laserfiche Forms includes a JavaScript library called jQuery ( version 1.10 ) that makes writing JavaScript a lot faster and easier . The code examples provided in this article use jQuery . <p> This article is written for those who are interested in using JavaScript , but have limited experience with it . As such , the code examples shown here are CSS class based . Getting these examples to work for a form is as straightforward as adding a few CSS classes to fields and then copying the code into the CSS and JavaScript page . <h> Perform calculations <p> Some forms contain fields , like Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on information entered by the user . If used correctly , JavaScript can automatically perform these calculations faster and more accurately than people . <p> For example , a non-profit organization relies on membership to function . Potential members use Laserfiche Forms to fill out their applications , on which they can select their membership level and provide an additional donation . As they enter their information , the form automatically totals the donations for them . <p> Several fields are involved in calculating the correct donation amount : <p> Select the Membership Type <p> Would you like to give an additional donation ? <p> Donation Amount <p> Total Due <p> Each of these fields needs to be given an appropriate CSS class for the JavaScript to work . CSS classes are assigned in the Advanced tab when editing a field . See this help page to learn more about adding CSS classes to fields . <p> Give the Select the Membership Type field the membershipType class . <p> Give the Would you like to give an additional donation ? field the additionalDonation class . <p> Give the Donation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Due field the total class . <p> Here is what adding the class to the Total Due field looks like : <p> When configuring the Select the Membership Type field , make sure to check the " Assign values to choices " option and give each option the correct value for the membership type . <p> After giving these fields the appropriate CSS classes , paste the following code in the JavaScript section of the CSS and JavaScript page and click Save . <h> Duplicate information by checking a box <p> Many order forms will have both a billing address and a mailing address . The mailing address frequently matches the billing address . It is possible to set up a form so that , when a customer indicates the mailing address is the same as the billing address , the mailing address is automatically filled with the specified billing address . <p> This example uses two address fields ( given the addressOne and addressTwo classes ) and one checkbox field ( given the check class ) that allows the user to choose whether the information will be duplicated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following code in the JavaScript section of the CSS and JavaScript page . <h> Benefits of using JavaScript in Laserfiche Forms <p> Adding custom JavaScript and CSS to Laserfiche Forms results in the following benefits : <p> User error is reduced by automating calculations . <p> The form layout and appearance can be easily modified to suit the organizations specific needs . 9785 @qwx869785 <h> Capture Strategies in Laserfiche <h> Best Practices in Laserfiche Security 9780 @qwx869780 9783 @qwx869783

I know we can use the print button of the PDF to print it and be able to choose those options ( in our actual PDF version , it is kind of hidden ) but I was wondering if there was a way that we can configure the Laserfiche print options so we can change them so the users use the same print button whatever the file type ( TIFF or PDF ) . <h> Replies <p> Alright , it sounds like that 's what Tanya was saying then , if it 's specific to type=electronic document .

Note : I do agree with Miruna on this , any file system access using Workflow could have adverse affects and cause Workflow to hang . <p> When you run the code from the script editor it will use all paths from your local machine . <p> When it runs as part of a workflow all paths ( and permissions ) will be executed from the workflow server and the service account it 's running as . <p> So if there 's a reference in your script to c : picture.png <p> It will look at your local machine for c : picture when running the workflow from script editor and the server 's c : when ran as a workflow . <p> I 've ran into this a few times , especially when moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure any referenced objects , files , or assemblies can still be accessed with the path . <p> Looks like you are referencing Office interop libraries . Most production servers do not have Office installed . That would be the first thing I would check . If Office is installed , as for my understanding , the dlls ' must be copied to the Workflow folder in Program files and registered there . Check this post as it outlines it pretty well . <p> Chris , Office is already installed . About the dlls , I had them in a C path , but after reading Carl 's comment I move them to the WF folder ( also checked the post you mentioned and it seems they are in the right place now ) , : <p> Now , the only Dlls I actually need are Interop.Word , Access.Dao and office.core , as you can see in the image bellow they are now in the WF folder . <p> ----------- <p> Edit : <p> Carl , not sure if this is what you were talking about , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It seems that everything is configured correctly , please take a look at the screenshot , maybe I 'm missing something : <p> Regarding the word document , there is only one document , in its content there are a couple of words between " &lt;&gt; " , the first step is to copy that document and paste it in the " En Proceso " folder , once this copy is ready those words are replaced ( it should use tokens but since its just a test I 'm using the same strings ) . Finally , once the words between " &lt;&gt; " are replaced , I make a copy of the modified doc and paste it in the " Terminada " folder , however since the code is n't working on the development server I 'm not doing the last step . <p> I followed Chris advice and added the DLL 's using the Administration Console . <p> The warning messages changed , it says : <p> I investigated this problem and it may be caused if I 'm using 64-bits dlls in a 32-bits system and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Script Editor there is no problem . So I guess the warning changed but the problem might be the same . <p> Miruna , I also did what you suggested , there is only one error message which is different : <p> Please let me know your comments , I need to have this done pretty soon and I have no idea how to fix it . <p> The other error is most likely related . You can not mix and match libraries with different CPU architectures . If you 're running Workflow as x64 , then the Office libraries need to be x64 as well . Additionally , you 're showing that the Workflow Service is running as Local System . So Word would be launched under that user when the script runs . It 's very likely that Word is stalling trying to show the message about picking the username and initials that it usually shows when first launched . <p> Per development the process in question is not supported by Microsoft in this link " Server Side Automation Process " Development redirect to Microsoft kb article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Microsoft list few alternative procedures to try on , the developer suggest to try one by one .

I can configure access on a server within the domain but not on a server which is outside of the domain . I can add repositories and Forms but Directory Server settings are not working ( please see the image ) . <p> Scenario : <p> Laserfiche portal server is provisioned in Corporate DMZ . The server operates outside of Active Directory Domain and uses local accunts to provide Laserfiche portal services . The server has an external Domain name and is accessible form internet . <p> Laserfiche has internal infrastructure integrated with Active Directory sign on credentials . Repositories are published and users can access specific section of repositories based on their active directory group membership . <p> Specific rules have been configured to allow network traffic from Portal Server ( DMZ ) to internal LAN . These include specific Laserfiche ports and LDAPS to internal active directory server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and CA certificates provisioned on DMZ server to support LDAPS between DMZ server and AD server .

@@98005791 @2205791/ <p> You ca n't have multiple starting forms for a process , so you have no URL to link to . Since there 's no URL generated until after a form has been submited for the next step in the process there 's no way to send that back to the client for javascript to act on it . <p> To do this I believe you 'd need to setup those forms as separate processes . <p> I know that Forms does not have any built-in features to pass information between forms that are in different business processes . There may be a way to do this with Javascript , but I have n't seen it before . <p> Can you provide some background on why you want to pass information between business processes ? There may be an easier way to configure this . <p> We have a web service that authenticates the user . I am calling that web service using javascript on form load . If the user is authenticated , i want to show the form with the information retreived from the web service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How do I acheive that please ? <p> So let me state explicitly , that Javascript runs on the forms themselves , not the business process . As far as I know , there is n't a way to attach any Javascript to the process itself . <p> What you 'll want to do is configure the process modeler in the Forms process modeler . You can configure outflow paths to initiate different user tasks containing different forms needing to be filled out . These outflow paths can contain logic such that when a field in a form is populated with one value " A " , the next task will be User Task A. When that field contains value " B " , the next task will be User Task B. Keep in mind , different user tasks can prompt users to fill out different forms . <p> If you 're hoping to have a value in Business Process A determine the outflow path for Business Process B , that is not possible . Field data is kept for each individual business process . Once again , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll need a summary of the process before I can suggest anything specific . <p> It looks like you have created several posts here on Answers all related to the same question . Please avoid doing this in the future as it causes a lot of confusion and duplicates the resources that we spend asking the question . <p> So are you looking for a way for Forms to display one form or the other ? Or are you looking for a way to implement security ? <p> Why are you using a web service to authenticate users and not the built in security ? <p> Going against Rob a little on this one . You can manually set a processes URL on the processes " Publish " tab . Once you have that , you can then pass values to another process using a querystring . For instance , we have one form that user puts an I 'd number into and once it is submitted , it starts a Workflow that queries a 3rd party database for some values and puts them into our own database . Then an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is partially prepopulated based on the values passed through the querystring . Here is information from the Forms help documentation : <p> Q : Is it possible to pre-fill the fields on a form by passing in URL parameters ? A : Yes , it is ! You can add variable parameters onto the URL to a form . In order to do so , you 'll need to know the variable name associated with the field you want to fill in , and have the link to that form . Once you have this information , build the URL with the following structure : base URL ? **35;1198;TOOLONG Replace variable1 and variable2 with the variable names of the fields you want to populate on the form , and replace value with the value you want to appear in those fields . Append other variables to the URL by inserting an &amp; symbol followed by the variable name , as shown above . Note : Only the Single Line , Multi-line , Number , and Currency fields are supported with this feature . <p> I have done what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am running into is that sometimes an ampersand ( &amp; ) will be used in the pre-filled field . This ruins the URL . Any suggestions for this ? <p> The &amp; is denoted in a URL as %26 . You would have to some how either get them changed in your source data or some how look for any &amp; and change them to %26 in the URL when it sends it . If you are doing it in Workflow , Pattern Matching might be able to accomplish this for you . <p> Would someone show me what the URL would look like after the ? ... http : **27;1235;TOOLONG ? I am pulling First Name in a field - the variable is FirstName . Will this work dynamically or does this only work with a static value ? <p> It would look like LONG ... If you mean dynamically as in a Forms Service task can generate this , then yes . Note : Only fields outside of collections and tables can be populated via parameters . Address , radio button , checkbox , file upload , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are ways around this limitation , but would require some custom javascripts.

Is it possible to use tools in Laserfiche Workflow to do this ? If so , which tool or tools ? <h> Answer <p> You can export the results of business processes in Forms directly from the Results page . <p> To do so , go to the Results page and click the Change column display button .

Specify the file type ( CSV or XLSX ) and whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Click Download to download the results . <h> Replies <p> You can use the ' SDK Script ' activity to accomplish this . A couple of caveats ; <p> First ; the account that workflow is running under must have appropriate Windows permissions to write the CSV file to the target folder . This is generally not a problem when you are trying to write a file to the local server and workflow is running under the local system account , but it will be a problem if you are trying to write to another server share and workflow is running under a domain account that does not have permissions to the target folder <p> Second ; the routines to write CSV files can get complex if the row data contains delimiter characters ( commas in this case ) . The code below is about as simple as it can get because it assumes that the row data does not contain any commas . <p> Finally , in the example below I am ' hard coding ' the header row and data row values . In a real world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field values as tokens and then referencing them in the script to build the header and/or data row strings . ( If you need help with referencing those tokens in your script then let me know ) <p> Alternatively , you can have Laserfiche Forms trigger a Workflow and use the " Retrieve Laserfiche Forms Content " activity in Workflow to extract all the field data . Once the data is in Workflow , you can convert it to whatever format you need , such as . csv , or even write the entries to SQL . <p> I 'm curious , how are you intending to use the . csv data John ? If you 're planning to archive the data or use it to trigger another process , you should be able to do all of that from within Workflow to consolidate your process and make it more manageable . 
@@98005795 @2205795/ <h> Answers <p> Deborah , Miruna 's solution did n't work for you not because of the double slash , but because of the ( d+ ) . On the other hand , Derek 's solution worked for you because of the ( S+ ) . abcW(S+) might work here , but it will also " work " on something like <p> abc#AA1234 <p> or <p> abc&amp;AA1234 <p> Or any string where the fourth character is something other than a letter or a digit , since that 's what W means . This might be what you want , but from your original description , it likely is not . <p> As for the part following that , ( d+ ) does n't work because the slash is followed by AA , which is not matched by d+ since d only matches digits ( it would , however , work on an input like abc123456 ) . In the suggested solution , ( S+ ) worked because that matches " anything other than a space character " . That means the suggested solution would also match abc#$%&amp; by trimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it might also not . <p> From your description , the regex you 'd most likely want would be <p> abc(w+) <p> or <p> abc(S+) <p> or maybe even <p> abc ( . * ) <p> ( everything after the abc , including spaces , endlines , and other words , in the case the input you are trimming from is the entirety of the input you want ) <p> Is the prefix always " acct " ? Is the suffix always " pdf " ? Or do you know something a bit more general , such as " the prefix always has letters but no numbers and the suffix always follows a period " ? <p> If it 's the former case ( always acct and always pdf ) , then you can simply do this for your pattern : <p> acct(d+).pdf <p> If it 's more general ( ie prefix can be multiple letters , suffix is any letters or numbers after the period ) then you can do something more general : <p> a-zA-Z+ ( d+ ) . w+ <p> I 'll explain this in parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or uppercase alphabetical letter . More specifically , letters a through z , and A through Z. <p> ( d+ ) : The numbers you want to " capture " . d+ means " one or more digits ( ie same as 0-9+ , or one or more characters from 0 to 9 ) " . The parentheses turn this into a " capture " , meaning the pattern match will result in just the bit you capture , effectively trimming out the rest of the input . <p> . : The period , escaped . In a regex , a period character by itself is used to symbolize a wildcard ; as in , it can represent any character . By using a slash , " " , you tell the regex you want to match exactly the period character . This slash is very important here ! ! <p> w+ : One or more word characters . w matches any alphabetical character as well as any digit . This let 's the pattern match suffixes like . pdf but also let 's it match suffixes with numbers , like .7z

I have a Field called " Doc Type " which contains a list of the 9 documents and is a mutli-field value . The documents are being scanned in and named the same name as those in the list .

Should n't you be assigning the " Doc Type " field to the folder 's checklist ? What do you have the in the document 's checklist field ? <p> Also , did you check to see if there were any errors in your previously run workflows ? Can you screenshot a document 's metadata and a folder 's metadata so I can get a better idea of how each field is set ? <h> Replies <p> When the document is imported into the application folder , the document has the Doc Type field that contains the text to signify what type of document it is and the folder has the Doc Type field that represents which documents already exist within the folder . So we 'd like to add the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the folder 's " Doc Type " field . <p> It sounds like , in this case , the document will be easy for the workflow to recognize ; most likely it will be the starting entry . The folder might be harder for Workflow to find , but it should be as easy as a " Find Entry " activity , then choose the " at " radio button , then choose the Global token of % ( Entry Path ) . This will find the folder that houses the starting entry . In this case , it will find the application folder . <p> You 'll need to retrieve the field values from the document then use an " Assign Field Values " activity . The Assign Field Values activity will need to be configured based on your case , but you 'll need to make sure , at the very least , that you have the Doc Type field set to assign the value from the document to the folder . You 'll also see that when you are assigning that value , you 'll need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and not replace field values , to make sure you 're not overwriting the pre-existing Doc Type values . <p> Hopefully this makes sense . Feel free to leave a reply if you have additional questions or would like some clarification ! <p> Big help with the suggestion . However , I ca n't seem to get the " Doc Type " to populate into the folder template ( even though the rest of the data does ) . I 've attached screenshots of my workflow ... perhaps you can see what I might be doing wrong . Basically , what 's I 'm doing is once a document is scanned in through Quickfields , it will create a new folder ( Foxhoven , Daryl - 12345 ) . From there , I have a " Checklist " that will be copied into that folder as well . Then I simply want any new documents that are put into that folder to update the " Checklist " field that 's assigned to the Folder . I can get the template and information to be assigned to the folder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What is the entry with I 'd 172 ? Is that the checklist ? I 'm having trouble following why you have a checklist document and a checklist metadata field . <p> Can you also attach the screenshot of the " Assign Field Values 2 " --&gt; " Checklist " field ? I want to make sure that field is set to " Append " and not " Replace " <p> The last thing I 'd suggest checking is the workflow 's recent activity from the common searches pane . Open a workflow that did not successfully update the " Checklist " metadata field and see if there are any errors or warnings from the messages tab . <p> If you 'd like to continue troubleshooting this workflow over Answers , I 'm more than happy to continue offering assistance .

The Checklist document is a PDF that the Supervisor must complete and sign upon review of the Application documents ... the " Checklist Metadata Field " is simply a multi-value field that allows the Supervisor to see what documents have been scanned in and how which have not ( as I 'm going to create another workflow that will route the folder to the Supervisor so they can quickly see the metadata and what documents are still not received ) . <p> It looks like you 're retrieving the " Checklist " field from the document and assigning that field to the Folder . Should n't you be assigning the " Doc Type " field to the folder 's checklist ? What do you have the in the document 's checklist field ? <p> Also , did you check to see if there were any errors in your previously run workflows ? Can you screenshot a document 's metadata and a folder 's metadata so I can get a better idea of how each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of eyes ! Test this out and let me know if you run into anything else ! <p> Also , I wanted to leave a friendly reminder that if that was indeed the solution , make sure that you mark a response that " Answered your question " to make sure that anyone who sees this topic will know that it was resolved . <p> Here 's a sample workflow that works in your general scenario where the documents scanned in are named as the document type and the parent folder 's " Doc Type " field gets appended with the values as documents are scanned in . There 's also a check to see that when the multivalue field has nine values , it will set the " Status " field to Complete . Note that there are probably more efficient ways of designing this workflow . <p> No problem . Also , my sample workflow uses a starting rule based off of a document being scanned into the folder . The document name is the same as the value you want to update the parent folder document type field with . 
@@98005800 @2205800/ <h> Question <h> Question <p> When using Universal Capture with QuickFields , you are able to convert . bmp , . jpg , and several other formats to Laserfiche TIF 's . However when using Laserfiche Capture Engine you are only able to convert PDF 's to Laserfiche TIF 's . Is there a reason that the Laserfiche Capture Engine is so much more limited and are there plans to add this functionality in the future ? <p> The scenario is that we are wanting to use it to convert Forms attachments to TIF and thus the documents already exist in Laserfiche and force us to use Laserfiche Capture Engine . I understand that they can be manually converted by generating the pages via snapshot but that is not feasible for an enterprise roll-out where automation is key . We 've limited the extensions they can provide in Forms but are hesitant to limit them even more to only PDF . Is there another automation that is preferred for converting the Forms image attachments ( jpg , png , bmp , tif , ... ) to to Lasefiche TIF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 , 2016 <p> On further investigation , image attachments are converted to Laserfiche image documents as of Forms 9.1 . The extensions converted are based on the options under New DocumentsFile Conversion for the user specified in the connection profile in the Save to Laserfiche action . <h> Replies <p> Actually , Universal Capture does not do any file conversion for images . I 'm guessing you 're looking at the documents in the volume ? The Laserfiche server changes the extension on all the images to TIF , but they 're still in their native format . <p> I just ran a TIF , a BMP , and a JPG through the Unversal Capture in QuickFields 10.1 and I assume it converted them as I show nothing for them under " Electronic Document Properties " and page info shows them as a tif . <p> If I go to this document in the volume it attempts to open it as a TIF . <p> So you are saying this document is not actually a TIF now and that QF just changes the extension as part of the import @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we are showing that they are TIF , storing them as TIF , reporting to the end user from a Records Management perspective that they are TIF , but they actually are n't TIF ? <p> Also , why does n't the Laserfiche Capture Engine do this same process then ? <p> Forms creates all attachments as electronic documents , regardless of their format . <p> Capture Engine does not interpret electronic files , it just exports them and they are kept as the electronic component of the document . Quick Fields was not designed to handle image files as a document 's electronic component because that was never an expected configuration . <p> So now that Forms is such a massive part of Laserfiche and Records Management ( in TIF format ) has always been so important , what is the recommended method for converting those Forms attachments that are in image format ( JPG , BMP , TIF ) to Laserfiche TIF images or is it just a manual process ? Is there new functionality ( e.g. future QuickFields functionality , DCC enhancement , new service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I filed an enhancement request for Forms and we can look into adding a new process to Quick Fields that could handle that conversion . <p> I do n't disagree that the conversion process could be easier because Windows does not have great image display tools and having image files as electronic documents makes the user experience somewhat more uneven . However , as far as records management is concerned , it does not matter whether the document has image pages , is in an electronic format or has both image pages and an electronic component . Retention schedules apply to it in all cases . <p> Correct Retention Schedules still apply but many retention standards ( State schedules and others that are determined outside of Laserfiche ) require the document to be in TIF format to constitute an original . This is why it is so imperative to have the ability to convert these as opposed to telling the end user we can only accept it in PDF because that is the only thing we know how to convert to the TIF format we need to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I now have a clearer understanding of how the import processes ( Laserfiche Capture &amp; Universal Capture ) function/differ . Also , thanks for creating an enhancement request for QuickFields . I am hoping this functionality is also added to the DCC as document conversion ( from PDF , TIF , JPG , &amp; BMP ) would be a huge benefit and seems necessary to continue to grow the Forms product . <p> On further investigation , image attachments are converted to Laserfiche image documents as of Forms 9.1 . The extensions converted are based on the options under New DocumentsFile Conversion for the user specified in the connection profile in the Save to Laserfiche action .

So it may still upload the files multiple times . <p> For your case , I think you would like Import Agent check the folder and import once every night . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run once . You can configure a windows task scheduler to run Import Agent once by specifying argument " -o " to ImportAgentService.exe . In this way , Import Agent checks the import folder , imports the files once and exit . <p> Put the Excel files in a folder that your users work from that is NOT monitored by Import Agent .

@@98005817 @2205817/ <h> Tech Tip : Folder Tunneling <p> By : Sarah Seene Technical Writer <p> Laserfiche let 's you make documents and folders available to users right where they expect to find them . Sometimes you will want to give users or groups access to folders that are buried in folders to which they do n't  have access . For example , you might want users to be able to access their personal folders , but not the department folder in which they reside . Or you might want to give one department access to a single sub-folder that resides in another department 's folder . You can do this by creating a shortcut to the desired folder , and placing the shortcut in a folder that the user or group can access . This way , you can give the user or group access to the shortcut 's target but not any of the folders in between . <p> Example : You want to create a folder for Jane 's retirement fund information , called Jane Smith 401k , within the Human Resources folder . However , you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folder , not the Human Resources folder itself . By creating a shortcut to the Jane Smith 401K folder in Jane 's personal folder ( which she has access to ) , Jane will be able to follow the shortcut to her 401k folder and search for her 401k folder " even though she ca n't browse to her folder by going to the Human Resources folder . This configuration is useful because you do n't need to explicitly deny Jane access to all the other folders within the Human Resources folder , but simply grant access where it is needed . This , in turn , simplifies the repository 's overall security policy . <p> Folder tunneling adds great flexibility in setting up repositories . Potentially complicated and time-consuming modifications to the overall security setup of the repository can be avoided in cases where certain users should be granted access to specific pieces of information in an otherwise confidential parent folder . 9785 @qwx869785

Here are three reasons to begin your implementation in the accounts payable ( A/P ) department . <h> 1 . A/P touches many departments <p> Every department has invoices and purchase orders that need to be submitted or processed . By automating A/P , the benefits of ECM will be felt across the whole organization . - For example , the A/P process at Eaton County , MI , touches 25 departments . Once these departments saw how quickly their purchase orders and invoices were approved , they were eager to use ECM to automate their own processes . <h> 2 . Results are quick <p> A/P is such a paper-heavy and time-consuming process that by automating even a small part of it , you 'll see results right away . This will help generate buy-in from users and spread the good word throughout the organization . For example , implementing ECM in the A/P department at Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a task that used to take employees 5-10 minutes per voucher . <h> 3 . Benefits are substantial <p> Because A/P is a very paper-heavy process , the benefits of automation are substantial . Such benefits can be measured in both time and money saved . - For example , the Florida League of Cities saves 50 hours a month by automating A/P , while Pebble Partnership saves $3,800 annually on postage , paper and storage costs alone . Such benefits justify the organizations investment in ECM and reduce resistance to organization-wide implementation from high-level stakeholders . 9785 @qwx869785 9781 @qwx869781 9780 @qwx869780 9783 @qwx869783

I am using the Workflow " Script SDK " activity to perform the script below . I receive the error when the user is not explicitly assigned to the folder security . If I add a group that the service account is a member of , I receive the access denied error . If I explicitly add the service account to the folder , then I am able to export the PDF to a UNC path . <p> I opened a laserfiche support ticket and was told to open an answers forum as this may be related to the script . <h> Answer 9784 @qwx869784 <p> replied on March 7 <p> We were able to figure out that it was a Kerberos issue . <p> It required the service account to be restarted . <p> The service account was added to the Active Directory Group and they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and logged in as the service account , the kerberos tokens were updated allowing the service account to authenticate through the new AD group . <h> Replies <p> It may also depend on all of the ACLs ( entry access rights ) that are effective ( accumulated ) on the folder as well as the entry . Perhaps you can provide that information ( as a screenshot ) , either on the support ticket , or as a reply to this post ? <p> My original suggestion was to get a screenshot of the entry access rights for the Laserfiche folder and entry . <p> However , the correct answer to your question would depend on which issue ( the UNC path versus the Laserfiche folder/entry ) is causing the error you are seeing . <p> If you do n't know which one is causing the error , that would be your first step to figure out . <p> You can also put an exception try-catch block around your code ( inside the VB script ; not in the workflow designer ) . Inside the catch block , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line where the error happens . <p> You can also print out the value of TokenReplace ( " % ( ExportPath ) " ) and see whether it is a valid UNC path . <p> You can also try to write a test file to the same UNC path , before you access the Laserfiche document entry . That way , you can verify whether the UNC path is writeable , in order to determine whether your error has anything to do with the UNC folder security . <p> General advice when dealing with scripting errors <p> If you have access to SDK and Visual Studio , it would be easier to debug your script by implementing a test version of it as a . NET console application first . The benefits are : <p> You can use Visual Studio debugging while it is executing , <p> You can see the line of code that throws the error , <p> You can inspect the local variables inside your script at the point where the error happens , <p> You can specify the credentials when connecting to Laserfiche repository , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues early in the troubleshooting process . <p> In general it is recommended to use exception handling and logging , whether within WF scripting or with standalone test application . <p> The error is being thrown at the UNC path . I replaced the token with the UNC path and I get the same error . <p> As I stated earlier , the script works when I explicitly add the windows account to the folder security at the UNC path or parent folder outside of Laserfiche . If I attempt to use AD group security instead of adding the user , I receive the error . <p> I was able to log onto the server as the WF service account and add/delete documents in the UNC path . So I assume it is n't a windows issue . <p> I wanted to see if Laserfiche had an answer as this does n't seem to be an issue with the script . As I said earlier , it works when I explicitly add the WF Server Service account to the folder security of the UNC or ExportPath . However , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOBs and Certs " to the folder security , I receive an access denied error . <p> The WF Server Service Account is a member of " SOBs and Certs " . The group has Modify rights at the folder level of the ExportPath . When I log onto the server as the WF Server Service Account , I am able to import documents / PDFs into the ExportPath . <p> Please let me know if Laserfiche or anyone has a response to this issue . <p> Unfortunately , this is a Windows error , not a Laserfiche one . The Workflow service does not calculate security on the target folder , it just attempts to write to it . You might be able to get a better answer on how Windows processes security for service accounts from a Microsoft forum . <p> The service account was added to the Active Directory Group and they did not bounce the server .

@@98005833 @2205833/ <h> Update Dynamic Fields Directly Within Laserfiche <p> Contributed by : Ben Birns , Capital Solutions <p> Dynamic fields allow you to constrain the values in one field based on a value set in another . Usually , administrators must specify which sub-values ( child values ) are valid for which parent values by populating tables in an external database and then specifying which Laserfiche fields in the template correlate with the external table values . By following the method below , you can configure dynamic fields without needing to create and maintain any external database tables , allowing you to quickly update your field values without having to involve a database administrator . <h> Example <p> In this example , we are dealing with a number of estates . Each estate has many streets that belong to it . We are going to set up a template named Housing , which then allows a user to select an Estate from a drop-down menu and a corresponding Street from a dynamic field . <p> In this example , Estate is the parent field and Street is the child field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These instructions continue along the example I have introduced , but you can adapt these steps to fit your specific template and field needs . The embedded hyperlinks will also take you to areas of the Laserfiche Online Help that describe the specific process in more detail . <p> Log into the Laserfiche Administration Console and create a list field called Estate . Populate this field with a few estate names of your choosing . Later , you will be able to add more names to the list . <p> Create a text field named estreet . Allow this field to store multiple values . Since this field will only be used for adding dynamic field values , the naming does n't matter . Make sure that only administrators have edit rights to estreet . <p> Create a new template named StreetsLookup and add the Estate and estreet fields to it . Administrators should secure the StreetsLookup template to prevent general users from adding to dynamic field values . Note the width of the new fields and record them as ESTATEWIDTH and ESTREETWIDTH respectively . <p> Create a text field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be displayed on document templates . Do not populate this field yet . Make sure the width is the same as ESTREETWIDTH <p> Use these SQL scripts to create a view named StreetLookup in an external database . These scripts are written to run directly within the Laserfiche database , but they can be easily modified if you would like to create them in another database . /*1 . Get psetid of template containing level 1 values and replace with INSERTFIRSTVALUEHERE*/ SELECT psetid from propset WHERE psetname='StreetsLookup ' /*2 . Get the propid of the field containing the street values and replace with INSERTSECONDVALUEHERE. */ SELECT propid from propdef WHERE propname='estreet ' /*3 .

You need one document per estate . It does not matter where in the repository these documents are created . <p> For each estate , populate the Street field with the related streets . You should end up with as many blank documents as estates , with each document referencing a different estate . <p> Now it is time to create the actual document template . The example below is called Housing . Add the Estate and Street fields to the template and set up the dynamic field links . <p> Test out your new dynamic template @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigning the Housing template to it . <p> Note : This solution has only been tested to work with Laserfiche Client and Server versions 8.2 and 8.3 , and SQL Server 2005 and 2008. 9785 @qwx869785 <h> Capture Strategies in Laserfiche <h> Best Practices in Laserfiche Security 9780 @qwx869780 9783 @qwx869783

What is the workflow item to get the form from Laserfiche forms so I can then use the email action in workflow ? <h> Answer 9784 @qwx869784 <p> replied on October 26 , 2016 <p> There are a number of ways your workflow can find the form that you saved to the repository . I use the metadata field ' Reference Number ' and the submission i 'd so that I guarantee that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field and/or the submission i 'd is not required to do any of this . You could just simply search for the name of your form in the directory you saved it to . <p> However each time a forms process runs it generates a unique submission i 'd , so I use that to positively identify the form and prevent a possible mistake of sending the wrong form . <p> A quick breakdown of the entire process . <p> My forms workflow : <p> I configure the save to repository task to save the form to a specific directory and add the metadata field /dataset/submissionid . This is the unique number that Forms generates . <p> The form is saved into the repository with the metadata field ' Reference Number ' . Again , it will be unique for each form saved into the repository . <p> When forms calls the workflow , the submission i 'd number is passed as a variable and we can use that to positively find the form we want to email out . <p> To see the default variables that forms passes to a workflow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a form . Click the Green Arrow on your workflow , then ' View Workflow Properties ' in the lower right corner , check the Attribute " Started by Laserfiche Forms " . <p> You will then have a token set called Input Parameters available to your workflow that includes the unique submission i 'd . ( useful for a variety of things ) <p> The workflow searches the folder I specified for that unique submission i 'd and I use that result in the email activity as my attachment to mail . <p> You will also probably want to tell the email activity to send the attachment as copy as it defaults to sending a shortcut link back into the repository and unless the recipient has a license they will not be able to view it . <p> Right click the attachment and select properties . <p> And select attach a copy of the document and any other options you need . <h> Replies <p> I have a few forms setup to do this . I use the submission i 'd variable since it will be unique , to find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know I always find the correct form . <p> In your form flow , save the form into your repository . Using the configure fieId options , assign the field ' Reference Number ' to your saved form using the Submission I 'd ( /dataset/submissionid ) Of course you can use any field variable you like . <p> Thanks , that did help a lot but I think I still have some questions . Is that custom search query going to get the latest form in the folder that I am searching in or just any form ? <p> My thought process is that the user fills out the form and submits it . The forms processer modeler will place the form in a folder in the repository . Then I have the next service task run a workflow and pickup the latest document in that folder and email it . <p> Through workflow , you would first need to sent the form to Laserfiche .

A . docx file for example does not get pages added just because it has been OCRed . What is the best way to find all documents that have not been OCRed . <p> It appears this is excluding documents that have text associated with them . But these documents have not been OCRed . I am looking for a way to search for all documents that have not been OCRed and therefore less relevant in search results and no search details will be shown . <p> The search I posted if used by itself will search the entire repository for all documents that do n't have text ( OCRd text ) associated with them . Doing a test , it still does not address your issue of finding electronic files that have not had text extracted from them . <p> The problem is that when I use your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have extracted text . If I right click a single document and select OCR , then it gets an improved search ranking and more details in the context hits location . I would like to OCR all documents that have extracted text but no OCR . <p> That 's interesting . I would have thought that extracted text would count as having been OCR 'd and that telling it to OCR the document would have no effect other than to re-extract the text . It 's not like it 's going to Snapshot the document and OCR the images . <p> It makes a big difference . First we found that no context details are listed for only extracted text , also there is no location data . Then we found that search rankings go up when a document is OCRed , it moves up in the search results . <p> You can not OCR an electronic file . You can only extract its text . When you import an electronic file and tell it not to generate searchable text , when you perform a search it gives what Chad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic file . <p> If you tell it on import or after it 's in the repository to " OCR/Extract Text " the electronic file , it actually creates pages for the file ( see the IIS Reset file below ) . <p> The pages do n't show up as an image when viewing it in the document viewer , but you will see a thumbnail . Nor do they show in text pane in the document viewer . If you perform a search on these documents you get the more detailed results as Chad was referring to as well . <p> In the end , Chad has a great question . How do you find all electronic files that have not had text generated for them since what is produced when using the Generate Text button on an electronic document does n't show up in the Text pane and since it does n't have pages , you can not perform a " has pages with no text " search ? <p> It does n't seem to work in the latest version . I am not sure what the search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire repository . <p> For example there are some PDF files in here that have password protection , invalid pointers , and general database errors ( does a PDF even have a database ? ) . They ca n't be OCRed . I should be able to find them . <p> When I search for . pdf extension and include that advanced search I get no results . So it ca n't be returning everything . <p> I do n't know if you found the solution or not , but I thought that I would post this as I had the same question . <p> We had to re-OCR the entire repository as the OCR settings had been set incorrectly . But we wanted to start with documents who were never OCR'ed . The above worked for us . We wanted to search for a template field S Film ReOCRed as well . We verified the results and the search returned the correct record set .

From the provided code listing , I 'm guessing you had assigned the " capitalizeMe " class to field 44 ? In which case that class is applied to the same element as the " q44 " i 'd . So when you have the selector " #q44 . capitalizeMe input " it looks for an input element within a " capitalizeMe " element within the " q44 " element . This structure probably does n't exist . <p> If you specifically want only the " #q44 " element to follow this rule , the following two CSS statements are equivalent : <p> as you would then be able to extend this behavior to other form fields simply by adding the " capitalizeMe " class to them , without having to also add their form field I 'd to the rule . <p> Personally , I would recommend in general to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for reasons of easy extensibility , but also for ease of reference as to what is being targeted for the rule , for example if referring to the custom code to troubleshoot , or if someone else takes over the project and will have to work with the code . Even if the target of the rule is one specific field and it wo n't be applied to anything else , it 's easier to understand what is targeted by " . zipcode input " than " #q17 input " . <p> As a final caveat , potentially not relevant for your use , the " text-transform : capitalize " property will capitalize the first letter of any word ( space-delimited ) in the target element . In particular , it is not the same as " title case " ; articles and short words like " of " will not get any special treatment . There are a few other interesting behaviors of the rule , more at the Mozilla Developer 's reference .

The financial aid process usually involves many different forms and supplemental documents that must be processed , reviewed and approved by multiple people . Here are three ways to reinvent this time-consuming and paper-intensive financial aid process . <h> 1 . Make forms easily available <p> The current generation of college students is used to having information available on demand . Why should financial aid forms be any different ? Palm Springs , CA-based College of the Desert has an online student portal where all financial aid forms are electronically available . Students no longer have to stand in a long line at the financial aid office just to obtain a blank copy of a form . <p> College of the Deserts online student portal . <p> These forms can be linked to the student database so that most of information in the form is prefilled once a student types in his student I 'd . Certain fields can be set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted . <p> This reduces overall processing time because : <p> Electronic forms ensure legibility . <p> Counselors do n't have to follow up with students to correct or receive missing information . <p> Lines in the financial aid office are reduced , giving staff more time to process information . <h> 2 . Facilitate communication <p> It 's important to keep the line of communication open between everyone involved in the process , including the students , counselors and other reviewers . Oklahoma Christian University provides an online financial aid checklist on its student portal , which is updated when new forms are submitted and let 's students know exactly what is missing . <p> Oklahoma Christian Universitys online financial aid checklist . <p> Students can also choose to be automatically notified by email when documents are missing , or when their documents are reviewed and approved .

Centralize student records <p> Fielding inquiries from students and parents regarding the status of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trying to find the appropriate student file can make responding to these questions time consuming and inefficient . <p> Tarrant County College District ( TCCD ) faced this issue with students applying for Veterans Administration ( VA ) benefits . TCCD now stores all student records , including VA benefits forms , in an enterprise content management ( ECM ) repository , which is synced with the schools enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system . Now , VA district representatives can access student forms by performing a quick search in the ECM system , improving response time to student queries . 9785 @qwx869785 9781 @qwx869781 9780 @qwx869780 9783 @qwx869783

@@98005870 @2205870/ <h> Discussion <h> Discussion <p> Everyone knows that workflow can send data to Forms using the Invoke Business Process and Set Business Process Variables activities . However , one important thing it can not do is " attach " files to File Upload fields . We were hoping that version 10.1 would have this ability and were disappointed when it did n't . So we decided to figure out how to do it ourselves . <p> The idea behind this approach is to provide a unified interface for all document approvals . A lot of users , especially those who are not tech-savvy , get really confused by having to navigate between different Laserfiche modules . One minute they are filling out a form or approving a submission , and the next they have to log into the repository , find the document they want and then change a metadata field . This introduces a lot of friction to the user experience ! <p> Here 's the approach : <p> First , create a new business process in forms with a simple approval step . <p> Then , modify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a custom HTML field ( not important ) as well as two single line fields ( GUID and Name ) and a file upload field . We will create a workflow that , when run , will push two Word documents inside a repository folder ( a resume and a cover letter ) into this file upload field . The end result will look like this : <p> Pretty nice , right ? <p> Let 's take a look at the workflow now . It 's not a simple workflow , so I 'll try to explain each step . <p> First , we 'll create a bunch of tokens using the Assign Token Values activity . <p> Then , we use the Find Entries activity to find the documents we want to attach to the file upload field . In my case , it simply points to a folder inside the repository , and the folder contains Resume.docx and Cover Letter.docx . Nothing special . <p> Next , we need to create a GUID , which stands for ' Globally Unique Identifier ' . GUIDs are very useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you develop . You 'll see how this GUID comes in handy soon . <p> Now let 's invoke the Forms Business Process we created . We will only assign two variables : the GUID we just created will be assigned to the GUID dataset , and we 'll use a hardcoded value to the Name field . <p> My business process is called " Test Document Review - Copy " . Yours can be called something else . <p> Okay , now things get exciting . Let 's take a look at the Find Submission I 'd activity . The idea behind this activity is that , when we invoked the business process in the previous step , a new submission got created in the Forms database . However , because the Invoke Business Process activity does not return a token for the submission I 'd , we need to find it manually . The way we do this is by searching the cfbpdata table for a specific value that belongs to that submission : the GUID . <p> As you can see , the value column gets the GUID . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case I 'm using it to make the query a bit faster . If you have a very large database , searching the value column in the cfbpdata table for a GUID can take several seconds ( since the column is not indexed ) . Using attributeid essentially narrows the scope of the search ( think Within Folder searches in LF - same concept ) . <p> Okay , before I talk about the next activity , I 'd like to explain the attributeid a bit further . Basically , we need to find the attributeid of the file upload field . To do this , we need to do a bit of digging in the Forms database . <p> First , we 'll need to find the bpid ( business process I 'd ) of the business process we created in forms . This can be found by looking inside the cfbusinessprocesses table . Find the name of your process and you 'll find its bpid . <p> Then , open the cfprocesses table and find the bpid , and grab the processid . <p> Finally , run a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In my case , it is 54 . <p> You 'll note that it returned three fields , since our business process has three fields ( name , GUID and the file upload field ) . The one with attributetype of doc is the one we need . Make a note of its attributeid and memberpath . In my case , they are : <p> attributeid : 1518 <p> memberpath : 1398 <p> Okay , let 's move on to the next activity in the workflow . In this activity , we will enter another row into the cfbpdata table for the submission that workflow made earlier in the instance . <p> The important stuff here is that you need to check the " create identity token " checkbox . The repeatid also has to be 0 and the value has to get the blank value from the Blank token we generated at the very beginning . Otherwise , Forms totally freaks out , I have no idea why . <p> The reason we have gone through all this trouble so far is that , in order for Forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there needs to be a bpdataid value for that attributeid inside the cfbpdata table . The bpdataid automatically gets created by the database engine when workflow inserts the row in the activity we talked about above . <p> We have set the stage for inserting the documents into the file upload field now . Let 's now loop through the documents we found using the Find Entries activity . For each document , we do three things . <p> First , we need to use an SDK activity to get the electronic document portion of the entry and convert it into a byte array.The reason we have to do this is because Forms actually keeps the documents as binary data inside the database : <p> We also find out the extension of the document because we will need it in the next activity . <p> Next , we need to insert that byte array into the cfbpattachmentdata table using a Custom Activity : <p> I 'm actually include this script below since it can be a bit hard to see in the screenshot : <p> Essentially , we convert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) into VARBINARY(MAX) and then insert it into the cfbpattachmentdata table , along with the length of the document ( in bytes - we calculated this in the SDK script ) and the document name . <p> And then for the last step , we map the cfbpdata row we entered earlier with the binary of the document we inserted with the custom activity : <p> Once you run this workflow , there should be a new task created for the user inside the User Task you configured in the Forms process , and when they open the task , they should find the files that workflow found using the Find Entries activity . Currently this works only with electronic documents , but it should be easy enough to modify for scanned images too . <p> I 'm also using a bit of custom HTML and JavaScript to change the look-and-feel of the document review form . My custom HTML field contains a table : <p> &lt;h2&gt;Documents to Review&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h4 id= " name " &gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;table class= " table " &gt; &lt;caption&gt;The documents you need to review are listed below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your computer and open it in its associated application . Once done , come back to this form , type your comments and select Approve or Reject . &lt;/caption&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Document Name&lt;/th&gt; **36;1630;TOOLONG &lt;/thead&gt; **27;1668;TOOLONG &lt;/table&gt; <p> First , this works very well in our development environment , but we probably would not use it in production . Not only is it brittle ( if the Forms database structure changes between versions , it can break ) , but it also manually inserts data into the forms table , which is not a good idea . If your Forms database breaks because of this workflow , I seriously doubt LF Support would help you . <p> Second , it is totally possible to use this and accidentally violate the LF licensing agreement . The approach allows pushing repository documents to Forms Authenticated Participants , which means they no longer need a Named License to view documents in the repository . Unless Laserfiche says otherwise , or comes out with an out-of-the-box method , make sure the forms users these documents are sent to are named users . <p> Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this functionality soon . The possibilities it opens up are crazy ! <p> I just came across this and wish I had a month or so ago . I 'm doing something similar and got stuck on the INSERT part for Binary Attachments ( error below ) . I noticed that there seemed to be no way to CAST a string to a binary string ( " 0x00 " as a test ) . Your workflow is helping me in that I know that I need to use a Custom Query . I suppose I could do all the queries in SDK code , but I want to stay away from that if I can . <p> It still seems ridiculous to have to use such a workaround -- manipulating the Forms DB . We 're still on version 9.2. x here , so it 's also helpful to know that upgrading to v10 wo n't help in this regard . <p> <p> A user named ' FormsRouting ' initiated an instance of ' ************* ' which terminated . <p> Reason : Implicit conversion from data type nvarchar to varbinary(max) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this query . Implicit conversion from data type nvarchar to varbinary(max) is not allowed . Use the CONVERT function to run this query .

@@98005880 @2205880/ <h> Question <h> Question <h> LF10 - Allow read-write access ONLY to 1 specific subfolder or file without showing the main folder and its subfolders <p> We chose Laserfiche due to its very good security features but I could n't seem to find how I can allow access to only specific subfolders or files without showing its root main folder . This is a major business need as we can not manage taking out a file/folder and putting in a general use folder everytime we have our volunteers come in to help with metadata management due to the volume of files we have . Please help . <h> Replies <p> Hi Bea ! If you give them read/write access to just only one subfolder , they will be able to access the content to that folder . The problem is the folder tree before it is hidden because no access has been given to the user , making it difficult to browse to . A couple of things you could do to access it easier : <p> 1 . Get the user to search for the folder . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root level , and give them access rights to browse/read that shortcut only . <p> 3 . Setup access right so they can only see the folders to the folder they want ( I would only recommend this if the subfolder is permanently made available to your user ) . <p> There are so many different things you can do with Laserfiche Security so I have provided a couple of links to white papers and presentations so that you can have a better understanding ! <p> Note that you can also use entry access scope to grant rights differently to the parent folder compared to its contents . So you can give the user the ability to see the existence of the root folder itself , but not grant them rights to see any of the children except for the one folder you want them to see ( say by using a shortcut as Cathy describes above ) . <p> If you create a security tag and assign it to all users except this specific subset ( make sure this includes admins and your service accounts like workflow ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folder in your main folder . Since presumably your security is already set correctly that this special group does not have permissions to sub folders/docs , you only need to assign the tags to the top level . Additionally , if your everyone group has read access for everything I 'd remove it from the root folder ( and anywhere else it is ) . you can then create a new group that includes all of your other users to grant permissions to everything . <p> When users log in to the laserfiche , they will only see one folder . The trick to this method is to make sure that all other folders/subfolders are locked away with permissions too , otherwise the users can use a search to see those documents . In addition , you can hide unneeded templates by setting security on the templates to only the other groups . If other users have rights assigned by that former " everyone " group , just add your new everyone else group access to everything at the root level , and the new group you create for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to avoid using Deny as much as possible . It 's easy to cause confusion - it 's simpler just to not grant rights . <p> One note : when adding security tags to a user or group , they do n't kick in until you log out and log in . So if you add a security tag to a user and a folder at the same time the folder will immediately hide itself from a user and wo n't be visible until they log back in ! So when you do this you might consider adding the tags to everyone first , then let your users know to log out ( or wait a day ) before starting to add that tag to your root folders . <p> 2nd note : I know I mentioned this above , but do n't forget to add your workflow , quick fields , forms , import agent and admins to your security tag too ! I used to be the primary person at the VAR I work for and this was a very common call I would receive after changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and add these users to it and always add all security groups to it . All of the services log in/out with each run so you do n't need to reboot or anything for the tags to take effect .

Each loan application requires multiple steps performed by geographically dispersed employees , which in the past made the process cumbersome and time consuming . Here is how Laserfiche Workflow simplifies the loan application process . <h> The legacy process <p> After the customer filled out a new loan application at any of the banks branches , the customer service representative , known as the private banker , mailed the application and all related documents ( e.g. , tax returns ) to the loan processing department . The loan package was then mailed back and forth between various departments until the loan was underwritten , approved and funded . The loan package , which could take up as much as two reams of paper , was archived in a file cabinet . <h> The current process <p> With Laserfiche , the private banker scans the loan application and all related documents into a new customer file in the Pending Loans folder immediately after they are submitted . <p> Laserfiche Workflow automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document types in the loan packet . An email is then sent to the private banker 's assistants asking them to gather all the required documentation and scan it into the folder . <p> Once the information has been scanned , the private banker sends the loan packet to the credit manager for review by selecting " Send to Credit Manager " from a template list field . Laserfiche Workflow then creates a shortcut to the application packet in the credit managers folder . <p> The credit manager can approve the packet , deem it incomplete or decline it . If the packet is incomplete , an email notification is sent to the appropriate processor , who generates the additional information letter ( AIL ) . <p> The AIL lists all of the information still needed for the loan to be finalized ( e.g. , a copy of a title to additional properties owned by the applicant ) . The private banker is notified of the AIL and sends a copy to the applicant . The applicant brings in the additional documents and the private banker scans them into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the credit managers Laserfiche folder for additional review . If the packet is approved , the credit manager selects an underwriter . Laserfiche Workflow then creates a shortcut to the loan packet in the underwriters folder . <p> Once the loan is underwritten , it moves to the loan committee for approval and sign-off . Once the loan committee signs off on the loan , the underwriter changes the status of the packet to Approved and Laserfiche Workflow creates a shortcut in the private bankers folder . <p> The private banker notifies the applicant that the loan has been approved and prints the loan documents for the client to sign . The private banker scans the signed documents back into Laserfiche . <p> The loan is then moved forward to the credit manager for final review . If approved , it is sent back to the processor to be serviced . Once the loan is serviced , the whole packet is moved to the Loans by Number folder and a shortcut is created in the Loan by Name folder .

@@98005898 @2205898/ <h> 3 Things You Do n't Want to Hear About Your ECM Implementation <p> Your organization finally pulled the trigger and invested in enterprise content management ( ECM ) . Congratulations ! Now its time to make sure the transition goes off without a hitch and that you do n't hear these statements during or after your ECM implementation . <h> 1 . " We tried to do too much too fast . " <p> Its easy to get overly enthusiastic when you first get ECM . Its understandable . Who can resist the temptation of going gung-ho and hooking up this shiny new toy in every single department ? <p> But take it from the organization that did it right : Franklin County , PA . It rolled out its ECM system one department at a time . This gave each department time to adjust to its new processes and allowed other departments to see all the benefits of ECM . Eventually , people started seeing that they could streamline their own work with ECM and requested to be next on the implementation list . <p> A key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ECM was to select a " champion " in each department . " This person was very enthusiastic about the project and fully embraced it , " said Ed Yonker , Application Software Specialist . " The ECM champion was instrumental in obtaining buy-in from everyone else in his or her department . " <h> 2 . " We did n't  think this person had to be involved . " <p> Leaving someone out of the group is uncomfortable and awkward for everyone involved ( and in this case , uninvolved ) . Its no different when you implement ECM . <p> When it was time to implement ECM in the accounts payable ( A/P ) department , the IT department at the Florida League of Cities collaborated with A/P representatives every step of the way to truly understand what their department needed . <p> In fact , the IT department did this with each department in the organization to build a truly enterprise system . " Once IT learned the business , we were able to see the complex overlapping data relationships between the various departments , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We got a bit ahead of ourselves . " <p> Many people who have gone through the ECM implementation process strongly encourage doing as much planning as possible . <p> John Barrangan , COO of Girard Securities , said his team took three to four days to whiteboard each of the companys processes before the firms IT department even touched the new ECM software . Extensively " whiteboarding " every process was helpful for many reasons : <p> It allowed Girard to audit and streamline its processes before optimizing the ECM implementation . <p> With the entire team in the room , everyone was able to see how every role contributed to each process . <p> Everyone involved had a chance to provide input on how to make the process better and to officially agree on how things would work . <p> When it came time to implement , Girards IT department knew exactly how to build the approved workflows for each of the processes . <p> Implementing ECM definitely requires some legwork .

If we delete and Re-create the user account , then it reflects all the info that was previously missing . See below images : <p> Original Account : <p> The Same profile after Deletion and then re-creation of the account : <p> Due to the number of users that is effected by this behaviour I would like to know if there is a easier way to get LFDS to somehow be refreshed in order to update all the profile data for the effected users , without the need to Delete and re-create the account . <h> Replies <p> thank you for the reply but that is not the behaviour we are seeing . The accounts that have none of the profile attributes , have been on LFDS since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago and some are as new as 8 months ago . <p> Granted majority of the users are only logging into the repository , but the i past weekend we did a migration of our Forms server to use LFDS Authentication . If your theory is correct , then all the effected user 's profiles should have updated yesterday when they logged in for the first time via LFDS to access the forms server , but they did not . Because of the information being missing , it caused problems in their processes and this is when I came to the conclusion that Deleting their account and then re-creating solves the problem . <p> What feedback are you waiting on ? I had supplied feedback already on my findings 2 weeks ago and have not heard back since . <p> the one part of the suggestion you mention above about having a user log in via Web access however was not given through to me , so I 'll see if I can get that done and see if there is any change in the user properties . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users , I did not have a user that I could test with . So in order to test and see if Signing in with Forms , after the update to LFDS , would solve the issue I took an affected profile , granted them access to Forms , and asked the user to sign in . This then successfully updated specific User Profile details on LFDS . So for any user having the problem , once the Update to LFDS is done , the Form sign in fixes their details . <p> My problem however is now that the profiles that still remain affected , are not Forms users .

It would although require the " SDK Script " activity as this is not native to workflow . Not sure why , maybe this is something you could request as a new feature . As for the OCR part , this could also be achieved using the " SDK Script " , but not recommended . Longer running processes such as OCR are better suited for dedicated services such as Quick Fields Agent , LDCC , even third party apps using the SDK . If you are interested in some code for the Page Rotation , let me know . <p> Chris is correct ; You do not need the SDK to use the SDK Script activity in Workflow . If you were going to build some type of integration outside of Workflow then you would need to purchase the SDK . The only additional advantage that the SDK would provide in this case would be documentation and example code snippets . <p> To your DCC question - DCC does not require a separate license for Laserfiche Avante or Rio customers . It performs image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , similar to what the Laserfiche Client supports . That said , DCC still requires an imaged document to perform OCR on , like the Client . Without a text stream , your best option is to use native PDF page generation to generate an image ( and OCR it ) of the PDF .

I checked to see if there were any files left through the admin console however when I checked the physical location of where the older volume was stored there were still documents within this folder . I was wondering if it would be fine to delete this folder given that Laserfiche can not detect the files anymore . I was wondering if this is normal or not ? <h> Replies <p> You may want to run the volume consistency checker to find out what those files are . Perhaps they are associated with files that may have been in the recycle bin . Or maybe they are linked to files that the user did n't have rights to so when they migrated documents from one volume to another , not all documents were actually migrated . <p> In general though , migrating documents from one volume to another should n't leave them in the original volume .

I will run the volume consistency checker . Is it suggested to run this on the volume it was transferred to or the volume that it was transferred from ? <p> Please explain in more detail what 's being done and what 's being seen . Are they trying to migrate every document from one volume to another ? If so , what 's the process being done ? Are they just doing a search for all documents in one volume , then selecting all those documents and choosing to migrate them to a new volume ? <p> Also , when you say one set of volumes did not transfer over completely , do you mean that the process was interrupted somehow so out of all the documents that were selected to be migrated from one volume to another , only some got migrated while the rest still remain in the original volume ? Or are you saying that the Laserfiche Server indicates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's not the case when looking at the physical files in the volume location ? <p> If you can provide the exact context of what 's being done and what 's being seen , then a more detailed suggestion can be provided . <p> The initial problem for the customer was that they had multiple physical volumes that needed to be migrated to logical volumes . The reason for this is that they would receive a message stating the volume was out of space . In order to migrate from the physical volumes to the logical volumes I first created the logical volume . I then went into the Laserfiche client and searched based on the physical volume and highlighted all documents then went to task and migrate entries . I migrated the entries to the logical volumes . There were no interruptions that I know of and there had been nothing recorded in the event viewer . Within the admin console it had read that there were no pages or data for the volume that was migrated from . <p> I did do a search within the volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with exactly 0 kb . There were no results returned . I will run the volume consistency checker to make sure I did n't miss anything . I will update the results once this has been completed . <p> I can see that the described situation happens within Laserfiche on some occasions , I ca n't figure out when . <p> Some documents are migrated properly and I can see them on the destination volume , but some of the tiff files from some of the migrated documents remain duplicated on both , the destination and the original physical path . <p> Meaning that during the migration process Laserfiche succesfully migrated the documents to the destination Volume but failed to deleted the files from the original physical path .

When you use Quick Print , it should open the file in another tab which will allow you to print it from there . You can find more information regarding printing in Web Access here . <h> Replies <p> None of our users have the export permission , so they are unable to print . I guess we will have to stick with the Laserfiche Client for now .

The Web Access server can deliver content to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that content was ever sent to a printer . <p> This is definitely something that we will have to look into more as we continue to develop our web applications . <p> Sure . Unless you can limit the scope of what can be exported ( which may exist that I am not aware of ) , the worry is that it is very easy for a user to export portions or entire volumes of records with ease , where printing would be too cumbersome to tempt record theft . <p> Am I correct in my thinking that if a user can export one document to print , they can export a whole volume ? There is n't any way to limit a user to exporting only documents , not folders that I am missing , is there ? <p> The entry access rights configured for the user in question handle this aspect . Do you mean that there exists a scenario where a user is allowed to read an entry , but you want to prevent that user from being able to export it , while there would exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to export ? <p> It seems that your main concern is more with access rights than the export feature right . Access rights determine which entries a user has access to so you 'll want to make sure that is configured properly first . That way users can only export documents they have access to . <p> This goes back to my previous question regarding possible medical records that users are supposed to be able to access , but you do n't want them to be able to export them , while also having another set of medical records they can access as well as be allowed to export ? <p> My first suggestion would be to review this help page regarding configuring security and access rights in Web Access .

We need to be able to pull that info from the database into a second form for updating/editing . Is there any way to populate any form of multiple choice option using the data that started as a form checkbox and stored/retrieved from a SQL database using a stored procedure ? <h> Answer 9784 @qwx869784 <p> replied on October 11 , 2014 <p> Okay so this this is what I have put together and seems to work in my small test environment . I will be adapting it to the full evaluation form over the course of the next couple days . Uses the CSS types of filledfield and dropdown as listed by Kenneth above and uses a change field trigger on the employee I 'd field that is filled by the initial stored procedure so that all the other single line " filledfield " s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have Yes-No , A-B-C , A-B-C-D-E , and A-B-C-D-E-F-G questions through out the form that have the " dropdown " . I hope this helps others that need this type of solution . I have chosen to use radio buttons to keep from having extra code to limit the number of checkboxes that can be clicked at a time . We are looking for a single response from these questions that allow us to change values as needed with out having the client choose every question over to update the database . <p> Can you explain to us why the need for the multiple almost identical functions ? I would use the last one for all of them . It should always work without a problem . If the field is only able to be 1 of two options , then it does n't  need to worry about the next item in the case anyways . <p> If you need multiple checkboxes to be able to be selected , I would recommend filling the hidden field with all the values , separated by some unique value . Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split function on the string and you will be able to select all your options . <p> I actually realized I over complicated things , which happens a lot when you deal with stuff like this . You would n't need to format the text , just go ahead and loop through all the auto-suggestions , similar to how it is done here : <p> I subtracted ' 1 ' from the values in the suggestion to be able to adjust for how Javascript references the field . You can remove it if you start at zero for the suggestions . <p> I put in the suggestions " 1 " and " 3 " and got this output : <p> You will need to adjust the number in " Field2- " part to be whatever field it is you are using . Also , you will need this to be a function since it will need to trigger after the lookup is performed . Can you post some sort of screenshot or inform me the field number/CSS Class of the field that would cause the lookup to occur ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checkbox is , I can help iwth that as well . You will need to apply a CSS class like I did to the hidden field for it to find and go through all the values <p> If I am correct , you want to take a checkbox field and use it 's selected options in a SQL Query/lookup so that in the next form step that certain information is populated from that information to other fields ? <p> To do this , we need to understand how each option effects the query . Say , if you want it to be if the checkbox is enabled for option 1 , then 1 lookup occurs , but for each subsequent checkbox that is selected , a second lookup is performed that updates other fields . <p> The other option is each option selected effects the overall lookup and you set up only one lookup to occur . <p> Either way , we will need the use of a hidden field ( or 5 if you choose the first option I mentioned ) and use javascript to take the selected items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are selected . Then , in the second form , we would use javascript to trigger the lookup when the form is loaded , giving you the result you wanted . <p> Let me know which functionality you are looking for so that I can give you a hand in getting started . <p> Kenneth , I am looking to take a value from a stored procedure into a single text box and then use the content of that text box ( Value 1-5 but a single value ) to select a check box in the form . I have tried to get your first example to work as seen in the attached photo but am failing miserably . Did I mention I have no understanding of Java and the data guy in me says it 's just another variable why is this functionality not built into the system ... <p> So if you can point out where I have messed up your code it would be great . <p> Also , in line 3 , you need to keep it how I recommended in the field place : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . val() ; <p> Otherwise it is not getting the value from the field . <p> Last thing , you will need a value in that field , so set a default value for it as a test , or add a field that would represent the field that causes the lookup , at which point , you will want to assign that field a CSS Class name like " TriggerField " and then you would need to change the code to the below code snippet : <p> Okay so now I have this working in a controlled test form , but when I try to populate the filled fields with a view based off an the entry of an employee number it does nothing . Is there a way to postpone the execution of the java until after a field is entered ? <p> try adding the following right under the line that starts with " function " <p> alert ( 'test ' ) ; <p> If this runs then at least we know that the code is starting but it may not be working properly .

Form is still with Manager A , the switch has taken place and process updated . Will it move onward to the new Manager B once Manager A completes his task ? <p> 2 . Form is currently assigned to the old Manager B. The process is updated , will the form update be in the new Manager Bs queue or still with the old Manager B ? <p> 3 . Is there an easy way to transition if something like this happens with forms that are in process , or must the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update the workflows in process with a new published workflow , is there something like that for Forms ? <p> I am asking as the client has requested that I contact you for an officially approved best practice or method for handling this . <h> Answer 9782 @qwx869782 <p> replied on February 12 , 2014 <p> You can do this two ways , either in Forms or in Workflow . With Forms , to update the form to route to the new manager B , all you have to do is change the task participant in the user task in the Forms designer . This will not update existing processes however . To anticipate this change , you could add an Intermediate Timer Event to the process . If you attach an Intermediate Timer Event to your user task , you can specify that if a certain amount of time passes , send the approval to another user , say the original users supervisor . Again , this would not update existing processes with manager B , but at least ensures old processes will not be forgotten . <p> Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of the routing process . In this case , have Forms deposit the form into your repository , and then let Workflow pick it up from there . Like you said , with Workflow you can update existing workflows when re-publishing . This way , any processes that have not yet been routed to the previous manager B , will be routed to the new manager B. To simplify the process of changing users from the old manager to the new one , I would suggest using either the Find User , or Business Process Step activities . These activities can be placed at the beginning of the workflow , and create tokens for a specific user . Since all subsequent activities can point to these tokens instead of the actual user , if you have to change users , you only have to make changes to one activity . <p> Would it not be possible to use the Intermediate Timer Event in a different way ? Say , that if the timer triggers , that it sends out a webhook that is designed to give back a token @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have that back , you can assign the task to that manager that should be assigned to the task . <p> In this way , you would be creating more URL 's to user tasks even when the user is the same , but you can use the web service to make sure if a manager changes , that it gets redirected shortly after the change is made . <p> The thing about more URL 's being created is not a huge concern to most , at least on a users end because if they forgot about the task and are unable to save an incomplete version , then that means they likely wo n't care if they need to use a new URL to get to the task . <p> Could you also build this into your process ? For instance , add a " Re-route To : " field at the bottom of your form . If the field is empty , it goes down the regular path . If the field is not empty , it 's re-routed to the user in that field ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would work and the overhead would be minimal . Of course , you 'd have to put a condition in at every location that might be affected . ... Just a thought .

This is the end result of my current script , which is also pasted below . As you can see , the first row did not perform the lookup as expected . I was able to select from the list , which then triggered my script . You can not see very easily on the screenshot , but the entire Stock Code drop down list is now disabled for the first row after the script runs . If I add some rows , then those rows perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabled at all . Clearly , something is n't right with my script and I could use some help getting it to work . <h> Replies <p> There are a variety of issues with the code you found on StackOverflow . Put simply , it 's designed for static tables where the entire table gets generated on the server and then is served to the client , whereas Laserfiche Forms has dynamic tables where users can add more rows to the table . Every row that is added gets a " fresh " dropdown field , whose values will not be initially disabled like you would want it to . <p> This is also why the code you have works only for the first row . When you do : <p> $ ( ' select ' ) . change() <p> The change event handler gets attached only to the dropdown fields that are currently on the form . New dropdown fields , i.e. those added by the user , do n't get the event handler attached . <p> JQuery provides a mechanism to attach event handlers to dynamic elements using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handler to a static parent element . For example , if your table i 'd is q5 , you can do this : <p> $ ( ' #q5 ' ) . on ( 'change ' , ' select ' , function() ... ) ; <p> Since the table itself is static , it delegates the event to its children elements , even if those elements are added dynamically . <p> The reason your entire dropdown field is getting disabled is because of this line : <p> tr.find ( ' . stockCode option ' ) . attr ( " disabled " , " " ) ; <p> If you want to enable a field , you need to explicitly set the disabled attribute to false : <p> tr.find ( ' . stockCode option ' ) . attr ( " disabled " , " false " ) ; <p> Lastly , the reason your lookup does n't work is because , as per W3C 's HTML form specification , disabled fields do n't get their values submitted . This prevents lookups from being performed . There are various workarounds for this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short ( i.e. 10 ms ) delay before disabling the field : <p> This copies the selected value in the dropdown to another field to the new field you just created . Note that it has to be a single line field in this case ( but it 's not too difficult to make it work with a dropdown field if you need that ) . <p> After that , create a second form and use field variables to make it look identical to the first form . <p> Now , on the first form you 'll hide the hiddenStockCode field and it 's column : <p> . hiddenStockCode display : none ; #q3 display : none ; <p> q3 is the hidden stock code column 's i 'd on my form . Yours may be different . <p> On the second form , you 'll hide the original stock code field and its column : <p> . stockCode display : none ; #q1 display : none ; <p> What 's happening here is that when the user selects a stock code , we 're copying the value to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection . When the submitted form is opened ( either as a user task , or when stored in the repository ) , the hidden form is now displayed , but the dropdown is hidden . <p> This serves the purpose of disabling dropdown items while still allowing their values to be submitted . <p> I believe your solution will work , however , I 'm using this data that was submitted to save into a SQL database , and this will obviously require changes to my WF design . I can do that . <p> Another challenge is that the users are currently able to make changes to the stock codes that were submitted , so there are lookup rules that are designed for the other forms that use the same data . " Disabling " or preventing this functionality would change the way the users currently work and I would like to try and avoid that if possible . <p> I 'm attempting to do this as well , but not getting success in exporting the value to Laserfiche .

@@98005949 @2205949/ <h> Moving files to the second volume - Is it done automatically or manually ? <p> I want to know if the second volume will automatically be taking over when the first one is filled up or it should be done manually . Also , is there a limit on remaining free space on the first volume that we should kept prior to moving to the second volume ? <p> The customer has two logical volumes namely VOLUME0 and VOLUME1 which are on an application server . How will the rollover to VOLUME1 be done ? Note that the default volume has only 40GB free space left . Thanks to advise . <p> I 'm still unclear if they are the SAME logical volume or two different ones . If they are logical children of the same parent volume , the rollover will happen automatically when the first volume reaches the provided size limit ( or at the specified time period , if it 's set up that way ) . The user would n't need to do anything and both would appear as the same volume to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they are different volumes , there is no inherent rollover between them . <p> Regardless , changing the path ( or any of the properties ) of the parent logical volume will impact the defaults when the next rollover child is created . So if you wanted to ensure that the next volume will be on a different location , you can change the path now and it will be created there . Of course , if it 's the physical volume , it will actually try to move the existing documents there right now , so make sure you 're setting it on the logical parent . <p> We have two separate volumes , each volume is on a different Windows drive . Since the user is having a hard disk space issue on the first volume ( i.e. 40 GB of hard-disk space is left on the Windows drive holding the first volume ) . <p> Do you mean that for different volumes ( i.e. the current configuration of volumes set at user 's place ) , the user will have to map the path of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admin Console and change the default volume to the second volume from the Repositories node in LF Client ? Will the users be able to access the documents found in the VOLUME0 volume in LF Client and will the files be read-only ? <p> Please clarify as it seems to me that the volume rollover is not being automatically done as it is a hard-disk space limitation . <p> Please refer to attached screenshot . In case that the size of the first volume ( i.e . VOLUME0 ) has reached its 20480 MB and the rollover schedule was selected , all new files uploaded to Laserfiche Client will just get rolled over to a new sub-physical volume folders WITHIN the same logical VOLUME0 volume and it will never move to VOLUME1 . For instance , new files will move in VOLUME001 and after a time schedule set up , new files will move in VOLUME002 etc .

The user has the option to select between three different kinds of forms , an Automatic Loan Payment , Automatic Share Transfer , or Automatic Mortgage Payment . After one is selected , it loads unique information pertaining to those types of transfers , such as disclosures unique to each type .

I 've tried rearranging the options and had the same result . For example , initially Mortgage Payment was the third option , and I switched the Share Transfer to be the third , with the same results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third option , only making the first two options work , then the universal fields display like they should .

Will it just be a matter of installing the Directory Services , creating a Master License , generating a Server license and re-activating the original server ( with the new key ) ? <h> Replies <p> Rio does not give you individual product keys anymore , just a single one for the master license . As Bert mentioned , you use that to generate the master license for Directory Service . Then register the Laserfiche Server in Directory Service , download the license , replace it in the server 's install directory and restart the service . Any other products like Web Access and Quick Fields will also need to be registered and have their licenses updated .

Or is the Forms portal add-on ONLY for initial submission by anonymous ( public ) users ? <p> An example is where our client is on boarding a new account and part of the process involves gathering information from their customers IT dept . They would like , as part of the on boarding process , to shoot the customer IT dept an email with a IT questionnaire form pre-filled with variables from the new account form . Their customer completes the IT questionnaire and submits which then allows our clients process to continue . In this case , our client 's customer does not have a Laserfiche login . <h> Replies <p> You are correct in that Forms Public Portal is really just for Anonymous Submission only . What you can look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the first form into a DB table , generate a Ticket number which is then emailed back to the original submitter , and have them enter that into the next form they are to complete and have lookups populate the information based on the Ticket Number . If you do n't want to have the lookup completed on the initial submission you can have it happen when the form is assigned to the reviewer so that information was not placed in a public environment . <p> Thanks Steve . What you have outlined would n't resolve this particular issue in that the initial submitter whom is a Laserfiche user does not submit the later form which is the third form in this specific process . <p> While the customer could just send a link to the blank public form to its client , it would be great if this was populated with some of the client header information so the form is partially filled out . This is straightforward for a participant user or full user obviously so the right question is whether or not a public user can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them or can a public user only initiate a new blank form ? <p> Thinking of another approach , would be to build the URL string to include the field data to be filled in so when they clicked on the link it would launch a blank form and then fill in the fields from the URL string . An example of this can be found in LF Connector App 10 where it can Launch a website and prepopulate the fields this way .

@@98005980 @2205980/ <h> Question <h> Question <h> Using the Admin Account To Log Into Forms <p> For years the Admin account has been used to administer Laserfiche using a limited built-in license so that you : <p> Can get into Laserfiche if all other accounts had their access removed . <p> Do n't necessarily have to buy a license for system admins who are administering Laserfiche but not using it . <p> While this works fine for Laserfiche , it is causing some issues in Forms as there appears to be no way to log into Forms 10 with the admin account if it does not also have a " read/write " license associated with it . As Forms carries the sames administrative issues &amp; emergencies , why is this same admin license not applied to Forms ? <p> The special status of the built-in ADMIN user is due to how the Laserfiche server interprets the login for security . However , Forms maintains its own " list of users " for assigning security , etc , because it has its own security considerations to worry about and really does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially moot if Forms is configured to use LFDS authentication where there is no repository to base any existing security on . <p> For either Laserfiche repository or LFDS authentication with Forms , login access is provided to all users with either a read/write named user license or an authenticated Participant license . ( Upon synchronization with the corresponding User Authentication source , that is . ) If using Laserfiche repository authentication and the built-in ADMIN user has not been assigned a read/write named user license , then it is ineligible for login to Forms . <p> In the Forms Configuration page in the User Authentication tab , you will specify one account meeting this licensing criterion to serve as the initial " System Administrator " which you use to set up system security , etc . For LFDS authentication , there is the additional criterion that the user must belong to a whitelisted LFDS group . For Laserfiche repository authentication , there is actually the additional requirement that this user have the Manage Trustees privilege . This can be thought of as the Forms analogue of the ADMIN user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that still requires a license to access Forms . The beauty of the ADMIN account is that a customer could use all of their licenses for end users and the ADMIN account could be used for emergency access . As it stands now , if this were to happen they would have to take a license away from a user so that an emergency account could get into Forms . It would be nice to see Forms have an " ADMIN " account not tied to any repository that could be used for the same purpose . Emergencies happen and up until Forms , Laserfiche had been good at providing an emergency access account . <p> No , a licensed account is required to log into Forms to manually sync users , administer data sources , admin Teams , research stuck instances , and many of the other non-forms **29;1904;TOOLONG activities that an admin might need to be able to do . How can these tasks be accomplished without a licensed account ? <p> You can review this help page where under the " Laserfiche Repository Users " section , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time it logs in to the server . When Laserfiche Forms successfully connects to the Laserfiche Server , it will activate the special FormsUser$ account , which it will use when connecting to the Laserfiche Server in the future . Once this occurs , Forms will no longer use the account you specified to connect to the Laserfiche Server . <p> Beau , Forms does not have the concept of administrative privileges separate from being a " participant " in processes . All administrative rights come on top of being allowed to participate in processes . The actions you 're describing are part of being a Forms user . And being a Forms user requires that you are a named user . <p> Using your logic then their is no point for the ADMIN account in the repositories as everything it does falls into the actions of being a " licensed administrator " and thus that account should not exist either . I understand how it works but obviously from the other responses received , I am not alone in being used to administering the Laserfiche environment via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Forms and I am increasingly seeing it as customers have been designed &amp; trained to handle their environment one way over the past 20+ years and Forms does not follow in the same logic . It would be nice to see consistency where an " ADMIN " account with limited abilities so it is not used as a license ( just like the admin account for the repositories ) is available for emergency situations . I understand that is not likely to happen but myself , as well as a few other people who have responded to this ( and I 'd wager even more who have not ) , would like to point out this issue we are facing .

At first the scanner driver was setup for blank page removal by default , and it took some looking to find out how to turn it off .

I have the default scanner software running . I do this by clicking the red check box icon in the scan window and select the radio button . <p> I do n't believe that when selecting the drop downs within the Laserfiche scan client window that it automatically selects the profile .

Sometimes when you update or re-install office product , the add-on gets disabled . In order to enable it , you have to find your version 's settings for Add-Ins where you can see all the active and inactive add-ins . Generally the setting can be found under File menu &gt; options . You should see Laserfiche Excel Add-in in the inactive category . Once you enable it , you should be able to use the Ribbon Tab for Laserfiche . <p> Having similar issue with Outlook 2013 and LF 9 . I can not get the LF tab to stay loaded in Outlook . Every time I exit Outlook and go back in again , the Laserfiche add-ins are Inactive . I can do Susan Rayshell 's steps above and enable the add-ins again , but they will only be active for that Outlook session . It may have something to do with Outlook not liking the add-in because it did come up one time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it disabled them . But , I have not seen that message since enabling them again . I 've tried uninstalling the LF Office integration completely and adding it back in , but that did n't help . Maybe this is more of an Outlook add-in question . I 'll search on that see what I get , but in the meantime , I 'm open to suggestions . Thanks - Gary . <p> This is what seems to be working for me in Outlook . I 'll tell you the easy way first , then I 'll provide details below of what I think the easy way actually does . <p> In Outlook , click on File . On the right side , if an Add-in has been disabled , it will have a large button you can click on to manage add-ins . It may be there all the time too , but if Outlook has already disabled an add-in , it will be more noticable . <p> If you click that button , you will see the list of Add-ins that have been disabled . This usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the application unstable , causing it to have crashed multiple times before . <p> Find the add-in you want to enable , such as Laserfiche Outlook(2013) Add-in , and click the Enable this add-in button . The version of LF varies , so yours may say ( 2007 ) or ( 2003 ) , etc ... <p> Once you 've enabled the add-ins you want , click Close . Then click the Back arrow to return to Outlook . You should immediately be able to see the Laserfiche tab . <p> So , in doing these steps above , I think what it is doing behind the scenes is creating these registry entries below . This is the way you can manually do it . Please be sure you know how to use the registry editor because one wrong change could disable your whole computer ! Make sure you do a backup of the registry first before making any changes . <p> To add the registry entries manually , to keep the Laserfiche add-ins always enabled do the following below . <p> Press the Windows key + R to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and press Enter <p> Navigate to LONG ... ( Note : You may have to create the DoNotDisableAddinList key if it does n't exist ) <p> Now in the right pane , add the following dword keys and set the value to 1 for each : <p> To set the value to 1 , double-click the key once it 's created and type in 1 for the value and click OK . Do that for each one .

@@98005995 @2205995/ <p> And in that post there is a reply by @referring to hotfix # 1013831 , which I installed ( and the install appeared successful , Windows now shows version 10.2.0.789 ) . But I 'm still experiencing the issue . <h> Replies <p> EDITED : I read too quickly and see that you already installed the hotfix I first suggested . Apologies , I do n't know what the cause would be beyond that . You may have to download and send a copy of the form in question to support for further diagnosis . <p> In order to test this further , I made a copy of my form to use for testing , and routed the user task to that form instead . Then I made a small change to confirm that when I opened the form from my inbox , it pulled up the new test form instead of the original version . <p> Then I started systematically removing parts of the form and testing to see if the error went away . <p> I deleted all my CSS , my Javascript , the Lookup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I went through and removed all my fields ( a couple at a time ) and testing in between , and the error persisted . I am now to the point that the form is blank , all that exists is the built-in comment field , and the approve button . And I 'm still getting the error ! The only thing left on my form is the variables , which I ca n't delete since that would break my real version of the form . <p> I 've already confirmed that none of my variables are unnamed ( I had that issue once before ) , and as I mentioned , the form does progress from User Task 1 on to User Task 2 , just not from User Task 2 on to User Task 3 . <p> I do n't think it 's my actual form causing the issue , since I deleted the entire form and still had the issue . So I 'm down to : 1 . An issue with my process , but I do n't see one . 2 . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , and it works the first time . 3 . A system bug of some sort . <p> Providing a copy of my process to our VAR was not going to be a very easy option , it 's pretty complex with Workflows , and connections to multiple databases . So I tried replicating the error with a simpler process , and was able to do so . <p> Here 's the steps I took : <p> I made a Process Called " Error Testing " . The process had one form , named Test , with no fields , no lookups , no CSS , and no Javascript . The Process Disagram consisted of 5 steps : 1 . Start Event 2 . User Task - using the Test form , including the Submit button , and Assigning to my own user - all other values are at default settings . 3 . User Task ( 2 ) - using the Test form , including the Submit button , and Assigning to my own user - all other values are at default settings . 4 . User Task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Submit button , and Assigning to my own user - all other values are at default settings . 5 . End Event <p> Then I created a Workflow that consisted of one sole task , calling " Invoke Business Process " and loading the " Error Testing " Form Process . <p> I ran the Workflow : 1 . The Form " User Task " was created and placed in my Inbox. 2 . I opened that form and clicked Submit , which worked . 3 . The Form " User Task ( 2 ) " was created and placed in my Inbox. 4 . I opened that form and clicked Submit , and then I got the same error I was getting in my complex process . <p> I can provide our VAR with this process and Workflow if that is still the best course of action , but perhaps this information is sufficient for someone to replicate the issue ? <p> Since 10.2 , I 've noticed that occasionally my Javascripts completely stopped working in testing . Upon sectioning out different parts of my code to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find was that it did n't seem to like my very last line of code , but I could n't see any syntax errors . I do n't know what it did n't like about it ( thought I suspect it is the fact that I usually put a comment after closing brackets to indicate what section of code is being closed , and I wonder if it does n't like ending with a comment ) . To work around this , I added a an extra line break at the end of my code , so that the very last line was completely blank , then my Javascript worked again . I was planning to report the issue here on Laserfiche Answers so that support was aware of it , but had n't gotten around to it yet . <p> Anyway , I have no idea if these two issues are related or not . In fact , the simple use case I provided here to recreate the issue had no Javascripts at all , so I was not thinking they were related ... But I was dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen either issue for several week , so I wonder ... <p> Why do n't you try adding an extra line break to the end of your Javascripts on each form in your BP and see if perhaps the issue goes away ? It would n't hurt ... <p> Hi Matthew , it is a known issue for 10.2 that if the last line of your JavaScript is a comment , then the JavaScript will not work . This is a side effect for the performance improvement of load form in 10.2 . We have fixed this in the coming service pack .

That 's why Laserfiche Workflow has been designed to generate invoices , purchase orders , balance sheets and many other list-formatted documents . <p> In Laserfiche 9.2 and prior releases , Workflows " Fill out PDF Form " activity was used to generate documents with line items , but the activity was limited by the number of line items in a fillable PDF . <p> In Laserfiche 10 , Workflow is equipped with an " Update Word Document " activity that enables users to automatically generate dynamic line-item documents in a Microsoft Word document . <p> This article will focus on creating an invoice template in Microsoft Word and using the " Update Word Document " activity to process merge fields and dynamically insert line items . <p> Adding Merge Fields <p> Merge fields are used as placeholders for invoice information and can be added to a Word document by : <p> Clicking the " Insert " tab <p> Selecting " Quick Parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " option <p> Selecting " MergeField " from the list of field names in the field dialog box and filling in the field name under the Field Properties section <p> Leaving the other MergeField options at their default values <p> In the Field dialogue box , select " MergeField " from the list of field names , and fill in the field name under the Field Properties section : <p> After clicking " OK , " a merge field will be placed in the Word document where the cursor is located . These fields will be used as placeholders for Workflow to fill with information . <p> Creating an Invoice Template <p> Now that the instructions on how to use merge fields have been covered , here is how to create an invoice template in Microsoft Word . <p> Each page of the invoice should have identifying information about the document . For instance , a user may want the following items at the top of every page ( see the image below for an example ) : <p> Company logo <p> Document type <p> The customers billing address <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company logo , document type , customer billing address , invoice number and column headers . <p> The following steps allow users to create an invoice header with these parameters : <p> Place merge fields in the appropriate areas for first name , last name , address and invoice number . <p> Add a table row in the body of the document , which will be repeated for every line item . <p> Fill each column with a merge field that corresponds to item number , description and all other relevant parameters . Users only need to create one table row , as Workflow will target this table and add rows for multiple line items as needed . <p> This table must be named so that Workflow can find it in the Word document . In this example , it will be named " MyTable " by adding the following merge fields : <p> In the far-left cell of this row , insert a merge field to the left of the item number field , and name it " TableStart:MyTable . " This denotes the beginning of the tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merge field named " TableEnd:MyTable " to the right of the line total field . This denotes the end of the row . <p> The " Email " activity emails the completed invoice to the appropriate party . <p> Configuring the " Update Word Document " Activity <p> In the properties pane , choose " Server Attachment " as the source . Server attachments are electronic documents attached to the current Workflow server and are available to any Workflow designer using the same server . For more information on attaching files to a workflow server , click here . <p> Next , tell the activity what merge fields to look for and what values to replace them with . <p> Click the " New " button , and select the " Simple Field Merge " type . This type is for replacing a merge field with a single-value token from Workflow . <p> Click " Import Field Names from Document " and assign the Word templates tokens to each merge field that is NOT in " MyTable . " <p> Since there might be an empty " Address Line 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Remove unused fields " boxes so that the invoice wont show an empty space . <p> For the line items , a different modification type is required . In the " Update Word Document " activitys Properties pane , click " New " again and select " Table Field Merge " from the type drop-down list . This setting is used when the user wants a Mail Merge region to expand based on the number of values in a multi-value token . For instance , if the " Query Data " activity returns twenty values , then the region named " MyTable " would expand to fit all twenty values . <p> Click " Select " under Source Data File , and choose the line-item values that were retrieved with the " Query Data " activity <p> The " Merge Region Name " is " MyTable , " the name of the line-item table in the Invoice template . <p> Click " Import field names from document " , and assign the " Query Data " tokens to each MergeField inside the " MyTable " rows . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicking the advanced properties of the " Update Word Document " activity and checking the " Convert to PDF " box . Users can see how the document turned out by attaching the resulting file to an email . <p> Laserfiche 10 includes many new features and enhancements that allow users to work in the repository with greater ease and efficiency . Workflows " Update Word Document " activity is a powerful tool for generating dynamic content , including line-item documents , personalized letters , agendas , permits or forms . With the use of Mail Merge formatting , Laserfiche users can generate any document type that can be made using token substitutions . <p> Readers are encouraged to comment on this post with any questions or comments about this topic . <p> Is it possible to dynamically create table columns as well ( only a single row ) ? For example : <p> Field1 Field2 Field3 Field4 Value1 Value2 Value3 Value4 <p> The use case in which this would be useful is if not all of the fields have a value . So , in some instances , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value ) and at other times , I may only need to display 4 columns and their values .

Each section under &lt;events&gt; can have a separate set of fields to populate . In each subsection , you 'll want to add a &lt;fieldvalue&gt; element for each field you want to fill . Each element will look like this : <p> &lt;fieldvalue LONG ... <p> The TokenToFillWith part in there can either be static information ( like " envelope signed " ) , or you can use information from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be referenced using : <p> I still can not get these fields to map correctly , I will attach my config.xml file here in case someone can see what is wrong . The Docusign integration works until I add in the custom fields .

I have uploaded the current config file for Docusign / Laserfiche integration . Can anyone see what is wrong ? I 'm trying to set a custom field for the " On Signed " event . <p> Looking at the envelope data you provided , there are n't any CustomFields in there . I 'm guessing , though , that what you want is to map a tab , which your envelope does have some of . Per the KB article , you should try <p> % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( those being the two most relevant tab labels in the envelope you provided ) . <p> It seems like there might be confusion around what a " custom field " is . DocuSign terminology for signature tabs/tags/fields has changed a lot since the initial release of the DocuSign integration , so it is difficult to keep our documentation in line with their terminology . I will file a request to have it updated to the current DocuSign terminology . <p> For clarification : at the time of release , the term " custom fields " referred exclusively to what is now called " Envelope Custom Fields " . I do n't recall what exact terminology was in use for what is now called Custom Fields , but I believe they had just changed from Signature Tabs to calling them Signature Tags .

After upgrading our LFDS located on another server , we performed an upgrade of the LF server to version 10 . After the upgrade , the Admin Console 10 would not allow access using Windows Authentication . <p> It will allow the Admin account to sign in and I can see all users in our repository . I added my name as a repository user and it logged in fine . The problem it seems is with resolving the login using windows authentication . <p> I tried regenerating the licenses and synchronizing our active directory , but it will not allow any windows users to connect . Any thoughts ? THis is the message when I try to sign on using windows authentication . <h> Answer <p> Laserfiche Directory Server 10 Update 1 just released and fixed the variety of issues causing this .

But if you have the same other symptoms while in an Avante environment , then it is a different issue as our findings deal strictly with LFDS . <p> Windows users can not log in through the desktop Client or Web Access on any machine through either the Windows authentication check box or through manually entering credentials , while Laserfiche repository named users are unaffected and can log in with no issue .

After looking at several cases , it seems that this has only been the case for one customer so far ; tellingly though , they were able to switch back to the original user afterward . As of this post we are unsure why this was the case , and so it may or may not work for this workaround . <p> Supplying Windows credentials manually ( i.e. with the " Use Windows authentication " box unchecked ) , giving the username " DOMAINusername " and password returns the error , but supplying the UPN " username@domain.local " and password allows for logging in ( 140106 ) <p> This had been reported earlier in this thread , and we have recently identified this as a symptom of another separate result related to the way in which LFDS 10 queries the Active Directory . <p> Therefore unlike the other two cases , creating a brand new ( non-migrated ) licensing database will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We do have a hotfix for this ; until such time as either an update to LFDS or the hotfix itself is available through the Support site , contact your reseller to open a ticket with us so we can confirm the presence of the issue and if so , provide the fix . <p> Please do verify that the above two workarounds do not resolve the issue first ; we are likely to ask you to confirm that through the case , anyway . <p> If your behavior matches the conditions at the top of this post but none of the three cases apply or resolve the issue , then please do open a ticket with us and we can investigate . But so far each case that we 've seen has fallen into one of these three categories . <p> Thank you all again for your patience through this ordeal , and we hope that we can help get your systems back in shape and running smoothly . <p> Thank you for responding Raymond . I tried the last workaround , but that did n't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the LF Server to version 10 on another machine . <p> After the server upgrade , everything appeared to be ok . The Search DB asked to be upgraded , but I opted to run that after setting everything else up first . When trying to sign on with a full user ( any licensed user with sufficient rights ) into the Admin Console , an error 9010 was returned . Same thing when trying to use the Version 10 client . <p> The machine that was upgraded to version 10 has our repository attached . When signing on to the Admin Console 10 with the admin account , it validates fine and I can see all of the windows users/groups from before . It just wo n't let us sign on with any of them . Nothing should have changed with our active directory . <p> One thing I noticed is that the Laserfiche Directory Accounts section in the console is empty . Should that have something in there ? There is also a new section in the LFDS regarding single signon ( **33;2119;TOOLONG ) , but when I try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the LF server licensed correctly ? If you open the admin console , select the " servername " node , the right hand pane should show a summary of the licenses available . Does it show the correct number and does it show the server as licensed ? <p> Thank you . Highlighting the server instance in the console , it lists our server version and products . No # of users listed there . This is the screen shot . Would it be useful to remove the LFserver10 from the machine and reinstall ? <p> I 'm almost thinking the right fingerprint was registered . I 'm stumped . <p> Try removing one of the accounts and adding it back in the Admin console ( and/or reconfiguring the named user ) . <p> On one of the client machines , using another windows account , try logging into the client by typing in the actual " domainusername " in the username field , with their windows password in the password field . Uncheck windows authentication and see if you can login to the repository using windows credentials entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that did n't help . Also tried removing one AD user from LFDS and when I tried adding it back as a Windows user , LFDS added it back . I renewed the license and tried again . No luck . <p> Might it be the DS connection with AD ? I am running out of ideas . Thank you for all your help by the way . <p> I did regenerate licenses for the problem machine and the machine that the LFDS is running . This did give me slightly different results for the console information . So now it shows the following . This seems to be license related . Does n't look like it is getting the correct information from the LFDS ? I have n't seen " Viewer " before . <p> One thing is that we are not using SSL right now , so I am not sure if any of these connections need to be https . <p> Your screenshot indicates that LFS is unable to load the license , that the license is invalid , or that LFS can not confirm the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can think of are : <p> There is a fingerprint mismatch between the license from LFDS and the machine <p> LFS on this machine can not reach LFDS to confirm that it is licensed <p> The license file was for a different product <p> Try checking the LFS event viewer now that you have relicensed the server and see what the license error is . You could also check the LFDS event viewer in case there is an issue on the LFDS side . <p> To check ( 1 ) , you can view the hardware fingerprint in the license file and run showhwfp.exe on the LFS machine to see if they match . For easier reading of the license , I recommend using either a program like Visual Studio that can read XML well , or an online XML formatter . <p> I 'm not sure what the best way to check ( 2 ) is ; perhaps Support has some suggestions . <p> To check ( 3 ) , read the license file and see if it says Laserfiche Server . <p> I am wondering if the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can just replace the lf-licx file for the Server , or whichever application is n't working and it would fix it . I am going to keep looking at these fingerprints to see if I can spot anything . <p> Well , I have n't had much luck . Tried just about everything other than uninstalling LF products from the problem machine or , deauthorizing the licensing DB . I did remove the LF Server instance from LFDS and tried to use the activation tool instead . The key worked , but when I clicked : Activate : I received an odd message . <p> Activating using the activation tool wo n't work for LFS in a Rio situation : you only have one key , which will get you the master license . The master license can not be used for individual products . <p> At this point , it might be best to contact your reseller for further troubleshooting , and open a case with Support if necessary . <p> The error message you posted earlier implies that LFS can reach LFDS , and that LFDS did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not what LFS was expecting . I 'm not sure what could be causing this error at this point . <p> **29;2154;TOOLONG : Object reference not set to an instance of an object . at LONG ... specs , String dn ) at LONG ... database , String sidString , String identityProviderName ) at LONG ... args ) at LONG ... func , **29;2185;TOOLONG args ) <p> Thanks James . We have had several issues all surrounding either authorization and permission . Our approach was to document all service logins that were in use , audit local and database permissions , and reconfigure ownership across all servers and databases . <p> Things seem to have been working more consistently lately and I believe our errors were a result of several of the issues being discussed . It just took documenting / diagramming how applications were installed along with the connections being made . <p> For us , moving from 9.2 not using LFDS into using LFDS and then upgrading to LF10 introduced more complexity in authorization and permissions . My takeaway from it is to stay consistent and diagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the service accounts and databases . <p> We found after a few support cases that there was a bug in LFDS 9.2.1 which caused service user logins to fail . While it was fixed for LFDS 10 , upgrading from 9.2.1 to 10 does not resolve the issue , and the failed logins are a manifestation of this problem . Note that if you upgrade Laserfiche server to version 10 , but still have LFDS 9.2.1 , the same problem will occur . <p> In the meantime , a workaround is to unregister any affected applications from LFDS , generate a new license instance for the application , and download the new license file ( lf.licx ) to the appropriate directory for the application . You may need to change the LFDS and LFS service accounts to a different domain admin than currently in use , if applicable and if the above steps do not immediately resolve the issue . ( You may be able to switch back to the originally-used accounts after everything is working . ) <p> If this workaround does not work , I highly encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for helping to bring this to our attention . <p> So I have multiple Application servers and I upgraded 2 of them when LF 10 first came out and had no issues . Just this morning I upgraded another one of our servers that include the Update 1 and I ran into this issue . This is a pretty big issue at the moment because we are unable to use the regular service account that we have used for years with LF . This was a production machine and I had to do the above situation . I had to change the service account on the LF Application server and the service account on our Directory Server in order to allow for Windows Authentication to work . Is there an SCR number for this issue or has Laserfiche detected this as a bug and going to get resolved with Service Pack 1 or anything ? <p> We do plan to release a fix for LFDS , and we will post here when it is released . <p> James ' described workaround says that you should be able to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service account during the troubleshooting process . If this is not the case , you may be encountering some issue aside from the one we are already planning to fix . Did you try changing back to the initial service user ? <p> If you get errors upon changing back to your desired service user , you may wish to open a support case so that we can look into ways to address your issue . <p> I tried to change the user back to the Original user that I was using both on the LF Application server and the LFDS server , but the second I did that and restarted the services , I was not able to log in using Windows Authentication again . So I had to change those services back to my domain account so it would work again . I will wait until March for Service Pack 1 to be released and then I will apply Service pack 1 and see if I can then change back to our LF Service account that we usually use . <p> I 'm currently having the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well where the LFDS is located on a different server than the Laserfiche Server . I 've also taken the same steps as you too with no results . I do noticed that SSO is working fine . <p> Well that stinks Eddie . Yeah , it appeared that everything was ok and I had remounted the repo using Web Admin 10 . Then I was making some sort of change and I kept getting messages about needing to be signed on as a manager which I was . I 'd set my password in again and it looked like I was signed on . Said so up top . <p> AppPool errors started to pop up as I navigated around . Checked those out and everything was set okay . And so the day went . . . <p> I 'll have to try SSO to see if that does anything . But it did n't earlier . We sent LF a few logs and they said this has been popping a bit . I 'll reply if the developers turn up anything . Good luck ! <p> Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ideas out there . 9010 error for Windows Accounts after upgrading to 10 . Turns out our upgraded license ended up having 0 repository user licenses , but the Admin account had a license assigned . ( We ran into an issue that led to creating a new license rather than being able to update what was there currently . ) <p> Recreating the Server license with some repository users allocated fixed the problem . Weird that Windows Accounts that do have a license were unable to log in due to this issue . <p> We 're having the same problem as everyone else here , did an upgrade from 9.21 to 10 just now . No windows logins work , I 've tried assigning some full licenses to the server license file directly and replacing it ( and restarting the server ) but it does n't appear to fix anything . Problem affects weblink too . I followed Chase 's advice above about logging in manually using the ' username@domain.local ' which actually works on both the client and weblink , but domainusername does not work nor does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the case Chase is describing is unrelated to the this bug , and may be specific to certain domain configurations . We 'll update once we know more , but it 's much more likely that you are running into the general case that we already have a workaround for . <p> To be clear , just replacing the license on LFS is n't the workaround . You must register a NEW instance of LFS and download the license from that new instance . <p> We are experiencing similar behavior and none of the solutions have worked for us . Moreover , certain users can use Windows authentication to access the desktop client , while other receive the below error . Additionally , all users can access the web interface successfully . I would like to open a ticket , but this seems to be the only place I have access to contact support <p> This error indicates that you are completely unable to reach LFDS , which is not related to the above issues . I would recommend starting a new post , as this one is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Furthermore , if you feel you need to open a support case , you should contact your VAR/reseller . <p> As a first troubleshooting steps , I 'd recommend the following : check if the users who are having login issues can log in successfully using a machine of a user that can login ( or the other way around ; do users that can log in successfully get the error message on the other user 's machine ) <p> This is exactly what we are experiencing right now . Out of the blue . Two days ago everyone could connect and after that , some people can connect some of the time . <p> Ironically , I started this thread last year and things were eventually resolved . Now I do not know what is preventing access . I have also tried using the ADMIN account as well with sporadic results . We are either of these : <p> We are racking our brain to figure it out . We tried both the machine name and the IP address in the " Attach " section . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our server is located on another VM . <p> I have regenerated our license for our server and refreshed the master license . No luck . <p> I think it has something to do with the connection timing out . I looked in the registry for the LFSO entry , but there is n't an LFSO entry there in both the 32bit and 64bit sections . <p> This error is different both from the original thread above and from Chase 's recent reply . The error says you are completely unable to reach your Laserfiche Server , and may not be related to Directory Server at all . <p> Since this thread is already very busy and is unrelated , I recommend asking a new question so that it 's easier for people who can help troubleshoot to find it . <p> Thank you Brianna . My apologies as I saw Chase 's post and it was pretty spot on to our new issue <p> I will start a new question if this is so much different than the earlier posts . What confuses things is that we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , LFDS communication , and other authentication messages . <p> It 's not a problem ; I just want to make sure your post is seen by people who can help and that it 's easy for future users to get to . <p> For future reference , a good first step to distinguish issues is by the labeled error code/error message that appear at the top of the long event viewer message . <p> " I ca n't log in " is like " my car wo n't start " . Is it battery problems ? Ignition problems ? Just out of fuel ? Maybe even you used your spouse 's car key ? Some scenarios are more likely than others , but you ca n't tell the cause just from " my car wo n't start " . <p> For example , the error messages in this thread originally were all 9010 errors :

I 've found that if I <p> put in a valid SQL query with all columns I need returned ( assuming they are the same for all variations of the query token ) , <p> run the test on the activity so it populates the query 's column output tokens , <p> and then replace the entire query with % ( tkQuery ) , <p> that it will let me use a token as my query at runtime . Obviously I ca n't test the custom query activity this way but at least it works at runtime for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own custom script but I would prefer to use out of the box tools to accomplish this . I understand this may be a niche need but has anyone found a better way to pass a dynamically built SQL query token into the Custom Query Activity ? For Laserfiche , is there any plan to easily allow tokens to be used directly within a SQL query , without the need to pass them in as parameters ? <p> I do n't mind using this method but it does not appear to be designed to work this way since there is no built-in button or right-click to add tokens to the query and since the test for the activity fails . Any chance in the future to allow it to use tokens to build the query inherently within the activity ? <p> This is n't necessarily what you 'll be using it for , but I wanted to extend one caution . Being able to piece together a SQL query from strings without proper parameterization ( which the Custom Query tool does ) is opening up SQL injection vulnerabilities . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any of the tokens were coming from a public facing Forms instance there could trouble . <p> I definitely agree with you there and appreciate that you clarified that . In this case the template fields I am pulling from are numeric only and I always verify any template fields used in a query with regular expressions to verify their accuracy . Great idea though to mention that before someone goes down the wrong path and opens up a huge vulnerability . <h> Replies <p> and then tokenize the two parameters . You could then pass a valid token to the first parameter and pass an ' % ' to the second parameter and get all of the records matching your first field . Or you could pass valid values to both parameters and get your second field included in the WHERE clause . <p> The theory falls apart with the OR statement though as I ca n't get the syntax correct to include that third parameter . And , as you know , the LIKE clause will include any substring matches . ( Which is not good ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script activity . More often than not I can code up a script faster than I can work out an issue with a workflow . <p> But then to a developer everything is easier when you code it from scratch ! <p> I do remember the days of having to write any database lookups with the Script ( VB.NET ) activity and it was nice to be able to customize everything through there . For this project I need to use out-of-the-box activities to allow non-coders to maintain/update as needed . But yes , I do like writing from scratch so it does exactly what I want . Thanks for working to find an answer ! <p> Beau - Quick question ; what differentiates the 10 different queries ? My guess is that you are doing some type of ' WHERE ' clause on the query to differentiate them . If so , is it a single field that is contained in the WHERE clause or several ? <p> Without being in front of the Workflow Designer I would say that you should be able to build your standard SELECT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WHERE clause . If you can provide specific examples I am willing to help with the syntax . <p> The Custom Query activity does not inherently allow you to use tokens in the query directly . Additionally , it does not let you successfully pass column names as parameters , only the values of those columns can be passed as parameters . <p> This query returns a single row as it should <p> This same query passing the column name as a parameter returns 0 rows <p> It appears this activity treats parameters as it should in a SQL query by only allowing them to only replace a comparison value and not an actual portion of the statement . <p> As an example , let 's say I have a table ( tblA ) with 6 columns ( colA , colB , colC , colD , colE , &amp; colF ) and I have 3 separate queries that need to pull the same columns but with different queries . <p> SELECT * FROM tblA WHERE colD= ' 12345 ' <p> SELECT * FROM tblA WHERE colD= ' 12345 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHERE colD= ' 12345 ' OR colF='abc ' <p> In this scenario I would have to build 3 separate custom query activities to use Workflow in the way it is designed . With the method I mentioned above I would <p> create a token to house the SQL query <p> build the SQL query in the token using routing decisions/conditional sequences <p> create a single custom query activity <p> set the query in that activity to SELECT * FROM tblA <p> use the test portion of the activity to populate the output column tokens <p> replace the SELECT statement in the activity with my query token <p> it wont test successfully in the activity but it will work correctly at runtime <p> I am looking to see if anyone has found a better way to dynamically build a query ( joins , from different tables , different where values , ... ) assuming all queries return the same columns and use the same datasource . <p> I like your enthusiasm and appreciate your desire to provide solutions . Your method is a great way to handle my example however my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually query many different tables , use joins , and have unique column names depending on which query the document qualifies for . I am writing the queries to return the unique column names as static alias 's to allow them to be returned consistently as the same token name by the Custom Query script . I think I will stick to using routing decisions for each query just to keep from having customization to support . Thanks again .

The SQL databases will reside on a dedicated SQL server , so they 're not moving . <h> Answer <p> If your Laserfiche Repository is staying on the same Laserfiche Server and you 're just looking to move the volumes to a different drive , then you can change the fixed path of the physical volumes in the Admin Console and the files will be moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help files has more information ) .

What I need to do is to populate a dropdown with understandable options like Dell D-600 , iPad Mini-Slate , Apple TV and have values assigned to each option that are their serial numbers .

The actual dropdown is created using HTML elements , a &lt;select&gt; object with a collection of &lt;option&gt; objects nested below it . They have the following syntax : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value " attribute of the option element , and the option text is between the opening and closing tags . You need to modify the HTML of the page to change the list .

Creating them as windows accounts is most efficient where possible as those users can then log into multiple repositories if they have accounts set up . I would n't delete all accounts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up in the way you described above . Then add that number of full named users to the server instance , regenerate the license , drop it in the program directory and restart the LF server service . Then when you go into the admin console for that server you can check the server node and you should have those licenses available . Then within the repository you can select the LF user as a full named user . Hope this helps . <h> Replies <p> The Directory Named Users or Named Device assigned in the LM will be able to be granted log in rights to any Rio server you put up .

This does mean though that these Windows Users will not be able to log in with LF Authentication as you are wanting to allow . <p> You would want to remove that windows account from License Manager and instead allocate that license to the server you are accessing through the admin console .

Rio Servers do n't allow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Windows Accounts - it automatically knows . However , if you 're using Laserfiche Users instead , it will ask you . You can not set up a Windows Account in the License Manager and then use it on a Laserfiche User - it must be set up as a Windows Account in the admin console to work the way you are trying to set it up . And in the Windows Accounts section it wo n't ask if it is named or not , it will just know . <p> I would recommend the first thing you try is regenerate the server license file for that server . You can do this by clicking on the server name in the " Registered Application Instances " area and then go to " Generate License File " . <p> Place that in the LaserficheServer directory and restart the service . <p> Sometimes these things can get out of sync . You should also doublecheck that the hardware fingerprint on that server is what the License Manager sees . <p> how can i use named user on RIO ? ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then create named user mapped to that windows user ? is it possible ? i tried it many times i am able to map it but i ca n't choose the user type on named user . <p> the purpose of this i want to use named user to be used on workflow or forms , where i can log in to forms either by windows account or named user providing username and password . <p> do you mean if i am using license manager to block license it will be known by laserfiche admin , and it will not accept to create named users ? ? if so i need to delete all windows accounts on lic. manager and recreate server license , will it work ? , what if i want to use both most users using license manager and two or users will use named user ? <p> Typically you use a combination of both types of licenses in LM , those that are created as Windows accounts or device licenses , and those that are created as repository named users with a specific purpose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where possible as those users can then log into multiple repositories if they have accounts set up .

The download is a fully functional 30-day demo and if you use it past the 30-day period you can request a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a screenshot for a very simple workflow ; <p> In this example you would be doing a Repository Search for documents that meet you criteria , then the For Each Entry activity to step through the search results . The Delete Pages custom activity in the above workflow is set to delete all pages from each document in the For Each activity . <p> Note : One thing to keep in mind is that any pages deleted from a document actually go to the Recycle Bin . Once you delete all of the pages that you deem necessary you will have to go to the Recycle Bin and purge them to actually regain disk space . <p> ( The custom workflow activities on the Qfiche website are designed for Workflow 9.1 or higher ) <p> So reading through the thread it looks like you want to delete the pages from any document that has electronic file attached and has a page count &gt; 0 . <p> Typically what I do when I want to create a search query is open up the Laserfiche client and go to the Search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is returning the documents that I want . If you include the Advanced Search option then you can copy/paste that query into the workflow Search Repository activity . Here is a client screen shot for a client search for any document that has an electronic file attached and has 1 or more pages ; <p> So you would copy/paste the text from the Advanced Search into your workflow Search Repository activity ( or just type LF:Ext= " * " &amp; LF:pagecount &gt; 0 in the Search Repository activity ) <p> Here is a screenshot of that ; <p> I would click the ' Test Search Query ' link to make sure the document count is the same as the client search . <p> I would also recommend that you try this query on a test folder first before you run it on your repository to make sure you get the required results . <p> Also , I would highly recommend that you do not check the ' Purge deleted pages from the recycle bin ' option in the Delete Pages activity until you are absolutely sure the workflow is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check that option and delete the document pages there is no way to retrieve them ! See below ; <p> If you leave that option unchecked then you can always restore the pages from the Recycle bin or purge the pages from there . From the earlier thread ; purging the pages from the Recycle bin will retrieve the disk space . <p> Finally ; before you purge the deleted pages from the Recycle bin please make sure that deleting the document pages will achieve the results that you want without unintentionally impacting how your users access and use the documents .

If ScanConnect is what you want to use , make sure the scanner 's ISIS driver is installed . Then make sure that ScanConnect is installed . Launch Laserfiche Scanning , select ScanConnect as the engine you want to use , and then go through the Scanner Setup process . If the scanner is not listed in the available scanners list , or any scanner for that matter , then apply KB 1011942 and then close and reopen Laserfiche Scanning and go through Scanner Setup again . <p> That sounds like something is wrong with your ScanConnect installation .

@@98006051 @2206051/ <h> Tech Tip : Copying Entry Links in Laserfiche Web Access <p> In Laserfiche Web Access , users can navigate to an entry , copy and paste its URL in the address bar , and send the link to another user . Users can right-click a specific entry and select Copy Link to have the URL automatically saved to the clipboard for them . In addition , multiple entries can be selected and their URL links can be copied and saved to the clipboard at once . This saves time navigating to and copying all the URLs for these entries one-by-one . <p> For example , Chris needs to send his colleague , Blair , direct links to a handful of invoices to be processed . Chris can navigate to the folder containing the invoices , select one or more invoices he wants to collect URLs for , right-click and select Copy Link . The links will be automatically copied to his clipboard and he can paste these links into an instant message to send to Blair . In addition , if Chris wants to send a link to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can right-click on the thumbnail of that page to copy its link and send it to Blair . <p> This is especially useful for electronic documents . In previous versions , users had to find the electronic document 's entry I 'd number and manually construct the URL using that I 'd . Now , users can right-click an electronic document and automatically copy its link , removing the extra steps it takes to customize the URL . <p> Note : - If you are viewing Web Access in Internet Explorer , the link will be automatically copied to the clipboard .

@@98006054 @2206054/ <p> Ling talked about changing the web.config which is great , but how is the other components set up ? <p> I 'm wondering the following : <p> 1 . At setup , how do I configure the DMZ Forms Portal - I know I point to the primary forms server , but do I configure the rest of the settings ? ( Currently getting access denied errors on ' User authentication ' tab ) If I disable the Forms Routing Service on the DMZ as Ling says to , I get a proxy error . Do I configure first then disable the service ? <p> 2 . The DMZ would host the Business Process , would it just host the Form and not have any steps involved in the Process designer ? <p> 3 . The Internal Forms server - would I need to host a copy of the Business Process there ? How will the Process Designer steps get started ? <p> Any help would be appreciated . The Form was designed internally and uses AD users and such , so it 's essential to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the Internal Forms server handle the rest after submission . <h> Replies <p> The safest way to configure this is to have Forms Portal installed inside the network and have a reverse proxy IIS server on the DMZ that acts as a bridge between the external users and the Forms Server . Simon Verrault has an excellent walkthrough here . It is for Web Access , but it should be easy enough to re-purpose for Forms . <p> The other option , which is more complex and risky , is to have two Forms Servers , one on the DMZ and one inside the network , and have them share the same database . The reason this is more complex and risky is that you 'll need several firewall rules to make sure the Forms Server on the DMZ can talk to the Laserfiche Server , the License Manager , and the database server . Most competent IT people will give you a lot of pushback when you suggest this because it 's against best practices to have DMZ services access assets inside the network . The reverse proxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least as risk-free as it can get with anything involving the Internet ) . <p> Thanks guys . I would like to keep as many ports closed on the internal server as possible , so if I go with the risky option , I would n't have to have external users working on the internal server . <p> When I installed Forms Portal on the DMZ , I had to get some ports opened for Forms Config to see the Forms SQL database , so that 's open . This DMZ already has Weblink so it already talks to the LF Server . <p> My question is , if I go with the risky option ( Forms Portal on DMZ , Forms Server on internal LF Server , both using same Database ) , how is that configured . As mentioned previously , there is no real written out steps for this . I saw that you need to disable the Forms Routing service on the DMZ and in config you need to point to the main Forms server ( internal ) , and also change the web.config on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a form submission to the Forms Portal , will the internal Forms server pick up the form submission and start the first item in the Business Process ? Will it act as though someone submitted the form internally on the internal form server ? <p> Ultimately the reverse proxy option is the best , but I believe I 'm over my head with Simon 's article . <p> I find it hard to believe that nobody else out there has n't done this with Forms Portal yet ... or at least has n't shared that they have . <p> We have a client using Forms Portal on the DMZ and another Forms Server inside the network . Both Forms Routing Services are running . It works exactly as you describe : when an external user submits a form , it 's routed to an internal user in a ( mostly ) seamless manner . It took a lot of fiddling and trial-and-error though . <p> You 're right that the documentation on this is non-existent and it 's very frustrating . Laserfiche really needs to publish some whitepapers describing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out on their own is crazy , especially since the software is getting more complex with more moving parts with every release . <p> I am glad to hear you have implemented this already , gives me hope that this can be done . Would it be too much to ask for you to list the steps involved ? Did you document this at the time ? I know there will be others that will benefit from your response if you do . <p> If you meant whether the user on DMZ Forms can see process diagrams , yes . Since you 're opening a port to the Sql Server , your DMZ Forms will also have access to the internal Forms database which stores business process diagrams . <p> No , since your DMZ Forms Server has access to the Sql Server , it can access the business process directly <p> For further configuration details , please see the white paper " Hosting Laserfiche Forms 10 in A Perimeter Network ( DMZ ) " here : <p> Is disabling the DMZ Forms Routing Service a strict requirement ?

@@98006055 @2206055/ <h> Answer 9784 @qwx869784 <p> replied on July 10 , 2014 <p> We have been looking at this as well and currently you can not . It would be nice that when a user scans to a folder , or imports to a folder , that the metadata would popup with the correct template assigned to that folder . <p> You would have to do this through Workflow . Though this would only happen after the document is stored . So they would scan/import the document to the folder , Workflow would run and assign the template , then the user could open it and fill it out . Not very streamlined but that is what we have done for some of our clients . <h> Replies <p> This appears to be solvable by setting the option in the Thick Client to " Use Parent Folder 's Template " . This does not as a result constrain the user by role or job scope . <p> I am not sure if this is apparent or obvious since the original question was lodged - could be some necromancing on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a good enough solution . <p> The only improvement now would be the option to present the user with the " Fields " Tab on import ( populated with the Parent 's Template ) rather than " General Tab " in a reliable way - I notice that it seems to do this sometimes but not others ... <p> I 've just been looking for this solution and your suggestion works really well - thanks ! <p> Now , the only occasional problem is when a template has a required field , and therefore you ca n't easily apply the template to the folder : because A : you do n't want there to be any content in that field at the folder level , and B : you ca n't apply the template if that required field does n't have any content . <p> So just to add to the above - if this happens : <p> Temporarily remove the ' required ' tick on the template field <p> Apply the template to the folder(s) <p> Reconfigure the template to have the required fields again <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a folder with a template that has empty ' required ' fields ) but it works . <p> Another workaround it to use a default value in the required field , but in many cases that would n't be appropriate since you may want to force users to add/select content and not allow the default through . <p> +1 vote for having this as a configurable option that accounts for the above - it would be preferable and more robust . <p> Is there any idea of the possibility of an improvement in this area for Laserfiche 10 ? <p> This is a bugbear for several of my clients and especially one in which the demo of the Laserfiche system is alongside a competitive product where the comparisons are easily and often made despite there being considerable respect for both the solutions . 
@@98006056 @2206056/ <h> Question <h> Question <h> Checkboxes on Forms : How to map efficiently to template fields when saving to repository ? <p> I have a checkbox on a Laserfiche form that allows multiple inputs ( and there are many options ) . When the " save to the repository " task occurs in my business process , each of these potential multiple inputs has a corresponding field on the template . <p> So far , it appears that I can select the specific checked/unchecked value for each of the possible inputs in order to have them transferred to the appropriate template fields - for instance , in the " Configure Fields " dialog , I can set the value for each template field to the value for the corresponding checkbox , like so : <p> " Applications in use " is the variable associated with the checkbox in question , and V105 is the corresponding value ( right now I have both the " choices " and " values " columns filled out in my form design . ) <p> I have two questions about this . <p> 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inputs from a multi-value checkbox to multiple different template fields in the repository ? There are quite a lot of potential inputs/template fields , and this may result in a very long set of field configurations at the beginning of my business process . <p> 2 ) The metadata on my document shows " Checked " if the checkbox was checked and " Unchecked " if the checkbox was unchecked . Is there a way to make it display " Yes " and " No " in the resulting metadata instead , perhaps with a workflow operation ? ( We 're hoping to use this metadata for reporting purposes later on ) . <h> Replies <p> I recommend taking advantage of the " Retrieve Laserfiche Forms Content " activity in Workflow . Generally when you find yourself wanting more functionality for a Forms process , Workflow is the application to turn to . As this Answers post explains , the checkbox token from Retrieve Laserfiche Forms Content is a multi-value token containing the checked values . As a result , you can place the selected values directly into a metadata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In Retrieve Laserfiche Forms Content , retrieve the checkbox field <p> Search Repository finds the entry to which you wish to assign the metadata field <p> Change Starting Entry makes the located entry the starting entry . Its not necessary , but I find it convenient . <p> In Assign Field Values , set your metadata field value to the retrieved checkbox field <p> The metadata field must be a multi-value field . This is set in the Admin Console <p> The field can be a text field or a list field , but note that if its a list field , you 'll have to update it every time the checkbox selections change <p> Track Tokens is also not necessary , but its useful for troubleshooting <p> If the target entry is the form you 're saving to the repository from Forms , then you 'll have to mark it in order to find it with the Search Repository activity . As the Answers post explains , I suggest using the forms submission I 'd : <p> Create a metadata field called Submission I 'd <p> Add the field to the forms metadata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Set its value to the Submission I 'd : <p> Note that you can make this a hidden metadata field using metadata security in the Admin Console <p> In Workflow , set the search query to find that form via this Submission I 'd field : <p> Youll have to do two more things to link the forms process to the workflow : <p> Kick off the workflow from Forms by adding the " Laserfiche Workflow " service task to the Forms process modeler : <p> Enable the workflow to use the Forms data by marking it as being started by Forms : <p> Either : <p> Right-click the workflow canvas and click " View Properties " <p> Click on the workflow canvas and in the right pane under Properties , click " View workflow properties " <p> In the General tab under Attributes , check " Started by Laserfiche Forms " <p> In Assign Field Values , I set the metadata field ( in this case PL-ApplicationType ) to the forms checkbox field from the Retrieve Laserfiche Forms Content activity : <p> If you 're getting True/False , you might be setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is Set " in their names ) . <p> I also noticed that PL-ApplicationType has dropdown arrows next to the values , whereas the multi-value field I 'm using ( " choices " ) is a text field . It is possible to use a dropdown field , but the list values must be the exact format that Workflow stores them . For example , my checkbox values in Forms are " choice 1 " , " choice 2 " , " choice 3 " , and " choice 4 " . However , when they 're stored by Workflow into the metadata , they 're stored as " choice1 " , " choice2 " , etc . If in the Admin Console , my " choices " dropdown field has list options of " choice 1 " , " choice 2 " , etc. , then they wo n't store from Workflow as they do n't match exactly . Therefore , while setting up the process , I 'd recommend using a text field as it 's less restrictive . Once you get it working , then you can reformat appropriately and make things more restrictive .

View the regional settings in the control panel of the Workflow Server computer to determine how these strings will format your tokens . <p> Example : Formatting regional settings : <p> Formatted token : <p> % ( DateTime# " g " # ) <p> Input : <p> January 23 , 2009 , 0:00 <p> Result : <p> 1/23/2009 12:00 AM ( English - United States ) <p> 23/01/2009 00:00 ( French - France ) <p> 2009-01-23 00:00 ( French - Canada ) <p> Specifier <p> Type <p> Function <p> d <p> Short date pattern <p> Formats date and date/time strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer 's regional settings . <p> D <p> Long date pattern <p> Formats date and date/time strings to the long date pattern defined in the Workflow Server computer 's regional settings . <p> t <p> Short time pattern <p> Formats date/time and time strings to the short time pattern defined by the Workflow Server computer 's settings ( hours and minutes ) . <p> T <p> Long time pattern <p> Formats date/time and time strings to the long time pattern defined by the Workflow Server computer 's settings ( hours , minutes , and seconds ) . <p> f <p> Full date/time pattern ( short time ) <p> Represents a combination of the long date ( D ) and short time ( t ) patterns , separated by a space . <p> F <p> Full date/time pattern ( long time ) <p> Represents a combination of the long date ( D ) and long time ( T ) patterns , separated by a space . <p> g <p> General date/time pattern ( short time ) <p> Represents a combination of the short date ( d ) and short time ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G <p> General date/time pattern ( long time ) <p> Represents a combination of the short date ( d ) and long time ( T ) patterns , separated by a space . <p> M <p> Month day pattern <p> Displays the month and day according to the Workflow Server computer 's regional settings . <p> Y or y <p> Year month pattern <p> Displays the year and month according to the Workflow Server computer 's regional settings . <p> u <p> Universal sortable pattern <p> Always formats to a pattern with a four-digit year first , followed by 2-digit month , day , year , hour , minute , and seconds . <h> Custom Date and Time Format Strings <p> You can also create custom strings to format dates and times to any combination of date and time formats . A popular use for this is to use dates extracted from your documents to create document names or folder paths according to a standardized system . <p> Example : Margarita wants to organize her documents into folders labeled with the last two digits of the year and the abbreviation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the date accordingly and uses the Rename Entry activity to name her folders . <p> Formatted Token : <p> % ( Date# " yy-MMM " # ) <p> Input : <p> January 23 , 2009 <p> Result : <p> 09-Jan ( English-United States ) <p> 09-jan ( Portuguese-Brazil ) <p> 09-ene ( Spanish-Spain ) <p> Note : On most Windows computers , the system clock 's resolution is approximately 10-15 milliseconds , so while seconds can be formatted to additional digits , they may not be accurate beyond that threshold . <p> Specifier <p> Type <p> Function <p> / <p> Date separator <p> Used to differentiate years , months , and days .

I have a request to format those fields using commas to make the value easier to enter when entering large numbers . I saw a post where this can be done on Single Line fields but I get an error when trying to set it on Currency fields . There are so many currency fields and lots of Workflow logic wrapped around them that I would prefer to make the change on the existing Currency fields rather than create new fields . <p> I should also mention that the Form itself has javascript that is calculating many of these Currency fields to produce totals and calculated sub-totals . So I need to be sure that whatever method to format with commas does not affect the javascript calcualtions . <p> The currency field is just an html input with a specific pattern . The Javascript changes the pattern for that field to allow for commas and then actually changes the value the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You should thoroughly test this though to confirm that it does n't cause any issues with calculations being done in Workflow . Basic checks work fine for me . <p> Form being filled out : <p> Form after clicking out of the field and/or during submission : <p> Workflow Condition Check : <p> Also , a future release of Forms should have a built in option to display separators in currency fields . <p> When using parseFloat , you need to remove the commas . You 'll also need to change the line where you save the value into the totaldebts field if you want the total to use commas . You can use something like <p> Only thing I noticed now is the commas do n't get applied to any currency fields that happen to be in a repeating collection ( other than the original field ) . If I select the link to add a new collection , then the currency field does not have the commas . <p> Also , the read-only sub total fields that I have where I am placing the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not sure if that is because they are read only or something else . <p> Here is a screenshot of that section . You can see that there are no commas . <p> Thanks Alexander but when I use the code you provided above , it seems to break it entirely . That might be more me than you code though ; - ) <p> I really appreciate your assistance but I am stuck on getting this to work correctly . Let me further state that I am not a developer so my knowledge of java script is quite limited . <p> I created a test form so I can play around with the code and I have most everything working correctly but the only things I ca n't get to work correctly is to have commas inserted in any of the fields that are in a repeating collection ( other than the initial field ) and to have the commas inserted in the total calculations at the bottom . Here is a screen shot of the test for I have set up that shows where the commas are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also attached the java script that I am currently using .

@@98006074 @2206074/ <h> Question <h> Question <h> In Forms 10 , are you able to relate field values to a file upload in a given row ? <p> For instance , if you have a table with the following columns ( Doc Type , Doc Description , and File Upload ) , are you able to relate the Doc Type and Doc Description in that given row to the FIle Upload ? <p> When we save the attachment to Laserfiche , there is no way for us to relate that document to the data in that row . It basically saves all the data in the fields , rather than what is specific to that row . <p> See screen shots . <p> We should be able to grab each Attachment and assign the Table values for that row to the template we assign it . <h> Answer <p> Like Ege said above , Workflow can do it . For fields in a table or collection , you can get the row they 're in and use it to pull out the other rows to make sure you 're assigning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . The major change to your process would be that you would have Forms save the form to Laserfiche , but pass the saving of attachments on to Workflow . <p> The workflow process can be started either from a service task in Forms or from the form saved to Laserfiche as long as Forms sets the instance I 'd and submission I 'd as field values . <p> The screenshot below assumes the workflow is started from Forms . If starting from LF , you will need to add a Retrieve Field Values at the top to read the instance I 'd and submission I 'd from the starting entry and set them in the advanced properties of Retrieve Forms Content . <p> In the example below , my form has a table with 2 columns : column 1 ( text ) and column 2 ( file upload ) . The workflow adds each uploaded file to Laserfiche and sets the corresponding value from column 1 as a field value . <p> For the purpose of this example , let 's say the form looks like this when submitted : <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the column data for each column . These tokens are named after the activity , table and column . So for my unimaginatively named table and column : LONG ... For my sample form , this is a multi-value token that contains the 2 values : A and B. <p> Workflow also retrieves the attachments as a file collection that we can process with For Each File : <p> Each file generates tokens for its name , path , size and extension . The path refers to the file 's location in the rows in the table by table and column names : **28;2281;TOOLONG . So for the first 2 in my sample form , the path in my table would be TableColumn21 , the next 2 would be TableColumn22 . <p> We can use this path and regular expression to extract the row number from the end and assign it to a token . <p> This would generate a token with the value " 1 " for the first 2 attachments and the value " 2 " for the next 2 . <p> We then create an empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic component and assign the field . <p> To assign the field value , we use the row number above to get the corresponding value out of the multi-value token for the other column . <p> For the first 2 attachments , this will return Column 1 's value from the first row , " A " , while the next 2 would get the value from row 2 , " B " . <p> Sorry about that , I did n't realize that Forms did n't have an option to save only the form . <p> I would modify the Forms task to save them into an " Attachments " subfolder in the same location as the starting form . Then I would have the workflow above start from the document creation for the starting form . At the end of this workflow , I 'd add an activity that just deletes the % ( Entry Path ) Attachments subfolder . By putting the action at the end , you give Forms enough time to finish saving the attachments ( since that 's done asynchronously and may take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that should n't be necessary . When will this feature be added ? I understand the workaround with Workflow , but then to have to create a subfolder to delete copies of the attachments I already received seems like a mess . <p> I do n't see why it 's a mess . It 's literally two more activities in the workflow . <p> You do n't have to use a subfolder either . You can also mark the attachments in a specific way ( either via name or metadata ) in the Forms process modeler , then have Workflow monitor for them and delete them as they come in . <p> I love that we now have the option to access the row data with the attachments but if I understand this correctly , I need to use Workflow to generate the attachments into Laserfiche if I want them to have the unique data for the row they were attached to ? If that is the case then how do I turn off saving the attachments in the Save to Repository activity . Or do I have to delete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreate those attachments via Workflow ? Seems like the Save to Repository activity in Forms could just know the corresponding row data for the table/collection the upload came from and then this entire process would be easy . <p> The way we deal with that is by automatically capturing the name of the uploaded attachment in a hidden field on the same row/collection . Then workflow uses that to match each attachment with the correct row/collection metadata.

Is it possible that other hardware changes were made since you installed the license ?

@@98006083 @2206083/ <h> Question <h> Question <h> Copy values from one field to another <p> I have several forms that will have the same radio button choices . Then depending on the choice , I would like to pull the first and last name out for further use from a hidden field . We use a database for staff , a different one for students , and the student teachers are just write ins . <p> The radio button will open up different sections for a look up in the different databases depending on the choice . Once the information is acquired I felt the easiest way to have a common thread to get the name for later would be in a hidden area . That way on the business process I would only use the hidden area to call the name . <p> Also , while I am at it , another I have is I have parsed the date field also in the hidden area to make it easier for filing away . What I would actually prefer is to use the date field at the top , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year +1 in the hidden area , if before July 1 , then keep the current year . That way I can save the form under the current school year . <h> Replies <p> You can use JavaScript to copy the value from one field to another and to manipulate that value if you like . In your example you have two sets of fields for the name and date . I like to assign these fields CSS classes . Give the name field the name CSS class , the date field the date CSS class , the hidden name field the otherName CSS class , and the hidden date field the otherDate CSS class . <p> If you only want to exactly copy the value from one field to another , you just need to wait for the user to leave that field and then copy the value . If you want to manipulate the value , as you do with the date field , you 'll still need to wait for the field to change before you modify the value .

@@98006086 @2206086/ <h> Replies <p> If you are running on version 10 , forms and workflow , you can update and return variables from workflow to forms . After you run your workflow , those variables are available to use in naming or metadata when you Save to Repository or other tasks . This is one of the version 10 updates we were most looking forward to . <p> Under the Laserfiche Forms Toolbox tab : <p> Variables that you define within your form will be avaliable to update and return results . <p> Use the ' Retrieve Laserfiche Forms Content ' and include the form variable that you want to update . <p> No we are using version 9.2 . Is there any way to update from version 9.2 ; if not is there any possibility to save Laserfiche form image submitted by user in the Repository using workflow , since we are able to create entry in the repository with metadata , but does n't store image . <p> The upgrade from 9 to 10 is pretty straightforward .

I am rather new to Laserfiche but noticed quite a few nice improvements between 9 and 10 . Have fun ! <p> One way that we deal with this scenario is we have two fields in Laserfiche called " Forms Instance I 'd " and " Forms Submission I 'd " . <p> When we use a Save to Repository event , we write the associated data into those fields . <p> Once a workflow is initiated on the document , it can use a " Retrieve Business Process Variables " task ( I believe this had a different name under Forms 9 . I think it was " Retrieve Forms Data " or something similar ) to retrieve any data elements submitted in the form . <p> These data elements can then have calculations run on them as needed and stored in the metadata as you normally would deal with tokens in a workflow . <p> Yes , I understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow to process information and update metadata . But , the business process I am dealing with that does n't allow to Save information in the repository before processing information in the workflow . So I have two option either Work flow should have output parameter that I can use in the Process modeler or I should able to save submitted form image in the repository in the work flow after processing information <p> Note to those who might use this thread . The name referenced for the process object is now " Set Business Process Variables " and not " Return Results to Forms " . While this may have been purely a naming change for describing the solution , it might make things interesting for inexperienced readers .

@@98006104 @2206104/ <p> I do n't think there is a direct answer to this question due to how differently each browser renders html and css rules when " printing " the page . The best way we have overcome this is after the form has been submitted , there is a " Download " ( must be allowed in the business process start event ) button that converts the page to PDF , which is a very close representation of the page ready to print , which we then open and print . Not the best solution , but a viable workaround.

Pulling up the original form with the collection filled out will allow a user to easily tweak individual sections of a collection ( or remove a section of the collection ) if desired . <p> Another way I 'm investigating is to have it where the process model will submit the form to the repository , but not end . We would keep it in a holding pattern , and based on the submission I 'd , have a user call the URL to the pending form to view it and resubmit if required . Will there be any downside to keeping many forms in a holding pattern if they do n't have to be tweaked ? <p> A year on and it looks like I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way I managed to do something similar is as follows : <p> User submits Form <p> Form process triggers Workflow ( Setup to wait until the Workflow finishes before continuing ) <p> Workflow creates a blank entry in the repository with the InstanceID of the Form and an Approval field attached . The Workflow sits in a Wait for Entry Change activity until the Approval field changes - this keeps the form " Live " but hidden from users in their Inbox until an action is required . <p> Once the form has been processed in the repository it updates the blank entry , which continues the Form process and let 's the user make any amendments to the Form should it be required . <p> With the addition of setting up Timer activities in the Forms process I 'm able to trigger Workflows at set intervals to make sure that there are no issues with the blank entry before keeping the process locked in any waits . 
@@98006123 @2206123/ <h> Replies <p> If you would like a counter that goes up by one for a specific type of document , Workflow can easily handle this ! I often accomplish this by storing my counter value in a field applied to one of the root folders of the repository . This field can be hidden from most users ' view , and need only be accessible by Workflow . Then I build a workflow that looks something like this , that runs every time a new document of the desired type is created in the repository : <p> Similarly , this value could be stored in a table , in which case you would retrieve the value with a Query Data activity and put the incremented value back into the table with an Update Data activity . <p> If you want them to be incremental and have no gaps , then you can use the EntryID , which is going to be unique for each entry in the repository . <p> If you want something incremented without gaps , you might need to use a SQL table and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message and return you the next number in the sequence for your usage .

@@98006126 @2206126/ <h> Question <h> Question <h> Does Port 80 have to be open to use WebAccess ? <p> I have a customer that wants to use WebAccess ( they 're small ) to access Laserfiche from outside their network . Their IT Company has <p> opened ports 5050 and 5051 in the firewall , forwarded them to the Laserfiche server . They do n't want to open Port 80 ... is this necessary if the above have already been opened ? If so , what else might they do . Also , is there anything else that needs to be done to simply gain access to Laserfiche through WebAccess outside of their network other than opening up the mentioned ports ? <h> Answer <p> It sounds like you users can already successfully use that instance of Web Access internally . If that 's the case , then you should n't need to make any changes to the firewall/port configuration for the Laserfiche Server because Web Access and the Laserfiche Server can already communicate . <p> To just open Web Access up to users outside the firewall , you do need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should probably take a look at the Admin Help for Web Access that explains that type of Firewall configurations . It refers to different configurations and ports . <p> In short , " By default , the Laserfiche Server listens on TCP port 80 . The Laserfiche Server broadcasts notifications on port 5051 . If there is a firewall between your Laserfiche Server instance and your Web Access server , make sure that ports 80 and 5051 are open on the firewall . You can use the Server Settings node of the Laserfiche Administration Console to modify the default port settings . " <p> So if you want to use a different port than port 80 , you would need to make the change accordingly . <p> I read that which is why I posted the question on here . The IT Company is saying that Opening Port 80 poses a risk to their network ... so my question is do we simply change the Port it 's using in the Admin Console to a port that 's not being used by anything else and IS NOT 80 ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that change ? I do n't want to make that change and then have it break everything else that is currently working . Laserfiche Server and WebAccess are both installed on the same server . <p> If I remember correctly , you would need to change the port that the Laserfiche client is using on each machine since it scans port 80 by default . If you are pushing the client out using group policy I believe you can change the port there . If you are not using the Laserfiche client at all and just Web Access , then it would only need to be set in the Web Access configuration . <p> I also believe that any other program trying to connect to the Laserfiche Server though would need to be altered as well to communicate on that specific port . <p> If they are worried about keeping the network secure , you can use an SSL connection . I would hope that would put to rest their security concerns . This is a link on Using SSL/TLS with Laserfiche . <p> You 'll need to better understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an acceptable compromise . You can change the port number as Blake has described , but if their concern is about the HTTP protocol that does n't really change anything . Switching to SSL will encrypt the data but again that might not address their concern . <p> It sounds like you users can already successfully use that instance of Web Access internally .

In general though , you can first unregister your repository from your current system . Then uninstall the Laserfiche Server and that will deactivate the system . Now you can install and activate Laserfiche 9.1.1 on your new server . Once that 's completed , register the repository and it will take care of the schema upgrade automatically . <p> The Client can be an older version than the Server if necessary , though we always recommend you update the Client when possible to ensure that you 're getting all the features made available by the server .

" Here 's the code for that . <p> The code above works if the user selects an option from a checkbox or radio button field and it automatically fills fields that are n't in a collection or table . Using the ' #q283 input ' selector works for radio buttons and checkboxes . For drop-down fields , use ' #q283 select ' as the selector . Like so : <h> Replies <p> There 's a somewhat tricky reason why the code is n't working . The identifiers for fields in tables are slightly different because the fields can appear more than once . Because I 'd attributes must be unique , a number is appended to the I 'd attribute for fields in tables . So , if you try to target them with #q64 , it wo n't find the right element . <p> Generally it is easiest to target those fields by adding a class to them and then using that class in your selector . If you wanted to use the I 'd attribute as the selector , you 'd grab the I 'd attribute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selector to mean " starts with Field8 " like so : $ ( ' id=Field8 ' ) . <p> Since using classes as selectors is generally a better idea and you already added the " autofill " class to the appropriate fields , here 's some code that will work for your second section ( and third section with slight modifications ) . The code will fill in each table field with the autofill class , make the fields read-only , and remove the " Add " button so users ca n't add another row to the table . <p> I 've pasted the above code into a separate sheet just to make sure it works with the 3rd section ... and it 's not working . I 've made all the necessary changes with the #q number ... but when I get to that section ... nothing happens in the the section when I choose ( NO ) to the Are you Ammending . I 've even put the code directly onto the Script Page in Forms . <p> Does it work for the second section ? If so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from working on the third section ( which is structurally very similar to the second section ) . <p> For the third section , make sure the option for that checkbox ( although I 'd probably switch these to radio buttons ) is " No " without any extra spaces . That value has to match the value specified on line 5 of the following code . <p> I may have to scrap the form altogether because now I notice that if I fill out the first section and say I chose " No " , then the second section I also fill out " No " then realize I made a mistake and go back to section one and change it from " No " to " Yes " , then it wipes out what was in section 2 even though it 's still showing " No " ( which means it should still say " See Prior Filing " .

A field rule will work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks for the feedback ... I think I might not have explained what I was asking in the last post very well . I know you can hide fields with Rules ... but is there a way for the data to still be poplulated in those fields and then displayed on the output form ? For example : I answer " No " and hide Field A , however , I still want Field A to be popluated with " See Prior Filing " and shown on the Output form that will be in Laserfiche . The reason we want it hidden on the Entry Form is we do n't want people mistakenly trying to enter information that is not needed . Is this still possible ? I tried it and any field I hide , does n't get popluated and then is not shown on the final output form in Laserfiche . <p> Here 's the important part that checks to see if it is the starting form : <p> if ( $ ( ' inputname= " routingResumeId " ' ) . val() == " " ) //checks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starting form wo n't have one yet . $ ( ' #q304 ' ) . hide() ; //hides the section with the filled fields .

Would you be able to verify that this is not that case for you ? and that the attachment is still not loading , when you do press the submit button ? <p> Are the Laserfiche Mobile Server and Laserfiche Forms installed on the same machine ? We are aware of a problem which surfaced in v10 when the 2 servers are hosted on the same IIS and we are currently working on it . The workaround of using the IP address for Forms server on the Mobile configuration page worked for us so please try again and restart the app so the cookies are cleared . Another workaround would be to type in the Laserfiche Mobile Server IP address in the app instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the configuration page . Basically making sure one is IP address the other is the not . And I guess not hosting the 2 servers on the same machine would work too . If these do n't work please open a support case . <p> This is a bug that user can submit the form before the file upload finishes and an SCR was already filed for it . As a workaround , user can wait for a while and then presses the submit button , to make sure the file is actually uploaded.

@@98006141 @2206141/ <h> Question <h> Question <h> Increasing number of concurrent connections to WebLink <p> Based on the following Answers post : LONG ... I learned that for any repository ( in this case our repository associated with WebLink ) , there is a maximum of four concurrent connections per Named User . Now , we have set WebLink up to have a Laserfiche user automatically login , so as to minimize efforts to people connecting from " the outside " . Without having to make the site so external clients would have to log in ( so as to split up connections among multiple users ) , is there any other way we might be able to increase the number of concurrent connections ? <p> Also , in the past I 've compared connection sessions with the repository sessions in the Laserfiche Administration Console . Recently , I was experiencing the " maximum connections exceeded " message , but did n't even see four connections total . Am I looking in the right place , or should I be looking for something , say , in the Event Viewer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 <p> Please confirm that after you regenerated the license file , you replaced it in the Laserfiche Server installation directory ( by default C : Program FilesLaserficheServer ) and then restarted the Laserfiche Server service . Also confirm that the new license is the only *. licx file in that directory prior to restarting the service . <p> As for the user that you 've configured in WebLink to be used as the Public Portal user , make sure that it is not configured in the Laserfiche Administration Console to be a repository named user , i.e. the Named User option for that user should be " False " . Also make sure that the " read only user " option has been checked and that the user does not have the " Manage Trustees " privilege . Make sure that the user is also not a member of a group that has said privilege . <p> After you 've configured WebLink to automatically log in using that repository user , if you are still unable to have users log into WebLink using the Public Portal licenses , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laserfiche Support so we can investigate the matter further . <p> So to confirm , your Laserfiche Server has been allocated the 25 public portal users and WebLink is configured to use a single LF user to automatically log in with ? Is this LF repository user configured to be read-only , does not have the Manage Trustees privilege , and also is not using a repository named user license ? <p> We actually have a licensing scheme called ' Public Portal ' for exactly this reason . Public portal allows your to set up a LF account for auto login with Laserfiche and pull from a pool of concurrent connections . As long as that account is marked ' read-only ' in the admin console and does n't have any other privileges that would override that read-only designation ( Manage Trustees , for instance ) , that user will use the concurrent connections from public portal and will not require a named user license . <p> Note that the 4 session max limit you mention only applies to named user licenses , so you 'd avoid that limit with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal customer portal , it appears you have public portal already . You can talk to your reseller/regional manager for more info on what you have and price sheet for other options . <p> As for the admin console not reflecting the number of sessions accurately , not sure what 's going on here . You made sure you refreshed the connection listing ? <p> I think that 's probably what the problem is . I 'm hoping to migrate my existing licensing scheme from Licence Manager to Directory Server tonight anyways , so I 'll probably re-generate the licence for our main Laserfiche Server at the same time ( as our existing instance does n't have the Public Portal users as you specified ) . <p> Sorry for the delay getting back to you , there were a few things I wanted to walk through first : <p> 1 ) I have re-generated the licence associated with our main Laserfiche server to have 25 public portal users allocated . <p> 2 ) I have attempted to configure WebLink to use a single Laserfiche user . Even though I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my repositories ) , and the server has five Laserfiche Named Users allocated , I ca n't seem to add a new Named User due to licensing limitations . Now , I have a few Laserfiche users , through all of my repositories , that are not Named ; would this be interfering with me being able to add new Named Users ? <p> Please let me know if I 'm on the right track with getting this set up properly - thanks much . <p> The User(s) for use with WebLink should not be set as a named user . If they are a named user , then they will not pull a license from the 25 concurrent Public Portal read only licenses . <p> Also , make sure to set the check for Read Only on the user(s) profile . <p> In Rio , the default way of assigning Named licenses is through the License Manager ( now Directory Service ) . If you wish to assign named licenses through a repository user profile , first you must assign the license to the server through LM/DS and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . This is not a recommended practice for regular users as when you assign a license to a server , that license can then only be used to access 1 repository . If the license is assigned to an AD user from the LM/DS , the user can be granted access to any repository on your system . <p> As an example , let 's say ( for simplicity ) you have a 10 user Rio ( I know , it does not exist ) . <p> Server A has 3 Named Licenses assigned <p> Server B has 2 Named Licenses assigned <p> In LM/DS you now only have 5 license left to assign to AD users <p> Now if Server A has 2 repositories , the 3 Named Licenses available to Server A can only be assigned in 1 repository each . Assume that Repository 1 ( Ar1 ) gets 2 of those licenses and Repository 2 ( Ar2 ) gets the remaining 1 . Then let 's say that Server B has 2 repositories and assume that Repository 1 ( Br1 ) gets both of the assigned Named Licenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the server assigned Named Licenses . Below shows your log in limits . <p> Ar1 = 5 AD users from LM/DS and 2 users from Repository assignment for a total of 7 users <p> Ar2 = 5 AD users from LM/DS and 1 users from Repository assignment for a total of 6 users <p> Br1 = 5 AD users from LM/DS and 2 users from Repository assignment for a total of 7 users <p> Br2 = 5 AD users from LM/DS and 0 users from Repository assignment for a total of 5 users <p> Currently , we have 88 Named User licences , 83 which are assigned to Windows accounts , and 5 for Named ( non-Windows ) Users . I 've tried moving away from having Named Users assigned anywhere , except when absolutely necessary , to avoid using multiple licenses across multiple repositories . I was wanting to set up another Named User with Full access to the repository associated with WebLink , however even though I have 4 Named Users defined , I ca n't seem to add another . I have users defined across my repositories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not sure why I ca n't add another Named User , unless all users in all repositories count toward , the 5 Full Repository user limit we currently have in place ? <p> 1 ) My Laserfiche Server has been allocated the 25 public portal users , and I 've regenerated the licence key and restarted the Laserfiche Server service to apply this change to my existing licensing scheme . <p> 2 ) WebLink has now been configured to use a single , full repository user , logging in automatically . <p> 3 ) The WebLink user has been set with read-only privileges on the repository , and the Manage Trustees privilege has been removed ( but not set as a retrieval only user , as it appears our existing licensing does n't appear to have this ) . <p> I have experimented with using a Windows account as well , but this did n't seem to work either . Might there be something else I might need to do to get the public portal licenses associated with this user ? Or have I maybe set this user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license file , you replaced it in the Laserfiche Server installation directory ( by default C : Program FilesLaserficheServer ) and then restarted the Laserfiche Server service . Also confirm that the new license is the only *. licx file in that directory prior to restarting the service . <p> As for the user that you 've configured in WebLink to be used as the Public Portal user , make sure that it is not configured in the Laserfiche Administration Console to be a repository named user , i.e. the Named User option for that user should be " False " .

I am currently working on this exact thing using the Http post activity in Workflow . I have n't gotten it to work yet , but will update the post with any news . <p> Laserfiche Forms processes have to start with the submission of a Form . At first thought , what you could do is have Workflow email a link for that form to a particular person . That person would then fill out the form and submit it , thereby starting the Forms Business Process . <p> From a simplicity standpoint , I think Rick 's idea would best suit your needs . As Rick stated , you can use Workflow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow to start the business process . Just to clarify , there are other ways to begin business processes other than submitting a form , but form submission is the most common way to begin a Forms process . <p> One advantage to using this method is that you can pass parameters via URL ( check out this link for more info ) . Ultimately , this will allow you to take tokens from your workflow and pre-fill fields in the resulting form . That will lead to more efficient and more accurate forms submisisons . <p> Blake 's idea is also viable , but obviously it will require a bit more technical knowledge to accomplish . <p> If you have any questions , please feel free to respond and I 'll be happy to offer further suggestions or assist in the implementation of Rick 's idea . <p> The main appeal for us to be able to have Workflow submit an LF Form is that now instead of the user receiving an email and having it get lost in all of their other email , the first task of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person so now it shows up in their Pending Tasks area of Forms . <p> It is apparently possible to do , but is highly not recommended as updates to the Forms software could easily break the Http Post activity .

I 've tested changing a template field 's type from " List " to " Text " in my test environment and the existing field values were not lost for this modified field . I wanted to pose this question in Answers so I could get feedback from others before I pull the trigger in my Production repository . Note : I 'm not changing the width of the field . <h> Answer <p> APPROVED ANSWERSELECTED ANSWER <p> replied on February 6 , 2014 <p> My sample size is much smaller than yours , but I just tried converting a list field to a text field of the same width ( on version 9.1 ) , and I had no issues--the field was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( But of course , doing this kind of thing with a good working backup on hand is always an excellent practice ! ) <h> Replies <p> Whenever you change a field type , the system will prompt you to let you know that there could be potential data loss . This means that you will lose the values in your fields if data in the field does n't meet the criteria of the field type . For example , imagine that I have a field ( type text ) called " Name " and it had the value " Alan " in it . Now if I change this field type to " number " the values in my field will be lost because the value " Alan " is n't a number and you ca n't enter letters into a number field . In your example , you are going from a list to a text field type so the data in there should remain since a text field accepts both letters and numbers . <p> Of course there is always risk involved when making changes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would recommend to back up your files before you make the change if possible . Another thing you can try is to add a new field to the template . Have a workflow put the value of that list field into your new field as a placeholder . Then make the change to the field type . If for some reason data gets lost , you still have the original value in that new field that you created . <p> The Laserfiche Admin Console does do a good job of warning when field values will be affected ( lost or truncated ) and my testing made me feel good about making the change but like you said there is always risk involved when making any change . Since I 'm dealing with 187,000 entries I ca n't ignore the " what if " factor . Thanks for the suggestions in your second paragraph as well . I will make sure to do this off-hours after a good DB backup . <p> My sample size is much smaller than yours , but I just tried converting a list field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version 9.1 ) , and I had no issues--the field was converted and all the existing values on documents remained intact . ( But of course , doing this kind of thing with a good working backup on hand is always an excellent practice ! ) <p> I was just faced with this situation and had no other option but to do the change . The client had well over 100,000 documents utilizing only list values and everything converted fine , we were on version 9.1 . Of course , always get a back up just in case . Everyone 's set up is so different ! <p> So I understand the logic that if you change field type from Text to Number , you would lose " Alan " because Alan is not a number ... but what if the field was initially setup as a " Text " field ... and all that were in there were numbers ... would that info stay if you convert it to a " Number " field ... or same issue ? <p> The documents that have " Choice C " will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modifying that field for other documents or assigning that field to new documents , " Choice C " will no longer be an option . <p> As a recommendation , it 's always good to test this on a small scale with isolated documents . You can also take a backup of the repository before making a change like this . However , changing the list field options like this is safe and should behave like I stated above .

@@98006146 @2206146/ <h> Question <h> Question <h> Wait condition met but workflow does not move to next step <p> This has been happening to me for years now with a small percentage of a particular workflow 's instances . I worked with support a few months ago ( we are a VAR ) and after much haggling , they advised us to upgrade from 8.3 to 9 . <p> As an aside : The experience with support was nothing short of unpleasant , but that is not the topic of this thread . Suffice to say , I have sought help from Laserfiche Support with this in the past and would now like to pursue answers from the community . ( not that I would not welcome answers from Laserfiche support personnel or any other Laserfiche representatives , just hoping to receive better results from this forum . <p> Upgrading to 9 seemed to resolve the issue for a while , but I 'm starting to the see it again . Affected workflows show that the condition has been met , but the entry does not move . This happens only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank you for sending a copy of your database to Tech Support . We were able to narrow down your issue . Tech Support will be emailing the same information to you shortly , but I am posting it here anyway since this thread has been getting so much attention . <p> The problem seems to happen when the email or export entry tasks ca n't notify their corresponding activities that they have completed . This seems to be an issue with how Windows Workflow Foundation handles tasks with longer names . Since it is not in our code , confirming our assumptions and implementing a fix is taking a bit longer . We are still investigating the best way to handle the issue . <p> We wo n't be able to get the stuck instance to move on , since there is no way to signal to the instance that the task is completed from outside of the task itself . However , you can side-step the issue for now in future instances by turning off the option to run these 2 activities as tasks . To do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Server Configuration node and open the Advanced Server Options dialog . In the Activity Performance tab , uncheck the boxes labeled " Email " and " Export Entry " . <p> This is a requisition and purchasing workflow , so the entry flows from the initiator to their department director for approval . We have a list field ' DirectorApproval ' with options for Approved , Denied , Pending , and Not Required . I have a wait condition the routing activity for the Dept Director that waits for DirectorApproval to equal Approved or Denied . <p> Every once in a while the Director will mark the field Approved , and Workflow apparently recognizes the condition is met - according to the Conditions tab in the Workflow details - but does not move on from the Routing Activity to the next activity . Like its still waiting , but the condition clearly shows it has been met . <p> I have Input Entry selected in the ' Wait until these conditions are satisfied for ' field under Wait Conditions tab . The routed entry and input entry should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing around this requisition to get various approvals . <p> Because this is a production environment and the issue has been ongoing for some time , management requests for me to terminate and restart these as soon as I discover them . <p> I manually terminated and restarted the workflow to keep them operating . <p> That in itself should be telling : I made the workflow so that it checks the various approval fields before routing to the user for approval . This way if a field is already Approved , Denied , or Not Required , Workflow bypasses routing to them . I am able to restart these workflows without altering any fields and on subsequent workflow instances , the field is recognized as being Approved , Denied , or Not Required and is routed accordingly <p> It 's pretty hard to tell what is going on without looking at the log files or knowing which version we 're talking about . Each subsequent screenshot gives a bit more information , but not enough . The last one shows the routing activity was canceled , which usually indicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that got canceled is not visible . <p> Please open a case with tech support and attach the workflow logs . You can request escalation if your case is not handled in a timely manner . <p> We have also had issues for years where simple workflows should ' move document(s) to a folder ' . However they did not move the document every single time . If we had 20 docs to move at once , it would move 18 . Or it could be a onezy twozy and it would not move . Just as you have done , we look at Workflow and it shows they all completed . So every 3-4 months staff hasto do a search on their ' trigger field ' values and then see where the ' location ' of the document is . If it did not move ... put a ' space bar ' in a field to retrigger it again . <p> I have asked for help on this also for years . I have asked if there was a way to have part of workflow a confirmation where if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does , and if not it notifies me . So if you find out why , it would be great to hear what may be causing it . I would look for similarites with my work flows . These are critical moves in many situations and we need better accuracy . <p> I am keen to see the outcome of this thread . I also have a customer with exactly the same issue that comes up time and again and is persistent across WF upgrades . Since it is a very busy system , up to 15 000 running/waiting instances at any given time and between 15000 and 20000 new instances triggered per day , this issue tends to come up often , albeit at random . <p> Usually only spotted once users complain that files are not moving after updating them . <p> I am actually troubleshooting a few issues in an open case at the moment and I can only come up with some wild theories at this point as to why WF may be behaving this way . <p> I 'll be keeping an eye on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover anything concrete . ; - ) <p> Sheldon , with that many running/waiting instances , have you looked at the feasibility of ending that workflow , starting a new one , and incorporating what was in the wait condition into your starting rule for the new workflow ? Just thought that be more efficient and not keep so many open at a given point in time . <p> Support did a remote session to our Workflow server . After poking around a good bit , they recommended we upgrade to latest version . We were on 9.1.0 and have upgraded to 9.1.1.486 . Upgrade was just done , so I will keep this thread updated on if the issue recurs . <p> Thinking I have made significant progress towards discovering the cause - and possibly an actual resolution to this issue that has plagued me for so long , I reported my above findings immediately to Support . <p> 1- Publish a WF with Route Entry to Folder with waiting status for example &lt;tag&gt; is set and to Send Email every 5 minutes for 60 email - the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in waiting state while sending emails . <p> 2- Run it on entry <p> Definition : Version 1 Designer : Version 1 - Waiting <p> Diagnostic : Version 1 - False - Next Timer : ( Date/Time + 5 minutes ) <p> 2- Wait for the first email to be sent so you can 5 minutes to do next step <p> 7- Set the tag to true to end the wait and you will see an activity ( wait for entry change ) highlighted in blue in the instance details , but the conditions tab shows the conditions for it have evaluated successfully . <p> This is a known issue . I 've filed it in our bug tracker and there is no resolution yet . It only happens when intermediate versions between the running instance 's version and the current version are deleted . It has nothing to do with the issue that started this thread . <p> In the above 7 steps to reproduce the problem , I did n't delete any version . <p> Step 1 is brand new WF , and until step 7 I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Update : <p> I want to note that when I updated the running waiting workflow I can see this message " Successfully update workflow " Test to version 2 " <p> I used your recommendation in this thread : " you can side-step the issue for now in future instances by turning off the option to run these 2 activities as tasks .

In this case unlikely the one need update in logic is running . <p> Never update running WF instance , and if users ask for change in logic it apply only for future WF , which is little bit confusing for the users and for me as well . <p> I am interested to know if your WF admin console Error Log : Current Error Log + rolled over logs , got this error : Object reference not set to an instance of an object , in this case we both having the same problem . <p> Note that I did n't delete any version from Definition History for the above 7 steps . <p> If you delete versions you may activate this bug although I think it is fixed the last time I checked it out <p> Ali , I understand your frustration , but , like John 's original issue , this is not a problem that can be resolved here . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm locking this thread since the original question has been investigated and answered . <p> Bonnie &amp; Sheldon : Thank you very much for validating that I 'm not crazy or making a careless mistake somewhere ! As a technical- , analytical- , scientific-minded guy who believes that the computer universe is governed strictly by cause &amp; effect rules , this is the kind of problem that keeps me up at night . The more of us we can find , the more data we 'll have to establish a pattern or some kind of link . <p> John Geist : Thanks for your input ; I have not tried separating out the wait condition , but I can see how that would at least give better tracking info , and maybe even give me better results . That may be the next thing I try . <p> Currently , I do have a ' Check ' workflow , running on a 15 minute schedule from 7:00a - 6:00p , that goes through each folder where entries wait . For each entry , if the appropriate wait condition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . not ideal , but at least I do n't have to wait to hear it ' through the grape vine ' . <p> I 've noticed 2 problems with this ' Check ' workflow - the first of which , I feel I can address ; the second , I 'm not so sure . <p> 1 . if I do n't address a given entry within 15 minutes of reporting , the check workflow will trigger another email on the next check . I 'm going to use a ' Stuck ' tag in attempt to prevent these repeats . <p> 2 . If the Check WF happens to catch an entry where the wait condition has been met , but workflow has n't had reasonable time to act , a false positive will be reported . I was hoping to somehow check when the wait condition was met and compare that time to current time . A difference of more than five minutes surely indicates the workflow is stuck , I figure . <p> My two cents .... I have found that separating the wait condition out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give better visibility for tracking , such putting that right before the routing activity . Have you tried that by chance ? <p> I noted yesterday that some instances show a status of Running in the Search Results pane , while the majority have Waiting status . Those running instances seem to stay running for longer than any activity should run . So , I went to digging . <p> Those instances that were sitting with Running status showed an email activity that had been running for more than a few minutes - days in most cases . See , my WFs are setup so that if they are not acted on by designated users , an email is sent to a manager everyday . Every day for 90 days . Eventually that repeating email child activity - its parent activity is a Route to User activity - hangs and runs indefinitely . So when the user does change their approval field , the wait condition is met , but the instance is still stuck on running that email activity . See below , a normal instance 's activities tab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We are experiencing the same problems as being described . We have however 2 variations to the this problem . <p> 1 . Where the Entry Condition is met and workflow recognizes that the condition is met when looking at the conditions tab , but still the workflow does not progress . the only solution is to manually complete or terminate the Workflow and restart it on the document . On this we were also advised to upgrade which we did a couple of weeks ago . <p> 2. where the Entry Condition is met and workflow does not seem to recognize the change in the entry has taken place . In this instance , you could find the event in the subscriber , but the even does not seem to be promoted to the workflow service . In some cases we found you can do one of the following for workflow to become aware of the change : <p> a . Change the condition being evaluated back to a " false " state , save the document and then change it back to a " true " state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then become aware of the condition being met and carry on . <p> b . In some instances we found if the Entry is manually moved to a different folder , then Workflow becomes aware of the Change that initially should have made the waiting condition become satisfied . <p> c. some instances nothing neither of the 2 approaches mentioned above worked and the only way to get workflow back on track is to complete or terminate the workflow and start it again on the document . <p> The second variation is still happening on 9.1.1.365 and just this morning we had 22 entries effected by this . <p> To clarify , I do have the same symptoms that Vincent Kelly mentioned in #1 . This is often how I get notified of the issue - a user will change an approval field and expect the entry to move and it does not . On viewing the instance in WF Designer , Conditions tab , I do see that even though a wait condition is shown to be met , the entry does not move . It seems in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity hanging . <p> Right , I did n't say it very well . In your case , from the other screenshots , it is the Email activity causing problems . The condition evaluation happens on the subscriber , so it would get done anyway . However , because the Email tasks is stuck , the activity never knows it can move on . <p> In Vincent 's case , we would need to look at the instances in question to see if it is the same problem or something different . Vincent 's second problem would be entirely different because we would have to look at the Subscriber to see if the event ever came in to be evaluated or if the LFServer never sent the notification . 
@@98006149 @2206149/ <h> Question <h> Question <h> I have a color tiff that I want to copy and put into a folder as B/W . What would be my process <p> We have a document that is color as it is routed for signatures using Workflow . For it 's final destination ( once all signatures are captured ) , we want it to be convereted to black and white ( save space ) for storage until it meets it 's retention requirements . Using Workflow how can I accomplish this task using 8.3 or 9. x ? <h> Answer <p> Workflow does not do any image processing out of the box . If you need the process to be fully automated , you can do it with Quick Fields Agent . Essentially , Workflow can place all documents that are ready for archival in a folder . Quick Fields can then take them from that folder on a regular basis ( which can be scheduled with the Agent module ) , convert them to black and white and then place them in their final destination . <p> If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this color conversion manually using Photodocs . You should begin by creating a copy of the color document . Then , if you right-click the copy , one of the options will be " Reprocess with Photodocs . " This assumes Photodocs is installed on your computer . Once the document opens , you can run color conversion processes on them . <p> See below for an example . I have a picture of a Koala in the repository that I opened in Photodocs . One of the options in the toolbar is color conversion , which comes with three options . The one I have selected converts the page to black and white when clicked . <p> Once color conversion is done , you can click Store on the bottom right corner , and copy the document ( now black and white ) to the folder you want . Here 's what my koala looks like now : <p> Photodocs is nice because it also gives you the ability to select multiple processes ( such as cropping ) , saving them as a profile and running them on groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations in batches once per day or even once per week . It still has to be done manually but this can save you a few steps . <h> Replies <p> I found that for use only as image compression , uncheck everything except the first button on CONVERT COLOR . That 's the " Black and White " option . If you have CROP or ROTATE checked , it potentially creates squished or wavey images on some pages . Once you uncheck everything but CONVERT COLOR , it works fantastic . Takes a 995mb scanned color file down to 20mb ! Phenomenal results , and image quality is unchanged . I was using the JPEG compression set to 80% . <p> CAUTION : The Laserfiche Scanning interface creates huge file sizes when scanning directly into a Laserfiche folder when the scanner is set to Color TIFF . Either create the document OUTSIDE of Laserfiche and drag/drop in , or only use Black and White scan settings within Laserfiche.

@@98006153 @2206153/ <h> Answer <p> APPROVED ANSWERSELECTED ANSWER <p> replied on February 25 , 2014 <p> There are a few ways you can do this . <p> 1 . Edit the codebehind for each of the pages that contain the link for " My WebLink " and change the href from MyWebLink.aspx to your internal page . The various pages are Welcome.aspx.vb , Browse.aspx.vb , DocView.aspx.vb , and Search.aspx.vb . The line you want to change is <p> PrefsLink.HRef = " MyWebLink.aspx " &amp; OneDBID <p> Note that you 'll need to recompile the application afterwards . <p> 2 . The other option is to hide the " My WebLink " link in the aspx pages and create your own link directly in the HTML on the actual aspx pages . The benefit of this is that you wo n't need to recompile
