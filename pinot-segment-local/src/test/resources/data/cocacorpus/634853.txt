For a more detailed introduction on G-LISA assays and a listing of other available G-LISA kits , see our main G-LISA page . The BK124 Rho activation assay kit measures the level of GTP-loaded RhoA only in cells . The level of activation is measured with absorbance set at 490nm . For a kit to measure RhoA activation with luminescence detection , see Cat . # BK121 . <p> Kit contentsThe kit contains sufficient reagents to perform 96 RhoA activation assays . Since the Rho-GTP affinity wells are supplied as strips and the strips can be broken into smaller pieces , each kit can be used for anywhere from one to multiple assays . The following components are included in the kit : <p> Question 1 : Can I detect isoforms other than RhoA , Rac1 or RalA with these G-LISA activation assays ? <p> Answer 1 : Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rac1 G-LISA ( Cat . # BK128 ) and RalA G-LISA ( Cat . # BK129 ) can be used to detect RhoB or RhoC , Rac 2 or Rac3 or RalB , respectively . The capture proteins that the wells have been coated with bind all of the isoforms of the respective GTPase . The specificity of signal is conferred by the specificity of the monoclonal primary antibody utilized . Use of an isoform-specific monoclonal antibody allows detection of other Rho family isoforms . Please see this citation for an example of this modified procedure ( Hall et al. , 2008 . Type I Collagen Receptor ( a21 ) Signaling Promotes Prostate Cancer Invasion through RhoC GTPase .

Under these conditions the protein is stable for 6 months . Lyophilized protein can also be stored desiccated at -70C where it will be stable for 6 months . However , at -70C the rubber seal in the lid of the tube could crack and allow in moisture . Therefore we recommend storing at 4C . If stored at -70C , it is imperative to include desiccant with the lyophilized protein if this storage condition is utilized . After reconstituting the protein as directed , the concentrated protein in G-PEM buffer should be aliquoted , snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70C ( stable for 6 months ) . NOTE : It is very important to snap freeze the tubulin in liquid nitrogen as other methods of freezing will result in significantly reduced activity . Defrost rapidly by placing in a room temperature water bath for 1 min . Avoid repeated freeze/thaw cycles . <p> Question 2 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and GTP for resuspending tubulin ? <p> Answer 2 : We recommend resuspending tubulin in general tubulin buffer + GTP to maintain tubulin monomer protein stability and conformation and to provide the necessary components for polymerization . For resuspension , we recommend using a general tubulin buffer ( Cat . # BST01-001 ) which consists of 80 mM PIPES , 2 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA , pH 7.0 , supplemented with 1 mM GTP ( Cat . # BST06-001 ) . Tubulin requires GTP and magnesium ions for proper stability and conformation , even in its monomeric state . GTP is also required for the polymerization process as its hydrolysis during tubulin polymerization is necessary for polymerization to occur . EGTA is a chelator of calcium which is a potent inhibitor of tubulin polymerization . Glycerol is often added to a final concentration of 5 - 10% to enhance polymerization ; however , glycerol is not necessary for the maintenance of biologically active tubulin and does not need to be included when reconstituting and storing tubulin . When aliquoting reconstituted tubulin for storage , it is essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of &gt;6 mg/ml to preserve tubulins biological activity . Then the aliquots should be stored at -70C . When thawing the aliquots , thaw rapidly in a room temperature water bath and place on ice until right before experimental use .

The level of activation is measured with luminescence . For a more detailed introduction on G-LISA assays and a listing of other available G-LISA kits , see our main G-LISA page . The Rac1 G-LISA Activation Assay ( Cat. # BK126 ) measures the level of GTP-loaded Rac1 protein in cell lysates , this is in contrast to Cat .

Why ? <p> Answer 1 : To accurately measure luminescence signal intensity between the positive control and buffer blank , please check the instrument settings on the luminometer ( see below for suggestions ) . We also recommend running some " set-up " experiments with just the buffer blank and positive control to determine optimal settings for detecting the positive control signal 3-5 fold higher than the buffer blank . It is also important to remember to use a fresh control protein tube for each run of positive control samples . Do not store and re-use the positive control . <p> Machine Settings <p> Gain <p> Gain controls the sensitivity of the machine . Most luminometers do not allow manual alteration of gain and use an auto-calibration or limited calibration function . Turn off auto-settings and auto-calibration to use the machine in manual mode .

It is a good idea to set the machine at the lowest integration time ( usually 10 100 ms ) . Integration times greater than 200 ms are likely to read out of the linear range of the assay and may require lowering of gain or dilution of primary and/or secondary antibodies . <p> Shaking <p> Most machines give the shaking option .

@@109313858 @4713858/ <h> YAP1 grabs the spotlight in oncogenic Ras addiction <h> YAP1 and the Hippo Pathway <p> The Hippo signal transduction pathway plays a critical role in the regulation of organ size through the coordinated modulation of cell fate1 . The core pathway members include two sets of serine/threonine kinases ( MST1/2 and LATS1/2 ) that act in succession to shut down pro-growth signaling through the phosphorylation and " inactivation " of the transcriptional co-activators YAP and TAZ2,3 ( Fig. 1 ) . YAP and TAZ are paralogous proteins that have overlapping , but not identical , functions in regulating cell growth , differentiation , and apoptosis4 . For simplicity , this newsletter will focus specifically on YAP1 ; however most of what will be discussed has been shown to be true for TAZ . The MST1/2 LATS1/2 YAP1 signaling axis is activated as a result of a cell 's response to physical changes in the extracellular environment , including cell adhesion , cell-cell contacts , and extracellular matrix stiffness , etc.5 . Notably , several signaling pathways intersect with the Hippo pathway to ultimately control YAP1 activity6 . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by LATS1/2 on multiple serine residues ( S61 , S109 , S127 , S164 , S381 ) , which subsequently leads to the binding of 14-3-3 to phosphorylated S127 and the cytoplasmic retention of YAP13 . Additionally , the phosphorylation of S381 facilitates the binding of CK1d/e , leading to further serine phosphorylations ( S384 , S387 ) that promote the interaction of YAP1 with the SCFbTRCP ubiquitin ligase complex . This chain of events results in YAP1 ubiquitination and subsequent proteosome-dependent degradation7 . In the absence of Hippo pathway signaling , YAP1 is shuttled into the nucleus where its primary nuclear partners are the TEAD transcription factors4 . Importantly , there are several other transcription factors that have been shown to partner with YAP1 in a context-dependent manner ( e.g. , SMADs , -catenin , Fos , E2F , etc. ) 4,8,9 ( Fig. 1 ) . <h> The role of YAP1 in cancer is complex <p> The overexpression of YAP1 in non-transformed cells leads to its nuclear accumulation , resulting in adhesion-independent cell growth , **25;27;TOOLONG transition ( EMT ) , suppression of apoptosis , and growth factor-independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct cause and effect relationship has not been firmly established for YAP1 and the development of cancer , it is clear that in most contexts elevated YAP1 activity would support neoplastic behavior . Consistent with the in vitro YAP1 overexpression studies , several cancers have been shown to exhibit elevated YAP1 expression2,11 . Moreover , elevated YAP1 activity has been correlated to a poor prognosis in several cancers12,13 . The etiology of YAP1 activation in cancer is varied and often results from the dysregulation of the Hippo pathway and/or the amplification of the 11q22 genomic locus that encompasses the YAP1 gene10,14,15 . In contrast to its association with cancer progression , there are cases where YAP1 appears to act as a tumor suppressor ( e.g. , breast cancer and some colon cancers ) 16,17 . One clue to this apparent paradox for YAP1 activity comes from studies looking at the phosphorylation of YAP1 on two tyrosine residues ( Y357 and Y391 ) by kinases in well-established pro-oncoprotein signaling pathways . The tyrosine kinase YES1 phosphorylates YAP1 on Y357 , thereby fostering its interaction with -catenin to drive Wnt pathway signaling18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrosine kinase c-Abl phosphorylates YAP1 on Y391 in response to DNA damage , leading to its association with p73 and the recruitment of p300 to stimulate the transcription of proapoptotic genes20 a decidedly tumor suppressive activity . In both cases , YAP1 is active and nuclear , but the diametrically opposed transcription programs that are activated are dictated by signal dependent interactions between YAP1 and different nuclear binding partners . <h> YAP can overcome oncogenic Ras addiction <p> Recent evidence has shed light on the importance of YAP1 in Ras-dependent cancers8,9,21,22 . Gain of function mutations in Ras ( H- , K- , or N-Ras ) have been observed in 33% of all human cancers23,24 . These mutant Ras isoforms are dominant drivers of oncogenesis and the resultant cancers are highly dependent , or " addicted " , to mutant Ras signaling for their survival25,26 . YAP1 has been identified as a critical factor in oncogenic Ras signaling that allows cells to overcome their Ras addiction8,9,22 . Ras signaling modulates YAP1 activity at multiple levels , including the inactivation of LATS kinases27 , and through the regulation of YAP1 turnover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCFTRCP complex employed by the Hippo signaling pathway22 ( Fig. 1 ) . In the latter case , Ras signaling downregulates the expression of SOCS6 , which is the YAP1 substrate recognition component of the Elongin B/C ubiquitin ligase complex22 . This ultimately leads to increased levels of YAP1 , its nuclear accumulation , and the activation of pro-oncogenic transcription that is mediated through its binding partners Fos and TEAD2/E2F8,9,22 ( Fig. 1 ) . <h> Conclusion <p> The finding that YAP1 can overcome oncogenic Ras addiction , and that its activity is elevated in several cancers , implies that therapeutics targeting Ras alone will likely be met with resistance that is mediated in part by YAP1 . Moreover , YAP1 can act in a cell context dependent manner in either a pro-oncogenic or tumor suppressive capacity , suggesting that there may be therapeutic opportunities to promote its tumor suppressive behavior when developing drugs to target oncogenic Ras . Importantly , the activity of YAP1 is significantly modulated by several post-translational modifications ( PTMs ) ( i.e. , serine and tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitination ) .

@@109313860 @4713860/ <h> Citrullination : Taking the Charge out of Arg <p> Protein citrullination ( a.k.a. deimination ) is a novel arginine-directed post-translational modification ( PTM ) that results in a permanent change in the targeted protein . Peptidylarginine deiminases ( PADs ) mediate the calcium-dependent deimination of the guanidino group of arginine side chains to form an ureido group and the nonstandard amino acid citrulline ( see Fig. 1 ) . There are 5 different PAD isoforms ( PAD1-4 , PAD6 ) that share significant sequence homology and differ primarily in their tissue-specific expression1 . PADs are incapable of deiminating free L-arginine , which confirms their primary role in the modification of arginine side chains present in proteins2 . To date , there have been no enzymes identified that can reverse this process . <p> The deimination of arginine side chains in proteins results in the net loss of a positive charge and an increase in local hydrophobicity for the target protein .

This nucleotide free complex will then take up a new nucleotide after which the GEF is released from the GTPase . Because GEFs typically have a higher affinity for GDP-bound GTPases than for the corresponding GTP-bound GTPase and the intracellular ratio of GTP to GDP is about 10:1 , GEFs will drive the exchange from GDP-bound GTPases to GTP-bound GTPases <p> The fluorophore based assay in this kit is suitable for measuring nucleotide exchange on GTPases in either 96-well or 384-well format . The kit measures the uptake of the fluorescent nucleotide analog N-methylanthraniloyl-GTP ( mant-GTP ) into GTPases . The uptake can be measured due to the spectroscopic difference between free and GTPase-bound mant-GTP . As mant-GTP gets bound in the nucleotide binding pocket of a GTPase , its fluorescence ( ex : 360 nm , em : 440 nm ) increases dramatically ( 1 , 2 ) . Therefore , the enhancement of mant-GTP fluorescent intensity in the presence of a small GTPase indicates nucleotide uptake ( or exchange for already bound nucleotide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buffers and reagents needed for the assay , a 96 and a 384-well plate , as well as human Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA GTPases and the GEF domain of Dbs as a positive control GEF .

The kit also comes with a 384-well and 96-well plate along with exchange buffer that contains the mant-GTP . Once bound to GTPases , the fluorophore emission intensity of mant-GTP increases approximately 1.1 to 2.0 fold depending on the protein . Therefore , the enhancement of fluorescent intensity in the presence of small GTPases and GEFs will reflect the respective GEF activities of known or unknown proteins .

KSP plays a critical role in mitotic spindle pole separation , and its inhibition results in the formation of monoaster spindles which is thought to lead to mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis1 . From a therapeutic standpoint , it was anticipated that inhibiting KSP would produce antimitotic benefits by targeting microtubules with fewer and less severe side effects . Microtubule targeting drugs ( e.g. , Paclitaxel and Vincristine ) are quite efficacious and continue to be a front line therapeutic approach for several cancers ( e.g. , ovarian , breast , gastroesophageal ) 2 . These drugs , however , are associated with significant and occasionally debilitating side effects2,3 . Although microtubules play a critical role in chromosomal segregation during mitosis , they also have important roles in postmitotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microtubule-targeted drugs , leading to peripheral neuropathies2,3 .

The Cdc42 G-LISA Activation Assay measures the entire level of GTP-loaded Cdc42 protein in cell lysates . The level of activation is measured by reading at OD490nm . For a more detailed introduction on G-LISA assays and a listing of other available G-LISA kits , see our main G-LISA page .

Cell lysates subjected to the G-LISA assay and OD was read at 490 nm . The " controlled state " serum starved value ( 0.22 ) was subtracted from these samples prior to plotting . At 100 ng/ml the total activation was 2.1 fold or 110% over the controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be performed in one afternoon . <p> Kit contents The kit contains sufficient reagents to perform 96 Cdc42 activation assays . Since the Cdc42-GTP affinity wells are supplied as strips and the strips can be broken into smaller pieces , each kit can be used for anywhere from 1 to 96 assays . The following components are included in the kit : <p> Question 1 : Can I use the lysis buffer from the Cdc42 G-LISA activation assay kit ( Cat . # BK127 ) to prepare samples for the other G-LISA assays ? <p> Answer 1 : The Rac1 and RhoA G-LISAs use the same lysis buffer ( Part # GL36 ) . The Cdc42 G-LISA kit ( Cat . # BK127 ) uses a different lysis buffer ( Part # GL35 ) . The buffer components are proprietary , but in general , the lysis buffers contain a buffer , detergents and salts . GL35 is about 2X more concentrated than GL36 in regard to salt and detergent concentrations . So you could make the extracts in GL35 and dilute them in GL36 for the Rac1 and RhoA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for approximately 0.5-1 mg/ml protein concentration when performing the lysis . At higher concentrations , you are likely to have significant loss of signal due to proteolysis , increased phosphatase/kinase activity and increased GAP activity . <p> Question 2 : How many cell culture plates can I process at one time during the lysis step ? <p> Answer 2 : We recommend that from the point at you add lysis buffer to the plate on ice to aliquoting and snap-freezing the lysate samples in liquid nitrogen , no more than 10 min are allowed to elapse . After 10 min on ice , we find that GTP bound to GTPases ( activated GTPases ) undergoes rapid hydrolysis . Rapid processing at 4C is essential for accurate and reproducible results . The following guidelines are useful for rapid washing of cells . <p> Washing <p> a . Retrieve culture dish from incubator , immediately aspirate out all of the media and place firmly on ice . <p> c . Aspirate off all residual PBS buffer . This is essential so that the Lysis Buffer is not diluted . Correct aspiration requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ice for 1 min to allow excess PBS to collect in the vessel for complete removal . As noted , the time period between cell lysis and addition of lysates to the wells is critically important . Take the following precautions : <p> 1 . Work quickly . <p> 2 . Keeping solutions and lysates embedded in ice so that the temperature is below 4C . This helps to minimize changes in signal over time . <p> 3 . We strongly recommend that cell lysates be immediately frozen after harvest and clarification . A sample of at least 20 l should be kept on ice for protein concentration measurement . The lysates must be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70C . Lysates should be stored at -70C for no longer than 30 days . <p> 4 . Thawing of cell lysates prior to use in the G-LISA assay should be in a room temperature water bath , followed by rapid transfer to ice and immediate use in the assay .

They also play a major role in the organization of cytoskeletal architecture as evidenced in the establishment of the microtubule spindle during mitosis ( 2 ) . <p> Kinesins operate by utilizing the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move along their microtubule ( MT ) substrates .

It is therefore very important to use a spectrophotometer that has a narrow bandwidth in order that the wavelength for reading the assay does not encroach upon the 340 nm range . It is recommended that a monochromatic spectrophotometer such as a SpectroMax 350 ( Molecular Devices ) be used when possible as the bandwidth in these machines is very narrow ( 2-5 nm ) . If a filter based system is being used then it is important to make sure that the filter bandwidth is 10 nm or less , if not the result will be a ) significant background noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The spectrophotometer should be at room temperature and set on kinetic mode and it is recommended to take a reading once every 30 seconds .

Polymerization is followed by fluorescence enhancement due to the incorporation of a fluorescent reporter into microtubules as polymerization occurs . The standard assay uses neuronal tubulin ( Cat . # T240 ) , which generates a polymerization curve representing the three phases of microtubule formation ; namely nucleation , growth and steady state equilibrium . Other tubulins , such as HeLa cell tubulin ( Cat . # H001 ) can also be used in this assay .

@@109313872 @4713872/ <p> Introduction The Rho switch operates by alternating between an active , GTP-bound state and an inactive , GDP-bound state . Understanding the mechanisms that regulate activation / inactivation of the GTPases is of obvious biological significance and is a subject of intense investigation . The fact that many Rho family effector proteins will specifically recognize the GTP bound form of the protein has been exploited experimentally to develop a powerful affinity purification assay that monitors Rac and Cdc42 protein activation . The assay uses the Cdc42/Rac Interactive Binding ( CRIB ) region ( also called the p21 Binding Domain , PBD ) of the Cdc42 / Rac effector protein , p21 activated kinase 1 ( PAK ) . The CRIB/PBD protein motif has been shown to bind specifically to the GTP-bound form of Rac and/or Cdc42 proteins . The fact that the PBD region of PAK has a high affinity for both GTP-Rac and GTP-Cdc42 and that PAK binding results in a significantly reduced intrinsic and catalytic rate of hydrolysis of both Rac and Cdc42 make it an ideal tool for affinity purification of GTP-Rac and GTP-Cdc42 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponds to residues 67-150 . This includes the highly conserved CRIB region ( aa 74-88 ) plus sequences required for the high affinity interaction with GTP-Rac and GTP-Cdc42 . The PAK-PBD is in the form of a GST fusion protein , which allows one to " pull-down " the PAK-PBD/GTP-Cdc42 ( or GTP-Rac ) complex with glutathione affinity beads . The assay therefore provides a simple means of quantitating Rac/Cdc42 activation in cells . The amount of activated Cdc42 is determined by a Western blot using a Cdc42 specific antibody . <p> Kit contents The kit contains sufficient materials for 50 assays , depending on assay setup , and includes reagents for positive and negative controls . The following components are included : <p> Example results The Cdc42 activation assay was tested by loading the Cdc42 protein in cell lysates with either GTP ? S or GDP . As expected , the GTP ? S-loaded Cdc42 is very efficiently precipitated while very little GDP-loaded Cdc42 is precipitated ( Fig. 2 ) . <p> Incubating with the primary antibody overnight at 4C and using the appropriate ECL detection system . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use for my pull-down experiments ? <p> Answer 2 : PAK-PBD-GST beads ( Cat . # PAK02 ) will bind to Cdc42-GDP with a much lower affinity than Cdc42-GTP . If too many PAK-PBD beads are added to the pull-down assay , there will be significant binding to inactive ( GDP-bound ) Cdc42 . The result of this will be an underestimation of Cdc42 activation . For this reason , we highly recommend performing a bead titration to determine optimal conditions for any given Cdc42 activation or inactivation assay . Once optimal conditions have been established , bead titrations should no longer be necessary . We recommend 10 , 15 and 20 g bead titrations . <p> Question 3 : How can I test whether the beads are working properly ? <p> Answer 3 : A standard biological assay for PAK-PBD GST protein beads consists of a Cdc42 protein pull-down from cells loaded with either GTP ? S ( Cat . # BS01 ) or GDP . Here are guidelines to follow ( see Cat . # PAK02 or BK034 datasheets for more details ) : <p> Positive Cellular Protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) should be loaded with GTP ?

The only difference between the two absorbance-based kits is that BK004P uses 97% pure tubulin ( remaining 3% are MAPs ) while BK006P uses &gt;99% pure tubulin . This is an important difference because the presence of MAPs means that tubulin polymerization can be examined in the absence of enhancers such as glycerol or taxol with as little as 3 or 4 mg/ml tubulin using the BK004P kit . In this case MAPs act as polymerization enhancers . With BK006P , an enhancer such as glycerol or taxol must be used to drive tubulin polymerization with concentrations &lt;5 mg/ml tubulin .

@@109313886 @4713886/ <h> Rho GTPases and Reactive Oxygen Species : Crosstalk and Feedback <p> Redox agents , such as reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and reactive nitrogen species ( RNS ) , are key regulators in a variety of signal transduction pathways , including integrin signaling , extracellular matrix adhesion , and inflammation1-3 . Rho GTPases are also key regulators of many cellular processes , including cell growth , motility , and adhesion4 . While redox agents and Rho GTPases operate through a wide array of regulatory mechanisms , crosstalk between ROS/RNS and Rho GTPases is thought to play a pivotal role in many of their physiological functions5,6 and in a growing number of pathological processes such as acute lung injury and cancer7,8 . This newsletter broadly summarizes some established and emerging concepts in this rapidy developing field ( Fig. 1 ) . <h> Regulation of ROS by Rho GTPases <p> Major sources of cellular ROS/RNS production are the primary redox-modulating enzymes such as NADPH oxidases ( NOX ) , nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) , and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) 5,9,10 ( Fig. 1 ) . Rho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary component of activated NOX complexes and the subsequent generation of ROS ( superoxide anion , O2. - ) from molecular oxygen ( O2 ) 11 . Upon activation by extracellular signals , the NOX complex assembles at the cell membrane where Rac ( GTP-bound and possibly GDI-bound ) is required for ROS generation12,13 ( Fig. 1 ) . It is not yet clear if Rac acts as an adaptor or mediates electron transfer during O2. - production12 . Rac , specifically Rac1 , has also been shown to directly interact with NOS enzymes to regulate the generation of nitric oxide ( NO ) 13 . The authors found that NOS preferentially binds nucleotide-free GTPase , suggesting the involvement of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) and GEF-mediated cellular compartmentalization of Rac-mediated NO generation13 . Finally , Rac has been shown to interact directly , in a redox-dependent manner , with SOD , an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of O2. -to hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) 14 . Under reducing conditions , similar to those in a cell , Rac-GTP binds to SOD , which allows Rac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of O2. - by NOX . Under oxidizing conditions , like those produced locally by O2. - / H2O2 generation , SOD was found to dissociate from Rac which was then converted to its inactive GDP form , possibly by a yet-to-be-identified GTPase activating protein ( GAP ) 14 . These reports clearly indicate that Rho GTPases can generate a multitude of reactive oxygen intermediates ( RIs ) which can , in turn , result in a diverse array of protein modifications . Which species are generated and the cellular responses elicited will depend upon a number of factors , including the given stimuli , the local cell redox potential , and cellular location . <p> Figure 1 : Schematic Representation of Crosstalk Between Rho GTPases and ROS in Signal Transduction . The diagram is a schematic representation of possible crosstalk between Rho GTPases and ROS/RNS in a stylized cell . Reactions given under indirect ( orange ) , direct ( blue ) and feedback ( pink ) sections are representations of the most commonly reported mechanisms that fall under these headings . For specific pathways , the reader is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Direct and Indirect Regulation of Rho GTPases by ROS <p> Recent evidence points towards the interesting possibility that ROS/RNS can directly regulate Rho GTPases through redox-mediated post-translational modifications ( PTMs ) . For example , Heo and Campbell15 demonstrated that the conserved redox sensitive motif Cys18 ( Rac numbering ) located at the end of the conserved sequence ( GXXXXGK(S/T) ) , found in the p-loop of several Rho GTPases , including RhoA , Rac , and Cdc42 , is the site of redox-mediated reversible cysteine oxidation in vitro . This oxidation results in nucleotide displacement and , under reducing conditions , GTP nucleotide exchange and GTPase activation15 . This mechanism was later verified in vivo when it was shown that H2O2-mediated activation of RhoA and stress fiber formation is abolished by mutation of the cysteines Cys16 and Cys20 ( Rho numbering ) 16 . Importantly , the cysteine mutations do not inhibit the ability of RhoA to be activated by GEFs16 . The authors suggested that GTPase activation likely occurs via two parallel mechanisms , classical enzymatic GEFs/GAPs and a redox-mediated exchange ( Fig. 1 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which mechanism is operational16 . Further evidence for a redox-driven exchange mechanism has come from the finding that RhoA is nitrated at Tyr34 , within the switch one region of the protein , via enhanced NO production due to acute lung injury7 . The authors went on to demonstrate that this PTM produced a GEF-like activation of RhoA . Finally , redox-mediated PTMs have also been proposed to inactivate Rho GTPases17 . <p> In addition to direct regulation , indirect redox-dependent regulation of Rho GTPases involving phosphatases has been reported . For example , Rac-activated ROS production leads to inactivation of RhoA via a mechanism involving redox-mediated inactivation of the low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase ( LMW-PTP ) , subsequent elevation of p190 RhoGAP activity , and deactivation of RhoA18 . Interestingly , inactivation of phosphatases by ROS appears to be a common mechanism for ROS regulation of diverse cell pathways19 ( Fig. 1 ) . <h> Feedback Loops between ROS and Rho GTPases <p> The hypothesis that Rho GTPases participate in redox feedback loops5 has recently been demonstrated for regulation of leukocyte chemotaxis20 ( Fig. 1 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROS that results in a redox-mediated inactivation of a phosphatase . This in turn allows upregulation of a kinase that mediates GEF activation of Rac20 ( Fig. 1 ) .

Why ? <p> Answer 1 : To accurately measure luminescence signal intensity between the positive control and buffer blank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below for suggestions ) . We also recommend running some " set-up " experiments with just the buffer blank and positive control to determine optimal settings for detecting the positive control signal 3-5 fold higher than the buffer blank . It is also important to remember to use a fresh control protein tube for each run of positive control samples . Do not store and re-use the positive control . <p> Machine Settings <p> Gain <p> Gain controls the sensitivity of the machine . Most luminometers do not allow manual alteration of gain and use an auto-calibration or limited calibration function . Turn off auto-settings and auto-calibration to use the machine in manual mode . It is important to contact the luminometer manufacturer or consult the users manual to determine the best way to alter the machine sensitivity . If gain can be altered , one should read at low , medium and high gains to determine the reading within the linear range of the assay ( positive control should be 3-5X higher than blank ) . Gain range varies with instrument . For example , gain in the Tecan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 is the highest ) . <p> Integration Time <p> This parameter can be varied on most machines . It is a good idea to set the machine at the lowest integration time ( usually 10 100 ms ) . Integration times greater than 200 ms are likely to read out of the linear range of the assay and may require lowering of gain or dilution of primary and/or secondary antibodies . <p> Shaking <p> Most machines give the shaking option . The recommended setting is 5 sec shake , medium orbital speed before read . This option is not essential to the assay . <p> Temperature <p> Room temperature <p> Plate type <p> Any setting that specifies 96 well flat , white will be sufficient . <p> Filters <p> Luminescence does not require excitation or emission filters so the filter spaces should be left blank . If this is not an option , excitation can be set at any value and emission should be set between 400-500nm , with 430-445 as optimal setting . <p> Question 2 : My arbitrary luminescence units ( ALU ) or relative luminescence units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the manual . Why ? <p> Answer 2 : This is very typical as the luminescence units will vary from luminometer to luminometer based on the machines sensitivity and instrument settings . The important information to take note of is what the relationship is between buffer blank and positive control luminescence values . The positive control signal should be 3-5 fold greater than the buffer blank luminescence signal . If that is the case , then the G-LISA assay is functioning in the linear range and experimental samples can now be processed .

@@109313906 @4713906/ <p> Introduction There are a multitude of enzymes that hydrolyze ATP or GTP to form ADP or GDP and inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) . The Enzyme Linked Inorganic Phosphate Assay ( ELIPA ) from Cytoskeleton Inc. allows one to measure the phosphate released during hydrolysis on a real time basis . Thus a kinetic assay technique is produced for your enzymes activity . Particular purified enzymes that are applicable to this analysis are signaling phosphatases , apyrase , kinesin motors ( see Fig. 1 ) , metabolic enzymes , membrane transporters and alkaline phosphatase . Generally this assay is useful for enzymes with Kcat above 0.1 , if your enzyme or the family of enzymes has a lower Kcat then the CytoPhosTM Phosphate Assay ( Cat . # BK054 ) is useful . If your enzyme has a very low activity i.e. small G-proteins , the non-radioactive GAP assay ( Cat . # BK105 ) or the radioactive alternative , EasyRad Phosphate Assay ( Cat . # BK055 ) is ideal . <p> The assay is an adaptation of a method originally described by Webb for the measurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activated myosin ATPase ( 1 ) . The assay is based upon an absorbance shift ( 330-360 nm ) that occurs when **33;360;TOOLONG ribonucleoside ( MESG ) is catalytically converted to **27;395;TOOLONG purine in the presence of inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) . The reaction is catalyzed by purine nucleoside phosphorylase ( PNP ) . One molecule of inorganic phosphate will yield one molecule of **27;424;TOOLONG purine in an essentially irreversible reaction ( 2 ) . Thus , the absorbance at 360 nm is directly proportional to the amount of Pi generated in the reaction . <p> Question 1 : What are the recommendations for machine and filter settings for the ATPase/GTPase ELIPA Biochem Kit ( Cat . # BK051/052 ) ? <p> Answer 1 : The assay is based upon an absorption shift from 340 nm to 360 nm . It is therefore very important to use a spectrophotometer that has a narrow bandwidth in order that the wavelength for reading the assay does not encroach upon the 340 nm range . It is recommended that a monochromatic spectrophotometer such as a SpectraMax 250 ( Molecular Devices Inc. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very narrow ( 2-5 nm ) . If a filter based system is being used , then it is important to make sure that the filter is 370 nm with a bandwidth of 10 nm or less . With a broad bandwidth filter , you may experience significant background noise and greatly reduced sensitivity . The spectrophotometer should be at room temperature or 37C depending on your enzyme and set on kinetic mode . It is recommended to take a reading once every 30 s . The control is a reaction minus enzyme which will serve as a background control . Do not pre-read the microtiter plate . Start the kinetic readings at time zero . Make sure that all equipment and pipettes are clean and free of inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) , as this assay measures Pi generation . <p> Answer 2 : We recommend that the test protein be at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and &gt;90% purity . If the test protein exists in a less pure state , we recommend increasing the total protein concentration to compensate for the lower purity . The protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Hepes ( PBS is not suitable ) . The test protein may also require a cofactor . The protein cofactor or buffer condition ( e.g. , microtubules for motor proteins , sometimes an alkaline pH buffer , or a certain ion such as calcium for FtsZ proteins ) must also be free of phosphate ions . A good starting buffer is 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4 plus 20 mM KCl , plus protease inhibitors , phosphatase inhibitors and any co-factors that are necessary .

@@109313910 @4713910/ <p> Introduction The actin binding protein spin-down assay kit provides G- or F-actin plus positive ( a-actinin ) and negative ( Bovine Serum Albumin , BSA ) binding control proteins . Actin binding occurs when there is an affinity for any site of actin . F-actin binding can be measured by using a spin down method . In this way centrifugation is used to separate F-actin from G-actin by differential sedimentation . F-actin binding proteins will co-sediment with actin filaments and form a pellet at the bottom of the centrifugation tube . Proteins with F-actin bundling activity can be detected since they will cause the F-actin to sediment at lower centrifugal forces than normal ( 14,000 x g vs 150,000 x g ) . F-actin severing proteins , G-actin binding proteins or non-actin binding proteins will stay in the supernatant . Severing proteins will be expected if more G-actin remains in the supernatant than in the negative control sample , and this activity should be tested further by measuring F-actin length distributions before and after adding the test protein . G-actin binding proteins can be measured by adding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test protein sequesters G-actin then during the spin-down assay more actin will be left in the supernatant compared with the control . <p> Actin can exist in two forms : Globular subunit ( G-actin ) and Filamentous polymer ( F-actin ) ( See the About Actin page for more information ) . Both forms of actin interact with a plethora of proteins in the cell . To date there are over 50 distinct classes of Actin-Binding Proteins ( ABPs ) , and the inventory is still far from complete . Actin Binding Proteins allow the actin cytoskeleton to respond rapidly to cellular and extracellular signals and are integral to cytoskeletal involvement in many cellular processes . These include cell shape and motility , muscle contraction , intracellular trafficking , cell pathogenesis and signal transduction . <p> This kit contains non-muscle actin ( Cat . # APHL99 ) . The same kit is also available with skeletal muscle actin ( Cat . # AKL99 ) , see Cat . # BK001 . The skeletal muscle actin spin-down kit may be more appropriate to use to study actin binding proteins from muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 30-100 assays depending on assay volume . The following reagents are included : <p> Answer 1 : Make the test protein at the highest possible concentration in an actin compatible buffer such as a HEPES or phosphate buffer . The high concentration ( preferably &gt;20 M ) is necessary to optimize the opportunity to detect interactions between actin and the test protein . In some cases the Kd ( dissociation constant ) of an actin binding protein/actin interaction may be so low as not to be detectable by protein assay of the pellet ; however , the affect on the actin in the reaction mix may be enough to be detected by differences in the amount of actin in the pellet and supernatant versus the negative control . We also recommend centrifuging the test protein at 150,000 x g for 1 h at 4C to remove denatured proteins and cellular debris . This is not necessary if other steps ( e.g. , affinity column purification ) have been taken to purify the test protein . After the high-speed centrifugation , remove the supernatant and place on ice . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength should be below 50 mM , this is due to the character of actin association whereby its mainly ionic and hence will be affected by medium and high salt buffers . A good starting buffer is 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4 plus 20 mM KCl , plus protease inhibitors , phosphatase inhibitors and any co-factors that are necessary . A low salt actin polymerization 10x buffer can be made with 20 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM ATP thus allowing the salt to be kept low in the final reaction . <p> Additional issues to consider are that a ( i ) test protein cofactor may be necessary , ( ii ) a factor in the assay could be actively inhibiting interactions , ( iii ) the test protein could have a preference for a different type of actin , or ( iv ) the test protein may be at a low concentration in tissue extracts . <p> To address some of these potential problems , reagents can be added to remove inhibitors , such as EGTA ( Part #BSEG-01 ) for calcium . In the case of motor proteins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F-actin hence a non-hydrolyzable analog such as AMPPNP is used at 1 mM . An actin affinity column can be used to concentrate and isolate more of the test protein . Finally , different pH conditions may improve binding between the actin and actin binding protein ( e.g. alpha-actinins pH optima is 7.0 ) . <p> Answer 2 : Binding affinity ( Kd ) can be estimated from the spin-down assay by titrating the test protein concentration between 0.2 and 20 M and finding the concentration where half the original protein is in the pellet . Plot percent test protein bound versus original concentration in the reaction to obtain the Kd in M. <p> Question 3 : Can cell lysates be used with the non-muscle Actin Binding Protein Biochem Kit ( Cat . # BK013 ) as the source of a test protein ? <p> Answer 3 : Yes , cell lysates can be used as the source of the test protein . However , Cytoskeleton does not recommend this as the purity and concentration of the protein will often be too low to interact with actin . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proteases that can interfere or alter the interactions between actin and actin binding proteins . If lysates are to be used , we recommend the following : <p> Although this kit is designed for use with pure proteins or compounds , some researchers have added extracts with good results . Generally researchers use over-expressed proteins and a wild-type control extract similarly over-expressed . It is necessary to make a 10 mg/ml protein extract and then use 1/3rd volume of this to 2/3rd volume of actin at 1 mg/ml . In this way there is a high enough concentration of protein to indicate binding . The extraction buffer should be 20 mM Hepes buffer pH 7.4 , 20 mM NaCl , plus any co-factors for the protein , and a protease inhibitor cocktail such as Cat . # PIC02 . Phosphatase inhibitors can also be added . Rinse the cells with an ice cold buffer and lyse cells with a 25g bent over syringe needle or other device . The pH can alter F-actin binding properties of actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) by 0 to 100% . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 8.5 for extract preparation . The control cell line is very critical because potential ABPs could appear in the pellet by other routes ; for example , denaturing or aggregation with other cellular proteins . The total ionic strength should be kept below 50 mM in order not to salt off any potential ABPs.

If any of these points are overlooked , the results could lead to inappropriate experimental interpretation.Biochem kits are designed to overcome this bottleneck in research . <p> Question 2 : How can I use the Biochem Kits to investigate whether my protein interacts with the cytoskeleton or its regulatory components ? <p> Answer 2 : Cytoskeleton , Inc. has a variety of kits that can help the researcher examine how recombinant proteins , drugs or even cell lysates either interact and/or affect the function of cytoskeletal proteins including monomers and polymers of actin and tubulin . <p> Some examples of kits specifically designed for this purpose include the actin binding protein assay Biochem Kit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubulin binding protein assay Biochem Kit ( Cat . # BK029 ) . <p> Actin binding protein assay Biochem kit ( Cat . # BK001 or BK013 ) : This kit provides clear instructions and all the reagents and controls necessary to determine the ability of a given protein to bind to actin monomers versus actin filaments . F-actin binding can be measured by using a spin down assay where centrifugation is used to separate F-actin from G-actin by differential sedimentation . This kit can be used to determine ( i ) whether a test protein binds F-actin or affects the equilibrium between G-actin and F-actin , ( ii ) whether a test protein has G-actin sequestering or F-actin polymerization enhancing activity or ( iii ) whether a test protein of interest can bundle F-actin . We suggest coupling this assay with the Actin polymerization assay Biochem kit in order to obtain a more complete profile of your potential actin binding protein . <p> Tubulin binding protein assay Biochem Kit ( Cat . # BK029 ) : This kit provides clear instructions and all the reagents and controls necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubulin monomers versus tubulin polymers ( microtubules ) . Tubulin binding can be measured by using a spin down assay where centrifugation is used to separate microtubules from tubulin monomers by differential sedimentation . This kit can be used to : ( i ) identify novel microtubule associated proteins ( MAPs ) , ( ii ) confirm in vivo data suggesting a given protein is a MAP , ( iii ) characterize MAPs , ( iv ) identify/characterize MAP regulating proteins or ( v ) identify/characterize compounds that inhibit MAP binding to microtubules . We suggest coupling this assay with the tubulin polymerization assay Biochem Kit ( Cat . # BK006P or BK011P ) in order to obtain a more complete profile of your potential tubulin binding protein . <p> Actin polymerization assay Biochem kit ( Cat . # BK003 ) : This kit uses modified actin to follow polymerization kinetics . There are many types of actin binding proteins , including nucleating , capping , severing , side-binding and monomer sequestering actin binding proteins . All of these can be characterized by their effect on one or more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steady-state equilibrium . A compounds effects on depolymerization can also be evaluated . Cytoskeleton has adapted this powerful assay into a user friendly Biochem kit format . <p> Tubulin polymerization assay Biochem kit ( Cat . # BK006P or BK001P ) : We offer both absorbance-based and fluorescence-based tubulin polymerization kits to follow polymerization kinetics . The absorbance-based kit ( Cat . # BK006P ) takes advantage of the fact that light is scattered by microtubules to an extent that is proportional to the concentration of microtubule polymer . The fluorescence-based kit ( Cat . # BK011P ) measures polymerization as a function of fluorescence enhancement following the incorporation of a fluorescent reporter into microtubules as polymerization occurs . There are many proteins and drugs that either enhance or inhibit polymerization or depolymerization . These compounds can be characterized by their effect on one or more of the three stages of tubulin polymerization : nucleation , growth , and steady-state equilibrium . A compounds effects on depolymerization can also be evaluated . Cytoskeleton has adapted these powerful assays into user friendly Biochem Kit formats .

@@109313918 @4713918/ <p> Cytoskeleton , Inc. was founded in 1993 and coincidentally that was the era when the Rho family of small G-proteins was determined to be major regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics . This finding was established in a very direct way by the seminal paper authored by Drs . Anne Ridley and Alan Hall who at that time worked at the Medical Research Council in London(1) . Since then , the field has grown exponentially and now the annual publication rate in this area is approximately 750 papers per year(2) . In the intervening years , Alan was always available for consultation ; for example , he wrote a mini-review for Cytoskeletons 1999 catalog(3) . This giving character embodied his spirit and was emphasized in the various obituaries written by many colleagues . Alans legacy will continue through his influential body of work , and through the many students and colleagues whom he mentored . <p> Dr. Halls laboratory published two papers in the early part of 2015 , both focused on the mechanisms involved in the creation and maintenance of intercellular connections in bronchial epithelial cells . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOS1 , PAK4 , a member of the serine/threonine p21-activating kinase family , and the scaffold/polarity protein Par6B4 . Both PAK4 and Par6B are downstream of Cdc42 , a Rho family GTPase . GTP-bound , active Cdc42 can bind to PAK4 , which would presumably activate this kinase . Here , Hall and colleagues(4) demonstrate that PAK4 phosphorylates Par6B , with the primary site being the Ser143 residue . Interestingly , the Hall laboratory found that constitutively active Cdc42 ( ca-Cdc42 ; Cdc42V12 ) binds to wild-type and a non-phosphorylatable Par6B mutant ( S143A ) in cell lysates , but ca-Cdc42 does not bind to a phosphomimetic Par6B mutant ( S143E ) . This provokes the question as to whether Cdc42 , being a prenylated cell polarity protein , is in a position to bind and localize the unphosphorylated scaffold protein at the plasma membrane ( plm ) , and function to assist tight junction assembly ( see Figure 2 ) . Likewise , PAK4 could be localized to the plm via Cdc42 , placing it in the correct location to phosphorylate Par6B . In this situation , Cdc42 functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably can no longer be re-localized because its Cdc42-binding capability has been disabled . Thus , Cdc42 could be regulating the assembly and maintenance of tight junctions by coordinating the activity and function of these two downstream targets . <p> Figure 2 : Molecular mechanisms of tight junction assembly . <p> Legend : Schematic image depicting two pathways that help assemble a tight junction complex . Notice the cross-talk mechanism of the Cdc42/PAK4/Par6B interactions compared to the linear pathway of SOS1/Ras/MEK/ERK . <p> The second paper , citing a more traditional linear pathway from SOS1 &gt; Ras &gt; MEK &gt; ERK , describes a different , but complimentary , mechanism to support tight junction assembly(5) . The paper describes setting up a cell-based screen of 87 GEF proteins whose expression has been reduced by RNA interference ( RNAi ) followed by analysis of each samples phenoptype using immunofluorescence with the ZO-1 antibody , a tight junction specific marker . Cells that lost the ability to assemble tight junctions showed disrupted peripheral staining and had an irregular shape . siRNA-mediated knockdown of the SOS1 GEF was one of two GEFs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be involved is p114RhoGEF . The SOS1 pathway was investigated by using the same phenotypic assay with cells in the presence of either a ) a transfected dominant negative Ras gene , b ) a MEK inhibitor ( GSK1120212 ) , or c ) a ERK inhibitor ( SCH772984 ) . In all cases , the phenotype was highly disrupted , but strangely the MEK inhibitor only showed strong effects after chronic exposure ( 4 day treatment ) rather than a short 4 hour treatment which did not inhibit junction assembly . Thus , Dr. Hall and colleagues hypothesized that gene expression might be involved , so they screened all the disruptive conditions via microarray with 47,000 genetic markers. 33 genes showed significant reduction in expression , including known LONG ... genes and several genes connected with tight junctions , including epithelial membane protein 1 ( EMP1 ) , a scaffold protein . <p> In conclusion , Dr. Halls laboratory was developing genetic and molecular approaches to investigate how epithelial cell barriers are established by assembling tight junctions via multiple processes involving at least two signal transduction pathways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but hopefully his research will continue through the work of others .

Upon receipt , the lyophilized powders should be stored at 4C in a sealed container with desiccant . It is important to monitor the freshness of the desiccant and insure that it continues to absorb moisture to protect the lyophilized actins . With proper storage , lyophilized actin is guaranteed to be stable for 6 months . Alternatively , actin can be immediately resuspended at the concentration recommended , aliquoted , snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70C . When thawing frozen aliquots , it is important to thaw rapidly in a room temperature water bath . <p> Question 2 : What is the best way to store F-actin after polymerizing ? <p> Answer 2 : G-actin is stable for two days at 4C and requires a divalent cation , pH 6.5 - 8.0 and ATP for stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 1-2 weeks . F-actin requires ATP ( 0.2 mM ) and Mg2+ ( 2 mM ) for stability and is unstable below pH 6.5 and above pH 8.5 . F-actin is not stable to freezing . F-actin can be transferred to a variety of buffers ( e.g. HEPES , phosphate , etc ) without detrimental effects . We recommend the addition of antibacterial agents such as 100 g/ml ampicillin and 10 g/ml chloramphenicol when storing F-actin at 4C.

The homodimer heavy chain heads are ATPases which provide the energy for movement along the MTs . Binding of the dynein complex to cargo and dyneins processivity is dependent upon dyneins omni-present binding protein dynactin1-3 ( Fig. 1B ) and specific adaptor proteins such as presenilin , LIS1 , NUDEL , MuMA , Miro , Milton , BimL , and BimEL1-3 . <p> Researchers have examined the role dynein has in neurodegenerative diseases of the basal ganglia , dementias such as Alzheimers disease ( AD ) , and diseases of motor neurons that include amyotrophic lateral scherosis ( ALS ) , spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) , and spino-bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA ) 2 . <p> Research has identified at least three dynein mutants ( Legs at odd angles Loa , Cramping1 , and Sprawling ) that affect dyneins function , leading to motor and/or sensory neuron loss and impaired motor behavior in mice expressing these dynein mutants3,10,12-14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loa mutation ( F580Y point mutation in dynein heavy chain ) alters dyneins affinity for dynactin as well as the expression , assembly , and interaction of the protein subunits that compose the dynein complex15 .

Phosphorylation regulates vimentin IF assembly/disassembly ( i.e. , dynamics ) , vimentin 's binding partners , and vimentin 's role in cell motility . <p> Phosphorylation-mediated regulation of vimentin dynamics is integral for both mitosis and cell architecture/motility in interphase . Disassembly of vimentin IFs is a necessary step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disassembly , allowing for the proper separation of vimentin between the two newly formed daughter cells1-4,21 . Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 ( Cdk1 ) phosphorylates Ser55 on vimentin from prometaphase to metaphase , inducing IF depolymerization11,12,22 . Furthermore , this phosphorylation triggers direct binding of Polo-like kinase 1 ( Plk1 ) to vimentin , leading to Plk1 activation and phosphorylation of vimentin on Ser82 which lasts from metaphase until the end of mitosis12 . Plk1-mediated phosphorylation somewhat reduces the filament assembly of vimentin . Besides these kinases , vimentin is also phosphorylated by ROCK and Aurora B during mitosis . ROCK phosphorylates vimentin on Ser71 and Ser389 , while Aurora B targets Ser7218 . Both kinases phosphorylate vimentin at the cleavage furrow from anaphase to the end of mitosis , resulting in the necessary re-organization of vimentin filaments9,18 . <p> Other kinases that mediate vimentin dynamics are PAK and PKA . PAK phosphorylates vimentin on Ser56 which results in disassembly of vimentin filaments16 . Two major PKA phosphorylation sites on vimentin are Ser38 and Ser727 , though multiple other phosphorylation sites were identified ( Table 1 ) .

The 14-3-3 proteins bind the amino-terminal ( head ) domain of vimentin which prevents the binding and activation of 14-3-3 partner proteins involved in cell signaling and cell cycle control , including oncogenic Raf23 . Binding of 14-3-3 to vimentin requires phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues on the amino-terminus of vimentin . Similarly , binding between Akt-phosphorylated Beclin 1 and vimentin is dependent upon phosphorylation of Ser39 on vimentin24 . The Beclin 1/vimentin complex is involved in the inhibition of autophagy and Akt-mediated transformation24 . <h> Phosphorylation and Vimentin-mediated Motility <p> Vimentin phosphorylation also regulates processes underlying cell motility in normal and cancer cells . PKC mediates phosphorylation of vimentin ( Ser6 and Ser33 ) that is associated with integrin-containing vesicles14 . Integrins are needed for proper cell adhesion and motility and correct localization depends upon PKC-mediated phosphorylation of vimentin which allows proper integrin trafficking through vesicles to the plasma membrane14 . Correspondingly , cell migration increases with PKC-mediated phosphorylation of vimentin . Vimentin phosphorylation is also integral in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In serum-starved or non-motile fibroblasts , vimentin IFs are found throughout the cell periphery . Exposure to serum or photoactivatable Rac1 GTPase induces vimentin phosphorylation , IF depolymerization , and IF retraction from the cell periphery25 . <p> Vimentin phosphorylation also regulates cell motility in cancer cells . Upon activation of Akt , its tail region binds to vimentin 's head region , resulting in phosphorylation of Ser39 on vimentin and a corresponding increase in cancer cell motility and invasion in vitro and tumor and metastasis growth in vivo . Increased motility is likely due to phosphorylation-induced disassembly of vimentin IFs . Furthermore , Akt1 phosphorylation of vimentin also offers a level of protection against caspase-mediate proteolysis13 . <h> Summary <p> Vimentin IFs are modified by phosphorylation and at least three other PTMs ( ADP ribosylation27 , SUMOylation28 , and O-GlcNAcylation29,30 ) . Through these modifications , vimentin is spatially and functionally regulated . Despite a recent focus on the under-appreciated role vimentin IFs have in a myriad of cellular processes , much remains to be discovered , including the potential of PTM cross-talk30. 
@@109313943 @4713943/ <h> New small molecule inhibitors to control Ras signaling via Sos/K-Ras binding <p> The small G-protein Ras is a GTPase that cycles between inactive ( GDP-bound ) and active state ( GTP-bound ) forms . Ras plays an important role in several signal transduction pathways involved in normal cell growth and differentiation1 . The three isoforms of Ras , H-Ras , N-Ras , and K-Ras , were identified over 30 years ago for their oncogenic activation in human tumors1,2 . Aberrant Ras signaling has been identified in more than 30% of all human cancers with the most common being lung , colon , and pancreatic cancer1,3 . In particular , K-Ras has been identified as the most important Ras protein in cancer research , correlated with over 21% of human cancers4 . Despite extensive research on these proteins , no effective Ras inhibitor has been identified , earning K-Ras the reputation of an undruggable protein . Several efforts in the past have been unsuccessful , but there may be new hope in developing a therapeutic inhibitor to Ras proteins by targeting the upstream guanine nucleotide exchange factor protein Sos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sos exist , Sos1 and Sos2 , most research has focused on Sos1 . However , not all papers distinguish between Sos1 and Sos2-mediated signaling ; in these instances , the term " Sos " is used . Here we discuss several leading concepts in the pursuit of identifying viable drug targets to control atypical Ras signaling . <p> Ras-mediated signaling commonly occurs through the receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) -Sos-Ras pathway . Dimerization and autophosphorylation of transmembrane RTKs results from binding of growth factor ligands . Sos1 constitutively interacts with growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 ( Grb2 ) and the Sos1/Grb2 complex is recruited to phosphorylated RTKs and binds via the Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain of Grb25-9 . This RTK/Grb2/Sos1 complex positions Sos to bind to inactive ( GDP-bound ) Ras located at the plasma membrane ( and intracellular membranes ) 5 . Binding of Sos to Ras activates Ras by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP . Active GTP-bound Ras is returned to its inactive GDP-bound state through the activity of GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) ( Figure 1 ) 1,6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathway . <p> Although Sos-Ras interactions were described two decades ago7 , recent studies have identified new binding pockets , small molecules , and important post-translational modifications that may lead to the development of novel Ras inhibitors that work by disrupting Sos-Ras binding . Four recent papers describing the exciting results of altering Sos-Ras interactions are briefly described here . ( 1 ) Peptide HBS3 ( designed and synthesized by the hydrogen bond surrogate HBS approach ) mimics the alpha helix of Sos that is inserted into the switch region of Ras during Sos-Ras binding . In vitro experiments utilizing the alpha-helical mimic interfered with Sos-Ras binding and resulted in significant reduction in Ras activation10 ; ( 2 ) A unique ligand-binding pocket between the switch I/II regions of Ras has been identified and the small molecule DCAI , designed by fragment-based lead discovery ( FBLD ) , specifically binds within this pocket and blocks the interaction between Sos1 and K-Ras , resulting in K-Ras inhibition11 ; 3 ) SUMOylation of Grb2 at Lysine 56 located in the linker region increases the formation of Sos1/Grb2 complexes , which leads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhibition of SUMOylation of Grb2 at Lysine 56 impairs Sos1-Grb2 binding12 ; ( 4 ) K-Ras is post-translationally acetylated at Lysine 104 which negatively regulates K-Ras by interfering with Sos1-mediated nucleotide exchange . Modulating the acetylation state of K-Ras via activating its acetyltransferase or inhibiting its deacetylase may lead to cancer therapeutics13 . <p> An ideal therapeutic K-Ras inhibitor will selectively inhibit mutant K-Ras . Mutant vs wildtype selectivity has proved challenging since mutations are distal from the effector binding sites1 . Single amino acid mutations of K-Ras at residues 12 , 13 , and 61 are common and render K-Ras a constitutively active ( GTP-bound ) GTPase4 . Dr. Kevan Shokat and his team at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at the University of CA , San Francisco , recently made progress in addressing this selectivity issue by identifying a new allosteric switch II pocket ( S-IIP ) in a specific type of K-Ras mutant ( G12C ; Glycine 12 to Cysteine ) , which is present in 7% of lung cancer patients14 . Small molecules were designed to bind to this mutated Cysteine and disrupt switch I and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange is compromised and mutant K-Ras inhibition is achieved . <p> As researchers reveal additional Ras regulatory mechanisms , sensitive and quantitative methods to measure activated levels of these GTPase proteins take on increasing importance . To aid researchers with identifying and characterizing cancer therapeutics , Cytoskeleton , Inc. offers many small G-protein tools such as pull-down and G-LISA activation assays which are widely used to measure the activated levels of small G-proteins . Pull-down methods measure activated GTPase levels utilizing a domain of an effector protein coupled to a bead and the activated level of protein is measured by Western blot . G-LISA activation assays are faster , more sensitive , and more quantitative than traditional pull-down techniques . A video outlining these methods is available at **41;636;TOOLONG .

@@109313945 @4713945/ <h> GTPase Activation Assays : Detecting Different Isoforms <p> Ras and Rho family GTPases are cytoskeletal small G-proteins that critically regulate multiple actin-dependent cell processes , including development , growth , motility , and intracellular trafficking1,2 . Moreover , dysfunction of Ras and Rho family GTPases are correlated with several human diseases ( e.g. , cancer , neurodegeneration ) and these GTPases are targeted by multiple pathogenic bacteria3-5 . The GTPase families are comprised of multiple isoforms , including Cdc42 and RhoJ ; RhoA , RhoB , and RhoC ; and Rac1 , Rac2 , and Rac3 for the Rho family . The Ras family contains N- , K- , and H-Ras . Given the important role that these GTPases have in physiological and pathological processes , the ability to measure the activity of specific Rho and Ras isoforms is paramount ( Tables 1 and 2 ) . <p> Rho and Ras family GTPases cycle between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state .

Both formats are offered by Cytoskeleton , Inc. and both kit types can be modified to measure the activity of specific Ras or Rho family isoforms ( Tables 1 and 2 ) . Importantly , some isoforms ( e.g. , H-Ras vs K- and N-Ras ; RhoC vs RhoA ) are expressed at a much lower level than their related isoforms6,7 . Because there is substantial variability in expression , detection of the less abundant , activated isoforms can be more difficult . Potential assay variables that might require modification include : lysate concentration , lysis buffer , and antibody concentration and/or dilution , to name just a few . In the examples discussed below , the main modifications were titrating the lysate and isoform-specific antibody . <h> RhoB and RhoC activity with RhoA G-LISA kit <p> Rho GTPases mediate a variety of physiological and pathological cell functions .

@@109313949 @4713949/ <p> Tip #1 : Keep the lyophilized actin dry by storing in a desiccator at either 4C or -70C . After reconstituting actin as directed on the product 's datasheet , experiment-sized aliquots must be snap-frozen to liquid nitrogen before storing at -70C to preserve actin 's activity . To maintain activity , actin should not be frozen at a concentration below 10 mg/ml . When thawing the aliquots , thaw tubes in a room temperature water bath and immediately place on ice until used . Do not re-freeze actin once thawed .

Methanol disrupts the structure of F-actin and the phalloidin binding site . <p> Question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Answer 1 : <p> Globular-actin ( G-actin ) readily polymerizes under physiological conditions to form Filamentous-actin ( F-actin ) with the concomitant hydrolysis of ATP . F-actin is a double-helical filament as shown in Figure 1 . <p> Figure 1 . Double-helical structure of actin filaments . <p> Actin can polymerize from both ends in vitro . However , the rate of polymerization is not equal . This results in an intrinsic polarity in the actin filament . It has therefore become the convention to term the rapidly polymerizing end the plus-end ( see Figure 1 ) or barbed-end while the slow growing end is called the minus-end or pointed-end . <p> The propensity of actin to polymerize is dependent upon the affinity of actin monomers for filament ends . Thus , there is an actin monomer concentration below which actin will not polymerize . This value has been termed the Critical Concentration ( CC ) . At monomer concentrations above the CC , the actin will polymerize until the free monomer concentration is equal to the CC . When one is working with actin in vitro the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , at 4C muscle actin has a CC of 0.03 mg/ml in the presence of 2 mM Mg2+ and 50 mM KCl , but when these ions are absent , the CC is greater than 3.0 mg/ml . Thus , by altering the ionic type and strength one can alter the amount of polymer formed . Non-muscle actin has its own CC values . For example , at 4C in the presence of 2 mM Mg2+ and 50 mM KCl the CC is approximately 0.15 mg/ml . If Mg+ and KCl are replaced with Ca+ , the CC will increase to nearly 10 mg/ml . Finally , the CC of non-muscle actin can be reduced to 0.03 mg/ml by increasing the temperature to 30C . <p> Question 2:What procedure do you recommend for in vitro actin polymerization ? <p> For more critical work , cold spin at 150,000 x g for 2 h after step 1 to pellet small oligomers of actin and use the top 80% of supernatant for polymerization studies . <p> Question 3 : <p> What are the main types of molecular interactions with F-actin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds underlying interactions between molecules . One type of bond is noncovalent bonding and this is further broken down into subtypes . The main subtype of noncovalent binding by actin filaments is ionic-based which means that salt concentraitons higher than 75mM tend to dissociate the interactions . Molecular interactions with F-actin are not usually hydrophobic.

@@109313957 @4713957/ <h> Post-translational Modifications - Essential for Protein Regulation <p> To maintain homeostasis , cells need to respond to changes in the intracellular and extracellular milieu . Some of the changes have to be acted upon quickly to avoid detrimental effects that can lead to cell damage or even death . One way that cells act is through protein post-translational modifications ( PTMs ) which enable cells to respond quickly to various changes by influencing numerous properties of proteins including enzymatic activity , protein interactions , and subcellular location . Advanced developments in mass-spectrometry ( MS ) methods allow the identification of PTMs on a large scale . Today , more than 200 PTMs are known1,2 , ranging from small chemical modifications ( e.g. , phosphorylation and acetylation ) to the addition of complete proteins ( e.g. , ubiquitination and SUMOylation ) . The most extensively studied PTM is phosphorylation , in which protein kinases attach a phosphate group to serine , threonine , and/or tyrosine residues . Phosphorylated proteins appear to play a crucial role in many diverse and important cellular processes . Acetylation of histone proteins was discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation of chromatin structure4 . Several proteomics studies identified almost 5000 acetylation sites across almost 2000 proteins5,6 . Many of them are localized in cytoplasm , mitochondria , and the plasma membrane , indicating their involvement in diverse cellular processes such as signal transduction , cytoskeletal dynamics , and membrane stability5,6 . In addition to acetylation , the lysine residue has been found to be modified by ubiquitination and SUMOylation , where the former plays a prominent role in protein degradation through proteasomal pathway7 and the latter is important for regulating cellular processes , including cell cycle , apoptosis , DNA repair , and signal transduction pathways8 . <p> Fig. 1 . Enrichment of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was performed by incubating APY03-beads with lysates from NIH3T3 cells either treated or untreated with hydrogen peroxide-activated sodium pervanadate . Western blot analyses using PTMtrue antibodies detect co-modified proteins ( 1B-1D ) from the pY enrichment pool . <h> PTM crosstalk Adding layers of complexity to the proteomic network <p> PTM crosstalk has gained increasing interest in recent proteomics studies .

Some of these " hotspots " have been reported in the literature to crosstalk1,2 .

PTM crosstalk can be either positive or negative in nature . In positive crosstalk , one PTM can serve as a signal for the addition or removal of a second PTM , or for recognition by a binding protein that carries out a second modification ( e.g. , **25;841;TOOLONG SUMOylation ) 14 . For negative crosstalk , it can be illustrated through a direct competition for modification of a single residue in a protein15,16 , or indirectly by masking the recognition site for a second PTM15,16 .

@@109313958 @4713958/ <h> More Views <p> Introduction The Rho switch operates by alternating between an active , GTP-bound state and an inactive , GDP-bound state . Understanding the mechanisms that regulate activation / inactivation of the GTPases is of obvious biological significance and is a subject of intense investigation . The fact that many Rho family effector proteins will specifically recognize the GTP bound form of the protein has been exploited experimentally to develop a powerful affinity purification assay that monitors Rac and Cdc42 protein activation . The assay uses the Cdc42/Rac Interactive Binding ( CRIB ) region ( also called the p21 Binding Domain , PBD ) of the Cdc42 / Rac effector protein , p21 activated kinase 1 ( PAK ) . The CRIB/PBD protein motif has been shown to bind specifically to the GTP-bound form of Rac and/or Cdc42 proteins . The fact that the PBD region of PAK has a high affinity for both GTP-Rac and GTP-Cdc42 and that PAK binding results in a significantly reduced intrinsic and catalytic rate of hydrolysis of both Rac and Cdc42 make it an ideal tool for affinity purification of GTP-Rac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this kit corresponds to residues 67-150 . This includes the highly conserved CRIB region ( aa 74-88 ) plus sequences required for the high affinity interaction with GTP-Rac and GTP-Cdc42 . The PAK-PBD is in the form of a GST fusion protein , which allows one to " pull-down " the PAK-PBD/GTP-Cdc42 ( or GTP-Rac ) complex with glutathione affinity beads . The assay therefore provides a simple means of quantitating Rac/Cdc42 activation in cells . The amount of activated Cdc42 is determined by a Western blot using a Cdc42 specific antibody . <p> Kit contents The kit contains sufficient materials for 20 assays , depending on assay setup , and includes reagents for positive and negative controls . A larger 50 assay version of this kit is available as Cat . # BK034 . The following components are included : <p> Example results The Cdc42 activation assay was tested by loading the Cdc42 protein in cell lysates with either GTP ? S or GDP . As expected , the GTP ? S-loaded Cdc42 is very efficiently precipitated while very little GDP-loaded Cdc42 is precipitated ( Fig. 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and using the appropriate ECL detection system . <p> Question 2 : How much of the beads should I use for my pull-down experiments ? <p> Answer 2 : PAK-PBD-GST beads ( Cat . # PAK02 ) will bind to Cdc42-GDP with a much lower affinity than Cdc42-GTP . If too many PAK-PBD beads are added to the pull-down assay , there will be significant binding to inactive ( GDP-bound ) Cdc42 . The result of this will be an underestimation of Cdc42 activation . For this reason , we highly recommend performing a bead titration to determine optimal conditions for any given Cdc42 activation or inactivation assay . Once optimal conditions have been established , bead titrations should no longer be necessary . We recommend 10 , 15 and 20 g bead titrations . <p> Question 3 : How can I test whether the beads are working properly ? <p> Answer 3 : A standard biological assay for PAK-PBD GST protein beads consists of a Cdc42 protein pull-down from cells loaded with either GTP ? S ( Cat . # BS01 ) or GDP . Here are guidelines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more details ) : <p> Positive Cellular Protein Control : <p> Total cell lysate ( 300 800 g ) should be loaded with GTP ?

This is an excellent substrate for PAK-PBD beads and should result in a strong positive signal in a pull-down assay . <p> b ) Immediately add 1/100th volume of GTP ? S ( 200 M final concentration ) . Under these conditions , 5 - 10% of the Cdc42 protein will load with non-hydrolysable GTP ? S and will be " pulled-down " with the PAK-PBD beads in the assay . <p> c ) Incubate the control sample at 30C for 15 min with gentle rotation . <p> d ) Stop the reaction by transferring the tube to 4C and adding 1/10th volume of STOP Buffer . <p> e ) Use this sample immediately in a pull-down assay . <p> Negative Cellular Protein Control : <p> This reaction should be performed in an identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of GDP ( 1 mM final concentration ) should be added to the reaction in place of the GTP ?

@@109313966 @4713966/ <h> Phosphorylation of RhoA as a Regulator of Signal Transduction <p> Rho family GTPases are key regulators in a wide range of physiological processes , including cell motility , cell division , and neuronal development1 . Rho activity is regulated temporally and spatially by a variety of direct post-translational modifications ( PTMs ) that include prenylation , ubiquitination , oxidation , nitrosylation , and phosphorylation ( Fig. 1 ) . This newsletter focuses on control of RhoA function through phosphorylation . RhoA is a target for a growing number of kinases and as such , phosphorylation is emerging as a central theme in the regulation of this family of proteins2 . <h> Mechanism of RhoA phosphorylation at Serine 188 <p> Several kinases phosphorylate RhoA under both in vitro and in vivo conditions ( Table 1 ) . The main focus has been on PKA and PKG which phosphorylate RhoA on serine 188 . There are also reports of other kinases such as SKL ( Ste20-related kinase ) and AMPKalpha1 ( AMP-activated protein kinase subunit alpha 1 ) modifying RhoA ( Table 1 ) . <p> Early in vitro work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PKA deactivated RhoA . Their data supported a mechanism whereby membrane-bound RhoA-GTP is phosphorylated by PKA and the resulting membrane-bound phospho-RhoA-GTP is a substrate for Rho GDI ( guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor ) which mediates RhoA-GTP translocation to the cytosol3 . This contrasts with the classical model of Rho membrane cycling in which the inactive Rho-GDP is the substrate for GDI-mediated translocation to the cytosol1 . Therefore , it appears that phopshorylation provides a mechanism to inactivate Rho-GTP through disengagement from its site of action at the membrane . <p> Table 1 . Reagent Details For Modified GTPase Assays <p> Kinase <p> Modified RhoA aa <p> Effect <p> Ref <p> PKA <p> Ser188 <p> Turns off RhoA-GTP through removal from membrane to cytosol by a mechanism thought to involve Rho GDI <p> The in vitro work is supported by in vivo data using transfected phosphomimetic RhoA constructs . In this system , the longstanding observation that RhoA activity is reduced in the first 15-30 minutes after plating NIH 3T3 cells onto fibronectin surfaces correlated with increased phosphorylation of RhoA at serine 1884 . This correlation also agrees with reports that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was shown that the PKA-mediated stress fiber collapse in 3T3 cells was completely inhibited in cells expressing the non-phosphorylatable mutant RhoA-S188A4 . Similarly , stress fiber dissolution induced by constitutively active PKG in 3T3 cells was blocked in cells expressing RhoA-S188A6 . These studies demonstrate that RhoA is phosphorylated in vivo by PKA and PKG . Interestingly , it has been demonstrated in vascular smooth muscle cells that RhoA serine 188 phosphorylation protects cytoplasmic phospho-RhoA-GTP from ubiquitin-mediated degradation by forming a complex with Rho GDI7 . In support of this observation , stimulation of endogenous PKG activity in vascular smooth muscle leads to accumulation of RhoA-GTP in the cytoplasm7 . <p> Thus , by directing the translocation and accumulation of active RhoA away from its site of action at the membrane , phosphorylation appears to be an alternate mechanism to the classical GTPase cycle for directly regulating RhoA . It has been suggested that a dephosphorylation event might allow the release of the cytoplasmic pool of RhoA-GTP from Rho GDI , followed by translocation back to the membrane for effector interaction and signal transduction3 . A formal proof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increased affinity of phospho-Rho-GTP for Rho GDI can lead to activation of Rac1 in vascular smooth muscle cells8 . This is in agreement with previously published work that demonstrates balanced regulation of Rho family proteins through sequestration of a limited Rho GDI pool9 . <p> Figure 1 . Post-translational Modifications of RhoA <h> Physiological consequences of RhoA phosphorylation <p> The dramatic collapse of actin stress fibers in tissue culture cells upon induction of RhoA phosphorylation and the rescue of this phenotype by non-phosphorylatable mutants clearly demonstrates the potential of this PTM to play a significant role in the physiological regulation of RhoA . In this regard , overactivation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway is a known factor in vascular disorders such as pulmonary hypertension10 . Deactivation of RhoA through serine 188 phosphorylation may represent an additional therapeutic approach to combat this group of diseases11 . In this regard , estrogen , a known hypertension suppressor and vasoprotector , causes RhoA serine 188 phosphorylation through activation of AMPKalpha1 kinase12 . Phosphorylation of serine 188 in RhoA has also been proposed to regulate the physiological response of cytotoxic T cells to cAMP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism is thought to involve altered affinity of adhesion molecules through cytoskeletal rearrangements in response to phosphorylation of RhoA by cAMP-induced PKA . This could explain the ability of cytotoxic T cells to cycle from one target to another3 . In yet another example , RhoA serine 188 phosphorylation has been linked to the development of a neuroendocrine-like phenotype during androgen ablation therapy in prostate cancer . As this phenotype is associated with poor prognosis , it has been suggested that pharmacological intervention in this pathway may be a useful addition to prostate cancer therapy13 . <h> Conclusion and future directions <p> There are a growing number of kinases associated with RhoA regulation . Moreover , there is a growing number of PTMs that have been demonstrated to directly regulate this protein and other members of the Rho family . As Rho proteins play such a key role in many disease states , RhoA PTMs are of great therapeutic interest14 .

@@109313969 @4713969/ <h> June Newsletter : Kinesin Motor Proteins and Neurodegeneration <p> Kinesin motor proteins regulate mitosis and anterograde cargo transport as exemplified by fast axonal transport ( FAT ) in neurons . Neurons depend on kinesins for cell cycle regulation , especially the assembly and function of the mitotic spindle , a macromolecular structure composed primarily of microtubules ( MTs ) that undergo cycles of polymerization and depolymerization to properly segregate duplicate chromosomes into separate daughter cells . In addition , the kinesin motors use MTs to transport cargo such as proteins , lipids , and mitochondria to the axon and axon terminal , an essential process for normal neuron development , growth , and communication as the cell body is the site of synthesis1 . <p> In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease ( AD ) , cell cycle defects ( e.g. , chromosome mis-segregation , abnormal mitotic spindle structure/function , aneuploidy ) and impaired FAT are pathophysiological hallmarks of AD , the most common form of dementia2,3 . Indeed , FAT deficits and axonal swellings occur before the classic neuropathological signs of dementia ( plaques and tangles ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an early sign of neuron vulnerability to neurodegeneration4-8 . This newsletter focuses on the role Eg5 ( KSP , kinesin spindle protein , KIF11 , kinesin-5 ) and kinesin-1 have in AD-associated cell cycle and FAT defects , respectively . Eg5 is a kinesin motor that interacts with MTs and is essential for mitotic spindle formation and function . Kinesin-1 is the prototypical kinesin that mediates FAT . For a discussion of the role of the dynein motor in neurodegeneration , see the 2014 January/February newsletter . <p> The neuropathological hallmarks of AD are beta amyloid ( A ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau neurofibrillary tangles . A is produced by enzymatic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) by beta-secretase 1 ( BACE1 ) and the presenilin ( PS ) -containing gamma-secretase complex2,3 . In AD-associated cell cycle defects , both A and tau inhibit Eg5 activity and its interaction with MTs , which negatively affects mitotic spindle structure and function9-11 ( Fig. 1 ) . A dysfunctional spindle results in the mis-segregation of chromosomes , aneuploidy/hyperploidy , and cell death9-11 .

Eg5 mediates A-induced inhibition of long-term potentiation and loss of hippocampal spines/synapses13,14 , at least partly through a reduction in cell surface trafficking of NMDA and nerve growth factor/p75 neutrophin receptors13 . <p> Motors and Neurodegeneration : Axonal Transport Defects <p> All 4 **25;996;TOOLONG proteins ( APP , A , PS , and tau ) inhibit kinesin-1-mediated FAT . For APP and A disruption of FAT15-17 , various mechanisms have been reported , ranging from actin aggregation and dynamic changes in actin polymerization16 to activation of casein kinase 2 , which initiates a sequential cascade of kinesin-1 light chain phosphorylation and release of cargo from kinesin-117 .

Kinesin-1-mediated anterograde FAT is inhibited by GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of kinesin-1 light chains which causes dissociation of kinesin-1 and its cargo . GSK-3 can be activated by PS1 and/or PP1 with the latter activated by hyper-phosphorylated tau filaments . <p> Both tau and mutant PS1 ( M146V ) regulate kinesin-1-mediated FAT via **28;1023;TOOLONG activation of GSK-3 , resulting in GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of kinesin-1 light chains , which in turn induce separation of kinesin-1 and its cargo5 ( Fig. 2 ) . As a tau kinase , GSK-3 can mediate formation of pathological , hyper-phosphorylated tau , which dissociates from MTs and causes MT depolymerization , followed by formation of tau filaments and eventually neurofibrillary tangles2,3 . The amino terminus of either tau filaments or C-terminal-truncated , unbound monomers ( C-terminus contains MT binding domains ) inhibits kinesin-dependent FAT . Here , GSK-3 activity is increased via protein phosphatase 1 ( PP1 ) -mediated **25;1053;TOOLONG activation of GSK-323 ( Fig. 2 ) .

Furthermore , depletion of kinesin-1 produces similar transport deficits while also increasing levels of A peptide levels and deposits4 . <p> Conclusion <p> Normal neuron physiology relies on kinesin motors for a variety of processes , including proper mitosis and FAT . Impaired kinesin function has a profound and wide-spread effect on neuron health as kinesin motor dysfunctions are not only observed in AD , but Huntington 's disease24 , upper and lower motor neuron diseases , and Charcot-Marie-Tooth peripheral neuropathy2,3 .

@@109313975 @4713975/ <h> SUMOylation of Mitotic Proteins : Localization and Function 165268 @qwx1025268 <p> Successful execution of mitosis requires exquisite regulation and interplay of a myriad of proteins . Recently , the post-translational modification ( PTM ) of SUMOylation has emerged as an important functional regulator of mitotic proteins1 . SUMO ( Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier ) proteins are covalently ligated to a lysine residue of target proteins enzymatically2,3 . SUMOylated mitotic proteins are densely localized in the nucleus and their abundance seems to be controlled by either reverse modification ( deSUMOylation ) or ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic degradation4,5 . There are three SUMO paralogues ( SUMO 1 , 2 , 3 ) with SUMO-2/3 grouped together as they are 96% identical to each other . The two groups ( SUMO-1 vs SUMO-2/3 ) target different proteins and have distinct functions and subcellular localizations6 . To understand the dynamic SUMO-mediated pathways in mitosis , the identification of bona fide SUMO conjugates is essential . However , this has been significantly hampered , especially in detecting low levels of conjugates , due to the absence of high-quality antibodies against SUMO proteins . Here , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new antibodies which are useful in detecting proteins modified by SUMO-2/3 . <h> Regulation of Mitotic Proteins by SUMOylation <p> SUMOylation dynamically regulates the function of mitotic proteins by altering protein binding motifs , stability , and trafficking . For example , two members of the chromosomal passenger complex ( CPC ) which are modified by SUMO-2/3 are the mitotic kinase Aurora B7 and Borealin8 . Aurora B is the catalytic subunit of the CPC and its SUMOylation facilitates its kinase activity7 . The CPC regulates integral mitotic events , including chromosome alignment on the spindle , spindle-kinetochore attachment , and cytokinesis7,8 . Another essential mitotic protein SUMOylated by SUMO-2/3 is DNA topoisomerase II . SUMOylated topoisomerase plays an essential role in proper chromosome segregation9 . SUMO-2/3 are also responsible for the SUMOylation of the kinetochore-associated proteins BubR1 and Nuf2 which are likely involved in the noncovalent interaction between the microtubule ( MT ) kinesin motor CENP-E and polymeric SUMO-2/3 . This PTM is necessary for the motor 's proper localization and functioning , which includes connecting MTs and kinetochores10 . <h> Detection of Endogenous SUMO-2/3 Targets in Mitosis <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is extremely difficult to detect SUMOylated proteins from crude cell or tissue lysates . Enrichment of target proteins is necessary for further analysis11 . Immunoprecipitation ( IP ) is an efficient method for the enrichment , but this requires a high-affinity antibody specific to SUMO proteins . A recent study showed that the pull-down assay utilizing tandem SUMO interacting motifs ( SIMs ) successfully detected specific targets , but this may not be a universal strategy and may be vulnerable to contamination12 . The most popular approach is to use cell lines expressing SUMO mutants containing epitope tags13 . However , the generation of a cell line is time-consuming and labor-intensive , and the overexpression of mutant SUMO proteins may disturb well-balanced cellular homeostasis . Today high quality antibodies against SUMO-2/3 are available to the scientific community . Cytoskeleton , Inc. has developed two SUMO-2/3 antibodies . Clone 12F3 ( Cat. # ASM23 ) shows superior performance in WB , IF , and IP applications over the popular clone 8A2 ; the other is clone 11G2 ( cat# ASM24 ) which is extremely sensitive in the IP application . Briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are consistent with previously published results10,11 . Most of the SUMO-2/3-conjugates are heavily localized to the nucleus during interphase ( Fig. 1A ) , but cytoplasmic proteins are also SUMOylated ( see the inset in Fig. 1A ) . When cells enter mitosis , some SUMOylated proteins ( e.g. , RanGAP114 and Topoisomerase II9 ) are clearly visible on kinetochore-centromere structures ( Fig. 1B ) . The enrichment of SUMOylated proteins by IP makes it possible to detect specific targets ( even those in low abundance ) such as TFII-I . SUMO-2/3 conjugates from HeLa cell lysates were precipitated by 11G2 and 12F3 antibodies . The total precipitates were immuno-blotted with anti-SUMO-2/3 ( 12F3 ) , and specific proteins ( TFII-I and RanGAP1 ) were probed with corresponding antibodies ( Fig. 2 ) . Interestingly , RanGAP1 is mono-SUMOylated by either SUMO-111 or SUMO-2/3 . The precipitation of SUMO-2/3 conjugates by two different antibodies shows slightly different profiles . A linear epitope has been identified for 12F3 , while 11G2 appears to recognize a conformational epitope . <h> Conclusions <p> PTMs fine-tune mitotic protein function to insure successful cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is necessary to identify the substrate proteins and the downstream signaling cascades . Many PTM-mediated regulatory mechanisms remain to be discovered in mitosis ( and other cellular processes ) .

These new antibodies will provide a convenient and straightforward means to detect and study new PTM targets as well as contribute to the discovery of new regulatory mechanisms in mitosis and other cell processes .

Functionally kinesins can be divided into two major groups , those involved in vesicle transport and membrane organization and those involved in mitosis . The central role of kinesins in cell division makes them of great interest as targets for anti-mitotics . Of critical importance to the premise of kinesins as drug targets is the fact that all available data indicates that antibodies and small molecules directed against mitotic kinesins specifically inhibit the mitotic process but have no effect upon kinesin vesicle transport functions .

The researcher would then choose the dilution of monoclonal antibody which gave them the highest ratio of activated:control state . <p> A simple activated/control state pair of extracts can be made by growing cells to 50% confluence in serum containing media , washing twice with PBS , preparing lysate and aliquoting and freezing samples in liquid nitrogen . With one aliquot , defrost and let stand at room temperature for 60 min to degrade the activated signal to a low basal signal , which will be the control state . The untreated sample ( 2nd aliquot ) will be considered " activated " which most serum grown cells are . <p> Question 2 : How many cell culture plates can I process at one time during the lysis step ? <p> Answer 2 : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the plate on ice to aliquoting and snap-freezing the lysate samples in liquid nitrogen , no more than 10 min are allowed to elapse .

@@109313982 @4713982/ <p> Microinjection into cells followed by electron microscopy of streptavidin conjugated gold particles to determine the cellular localization of the tubulin . <p> Nanotechnology <p> MaterialPorcine brain tubulin ( &gt;99% pure , see Cat . # T240 ) has been modified so that random surface lysines contain a covalently linked , long-chain biotin derivative . A long-chain biotin derivative was selected for this procedure because it allows the biotin molecules to be spaced far enough away from the tubulin protein so as not to interfere with its activity , e.g. , ligand binding to SPA beads or other streptavidin based reagents . Biotin labeled tubulin is supplied as a lyophilized powder . <p> Purity The protein purity of the tubulin used for labeling is determined by scanning densitometry of Coomassie Blue stained protein on a 4-20% polyacrylamide gel . The protein used for T333P is &gt;99% pure tubulin . Labeled protein is run on an SDS gel , transfered to a nitrocellulose membrane and detected with streptavidin alkaline phosphatase ( Fig 1 ) . 10 ng of T333P is readily detectable . No free biotin is detectable in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biotin tubulin. 10 and 100 ng of T333P was run on a 4-20% SDS-PAGE gel , transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and biotin labeled material was detected with streptavidin alkaline phosphatase . <p> Biological ActivityThe biological activity of T333P is assessed by a tubulin polymerization assay . To pass quality control , a 5 mg/ml solution of fluorescein labeled tubulin in G-PEM plus 5% glycerol must polymerize to &gt;85% . This is comparable to unlabeled tubulin under identical conditions . 165304 @qwx1025304 <p> Question 1 : What is the proper way to store the tubulin to insure maximum stability and activity ? <p> Answer 1 : The recommended storage condition for the lyophilized tubulin product is 4C with desiccant to maintain humidity at &lt;10% humidity . Under these conditions the protein is stable for 6 months . Lyophilized protein can also be stored desiccated at -70C where it will be stable for 6 months . However , at -70C the rubber seal in the lid of the tube could crack and allow in moisture . Therefore we recommend storing at 4C . If stored at -70C , it is imperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition is utilized . After reconstituting the protein as directed , the concentrated protein in G-PEM buffer should be aliquoted , snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70C ( stable for 6 months ) . NOTE : It is very important to snap freeze the tubulin in liquid nitrogen as other methods of freezing will result in significantly reduced activity . Defrost rapidly by placing in a room temperature water bath for 1 min . Avoid repeated freeze/thaw cycles . <p> Question 2 : Does the biotinylated tubulin polymerize as well as unlabeled tubulin ? <p> Answer 2 : Yes , the biotinylated tubulin ( Cat . # T333P ) polymerizes as well as unlabeled tubulin ( Cat . # 240 ) . The biological activity of biotinylated tubulin is determined from its ability to efficiently polymerize into microtubules in vitro and separate from unpolymerized protein in a spin-down assay . Stringent quality control ensures that &gt;85% of the biotinylated tubulin can polymerize in this assay . This is comparable to the polymerization capacity of unmodified tubulin ( Cat . # T240 ) . <p> Question 3 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and GTP for resuspending tubulin ? <p> Answer 3 : We recommend resuspending tubulin in general tubulin buffer + GTP to maintain tubulin monomer protein stability and conformation and to provide the necessary components for polymerization . For resuspension , we recommend using a general tubulin buffer ( Cat . # BST01-001 ) which consists of 80 mM PIPES , 2 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA , pH 7.0 , supplemented with 1 mM GTP ( Cat . # BST06-001 ) . Tubulin requires GTP and magnesium ions for proper stability and conformation , even in its monomeric state . GTP is also required for the polymerization process as its hydrolysis during tubulin polymerization is necessary for polymerization to occur . EGTA is a chelator of calcium which is a potent inhibitor of tubulin polymerization . Glycerol is often added to a final concentration of 5 - 10% to enhance polymerization ; however , glycerol is not necessary for the maintenance of biologically active tubulin and does not need to be included when reconstituting and storing tubulin . When aliquoting reconstituted tubulin for storage , it is essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of &gt;6 mg/ml to preserve tubulins biological activity . Then the aliquots should be stored at -70C . When thawing the aliquots , thaw rapidly in a room temperature water bath and place on ice until right before experimental use .

In contrast to methods that rely on over-expression or knockdown of target proteins ( e.g. , DNA transfection of dominant-negative or constitutively-active Rho mutants , RNAi knockdown ) , G-switch reagents act rapidly on the endogenous target protein ( in minutes to hours ) , thereby optimizing the chance of generating a more physiologically relevant response . <p> Cell Permeable <p> Rapid Results ( within minutes ) <p> Highly Validated and Published <p> Cytoskeleton 's products have been cited hundreds of times over the past 18 years . Please contact Cytoskeleton 's Technical Support at **25;1229;TOOLONG for the latest citations . <p> Question 1 : Which small G-protein activators are best for neuronal tissue or cells ? <p> Answer 1 : Cytoskeleton offers a variety of GTPase activators that are a part of our G-switch line of small G-protein tools that work well for many different types of cells and tissue . We have a Rho activator ( Cat . # CN01 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C in a variety of cell types via a mechanism involving inhibition of Shp-2 phosphatase . Inhibition of Shp-2 allows constitutive activation of Rho GEFs . Calpeptin also inhibits calpain-1 in a mechanism that is unrelated to Rho activation . We also have a Rac/Cdc42 activator ( Cat . # CN02 ; EGF ) that indirectly activates Rac1 , Rac2 , Rac3 and Cdc42 proteins in a variety of cells through activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated signaling cascade . <p> Recently , we have expanded the G-switch line to include activators that directly act on Rho specifically or on Rho/Rac/Cdc42 proteins together ( Cat . # CN03 and CN04 , respectively ) . The active site of these direct activators is based on the catalytic domain of the bacterial cytotoxic necrotizing factor ( CNF ) toxins . For the specific Rho activator ( Cat . # CN03 ) , the catalytic domain is covalently attached to a proprietary cell penetrating moiety . CN03 activates Rho GTPase isoforms by deamidating glutamine-63 , which is located in the Switch II region of these GTPases .

For the Rho/Rac/Cdc42 direct activator ( Cat . # CN04 ) , the catalytic domain is also covalently attached to the same cell penetrating moiety . CN04 directly activates Rho GTPase isoforms by deamidating glutamine-63 of Rho and glutamine-61 of Rac and Cdc42 in their respective Switch II regions . This modification converts glutamine-63 to glutamate , which blocks intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTPase activity , resulting in constitutively active endogenous Rho , Rac and Cdc42 . <p> Question 2 : Why are the CNF-based activators a better choice ? <p> Answer 2 : The GTPase activators that are based on the catalytic domain of the bacterial cytotoxic necrotizing factor ( CNF ) toxins are the best choice for activating small G-proteins for multiple reasons . In contrast to methods that rely on over-expression or knockdown of target proteins ( e.g. , DNA transfection of dominant negative or constitutively active Rho mutants , RNAi knockdown ) , the G-switch reagents act rapidly on the endogenous target protein ( &lt;3 hours ) , thereby optimizing the chance of generating a more physiologically relevant response .

In addition , two main membrane types exist that further complicate the combinations of testing conditions .

High molecular weight proteins . <p> Useful notes . <p> High molecular weight ( HMW ) proteins have low mobility through polyacrylamide gels which reduces transfer by reducing the amount of protein that can reach the membrane under standard transfer conditions . There are several techniques that can be used to optimize the transfer by increasing mobility . These are three fold ; 1 ) add SDS to the transfer buffer , 2 ) increase the time for transfer , these modifications should be tried before the third method which needs more titration for optimization. 3 ) introduce mild proteolysis to cleave the protein into smaller pieces . <p> The optimal amount of SDS is 0.025% ( w/v ) which is enough to coat a portion of the positive charged amino-acid side chains but not enough to completely interfere with binding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equilibrating buffer prior to assembling the transfer sandwich , use 10 min with agitation prior to assembling the transfer setup . A great control sample is to use 100 nanograms of skeletal myosin as a well known large 240 kDal protein . <p> Protein hydrolysis can be of two varieties which are performed in the gel by washing in the appropriate solution/buffer , these are acid or protease treatment . An example acid treatment could be 10 , 30 , 100 or 300 min in 100 mM acetic acid , then equilibrating in transfer buffer prior to electroblotting . SDS is not required for this process .

Ubiquitinated proteins . <p> Useful notes . <p> Ubiquitinated proteins gain an 8 kDal protein moiety at the expense of a positive charge usually from modified lysine or arginine amino-acids which may shift the overall charge ( pI ) of the molecule to the acidic side of the pH scale .

@@109313987 @4713987/ <p> Upon translation , proteins are trafficked to their proper subcellular location so that they can perform their physiological functions . One mechanism that mediates correct protein localization and function is post-translational modifications ( PTMs ) . PTMs include protease cleavage , protein folding , and the attachment of molecules such as biochemical functional groups ( e.g. , acetate or phosphate ) or small proteins ( e.g. , ubiquitin or SUMO Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier ) . In this way , PTMs provide cells with a second level of regulation of protein function , signaling , and fate1,2 . PTM-mediated regulation involves alteration of protein binding motifs , thereby affecting the binding with other proteins , nucleic acids , and various small molecules . Enzyme-mediated reversible PTMs offer an especially powerful modulatory tool that enable proteins to perform multiple tasks systematically while the protein remains under precise regulatory control1,2 . <p> SUMO proteins are 12 kDa proteins3 discovered 18 years ago by four independent research groups4-8 and since then , their regulation of cellular processes has been heavily investigated9,10 . SUMO proteins are highly conserved from yeast to mammalian cells11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one SUMO protein ( Smt3 ) exists , but in vertebrate , three major SUMO isoforms ( SUMO-1 , SUMO-2 , and SUMO-3 ) exist , expressed in all tissue12 . Because mature SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are 97% identical in amino acid sequence ( 48% identity with SUMO-1 ) and no functional difference between them has been identified , they are collectively called SUMO-2/313 . SUMO proteins ( SUMO-1 vs SUMO-2/3 ) show distinct subcellular localization and the expression level of SUMO-2/3 is higher than that of SUMO-114-16 . While only a single SUMO-1 is ligased to target proteins , multiple SUMO-2/3s form poly-SUMO-2/3 chains by attaching SUMO to a conserved lysine residue and this chain is terminated by SUMO-1 ligation17,18 . <p> Figure 1 : Cycle of **26;1256;TOOLONG . <p> SUMOylation , the linkage of SUMOs to target proteins through isopeptide bonds , is orchestrated by a series of enzymatic reactions19 ( Fig. 1 ) . Processing enzymes ( SENPs ) cleave the C-terminus of newly synthesized SUMOs and the heterodimeric E1 SUMO activating enzyme ( SAE1/2 subunits ) activates SUMOs by the covalent attachment of SUMO 's exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linkage19,20 . The activated SUMOs are transferred to the sole E2 conjugating enzyme ( Ubc9 ) . Here , the SUMOs can be ligased to target proteins through two different pathways . First , the SUMO-Ubc9 complex binds to the target protein through a SUMO-interacting motif ( SIM ) and Ubc9 catalyzes isopeptide bonds between the C-terminus of SUMO and the epsilon amino group of lysines in the target protein , a process that is E3 enzyme independent22 . The second mechanism involves various E3 ligases such as PIAS family members23 , RanBP224 , or Pc225 targeting preferential proteins24-28 . Once SUMO-Ubc9 forms a complex with the E3 ligase , the E3 ligase binds to the target proteins and facilitates the SUMO ligation to target proteins29 . Many SUMOylation reactions occur on a consensus motif , ? -K-x-D/E ( ? ; hydrophobic residue , K ; lysine , x ; any amino acid and D/E ; aspartic acid/glutamic acid ) 30 , but SUMOylation on non-canonical consensus motifs has been reported31,32 . <p> Functionally , SUMOylation targets multiple proteins ( Fig. 2 ) , including Rac1 GTPase and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rac1 , a Rho family GTPase , is mediated by the SUMO E3 ligase , PIAS3 , and is necessary for increases in Rac1 activity in response to various growth factors and the ensuing Rac1-mediated lamellipodia/membrane ruffle formation which underlies cell migration and invasion34 . The authors suggest that SUMOylation is not required for activation , but instead extends the time that Rac1 is active . Rac1 SUMOylation occurs under both in vitro and in vivo conditions and while both GTP-bound and GDP-bound Rac1 are SUMOylated , the active form of Rac1 is preferentially targeted34 . Mass spectrometry revealed that 95% of in vitro Rac1 SUMOylation occurs on lysines 188 , 183 and 184 , or 186 , residues within the C-terminus polybasic region34 . These same lysine residues are also targeted for SUMOylation under in vivo conditions34 . Upstream of Rho family GTPases is the cytoskeletal protein actin . In vitro SUMOylation of actin by both SUMO2 and SUMO3 is involved in the nuclear localization of actin19,35,36 with both SUMO2 and SUMO3 modifying nuclear actin through an interaction involving amino acids K68 and K28436 . <p> Figure 2 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for SUMOylation as determined by proteomic analyses . Data for Fig. 2 adapted from Ref. 19 . <p> The other major cytoskeletal protein targeted by SUMOs is tubulin . SUMOylation of alpha-tubulin has been confirmed in vitro , while beta-tubulin has been identified as a putative SUMO-1 and SUMO-3 target19 . The authors19 posit that SUMOylation of tubulin may enable the sequestering of other SUMOylated proteins for the purpose of assembling multimeric protein complexes . <p> In summary , SUMO-mediated regulation of protein localization and function is not only complex but well-positioned as a major regulator of cellular architecture and transport . To better understand how SUMOylation regulates proteins , Cytoskeleton , Inc. is focusing on the development of high-quality antibodies which are highly specific to PTMs. 
@@109313988 @4713988/ <h> SUMOylation : Functional Regulator of Cytoskeletal Proteins <p> The filamentous cytoskeleton is comprised of three distinctive polymer networks : actin filaments , intermediate filaments , and microtubules . Their interplay is responsible for cellular structure , motility , and material transport in order to maintain cellular homeostasis . Also , flexible and rapid cellular responses to external and internal stimuli are possible due to the highly dynamic nature of the cytosmarginkeletal network and its related proteins . Changes in the function and/or localization of cytoskeletal proteins in response to stimuli are tightly and rapidly regulated and one of the primary means is by post-translational modifications ( PTMs ) which enable a high level of fine-tuning1-5 . Recently , SUMO ( Small Ubiquitin-related Modifier ) modification of proteins on lysine ( K ) amino acid residues has emerged as a key regulatory mechanism for various cellular processes4,5 . Unlike ubiquitination , SUMOylation does not lead to proteasomal degradation , as it plays a pivotal role in subcellular localization , transcriptional regulation , chromatin remodeling , response to stress , and regulation of mitosis6 . In this newsletter , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect(s) . <p> Actin filaments and actin binding proteins <p> Actin is one of the most abundant proteins and exists in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of a cell . SUMOylation of cytoplasmic actin has not yet been observed , but nuclear beta-actin is specifically SUMO-2/3 modified7 . SUMOylated actin can not form a filamentous structure and is retained in the nucleus as a monomer . Its functional role has not yet been identified and it is stilll not clear if actin is SUMOylated in the nucleus or SUMOylated actin is transported into the nucleus . Also , many actin-related proteins undergo SUMOylation . For example , Rac1 is SUMO-1 targeted by the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS3 ( Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT3 ) in response to Hepatocyte Growth Factor ( HGF ) 8 . GTP-bound Rac1 is preferentially SUMOylated , which stabilizes Rac1 in its active state and enhances cellular migration . The underlying mechanism remains unclear , but it is speculated that either SUMOylation increases the interaction of Rac1 with a guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) or decreases binding with a GTPase-activating protein ( GAP ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be experimentally demonstrated . In addition to regulation by GEFs and GAPs , the activity of Rho-family GTPases is negatively regulated by RhoGDI ( Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor ) which sequesters inactive GTPases . The binding affinity of RhoGDI to GDP-bound GTPases is enhanced by SUMO-1 ligation at the K138 amino acid residue . The resultant downstream signaling inhibits actin polymerization , cytoskeleton formation , and cellular motility9 . <p> Microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins ( MAPs ) <p> Microtubules carry out enormously different tasks in cells and microtubules are extensively and reversibly modified by PTMs , such as acetylation , tyrosination , phosphorylation , and SUMOylation1,10 . Proteomic screening results suggest that alpha- and beta-tubulins are SUMO substrates with further experiments validating alpha-tubulin as a target for SUMO-3 modification11 . However , the effect of tubulin SUMOylation in the cellular context remains to be identified . The endogenous level of SUMOylated alpha-tubulins seems to be extremely low since in-house SUMO-2/3 enrichment experiments with SUMO-2/3 affinity beads ( Cat. # ASM24-beads ) failed to detect it . Tau , a microtubule-stabilizing protein in neurons , is preferentially modified by SUMO-1 over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to microtubules ) of tau is decreased by its phosphorylation , which elevates the soluble ( unbound ) level of tau . <p> Evidence that either colchicine-induced depolymerization of microtubules or phosphatase inhibition increases SUMOylation of tau suggests that soluble tau is the preferential target of SUMOylation . Similarly , hyperphosphorylation of tau promotes SUMOylation , and reciprocally , tau SUMOylation promotes tau hyperphosphorylation13 . As SUMOylation and ubiquitination target the same lysine residue ( K340 ) on tau , SUMOylation rescues tau from proteasomal degradation by occupying the ubiquitin ligation site13 . The idea of competition between ubiquitination and SUMOylation is further supported by the fact that proteasome inhibitor MG132 treatment increased the level of monomeric tau along with that of tau ubiquitination , but its SUMOylation was decreased12 . A very interesting example of SUMOylation regulating a protein 's function in an opposing manner is observed with motor proteins and La , a RNA-binding chaperone protein that displays both anterograde and retrograde transport activity in its wild-type form ( Fig. 1 ) . In its non-SUMO-modified form , La binds to the MAP kinesin , but not dynein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enables not only retrograde trafficking , but also binding to dynein , but not kinesin14 . It seems likely that SUMOylation-mediated retrograde transport is related to the recycling of unbound La proteins . Thus , SUMOylation plays a role as a molecular switch in the bidirectional trafficking of La between the nucleus and axons of neurons . <p> Conclusions <p> Since SUMO proteins were discovered two decades ago , a myriad of nuclear proteins have been identified and extensively studied . Recently , cytoskeletal proteins have emerged as candidate SUMO substrates . Identification of SUMO target proteins has been experimentally challenging because the reversible modification is highly dynamic and only a small pool of the proteins are SUMOylated . To assist researchers in studying how SUMOylation and other modifications such as ubiquitination , acetylation , and tyrosine phosphorylation , regulate the function and localization of target proteins , Cytoskeleton , Inc. , offers the Signal Seeker line of antibodies and enrichment kits to study these modifications and their effects .

Usually the citation is associated with a particular result in the form of a graph or image that helps the authors present their findings . This indicates the utility of the Kits to produce publication quality data in a short timeframe thus helping improve the productivity of your efforts . Example citations for G-LISA assay kits are shown below . More citations are available on individual product pages . <h> Detection of GTPase Isoforms <h> Equipment Requirements <p> Question 1 . How can I increase the difference in Rho activation levels between control samples and stimulated samples ? <p> Three different solutions to this problem may exist : <p> A : If your control cells are supposed to be serum-starved , the lack in difference could be due to inefficient serum starvation , i.e. high basal Rho activation levels . To achieve good serum starvation and inactivation of Rho with most cells , it is important to have had the cells growing in the plates for at least 3 days before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for serum starvation : <p> B : You could be looking too late or too early to see the maximum effect on Rho activation . We recommend to always do time curves for stimuli that have unclear effects on Rho activation . For example , LPA is a well-known Rho activator that has Rho-dependent effects on cells and their cytoskeleton for prolonged times . The Rho activation seen by LPA treatment , on the other hand , is very transient . The spike in measurable Rho activity is often gone within 10 min . <p> C : Too much time may have elapsed between the cell lysis and the addition of the concentration-equalized lysates to the G-LISA wells . This will lead to smaller differences between samples . One way to get around this problem , especially if you are handling large numbers of samples , is to snap-freeze the samples in liquid nitrogen as soon as possible after lysis and clarification . To do this , lyse your cells , clarify the lysates , take off 30 l of lysate for concentration determination and snap freeze the remaining sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be determined without time pressure . Once all samples are prepared and measured with regards to protein concentration , thaw all samples quickly , dilute as needed and add to the G-LISA wells according to the manual . <p> Question 2 . How can I eliminate high variability between samples when using the absorbance-based G-LISA assays ? <p> Two usual causes : <p> Not flicking and tapping the plate vigorously enough between washes . <p> Check to make sure that there are no bubbles in the wells . Bubbles will affect the readings . <p> Question 3 . How do I reduce high background readings when using the luminescence based kits ( Cat . # BK121 and BK126 ) ? <p> Users have successfully used a gel scanner to read the plate and achieve lower readings with a 12:1 ratio between positive control and background readings . Alternatively , many luminometers have a dynamic range for sensitivity ( gain ) and integration time . These parameters should be adjusted and evaluated under control conditions to optimize signal detection . It is also important to note that baseline luminescence readings will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control protein samples are 3-5 fold higher than lysis buffer blank , the machine is accurately measuring active GTPase levels . <p> Question 4 . Will the G-LISA assay work for my specific cell type ? <p> Since Rho and Rho signaling pathways are highly conserved between species , the G-LISA kits are likely to work for all mammalian species and many other eukaryotic organisms . We are compiling a list of cell lines and species where G-LISA has been tested . See Table 1 at the bottom of this page . If you have used G-LISA with a cell type or species not listed in the table , we would very much like to hear from you . Email us about your experience . <p> Table 1 . Examples of cell/tissue types compatible with G-LISA assays <p> Question 5 . How can I activate Rho , Rac or Cdc42 GTPases ? <p> We recommend preparing positive control sample lysates that can be used with each G-LISA assay . For activation of the Rho GTPase , we recommend treating serum-starved cells for 10-30 min with 0.25-1 unit/ml of calpeptin ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , treatment of serum-starved cells for 2 min with 10 ng/ml of epidermal growth factor is recommended ( cat# CN02 ) . For activation of the Cdc42 GTPase , we recommend treatment of serum-starved cells for 1 min with 100 ng/ml of epidermal growth factor ( cat# CN02 ) . Additionally , we recommend omission of the PBS wash before lysing cells that have activated Cdc42 as the PBS wash alone can activate this GTPase . Finally , please see the attached table 2 for a list of common activators accompanied by the relevant citation and additional experimental information . <p> Table 2 . Activators of Rho , Rac and Cdc42 <p> Question 6 . How should I create a cell extract for testing and setting up the G-LISA assays ? <p> We recommend preparing two control cell extracts that can be used to set up the G-LISA assay with your cell or tissue type . A simple activated/control state pair of extracts can be made by growing cells to 50% confluency in serum-containing media , washing twice with room temperature PBS , preparing lysate as normal , aliquoting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand at RT for 1h which will degrade the signal to a low signal and will be the control state . A second defrosted aliquot to be used immediately will be considered " activated " , which most serum grown cells are . <p> Question 7 . Can I use the same lysis buffer to prepare lysates for use in the RhoA , Rac and Cdc42 G-LISA assays ? <p> The Rac and RhoA G-LISA kits use the same lysis buffer . The Cdc42 G-LISA kit ( Cat . # BK127 ) uses a different lysis buffer . The buffer components are proprietary , but in general , the lysis buffers contain a buffer , detergents and salts . The Cdc42 lysis buffer is about 2X more concentrated than the other lysis buffer in regard to salt and detergent concentrations . So you could make the extracts in the Cdc42 lysis buffer and dilute them in the other lysis buffer for the Rac1 and RhoA assays . As a reminder , be sure to aim for approximately 0.5 - 1 mg/ml protein concentration when performing the lysis . At higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal due to proteolysis , increased phosphatase/kinase activity and increased GAP activity . <p> Question 8 . Can I use the G-LISA kits to measure GTPase activity in tissue lysates ? <p> Yes , tissue lysates can be used instead of cell lysates and the general G-LISA instructions should be followed with the following modification . We recommend isolating the tissue , chopping the tissue into 1 mm chunks and macerating as quickly as possible , perhaps as quickly as 2 min total time . The small GTPase signaling pathway is very quick to change and activated GTPases can be hydrolyzed very quickly . Homogenization can be achieved in the lysis buffer with a micro-pestel and mortar ( see Fisher or VWR ) . Alternatively , 1 mm chunks can be drop frozen in liquid nitrogen for later processing . After homogenization , centrifugation is performed to remove cell debri and the protein concentration is determined . Phosphatase inhibitors are necessary for measuring Rho-GTP in artery samples , but we do not know whether other tissues require these . We recommend the following mixture , a combination of false substrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to consider when dealing with potential variation in the experimental tissue samples , e.g. , GAP activity , GEF activity , phosphatase activity , physical treatment and time to freezing . To reduce the enzyme activities , you can prepare the lysates as described above . A good test for lysates is to see what happens to them when you incubate at RT for 0 , 2 , 10 and 20 min . If the signal goes down rapidly , then your extracts need stabilizing . Try to aim for an extract concentration of 0.5 mg/ml because then the enzyme activities will be reduced . High activation states under non-stimulated conditions might be due to the GEF activity or the physical treatment during excision ( try a new sharp scalpel and slice rather than chop the tissue ) . 1 mm3 chunks should be frozen in liquid nitrogen . If these suggestions do not help , then try adding 300 mM NaCl and 0.2% SDS to the lysis buffer as this will reduce the GEF and GAP activities by reducing their interaction with the small G-proteins . <p> Question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in matrigel or other 3-D growth conditions ? <p> Cells grown in 3-D culture in Matrigel or collagen gels can be assayed using the luminescence-based ( BK121 and BK126 ) kits . The low amounts of cells in 3D cultures makes the conventional pull-down assay very difficult , variable and expensive . Customers have successfully used the G-LISA assay with cells grown in these conditions . Please see Keely et al. , 2007 ( Methods in Enzymology , v426 , p27 ) and Petroll et al. , 2008 ( J Cell Physiol , v217 , p162 ) for in-depth descriptions using G-LISA technology and 3-D cultures . An additional modification we suggest is to increase the ratio of extract/binding buffer from the recommended 1:1 ( v/v ) to 1:3 . <p> Question 10 . Can I use the G-LISA kits to detect other isoforms of the Rho , Rac and Ral GTPases ? <p> The RhoA G-LISA kit ( Cat . # BK121 and BK124 ) can be used to detect RhoB or RhoC . The Rac G-LISA ( Cat . # BK125 and BK128 ) can be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . # BK129 ) can be used to detect RalB . In all cases , the G-LISA wells capture multiple isoforms of the respective GTPase and the specificity of the primary antibody added to the wells determines which activated isoforms are detected and quantified .

Please see Hall et al. , 2008 ( Neoplasia. v10 , p797 ) for a successful example of this modification of G-LISA technology .

@@109313999 @4713999/ <h> Neurodegeneration : Rhes , SUMOylation , and Huntington 's Disease <p> The small G-protein Rhes ( Ras Homolog Enriched in Striatum ) is a 266 amino acid protein found predominantly in striatum , and to a lesser extent , the cerebral cortex ( Falk et al. , 1999 ) . Recent research has revealed that this GTPase may be key to understanding the paradoxical finding that while many different types of cells throughout the brain and body express wild-type and mutant huntingtin protein ( mHTT ) , striatal neurons ( and to a degree , cortical neurons ) have a selective vulnerability in Huntingtons disease ( HD ) ( Harrison , 2012 ; Harrison and LaHoste , 2013 ) . HD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by &gt;35 CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene , resulting in expression of mHTT that contains multiple glutamine residues ( a.k.a. polyglutamine or polyQ repeats ) . <p> HD is incurable and untreatable , causing deficits in movement , cognition , and mood . Neurons expressing mHTT are selectively lost in striatal and cortical neurons , despite the ubiquitous expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peripheral tissues ( Harrison , 2012 ; Harrison and LaHoste , 2013 ) . mHTT exists in two forms in neurons : 1 . toxic soluble monomer form and 2. aggregates or inclusions which sequester the protein . These insoluble aggregates are believed to be neuroprotective ( Saudou et al. , 1998 ; Gong et al. , 2008 ; Lu and Palacino , 2013 ) ( Fig. 1 ) . mHTT is modified by multiple post-translational modifications ( PTMs ) , including SUMOylation . This PTM causes deaggregation of the inclusions , releasing the soluble mHTT monomers and increasing neurotoxicity ( Steffan et al. , 2004 ) ( Fig. 1 ) . <p> Importantly , expression of mHTT by itself does not confer HD pathology ( Zeron et al. , 2002 ; Okamoto et al. , 2009 ) . Thus , there are other proteins or signaling pathways involved in mediating mHTT-induced neurodegeneration . A major breakthrough in HD research came with the discovery that Rhes preferentially binds mutant over wild-type HTT and acts as a SUMO E3 ligase to SUMOylate mHTT in vitro ( Subramaniam et al. , 2009 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhes increases levels of soluble mHTT and augments mHTT-mediated neurotoxicity via deaggregation of inclusions and/or reduced inclusion formation ( Subramaniam et al. , 2009 ) . Rhes is also SUMOylated itself ( Subramaniam et al. , 2009 ) . As would be expected , co-expression of Rhes and a mHTT protein reduced neuron viability , while silencing of the Rhes gene protected the cells from mHTT-mediated neurotoxicity in an in vitro neuron model of HD ( Seredenina et al. , 2011 ) ( Fig. 1 ) . Interestingly , mHTT is not the only protein targeted by Rhes for SUMOylation as Rhes enhances cross-SUMOylation between the SUMOylating enzymes E1 and Ubc9 and Rhes knockout mice have reduced levels of general SUMOylation in their striata ( Subramaniam et al. , 2010 ) . <p> Figure 1 : Processing of mHTT protein in neurons and its further modification by Rhes , leading to neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration . <p> The role of Rhes in HD was further confirmed in vivo with a HD transgenic mouse model crossed with Rhes knockout mice . These double transgenic mice experienced a significantly delayed and decreased onset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similarly , a striatal specific in vivo HD model was not reproduced in Rhes knockout mice ( Mealer et al. , 2013 ) . This finding demonstrates that Rhes depletion protects neurons from the cell death and motor deficits induced by the HD-causing treatment in normal mice ( Mealer et al. , 2013 ) . <p> As additional tools for studying the PTMs of proteins , including GTPases , become available , advances in our understanding of a cells physiological and pathological processes will follow .

@@109314002 @4714002/ <p> Introduction The Ras switch operates by alternating between an active , GTP-bound state and an inactive , GDP-bound state . Understanding the mechanisms that regulate activation / inactivation of Ras-like GTPases is of obvious biological significance and is a subject of intense investigation . The fact that Ras family effector proteins will specifically recognize the GTP bound form of the protein has been exploited experimentally to develop a powerful affinity purification assay that monitors Ras protein activation . The assay uses the Ras-binding domain ( RBD ) of the Ras effector kinase Raf1 . The Raf-RBD domain has been shown to bind specifically to the GTP-bound form of Ras proteins . The fact that the Raf-RBD has a high affinity for GTP-Ras and that its binding results in a significantly reduced intrinsic and catalytic rate of hydrolysis of Ras make it an ideal tool for affinity purification of GTP-Ras from cell lysates . The Raf-RBD is in the form of a GST fusion protein , which allows one to " pull-down " the Raf-RBD/GTP-Ras complex with glutathione affinity beads . The assay therefore provides a simple means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ras is determined by a western blot using a Ras specific antibody . <p> Kit contentsThe kit contains sufficient materials for 20 assays , depending on assay setup , and includes reagents for positive and negative controls .

The following components are included : <p> Incubating with the primary antibody overnight at 4C and using the appropriate ECL detection system . <p> Question 2 : How much of the beads should I use for my pull-down experiments ? <p> Answer 2 : Raf-RBD beads ( Cat . # RF02 ) will bind to Ras-GDP with a much lower affinity than Ras-GTP . If too many Raf-RBD beads are added to the pull-down assay there will be significant binding to inactive ( GDP-bound ) Ras . The result of this will be an underestimation of Ras activation . For this reason , we highly recommend performing a bead titration to determine optimal conditions for any given Ras activation or inactivation assay . Once optimal conditions have been established , bead titrations should no longer be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 66 , 132 and 198 g ) bead titrations . <p> Question 3 : How can I test whether the beads are working properly ? <p> Answer 3 : A standard biological assay for Raf-RBD beads consists of a Ras protein pull-down from cells loaded with either GTP ? S ( Cat . # BS01 ) or GDP . Here are guidelines to follow ( see Cat . # RF02 or BK008 datasheets for more details ) : <p> Positive Cellular Protein Control : <p> Total cell lysate ( 200 500 g ) should be loaded with GTP ? S as a positive control for the pull-down assay . The following reaction details how to load endogenous Ras with the nonhydrolysable GTP analog ( GTP ? S ) .

@@109314005 @4714005/ <h> Drugable site selection for KSP inhibitors <p> Since the discovery of the first kinesin spindle protein ( KSP , also known as Eg5 , KIF11 ) inhibitor , monastrol , in 1999 ( 1 ) , there have been a plethora of articles , 3D structures , and FDA applications based on the same binding site ( review 2 ) . The binding site is called the allosteric monastrol binding site ( AMBS ) which functionally plays a significant role in transducing chemical energy to movement of the neck-linker region . Drugs that bind this site are non-competitive inhibitors of ATP and microtubule ( MT ) binding . To date , the majority of published drugs bind to this site which is coincidental in most cases ; the reason for this is not apparent but possibly because the site is one of the most dynamic sub-domains of kinesin ( 3 ) . <p> More recently , interest has focused on other drugable sites in part because the AMBS compounds are known to select for resistance mutations ( 4,5 ) . Alternate sites could be ATP or MT binding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Fig. 1 , which shows their general location with respect to the MT and coiled-coil tail which binds adjacent KSP molecules in a tetramer design ( 6 ) . Excellent biochemical work by multiple groups has enabled classification of new binding sites ( 7-10 ) ; their method of classification sets a necessary standard for characterization of future KSP inhibitors ( see below ) . <p> Figure 1 : Kinesins drug binding sites . <p> Figure 1 . Drugable sites within KSP motor domain . The magenta color represents KSPs polypeptide structure in a worm/tube scheme , and the MT is in ghostly grey . Drugs representing the four different known sites in KSP : a ) AMBS represented by MK-0731 ( 12 ) ; b ) ATP site represented by ADP ( 13 ) ; c ) MT site represented by NSC 622124 ( 10 ) ; and d ) a second allosteric site ( A2 ) binding near to the MT and ATP sites represented by GSK-1 ( 9 ) . <p> At present , there are no front runner sites with regard to the optimal site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very high affinity drugs ( 1-10 nM range ) have been developed for the AMBS but without the expected improvement in clinical efficacy . Although the combination of anti-tumor drugs with KSP inhibitors looks like a promising use of the inhibitors ( review 11 ) , the use of KSP inhibitors alone has not yielded exciting clinical results . One aspect of developing very high affinity drugs is the likelihood that affinity for off-target sites is also improved ; these could include binding to serum proteins , detoxification sites , MDR elimination sites , and fat tissue deposits as well as other enzymatic targets in the cell . Two recent reports emphasize these phenomena : 1 . the recent finding that monastrol inhibits urease with similar binding affinity ( 15 ) and 2. the finding that a new compound shows binding to two sites on KSP alone ( 8 ) . One way of looking at the phenomena is that there will always be off-target sites for all compounds , and that improving affinity for a particular site will not per se improve efficacy in the clinic . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dose applied to patients has not been proportionally decreased ( Fig. 2 ) ; for example , MK-0731 is administered at close to the maximum tolerated dose of 34 mg i.v . ( 2 ) , whereas a 10 fold excess over the dissociation constant ( Kd ) wouldimply using only 100 g per patient . Thus , very high affinity drugs might not be the way forward ; instead it may be better to use low micromolar Kd compounds and administer 20-100 mg per dose . In this case , serum binding and elimination mechanisms would be saturated while the target is effectively inhibited . <p> Figure 2 : Two drugs in the AMBS site . <p> Figure 2 . Monastrol and MK-0731 in the AMBS have very different affinities , low and very high , respectively . Monastrol is in panel A ( 14 ) and MK-0731 in panel B ( 12 ) . Note the more complex aromatic structure of the high affinity compound . <p> One key aspect to KSPs drug family future is to develop standard characterization schemes that substantially characterize each compound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ATP , MTs , and monastrol to determine site of action ; 2. cell biological : classification of cell phenotype ; 3. cell line resistant mutations and sequence analysis ; 4. drug cross-linking and peptide analysis ; and 5. 3D protein model representation of the binding site .

Functionally kinesins can be divided into two major groups , those involved in vesicle transport and membrane organization and those involved in mitosis . The central role of kinesins in cell division makes them of great interest as anti-mitotic targets . Of critical importance to the premise of kinesins as drug targets is the fact that all available data indicate that antibodies and small molecules directed against mitotic kinesins specifically inhibit the mitotic process but have no effect upon kinesin vesicle transport functions . The fact that kinesins represent a new anti-mitotic target and that they are expressed predominantly during cell division suggests that they may be superior to and/or complementary to the current highly popular anti-tubulin drugs such as paclitaxel .

Briefly , cells are grown on glass coverslips , treated with control and experimental conditions , fixed , permeabilized and incubated with PAK-PBD or Rhotekin-RBD proteins . Localization of the bound proteins is accomplished by immunocytochemical detection of the GST tag with an anti-GST antibody that will allow localization of the activated small G-proteins bound by PAK-PBD or Rhotekin-RBD . Cytoskeleton has not verified this technique as a viable and accurate means of localizing activated small G-proteins and because it is not a widely utilized technique , we can not confirm that this procedure achieves an accurate representation of activated GTPases.

PTMs play a critical role in signal transduction , protein stability and turnover , protein-protein recognition and interaction , as well as spatial localization 2 . <p> Due to the importance of PTMs in basic biology as well as in disease pathogenesis , there is a significant interest in identifying regulatory PTM mechanisms for every protein of interest ( POI ) . Investigation of PTM modified POIs normally require an enrichment step as these modified proteins are relatively low in abundance . The majority of PTM detection methods have been developed in combination with enrichment strategies to provide the best opportunity to identify , validate , and study the function of regulatory PTMs for a POI 3,4 .

Importantly , IP allows researchers to enrich for specific , low-abundance PTM modifications on a target POI . Enrichment is achieved through affinity-based purification technology . Antibodies ( or specific binding molecules ) attached to a solid support matrix ( such as agarose resin ) bind to the POI or PTM , while non-targeted proteins in the complex lysate are not captured and removed through wash steps . The enriched proteins are then removed off of the support matrix using elution buffers and isolated in a concentrated volume .

Figure 2 provides example data utilizing POI-antibody specific IP , where phosho-SRF was detected using an SRF antibody for IP follwed by phospho serine antibody detection 6 . Target protein antibody IP has traditionally been the first approach used to determine if a POI is modified by a particular PTM , possibly due to the investigator 's expertise with the POI specific antibody for western blot applications . <p> However , as Figure 1 shows , utilizing the antibody in an IP assay is quite different than its use in a western blot application . It is not surprizing that often times IP with a POI specific antibody fails , or requires significant optimization because it is performing a different function in an IP vs western blot application ; therefore , as a starting point ensure that the POI specific antibody has been validated for IP . For initial discovery experiments , performing an IP with a PTM specific antibody may be an easier approach , where IP is performed with a PTM specific antibody and the POI specific antibody is used for western blot analysis . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to optimize both the IP and the western steps which may be required in a protein specific IP . <p> Another point of consideration , is that previous research has shown that PTM modifications may block the antibody binding site on a POI ; thus , false negatives are possible 7 . Either PTM specific IP or ovexpression IP may circumvent this problem , and should be considered if target antibody IP fails . See below for details on these two approaches . <p> Figure 3 .

Still , a significant benefit of the overexpression method include the ability to create mutated forms of the target protein to determine which specific amino acids are modified by a specific PTM . <p> It is important to note overexpression IP assays are not effective for analyzing changes in the target protein 's physiologic PTM state , as overexpression may mask results .

Mass spectrometry based PTM identification is a powerful tool , and is a valuable complement to conventional western blot PTM identification ; especially for site specific identification . <p> Additional benefits of mass spectrometry are its potentially unbiased approach , and independence from antibodies for detection of PTM modified proteins . While mass spectrometry theoretically provides an unbiased snapshot of PTM modified proteins , it has several limitations which bias against certain types of proteins .

@@109314024 @4714024/ <h> Life Inside a Microtubule <p> Microtubules ( MTs ) are dynamic cytoskeletal structures with multiple functions in cell growth , division , and morphological change . This review focuses on the MT lumen as a possible functional entity . The internal environment of the MT has its own peculiar biophysical state and is largely thought to be excluded from cytoplasmic influence , except for the 2 nm2 lateral pores1 and two 200 nm2 entrances at its ends2,3 . Its biophysical state is outside the scope of this article , but it has very interesting vitreous , electromagnetic resonance , and optical properties4 . <p> Several groups have expanded our view of what life is like inside MTs . The first of these breakthroughs came in the 1960s and 1970s by studying the structure of MTs at nm resolution with electron microscopy . Among other observations of MTs , researchers found evidence of 4-7 nm spherical particles in the lumen of MTs of highly fixed cells5-8 . The particles existence and frequency varied between cell type , with neuronal cells having the most particles . Also , Burton9 found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disassembly and re-assembly of intracellular MTs . Similar observations over the course of the next 30 years have culminated with observation of these particles in the MT lumen of non-fixed frozen sections of cells using vitreous cryoelectron microscopy or cryoelectron tomography10 . Identification of intraluminal components has been difficult , but recent reports have found evidence of tubulin binding proteins and tubulin modifying enzymes . <p> Tubulin acetyltransferase ( TAT ) is known to transfer an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the luminal side of stable MTs at Lys40 of alpha-tubulin1,11 . Although it is thought that luminal acetylation does not influence MT stability , it has been associated with differential binding of MT-associated proteins ( MAPs ) , kinesin motor affinity ( involving MT surface binding site12,13 , but this was recently disputed by two groups11,14 ) , MT severing15 , and increased MT stiffness which is useful in mechanosensory and cilia functions16,17 . Whether the TATs and tubulin histone deacetylase enzymes ( HDAC6 and Sirt2 ) are a component of the 4-7 nm particles described above remains to be determined . However , the single or dimer form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 3 x 6 x 3 nm ovoid18 ) and there is evidence of MEC-17 ( a C. elegans TAT homolog ) being localized within the MT lumen and in close association with the inner MT wall16 .

In cilia and flagella organelles , binary microtubule structures are stabilized by microtubule inner proteins ( MIPs ) which transverse protofilaments and the A and B microtubule complexes27,28,29 . <p> How do proteins and particles get into the MT lumen ? There are the obvious entry points such as those mentioned in the first paragraph ( 2 nm2 pores and 200 nm2 ends ) . However , each have limitations , as the 2 nm2 pores access is limited to small molecules ( &lt;1000 Da20,21 ) or thin strand-like molecules ; for the MT ends , access is limited by the distance molecules can travel by diffusion22 . A MTs mid-point can be upwards of 40 m away from the MT end , and theoretical measurements put the diffusion rate of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years/40 m , depending on the molecules affinity for internal MT walls22 . Less obvious entry points include frayed MT ends10,23 and growing MT ends in conjunction with MT treadmilling24,25 , and the breathing walls of the MT lattice recently observed by vitreous cryoelectron microscopy17 ( see Fig. 1 ) . <p> Figure 1 : Schematic representation of the entry points into the MT lumen .

Subsequent treadmilling could allow the captured entities to move to the minus end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible mechanism to explain why the MAP tau has a binding site in the lumen as well as on the surface of MTs when MTs are formed in the presence of tau , but not when tau is added to pre-formed MTs which only results in tau binding to the outside surface of MTs19 . Thus , in practical experiments to show molecules captured inside growing MTs , molecules can be included in a reaction containing polymerizing tubulin as compared to using pre-formed MTs ( for example , compare Cat . # BK029 versus Cat . # T240 datasheet method sections , see below ) . <p> In summary , several recent key papers indicate important molecules reside inside MTs , including acetylated alpha tubulin , MIPs , TATs , the major MT stabilizing agent ( MSA ) binding sites of taxol26 , and of course , tau protein .

A general ATP-site inhibitor can be a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog . These give excellent inhibition as presented in Funk et al. , 2004 ( Development of high-throughput screens for discovery of kinesin adenosine triphosphatase modulators .

Of the three classes of Arf GTPases , Arf6 is the only member of class III and uniquely localizes to the plasma membrane and endosomes , positioning it to regulate cellular processes dependent upon dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton , including endocytosis , exocytosis , trafficking/recycling of membrane-localized proteins , and membrane protrusions ( e.g. , ruffles ) . These cellular functions underlie physiological and pathological cell motility and intracellular trafficking . Arf6 cycles between an inactive , GDP-bound state and an active , GTP-bound state to act as a molecular switch in the cellular processes listed above . Activation of Arf6 by exchange of GDP for GTP is mediated by guanine exchange factors ( GEFs ) while inactivation by GTP hydrolysis is mediated by GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) 1-3 . In this newsletter , we discuss the mechanistic roles Arf6 and its GEFs have in cancer cell invasion and metastasis . <p> Arf6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton . Recent work demonstrates that Arf6 has an essential role in tumor angiogenesis and growth , as well as cancer cell invasion and metastasis4-8 .

Prevention of Arf6 activity/cycling inhibits cancer progression6,7,9 . <p> Of the fourteen known Arf GEFs , eight target Arf6 , and of those , five are Arf6-specific . Arf6 GEFs are activated directly through binding with the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain and recruited to the plasma membrane by binding to phosphoinositides produced by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) , as well as a variety of ligand-activated cell surface receptors . There the GEFs ' catalytic Sec7 domain activates membrane-localized Arf6 .

@@109314043 @4714043/ <h> Probing Sub-domains of Kinesin <p> Recent reports have highlighted a new phase of research for molecular motors . In contrast to five or more years ago , when macromolecular approaches were used1 , recent research has focused on resolving how kinesin is regulated by intramolecular dynamics . There are two main technical approaches that have allowed measurement of these dynamic mechanisms ; these are 1 . total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to observe single kinesin motors and 2. sub-domain swapping from one motor to another . <p> Interestingly , kinesin motor proteins are relatively flexible in accepting substitutions of small amino acid stretches from one partner to another . Kinesins are comprised of two general domains : 1 . the catalytic core and 2. the non-catalytic regions which include , the neck linker ( NL ) , coiled-coil ( CC ) and cargo binding sub-domains . The NL sub-domain is 14-22 amino acids in length ( see Figure 1 ) and Hoeprich et al.2 reported this sub-domain can be swapped from kinesin 1 ( K-1 ) to kinesin 2 ( K-2 ) with measurable function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al.2 used single kinesin tracking to show that the length of the NL sub-domain regulates the ability to move across the microtubule ( MT ) landscape when MAPs ( e.g. , tau ) are coating its surface . K-2 hardly misses a step when transversing these obstacles , whereas K-1 stutters and progresses more slowly compared to an uncoated MT . In a parameter called processivity or run length , which is a measure of the distance that a motor travels before dissociating from the MT , K-2 travels on average the same distance whether the MT is coated or uncoated with different Tau isoforms ( 3RS or 4RL ) , whereas K-1 travels shorter distances on Tau-coated MTs before dissociating . When the NL is genetically swapped between these motors , the characteristic processivity is also swapped . <p> Figure 1 : Schematic diagram of kinesin indicating the position of Loop 5 , neck , and cover neck relative to the motor domain , coiled-coil , and cargo . Note they are in close proximity to each other and hence interact during the mechanochemical transduction of energy to movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlighted the importance of the NL length in determining processivity of K-5 ( also named Eg5 or KIF11 ) . Their results indicate that with a longer NL , e.g. , 13-22 amino-acids , processivity is not altered , whereas 11 amino acids and shorter stretches cause decreased processivity . In contrast , velocity and force generation are much less affected by change in length of the NL . However , Shastry and Hancock find dissimilar results with an optimal NL length of 14 amino acids for processivity4,5 . The discordant results might be due to different buffers being used , which is noted by Shastry and Hancock as an important determinant of affinity and run length . Interestingly , NL regions have highly specific sequences and lengths for each motor , indicating that this area is optimized for the particular motors function . In Table 1 , we see that NLs vary from 14 to 22 amino acids and may contain prolines . Prolines are predicted to form a kink in the structure which may cause auto-inhibition of motor activity by bending the coiled-coil back on to the motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motor , i.e. , enable protofilament hopping or circumferential travel . <p> Table 1 : <p> Note : *monomer ; **dimer .

The typical classification of K-3 members as having low processivity seemed to be contrary to their function as vesicle motors which transport vesicles to distal parts of the cell . Soppina et al.6 showed that replacing the NL-CC1 subdomains with a coiled-coil resulted in a highly processive dimeric construct , hence demonstrating that , in fact , the motors are highly processive when dimerized , which occurs in vivo when they bind cargo7 . <p> Finally , a complex interplay of kinesin sub-domains was reported by Hesse et al.8 K-1 is thought to contain three sub-domains : Cover , NL , and L13 ( analogous to L5 in other kinesins ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Pi release to the NL , and hence contribute to motor domain movement . By swapping these three sub-domains between K-1 and K-5 family members , Hesse et al.8 discovered some individual features that relate to the specific function of those motors . For example the K-5 members domains , when transferred to K-1 , conferred the characteristic lower resilience to force representative of K-5 members . <p> These studies indicate a new level of understanding of kinesin sub-domains , demonstrating that they are interchangeable but also carry specific information about the function of their original motor . These sub-domains are short stretches of amino acids that appear to have a high impact on the motors specific functions . These sites are also potential targets for molecular intervention with respect to drug development and molecular biology tools .

@@109314050 @4714050/ <h> Rac1 in Diabetes : The Good and Bad <p> Elevations in blood glucose levels are sensed in pancreatic -cells , which respond through a complex signaling pathway involving mitochondrial-dependent glucose metabolism1 . The culmination of this pathway is the mobilization of intracellular insulin-loaded vesicles that fuse with the cell membrane releasing their contents into the bloodstream , which is referred to as glucose-stimulated insulin secretion ( GSIS ) 1 . Blood glucose normalization is then facilitated by insulin responsive target organs like skeletal muscle , adipose tissue , and the liver . When insulin engages the insulin receptor on the cells in these target tissues it signals the mobilization of the GLUT4 glucose transporter , which is actively shuttled to the plasma membrane thereby allowing the uptake of glucose from the blood2 . <p> Chronic high blood sugar ( hyperglycemia ) results in a state of glucose toxicity with concomitant lipid toxicity ( dyslipidemia ) that can lead to the development of Type 2 Diabetes ( T2D ) . The incidence of diabetes continues to rise and in 2015 there were an estimated 415 million people affected worldwide3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically insulin resistance in the target tissues and impaired GSIS4 . It is noteworthy that exercise is generally recommended in addition to changes in diet to help control blood glucose in patients with T2D . This approach takes advantage of the fact that skeletal muscle contraction drives glucose uptake through an insulin-independent mechanism5 . <p> The positive role of Rac1 in facilitating glucose control <p> The Rho family small GTPase , Rac1 , plays an important role in both GSIS in pancreatic -cells and GLUT4 translocation to the membrane in skeletal muscle . The role of Rac1 in both processes appears to center around its ability to facilitate the trafficking of vesicles through changes in the cortical actin structure6-7 . Loss of Rac1 function either through gene knockout in mice or siRNA mediated reduction in Rac1 levels attenuates GSIS6,8 . The importance of Rac1 in GSIS has also been validated pharmacologically using small molecules that block Rac1 activation either directly or indirectly through preventing the association of Rac1 with its upstream activators known as guanine exchange factors ( GEFs ) . The indirect inhibitors NSC23766 and EHop-016 inhibit the interaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Figure 1 . ( Left ) Schematic representation of GSIS with the role of Rac1 indicated in red . ( Right ) Insulin signaling in target tissues with the good/bad roles of Rac1 in red . <p> Using these inhibitors in INS 832/13 cells and primary rat islet cells , glucose-induced Rac1 activation and membrane association was suppressed and GSIS was reduced11-12 . Additionally , siRNA knockdown of Tiam1 or Vav2 in INS 832/13 cells also blocked glucose-induced Rac1 activation11-12 , confirming a role for each of these GEFs in activating Rac1 in response to glucose . Moreover , the direct Rac1 inhibitor , EHT 186413 , also blocked glucose-induced Rac1 activation and attenuated GSIS in INS 832/13 cells14 . It is important to point out that although the focus of this discussion is Rac1 other small G-proteins are known to play a role in GSIS ( e.g. Cdc42 and Arf6 ) 15 . <p> As mentioned above , target tissues respond to circulating insulin by mobilizing GLUT4 receptors . This process requires Rac1 and its downstream kinase effector PAK1 , except in adipose tissue where Rac1 does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also interesting to note that Rac1 plays a role in muscle contraction dependent glucose uptake17 . Both Rac1 and PAK1 have been shown to be activated in response to insulin in both mouse and human skeletal muscle18 . A muscle specific knockout of Rac1 in mice results in decreased insulin-dependent PAK1 activation , GLUT4 translocation , and insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glucose uptake7 . These mice also display an overall decreased insulin response , reflecting the importance of skeletal muscle in glucose control . Consistent with these findings , the pharmacologic use of the small molecule Rac1 Inhibitor II was shown to reduce glucose uptake in mouse skeletal muscle19 . <p> The negative role of Rac1 in promoting diabetic complications <p> Activated Rac1 ( i.e. GTP-bound ) is a necessary component of the NADPH oxidase ( Nox ) holoenzyme that plays an important role in generating extra-mitochondrial reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) 20 . It is known that glucose stimulates Nox-dependent ROS production and that a tonic increase in ROS is important for proper GSIS to occur21 ; however chronic **26;1899;TOOLONG leads to the overproduction of ROS , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reduction in GSIS22 . <p> The long term clinical complications of poorly managed T2D are manifold and include diabetic retinopathy , neuropathy , nephropathy , and cardiomyopathy23 . Growing evidence indicates Rac1 is also involved in many if not all of the above pathologies , in large part , as a consequence of the Rac1-depedent overproduction of ROS . A few examples include the involvement of Rac1 in diabetic cardiomyopathy , where Rac1-dependent ROS production leads to cardiomyocyte apoptosis24 . In the case of diabetic retinopathy , Rac1 has been shown to facilitate a breakdown in the blood retinal barrier , which is an essential step in disease progression25 . The Rac1/PAK1 signaling axis has also been shown to be important for podocyte injury by promoting a process known as **26;1927;TOOLONG transition ( EMT ) in the kidney26 , which is a critical element in the development of pathological fibrosis that is associated with diabetic nephropathy . <p> Conclusions <p> The observation that Rac1 has both physiologically and pathologically important roles in T2D implies that therapeutics directly targeting Rac1 to treat diabetic pathologies may experience challenges .

@@109314053 @4714053/ <h> Post-translational Modifications Regulate Ral GTPases <p> RalA and RalB GTPases regulate cell motility , morphology , signaling , vesicular trafficking , and endo/exocytosis . The regulation of these functions is critical for the development and spread of cancer1-4 , implicating Ral in oncogenesis and metastasis . Both isoforms are integral for Ras-mediated tumorigenesis , metastasis , and invasion2-6 . Despite sharing 82% amino acid sequence identity , effectors , and structural/biochemical properties4 , RalA and RalB have their own unique functions in oncogenesis due to distinct subcellular localization and differential effector interactions2,4,7,8 . Ral localization , binding partners , and function are regulated by post-translational modifications ( PTMs ) 2,4,9-11 . Ral PTMs are found within the Switch 1 and C-terminal hypervariable regions and include geranylgeranylation , carboxymethylation , palmitoylation , phosphorylation , and ubiquitination3,4 ( Tables 1 and 2 ) . <h> Geranylgeranylation <p> Geranylgeranylation ( GG ) is necessary for proper membrane localization and functionality of Ral12,13 . Geranylgeranylated RalA and RalB are both similarly localized to the plasma membrane13 ; however , others have reported differential localization11 . Both isoforms terminate in a CAAX motif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the signal motif for GG4 . GG is followed by carboxymethylation of the modified now terminal cysteine residue following enzymatic cleavage of the AAX residues4,14 . A subset of Ral proteins express the alternative CCAX motif , which signals modification by palmitoylation instead of carboxymethylation on the second cysteine4,15 . Formation of two differentially modified Ral proteins raises therapeutic dilemmas because CAAX processing enzymes are druggable targets16,17 . Proteins with the CCAX motif are likely immune to such treatments . <p> Inhibition of GG by either mutation of the cysteine residue or pharmacological inhibition of **25;2093;TOOLONG ( a.k.a . GGTase I ) disrupts Ral association with the membrane and functionality13 . GGTase I inhibitors target both isoforms ; however , differential effects follow the inhibition13 . GGTase I inhibitors prevent plasma membrane localization of either Ral isoform ; instead the Ral GTPases are found throughout the cytoplasm and perinuclear region13 . Additionally , a GGTase I inhibitor significantly decreases proliferation of various cancer cell lines in vitro18,19 , an effect replicated by genetic ablation of RalA18 . Similar GGTase I inhibitor-mediated anti-tumorigenic effects are observed in vivo19. 165271 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residues mediated by different kinases in vitro . The C-terminal RalA S18320 and S19421 residues are phosphorylated , which activates RalA10,21 . Both are specifically dephosphorylated by PP2A Ab , leading to decreased RalA activity20 . Loss of PP2A A expression increases phosphorylation of S194 and S183 , increasing RalA activation and inducing RalA-mediated cell transformation20 . The kinase responsible for phosphorylating S183 is unknown22 , while S194 is phosphorylated by Aurora A kinase ( AAK ) 21 . Besides increasing activity , AAK-mediated phosphorylation of S194 causes trafficking of active RalA and the effector RalBP1 to internal membranes , followed by increases in RalA/RalBP1-mediated downstream signaling10 . For example , phosphorylated RalA and RalBP1 re-localize to the mitochondria itself or mitochondrial vesicles , initiating a signaling cascade that results in mitotic mitochondria fission23 . Upon phosphorylation , RalA preferentially binds RalBP1 rather than exocyst subunits Sec5 or Exo8410 . In addition , phosphorylation of S194 regulates the in vivo and in vitro oncogenic functions of RalA10,21 . RalA is also phosphorylated by PKA22 on yet to be described residues . AKA inhibitors significantly decrease proliferation of cancer cells in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activation in cancer cells19 . <p> RalB is phosphorylated by PKC on S19824 and PKC alpha on S1929 . Phosphorylation of S198 stimulates activation of RalB9 , causes relocalization from plasma membrane to the perinuclear region24 , including endocytic vesicles9 , and regulates RalB oncogenic functions such as anchorage-independent growth , cell motility , and actin cytoskeleton dynamics in vitro24 . In vivo , RalB S198 phosphorylation is necessary for tumor growth and metastasis24 . Additionally , S198 phosphorylation alters RalBs effector interactions . Phospho-mimetic RalB is bound to RalBP1 preferentially at the endomembranes while phospho-deficient RalB is bound to Sec5 at the plasma membrane . The phosphorylation state of RalB regulates vesicle trafficking to and fusion with the plasma membrane and the subsequent release of vesicle cargo proteins9 . <h> Ubiquitination <p> Ubiquitination identifies proteins destined for proteasome-mediated degradation as well as regulating a proteins activity , localization , or binding partner(s) . The Ral isoforms are mainly monoubiquitinated in a nondegradative manner independent of activation state25 . However , RalA , but not RalB , is modified by nondegradative ubiquitination under anchorage-independent conditions . While both Ral isoforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutively ubiquitinated Ral constructs induce robust plasma membrane enrichment of RalA , but not RalB , which is localized as distinct puncta intracellularly . RalA ubiquitination triggers lipid raft enrichment at the plasma membrane . RalA is deubiquitinated in the raft microdomains which is necessary for endocytosis of the rafts25 . In a cyclical manner , endocytosis of lipid rafts caused an increase in RalA ubiquitination while blockade of endocytosis triggered a decrease . Several lysine residues are viable sites for Ral ubiquitination25 . Ubiquitination of the Lys47 RalB residue determines effector binding and subsequent functionality . When ubiquitinated , RalB binds to Sec5 rather than Exo84 ; however , upon deubiquitination , RalB binds to Exo84 preferentially26 . Binding to the former effector mediates innate immune response signaling while binding to the latter mediates autophagocytosis26 . <h> Conclusion <p> Ral GTPases undergo a multitude of PTMs that regulate their activity , subcellular localization , effector binding , and ultimately , function . Given the involvement of Ral proteins in Ras-mediated oncogenesis , there is a clear impetus to develop therapeutics that target Ral activation27 .

While the mechanism of this regulation is still being elucidated , it appears that in the absence of an Hh ligand , KIF7 negatively regulates GLI transcription factor activity , and in the presence of Hh signaling it positively influences GLI dependent signaling ; possibly through KIF7s Hh-dependent translocation from the base of primary cilia to the tip1 .

@@109314063 @4714063/ <h> 5/16/17 <p> The small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 ( Arf6 ) belongs to the Arf subfamily of Ras superfamily GTPases . Of the three classes of Arf GTPases , Arf6 is the only member of class III and uniquely localizes to the plasma membrane and endosomes , positioning it to regulate cellular processes dependent upon dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton , including endocytosis , exocytosis , trafficking/recycling of membrane-localized proteins , and membrane protrusions ( e.g. , ruffles ) . These cellular functions underlie physiological and pathological cell motility and intracellular trafficking . Arf6 cycles between an inactive , GDP-bound state and an active , GTP-bound state to act as a molecular switch in the cellular processes listed above . Activation of Arf6 by exchange of GDP for GTP is mediated by guanine exchange factors ( GEFs ) while inactivation by GTP hydrolysis is mediated by GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) 1-3 . In this newsletter , we discuss the mechanistic roles Arf6 and its GEFs have in cancer cell invasion and metastasis.

@@109314078 @4714078/ <h> September Newsletter : FtsZ Proteins : A Novel Anti-microbial Target <p> The tubulin homolog FtsZ ( Filamenting temperature-sensitive mutant Z ) protein is an essential prokaryotic cell divison protein . FtsZ is a GTPase that polymerizes in a nucleotide-dependent manner head-to-tail to form single-stranded filaments that assemble into a contractile ring called the Z-ring . This ring forms on the inside of the cytoplasmic membrane where it marks the future site of the septum of a dividing bacterial cell and is dynamically maintained through the course of cell division by continuous and rapid turnover of FtsZ polymers1-3 . FtsZ is the first protein to localize at the division site and recruits other proteins involved in bacterial cell division . Besides serving as a scaffold for other cell division proteins , FtsZ itself may exert cytokinetic forces that lead to cell division1-6 . <p> Given FtsZ 's essential role in bacterial cell division , it has recently become a novel target in the development of new antibiotic and anti-microbial agents7-12 . The unprecedented increase in antibiotic-resistant pathogens and lack of new antibiotic development highlights the need for new anti-microbials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Due to its novelty as a drug target , compounds targeting FtsZ would not be affected by current drug-resistance mechanisms14 . Initial FtsZ drug screens focused on drugs that inhibit eukaryotic tubulin polymerization given the functional and structural overlap between tubulin and FtsZ14 . There is little danger that an anti-FtsZ compound would also be anti-tubulin since FtsZ and tubulin only share 10-18% sequence similarity1,14-16 . <p> Currently , there are a multitude of compounds being evaluated as FtsZ protein inhibitors , including both synthetic small molecules ( e.g. , PC190723 ) , polypeptides , and inhibitors derived from naturally occurring agents , as well as nucleic acid inhibitors of ftsZ gene expression17,18 . To date , the only protein X-ray crystallography data for a FtsZ inhibitor are PC190723-Staphylococcus aureus co-crystals19,20 ( Fig. 1 ) . PC190723 , a benzamide derivative , potently inhibits S. aureus and Bacillus subtilis FtsZ proteins via binding in a cleft between the C-terminal domain and helix 7 in a region analogous to the Taxol binding site of tubulin17,19-21 ( Fig. 1 ) . These results suggest that the highest degree of binding is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suggesting that PC190723 inhibits FtsZ by first enhancing FtsZ polymerization and then stabilizing the polymers , thus preventing the necessary dynamic changes in FtsZ polymers for bacterial cell divison8,17,20 . The inactive FtsZ is mislocalized and instead of being localized in the middle of the cell , is distributed in distinct puncta , throughout the elongated cell . The major drawback to PC190723 is that it binds in a region of FtsZ that is prone to spontaneous anti-microbial resistance mutations ( Fig. 1 ) , meaing that compounds that bind here may present a limited ability to inhibit FtsZ . For this reason , analogs of PC190723 have been synthesized ( e.g. , TX707 ) and prodrug versions of PC190723 ( i.e. , TX541 ) and TX707 ( i.e. , TX709 ) were also developed and found to be effective against S. aureus ; however , their effectivness as broad-spectrum anti-microbials does not seem likely as they are not active against other Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens . In addition to these compounds , other potential FtsZ inhibitors in the midst of various stages of development , production , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peptide-based compounds , as well as nucleic acid-based compounds that inhibit ftsZ gene expression , in contrast to targeting the FtsZ protein as the other candidates do14,17,18 . <p> While these recent studies offer hope that targeting FtsZ proteins ( or the ftsZ gene ) will bear fruit in efforts to create antibiotics and anti-microbials against specific bacteria , current work does not support the hypothesis that targeting FtsZ wil lead to the identification and development of broad-spectrum anti-bacterial drugs . Indeed , the amino-acid sequence identity between different FtsZ species is 35 to 99% , and most commonly 40 to 60% ( see LONG ... for an homology database ) . Instead , using one FtsZ protein target will likely generate a highly specific drug to that species . For example , Haydon et al.21,22 reported that PC190723 inhibited FtsZ from S. aureus and B. subtilis ( 70% identity to each other ) , but not from Escherichia coli ( 51% and 47% identity , respectively ) . <p> Much remains to be done in pursuing anti-FtsZ drugs and translating the work of medicinal chemists into specific FtsZ inhibitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is important to use a rational drug discovery process , which requires structural and kinetic analyses of FtsZ binding compounds ( i.e. , inhibitors ) and mechanistic studies of anti-FtsZ compounds . <p> Several types of assays have been used to measure FtsZ polymerization , including GTPase , fluorescence quenching , FRET , sedimentation and light scatter assays . The requirements for drug screening applications are best served by the GTPase assay and fluorecence quenching formats . <p> Cytoskeleton , Inc. offers purified , active FtsZ proteins from multiple bacteria as well as custom services that can produce needed FtsZ proteins and/or perform screenings of anti-FtsZ compounds .

The ECM proteins that are engaged by integrins include fibronectin , collagen , and laminin ; multiple integrins exist with varying affinities for each ECM protein ( e.g. , nine different integrin isoforms can bind fibronectin ) 2 .

Oxidation of -actin is necessary for cell spreading in response to integrin engagement with fibronectin and has been shown to occur via the formation of a mixed disulfide bond between Cys374 and glutathione in a reversible process known as S-glutathionylation9 . This modification actually serves a dual purpose in that it protects actin from irreversible oxidation and it provides a signal for downstream events . One of the important consequences of -actin S-glutathionylation is the disassembly of the actomyosin complex ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary step for successful cell adhesion and migration9 ( Fig. 1 ) . <p> Fig. 1 : Impact of integrin receptor interactions with the ECM on actin dynamics . The engagement of the integrin receptor with ECM proteins ( e.g. , fibronectin , collagen , or laminin ) leads to receptor clustering , focal adhesion complex formation and the stimulation of local actin polymerization . In contrast , downstream signaling leads to the production of ROS that promotes -actin Cys374 oxidation , resulting in S-glutathionylation of this residue and the association of -actin with PDI , a step that is essential for cell motility . <p> The reversal of S-glutathionylation can occur in both an enzyme-dependent and independent manner7,10 . The primary enzyme responsible for this process is thought to be glutaredoxin , although thioredoxin , sulfiredoxin , and protein disulfide isomerase ( PDI ) can also perform this function7,11 . PDI has a canonical role in the formation of correct disulfide bonds in nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) 12 ; however , PDI also functions extracellularly in platelet aggregation13,14 and has been shown to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence suggests that PDI has a major role in the regulation of -actin oxidation in response to aIIb3 integrin engagement by fibronectin16 . In this study by Sobierajska et al16 , PDI was shown to form a mixed disulfide bond with -actin Cys374 under conditions of integrin activation ( Fig. 1 ) . Consistent with this role for PDI residing outside of the ER , immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated that PDI and -actin colocalize in membrane protrusions ( i.e. , lamellipodia ) associated with cell spreading . The physiological relevance of the -actin:PDI complex was also demonstrated using antisense RNA to PDI , where the downregulation of PDI expression resulted in impaired cell adhesion and spreading on fibronectin . <p> The finding that PDI has an important role in regulating the oxidation of -actin in response to integrin signaling suggests it may be important in other signal transduction pathways where -actin is S-glutathionylated . Furthermore , it will fascinating to see if further research in this area reveals a broader role for PDI in regulating other S-glutathionylated proteins , and whether PDI-linked proteins will show promise as biomarkers of disease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools to help the researcher study redox regulation of -actin .

@@109314086 @4714086/ <h> July Newsletter : PTMs Regulate Cytoskeletal Proteins in Heart Disease <p> Cardiovascular disease accounts for roughly one in every three deaths in the USA with heart disease accounting for the majority of these cases1 . The pathology of heart disease often involves the death or dysfunction of cardiomyocytes , specialized heart cells that produce the contractile , beating function of the heart . Many different proteins and cell machinery , such as ion channels and pumps , cytoskeletal proteins , and receptors play a significant role in regulating the contractile ability of cardiomyocytes . Interestingly , many of these proteins are regulated through post-translational modifications ( PTMs ) , in part because PTMs allow for rapid , but subtle changes to a protein as part of an overall cellular response2 . For example , SUMOylation of the critical sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2a ( SERCA2a ) pump was diminished in failing human heart samples3 . Interestingly , restoration of SUMOylated SERCA2a was sufficient to repair cardiomyocyte function , implicating SUMOylated SERCA2a as a potential target for therapeutic intervention . Indeed , N106 , a recently developed small molecule that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUMO-activating enzyme E1 ligase , improved ventricular function in mice with heart failure4 . There are many other examples of PTM-modified proteins playing a critical role in cardiomyocyte function and progression of heart failure2 . Here , we will highlight three examples where post-translationally modified cytoskeletal proteins facilitate cardiomyocyte contraction and normal heart function . <p> Microtubules : a-tubulin <p> Fig 1 . Diagram of microtubules ( MTs ) attached to sarcomeres in a cardiomyocyte under resting conditions ( A ) . In response to systolic contraction , MTs buckle to accommodate the changing geometry of the myocyte ( B ) . When MT detyrosination is reduced , attachment to the sarcomere decreases , resulting in a sliding rather than buckling action of the MT ( C ) . <p> Microtubules ( MTs ) play several roles in cardiomyocytes including functioning as compression-resistant elements , performing transport functions , and relaying signaling by converting contractile forces to intracellular signals5 . MTs are formed by the polymerization of a/-tubulin heterodimers . In particular , the c-terminal tail of a -tubulin is heavily modified by PTMs including glutamylation , acetylation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human disease . There is a particular focus on detyrosination of a-tubulin , the cleavage of the C-terminal tyrosine residue on the a-tubulin tail . Detyrosination increased cytoskeletal stiffness and altered cardiomyocte function as this modification affects MT-based mechanotransduction7 . Use of SiR-tubulin technology to perform high-speed , sub-diffraction imaging revealed that detyrosination of a-tubulin was critical for anchoring MTs to sarcomeres in order to regulate MT buckling during contraction8 ( Fig. 1 ) . Furthermore , detyrosination was significantly increased in patients with clinically diagnosed hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies , while acetylation and glycosylation of a-tubulin did not play a significant role in MT buckling8 . It will be interesting to determine which PTMs regulate alternative functions of MTs in heart disease . <p> Intermediate Filament : Desmin <p> Desmin is a muscle-specific intermediate filament protein that forms a scaffold for the contractile machinery in cardiomyocytes , and desmin mutations play a significant role in various heart diseases and are classified as desmin-related myopathies ( DRM ) 5 . Desmin is a highly modified protein , undergoing phosphorylation , ubiquitination , and ADP-ribosylation , among other PTMs9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progression of muscle-related diseases . For example , in myofibrils prepared from dissected muscles of food-deprived mice , desmin is phosphorylated , which marks it for subsequent ubiquitination and degradation , decreasing desmin protein levels10 . It is unknown whether this mechanism occurs in cardiomyocytes under pathologic conditions ; however , other studies identified phosphorylation of desmin as a modification altered in heart disease11 . Because desmin is so highly modified by PTMs , it will be interesting to determine how important PTM crosstalk is for regulating desmin expression , cleavage , and function as it relates to heart disease . <p> Troponin complex : Cardiac Troponin I ( cTnI ) <p> Activity of the trimeric troponin complex is controlled by calcium and in turn the complex regulates tropomyosins position on actin thin filaments and is a key regulator of sarcomere contraction . One component of the troponin complex , cardiac troponin I ( cTnI ) , functions as a critical regulator of sarcomere contraction , and is an important biomarker of heart disease due to its degradation and appearance in the blood12 . Phosphorylation of cTnI at several sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is altered in human heart disease12 . Little is known about other potential PTMs of cTnI ; although , a proteomic study on purified cTnI from human heart showed that cTnI can also be acetylated , oxidized and/or cleaved , in addition to being phosphorylated13 . However , this study may have missed other modifications such as ubiquitination or SUMOylation as the analysis was performed on a single gel band . Whether these lesser known or yet to be identified PTMs of cTnI regulate its function in heart disease remains unknown ; however , these PTMs are deserving of intensive research as cTnI is a critical disease biomarker . <p> Conclusion <p> This newsletter discusses the importance and prevalence of PTMs on cytoskeletal proteins and how they can have significant effects on human health and disease like heart failure . Importantly , the emergence of PTMs as potential therapeutic targets for treatment of heart disease is highlighted . With the development of novel tools to identify new PTM targets , it is much more feasible to discover novel PTM dependent mechanisms regulating cytoskeletal proteins . To assist researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyze post-translationally modified proteins under endogenous , physiologic conditions , which are critical to gain a meaningful picture of their role in disease progression .

@@109314121 @4714121/ 165349 @qwx1025349 <p> Rho GTPase activation is tightly regulated by Rho GEFs . Tyrosine phosphorylation directly activates RhoGEF ( Vav and Dbl ) activity . Both the Vav and Dbl family of GEFs contain a Rho GTPase binding site composed of the Dbl homology ( DH ) and Pleckstrin Homology ( PH ) domains . In an inactive state , they form a closed structure that hinders access of Rho GTPases to the DH-PH binding domain . Upon stimulation ( e.g. , epidermal growth factor EGF ) , sequential phosphorylation on multiple tyrosine residues ( and possibly serine/threonine residues ) causes a structural relaxation of this auto-inhibited state , allowing the binding of Rho GTPases to the catalytic sites and stimulating nucleotide exchange from GDP to GTP on the substrates2-4 . <p> Localization of Rho GTPase to the plasma membrane is required for its activation by membrane associated GEFs and association with effector proteins . RhoGDI plays an important role in regulating cytosol-membrane cycling of the Rho GTPases . RhoGDI forms complexes with Rho GTPases in the cytosol and prevents them from localizing to the plasma membrane where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutively-active Src non-receptor tyrosine kinase , RhoDGI is phosphorylated at Tyr-156 , which causes a dramatic decrease in its ability to complex with the Rho GTPase , resulting in localization of the Rho GTPase to the membrane where it can be activated and exert its function . After deactivation of the Rho GTPase by hydrolysis of GTP , RhoGDI can presumably reassociate with the inactive Rho GTPase and mediate the recycling of the Rho GTPase to the cytosol5 . <p> To maintain homeostasis in GTPase signaling , Rho GAP accelerates the hydrolysis of GTP , thereby converting active Rho GTPases to an inactive GDP-bound state . Tyrosine phosphorylation can have both positive and negative effects on Rho GAP activity . A study by Sordella et al.6 indicates that phosphorylation of p190-B RhoGAP by insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ) at Tyr-306 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) does not directly affect its GAP activity . Instead , it causes a rapid redistribution of p190-B RhoGAP to the plasma membrane ( lipid rafts ) where it can act upon active Rho localized there6 . Another study by Kai et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of b2-chimarein ( a Rac-specific GAP ) at Tyr-21 negatively regulates its GAP activity , possibly by promoting the association with a regulatory protein or by inducing steric inhibition between the Rac binding domain of the Rac GAP and active Rac ( Pro-23 and Pro-24 ) , thereby reducing its ability to deactivate Rac via GTP hydrolysis7 . <p> Several studies also indicate that direct tyrosine phosphorylation of Rho GTPases regulates their intrinsic localization , activation , and binding partners . EGF stimulates the phosphorylation and Vav2-mediated activation of Cdc42 . EGF-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr-64 on Cdc42 is mediated by Src tyrosine kinase and enhances the binding of active Cdc42 to RhoGDI . Interestingly , Cdc42 phosphorylation is not required for Cdc42 activation or interaction with effectors . Binding to RhoGDI facilitates the release of active Cdc42 from the membrane and its movement between different cellular locations where it can associate with different targets/effectors to potentially regulate important cellular transformation events8 . Rac1 is also phosphorylated at Tyr-64 by Src and FAK in vitro . Overexpression of Rac1-Y64D ( a phosphomimetic construct ) suggests that phosphorylation at Tyr-64 on Rac1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its binding to GTP , RhoGDI , GEFs , and its effector protein PAK9 . A study of the atypical Rho family GTPase Wrch-1/RhoU indicates that Src-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr-254 in the C-terminal membrane targeting domain causes the relocalization of Wrch-1 from the plasma membrane to cytosolic internal membranes through altered GTP/GDP binding , thereby reducing its ability to recruit and activate its effector protein PAK10 . <p> Rho GTPases are tightly regulated by Rho GEFs , Rho GAPs , and RhoGDI , allowing them to function as molecular switches for many important cellular events . In addition , post-translational modifications , such as ubiquitination , SUMOylation , phosphorylation , and acetylation of proteins in the Rho GTPase signaling cascade provide an effective fine-tuning mechanism for Rho GTPase function and localization .

This study revealed that the majority of lysine-acetylated proteins localize to the cytoplasm ( 30% ) and nucleus ( 30% ) , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 15% ) , endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus ( 5% ) , and extracellular region ( 5% ) 6 . Here we will highlight examples of lysine acetylation regulating cellular processes . <p> Lysine acetylation plays a crucial role in the regulation of cytoskeleton-associated proteins ( e.g. , actin , tubulin , small GTPases ) . Stress fibers , composed of beta- and gamma-actin , are important for cell shape and movement . In muscle cells , alpha-actin constitutes the microfilaments and together with myosin assures the traction forces required for muscle contraction and also for cytoplasmic streaming in non-muscle cells . All three actin isoforms can be acetylated5,7 . Also , several regulatory proteins of the actin cytoskeleton are modified by acetylation . For example , several subunits of the Arp2/3 complex , important for actin nucleation , are acetylated7 . Other studies have identified nine different lysine residues in cortactin which can be acetylated by HAT P300 or PCAF . Acetylation of those residues inhibits cortactins translocation to the cell periphery and reduces its binding capacity to actin , leading to diminished actin dynamics and altered cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor-stimulated Rac1 activation , leads to cortactins translocation from the cytosol to the cell periphery , where it interacts with and enhances the formation of F-actin10,11 . Rac1 and other Rho family GTPases have a crucial role in regulating actin dynamics that underlie formation of lamellipodia , filopodia , and actin stress fibers . The activation of these G-proteins is tightly regulated by a variety of proteins , including GDIs ( GDP dissociation inhibitors ) . Acetylation of RhoGDI alpha prevents its inhibitory effect on Rho family members , leading to enhanced stress fiber and filopodia formation5 . RhoA proteins are also inhibited by p120 catenin , a protein found in complexes with cadherin adhesion molecules . The p120 catenin is acetylated on at least three lysines which alters its subcellular localization and is important for its inhibition of RhoA5,12 . Like actin and Rho GTPases , the cytoskeletal protein tubulin is also acetylated , with the Lys40 residue on alpha-tubulin identified as the acetylation site3 . Studies have shown that tubulin acetylation contributes to microtubule stabilization and allows for more efficient bundling of acetylation-stabilized microtubules13,14 . Microtubules are important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensions like axons and dendrites . Both kinesin and dynein-dependent microtubular transport are enhanced by tubulin acetylation15 . <p> Fig. 1 : Human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells , untreated ( left ) or TSA-treated ( right ; 5 M for 12 h ) , were stained with a pan-acetyl-lysine antibody . Acetylated proteins in cytoplasm and nucleus were visualized by green fluorescence . Note that in contrast with the untreated control , the cytoplasmic acetylated microtubule network is clearly visible in a TSA-treated cell . The nuclear fluorescent intensities indicate the abundance of acetylated proteins in nuclei . <p> Besides these structural proteins , signaling proteins unrelated to histone modification and transcriptional regulation also have lysine acetylation sites . These proteins include Mdm2 , Ku70 , Stat3 , Smad7 , and Hsp90 . Mdm2 is a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein . Acetylation of Mdm2 impairs its ability to promote p53 ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation16 . Interestingly , p53 itself can also be acetylated , leading to the destabilization of p53-Mdm2 interactions , which enables the p53-mediated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Ku70/Bax complex , freeing Bax to localize to the mitochondria to execute its apoptotic function18 . <p> In addition to influencing protein function , lysine acetylation also regulates the cellular localization of proteins , especially for nuclear import and export . Interestingly , for some proteins , acetylation favors localization to the cytoplasm19,20 , whereas for others , acetylation will enhance the retention of proteins in the nucleus21,22 . The mechanism by which acetylation regulates cellular localization can be either the alteration of an interaction with a binding partner leading to localization in a particular compartment ( e.g. , p53-Mdm2 interaction ) , or a modified interaction with nuclear import/export factors . For example , acetylation of Lys239 within the carboxyl-terminal nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) in adenovirus-transforming protein ( E1A ) disrupts its interaction with importin-alpha , thereby enhancing its localization in the cytoplasmic compartment23 . Conversely , acetylation of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 ( HNF-4 ) at the NLS is important for its retention in the nucleus , thus preventing its export to the cytoplasm via the CRM-1 pathway24 . <p> ConclusionLysine acetylation is well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other DNA-dependent nuclear processes . Proteomics studies have identified many possible substrates of lysine acetylation and a large fraction of them resides in the cytoplasmic compartment , implicating their involvement in regulating important cellular pathways . However , the functions of many of them are still not clear . At Cytoskeleton , we have developed a mouse monoclonal pan-acetyl-lysine antibody to help researchers study lysine acetylation modification of their target proteins ( Fig. 1 ) . Applications of the antibody , including Western blotting , immunoprecipitation , immunofluorescence labeling , and ChIP , have been validated .

Podosomes are actin-rich structures surrounded by adhesion and scaffolding proteins that are involved in cell motility and invasion . Podosomes mediate the adhesion of motile cells to the extracellular matrix and are important for the attachment to , and degradation of , the matrix by motile cells . To better understand podosome formation and maintenance , the contribution of Arf1 and its guanine exchange factors ( GEFs ) , as well as the signaling pathways downstream of Arf1 activation , were evaluated in macrophage-like THP1 cells and fibroblasts . Inhibition of Arf1 or the Arf GEF ARNO with small interfering RNAs ( Arf1 and ARNO ) , pharmacological inhibitors ( Brefeldin A BFA and SecinH3 for Arf1 ) , or expression of dominant-negative mutants ( Arf1 and ARNO ) significantly impaired podosome formation and maintenance .
