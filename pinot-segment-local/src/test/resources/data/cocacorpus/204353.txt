@@23353124 @3353124/ <h> Restoration Druid Stat Weights and Gearing <p> This page covers the stats that are relevant for a Restoration Druid and what kind of things you should look for when gearing up . As a general rule , its almost always better to go with the higher item level piece of gear . Resto Druids make pretty good use of all stats , but some are still better than others . Feedback is always welcome . You can leave a comment at the bottom of the page , or tweet @PrestonDvorak . <h> Stat Priority and Normalized Weights <p> This is a quick glance at the stats you want . You 'll find normalized stat weights in parenthesis next to each stat . You can use these weights with AskMrRobot and Pawn with decent results . Note : the weights do n't always work well with trinkets , so default to your best judgement using the information in the " Picking Trinkets " section below the Best in Slot lists . Restoration Druid stat weights also have a tendency to change based on how much of each stat you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the tools in the " Additional Resources " section below the weight lists . <h> Large-group Healing <p> Consider these stat priorities and weights for healing 10-player or larger groups and raids . Large-group scenarios favor haste and crit because you 're less likely to have multiple healing over time effects on one target to take advantage of our mastery . <h> Small-group Healing <p> Consider these stat priorities and weights for healing 9-player or smaller groups , particularly Mythic+ dungeons . Small-group scenarios favor mastery and crit because you 're more likely to have multiple healing over time effects on one target and are also more directly involved in tank healing . This allows us to take better advantage of our mastery . <h> Additional Resources <p> It can become increasingly complicated to calculate and impossible to provide one-size-fits-all stat weights because Restoration Druid stat weights change as you gain or lose points in each stat , and can even change between encounters if you want to be really technical . While the weights above will get you by in general , if you really want to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or all of the tools below to get weights that are customized to your current gear situation or the encounter you 're facing . <p> Leaf 's Resto Druid Stat Weights - This is for the WeakAuras addon and calculates your stat weights in real time based on combat data and the healing you 're doing . <p> Twig It by Torty - A much more robust spreadsheet that allows you to get stat weights based on your current stats and healing breakdown for different fights based on damage meter or log data . <h> Stat Explanations <p> Intellect increases the power of all your spells . This includes how much healing your spells heal for and how much damage your damaging spells do . <p> Haste decreases the cast time of your spells and decreases your global cooldown . Your global cooldown affects how quickly you can cast spells that have no cast time , such as Rejuvenation . Getting a low global cooldown is essential as a druid because most of our main healing spells do not have cast times . <p> Critical Strike increases the chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A critical heal will heal for twice as much as a non-critical heal . This more or less equates to free healing , which means you will spend less mana healing players overtime the more critical strike you have . <p> Mastery increases the healing your heal over time effects heal for based on the total heal over time effects you have on the target . For example , if your mastery is 10% and you have one heal over time on a player , that heal over time effect will be healing for 10% more . If you have two heal over time effects on a player they will both be healing for 20% more . As of patch 7.1 , there is no longer a cap on the number of heal over time effects that can contribute to this bonus . So , using our example , if you have five heal over time effects on a player , they will all be healing for 50% more . <p> Versatility increases all healing and damage you do by a flat percentage . It also decreases all damage you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because our Mastery has the potential to gain three times the effect with multiple heal over time spells . 21074 @qwx221074 <h> Best in Slot Gear <p> With the expansion of the warforged/titanforged system and the removal of primary stats from necks and rings , definitive Best in Slot lists are harder to create . Despite where an item may appear on the list , you should almost always use the the piece with the higher item level . The exception to this is rings , necks , tier sets , and trinkets , where using a lower item level piece with better stats or effects is sometimes better . The lists below assume all items are at their base item level unelss otherwise noted . <p> For the sake of keeping the lists organized , it is assumed the raid gear being obtained is of Mythic-quality . At Heroic-quality and lower , there is much more overlap in items and the lists become almost impossible to rank . <h> Large-group Healing <p> This list of gear was built with the Large-group Healing stats above and is best suited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus of this gear is to maintain 20% haste and crit , and 10-15% mastery and versatility . Haste and crit are the focus because it 's important to be able to get heal over time effects out quickly , and crit will make them heal for more even if you only have one on each player . However , while simulating gear , I found that the sweet spot for haste was about 20% , at which point crit , and to a lesser extend mastery and vers , become better . Maintaining the Tomb of Sargeras 4-set will be important because the bonuses synergize well together and give us powerful effects for both single-target and group-healing . <h> Breakdown by Boss <p> The goal of this section is to make it easier to decide which bosses to use Bonus Roll Tokens on and which Mythic instances you should run . The numbers include all gear drops from the Best in Slot list as well as the top two trinkets from the Picking Trinkets section below . <p> *Use this macro to see what item level cloak you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> /script local LONG ... true do i=i-9.44-l*0.474 ; if i&gt;0 then l=l+1 ; else print ( " iLevel to be better : " , l+d ) ; break ; end end <h> Frost Relic <h> Small-group Healing <p> This list of gear was built with the Small-group Healing stats above and is best suited for healing groups of 9-players or less , particularly Mythic+'s.7.2.5 Notes : The focus of this gear is to maximize mastery and crit while maintaining the Tomb of Sargeras set bonuses , which synergize well together and fit the healing style of Mythic+ 's in general . Mastery and crit are the focus because they 're " win more " stats together . Having 3+ heal over time effects on all players is common , which buffs them through our mastery and causes them to crit for even more . <h> Breakdown by Boss <p> The goal of this section is to make it easier to decide which bosses to use Bonus Roll Tokens on and which Mythic instances you should run .

The exception to this is large item level differences , but even then many trinkets with static stats still appear very high on the list . To help make selecting trinkets easier , I 've included warforged/titanforged versions of some powerful trinkets that only occur at lower base item levels . This also shows just how powerful static stats are for Restoration Druids .

All simulations were conducted on AskMrRobot using my own healing rotation , the Raid Healing Krosus boss script , and Best in Slot gear from the lists above minus legendary items .

I personally feel static intellect will start to gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other gear . <h> Mana Regeneration <p> Mana regeneration trinkets should only be used if you 're running out of mana and ca n't solve the issue by healing more efficiently .

I 'm currently waiting on a Mythic+ script to be added to the new simulation , or to figure out another way to accurately simulate small groups . <p> **While Velen 's is the best trinket when compared to other trinkets , using Aman'thul 's Wisdom and Tearstone of Elune are generally better in small groups . <h> Mana Regeneration <p> Using mana regeneration trinkets in Mythic+ runs is n't advisable , there 's ample time to stop and drink to regain mana and you generally want as much throughput as possible .

Until more live logs are available , my guess is the new legendary items will be middle of the road and situational , depending on the fight or the play style you enjoy . Even with the decrease in effectiveness , I expect Aman'Thul 's Wisdom to remain at the top , or at least high on the list . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue doing so going forward . <h> Small-group Healing <p> This legendary item list was simulated and ranked using the Small-group Healing best in slot list above.7.2.5 Notes : The rankings below are from 7.2 . I 'm currently waiting on a Mythic+ script to be added to the new simulation , or to figure out another way to accurately simulate small groups . <h> Legendary Item Overview <p> Below you 'll find information on all of the legendary items that are available to Restoration Druids in Legion . Any legendary item will be good simply because of its high item level . However , some effects will be more useful in certain situations . <p> On a new character , you will be able to equip one legendary item at a time . The final Order Hall Advancement talent will allow you to equip an additional legendary item . Blizzard has stated they may raise the cap as the expansion goes on , but no specific date has been set . Blizzard has also said legendary items can drop from anywhere in the game ( Legion content ) . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosses , raid bosses , world bosses , emissary caches , PvP strongboxes , mythic+ weekly caches , and Blingtron 6000 boxes . There is currently no way to target a specific legendary drop , the drops are simply based on your selected Loot Specialization . <p> New in 7.1.5 , Velen 's Future Sight is a very powerful all-around trinket . Just the stats alone make it great , but the on-use effect is where it shines for Restoration Druids . A problem we often face is when we start putting Rejuvenations or other heal over time effects on the group , some players inevitably reach full health faster than others . We 're then left with the choice of spending more mana to top them off , letting them stay with missing health , or waiting for another healer to top them off ( spending their mana ) . This trinket , when used at the right time , will let us redirect some of the otherwise wasted overhealing to the players that are still missing health . I see this as a great effect to use towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topping off players . <p> Aman'Thul 's Wisdom is great for large-group healing , especially on encounters where you find yourself pre-casting Rejuvenations on players in preparation for high group-wide damage . The shoulders allow you to have even more Rejuvenations active before the damage starts , giving you even more things to buff with Incarnation : Tree of Life or Essence of G'hanir , as detailed on the healing tips page . <p> Tearstone of Elune is great for large-group healing . You 'll be using Wild Growth quite often , and the additional Rejuvenations from this ring will be extra , free healing , which is important in Legion with mana management being so important . You do run the risk of the bonus Rejuvenations being over-healing , but considering you 'll use Wild Growth during periods of high or sustained damage , this is less likely . <p> Prydaz , Xavaric 's Magnum Opus is another item that does n't provide a large healing boost through its effect , but the utility aspect can make a difference on some encounters , and the three secondary stats are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be able to trigger the shield when you need it , and you ca n't prevent damage from removing it , so in many cases you 're at the mercy of the fight . Even with that in mind , any damage not taken is mana saved for yourself and other healers . <p> Ekowraith , Creator or Worlds , is great for all-around utility and a healing boost , and it works well with our Tier 3 talent choices . As a Restoration Druid , the chest will make our Ysera 's Gift heal for 5% ( instead of 3% ) . Then , with our Tier 3 talents have a choice of gaining 9-yards of spell and ability range ( instead of 5-yards ) , 26% more movement speed ( instead of 15% ) , or 10% reduced damage taken ( instead of 6% ) . It 's not the biggest healing boost on the list , but the utility options it buffs ca n't be overlooked . The chest allows you to tailor yourself to specific encounters , with the extra spell range and movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aglaya are great for single-target healing as well as a small bit of extra sustained healing in some situations . Extending 3+ heal over time effects on a tank is very useful , and usually allows you to move on to healing other players without worrying about the tank dying . Even using Swiftmend on a non-tank to extend 1-2 heal over time effects can allow you to move on to other players taking damage sooner . While the bracers are n't as powerful in that situation , it does make the bracers somewhat flexible as they see a positive benefit when extending any number of heal over time effects . <p> Soul of the Archdruid can be nice on fights that make consistent use of the increased healing ( likely with Wild Growth ) , or if you just enjoy the Soul of the Forest play style . Overall it 's a viable option , but not something I think will replace the current top options outside of niche cases . Time will tell how it plays out ! <p> Chameleon Song is another legendary that can see niche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly on cooldown . If you 're only using Wild Growth sparingly , Tree of Life will not proc nearly enough or nearly consistently enough to be worthwhile over other options . It 's worth noting the Tree of Life buff from this item works exactly like the talent , causing Wild Growth to affect more targets , Regrowth to be instant-cast , etc . <p> The Dark Titan 's Advice is also nice for single-target healing , and is flexible in the sense that there 's no limits on who you can use Lifebloom on . However , the drawback is the " bloom " may not happen when you need it most . Even considering you can force the bloom to happen by refreshing Lifebloom when it has &lt;30% of its duration left , it 's still relatively unflexible when compared to other single-target options . <p> X'oni 's Caress is nice for single-target and emergency healing because it turns Ironbark into a powerful , on-demand heal alongside its existing damage mitigation . You almost always have Rejuvenations active , so you can count on your Ironbark target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removes Ironbark 's " weakness " of simply being a damage mitigation ability , which should be very noticeable in smaller groups and especially Mythic+ 's . <p> Sephuz 's Secret is a nice all-around legendary , and thanks to the changes in patch 7.1.5 , it can now be reliably proc 'd by healers on more encounters . The drawback is it can be hard to coordinate the haste buff with periods of high damage as you 're at the mercy of needing to have something to dispel or crowd control . In most encounters , you ca n't wait to dispel something so you could easily gain the haste buff and not have anything to do with it . However , if you can gain the haste buff at an optimal time , it 's incredibly powerful with lots of existing heal over time effects on players . <p> Essence of Infusion are incredibly powerful for group-healing , specifically when you know you 'll be using Tranquility during periods of high damage . They become less powerful if you 're not using Tranquility , using it less often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where most players are n't dropping below 50% health . The boots also have the hidden effect of : casting Healing Touch reduces the remaining cooldown of Swiftmend by 3 seconds . This is an unusual hidden effect because it contradicts the group-healing focus of the boot 's main effect , and I ca n't say using the boots for the hidden effect is worth it over the other single-target options that are offered . In most cases , casting something other than Healing Touch is more beneficial . In raids , you 'll likely want to cast Rejuvenation instead , and in smaller groups or Mythic+ , casting Wrath for more DPS is often more beneficial . 21071 @qwx221071 21067 @qwx221067 21070 @qwx221070 21076 @qwx221076

@@23353128 @3353128/ <h> Patch 7.2 Restoration Druid Changes , Updates , and Overview <p> With Patch 7.2 coming on March 28 , 2017 , I thought it would be fun to compile a list of changes that are affecting Restoration Druids . This is my first time writing an article like this , and feedback is greatly appreciated - even if it 's just to say whether or not you want to see articles like this for every patch . As usual , you can tweet @PrestonDvorak or leave a comment at the bottom of the page . <p> There are quest and content spoilers ahead , proceed with caution if you want to avoid them ! <h> Official 7.2 Patch Trailer <p> Patch 7.2 : Tomb of Sargeras releases on March 28 , 2017 . <h> Legendary Item Changes <p> Many legendary items are receiving updates to increase their throughput or make their effects more consistent . Below are my initial thoughts about the items changing for Restoration Druids . ( official source ) <p> Sephuz 's is being changed to have static 10% movement speed and 2% haste . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applying loss of control effects , dispelling , or interrupting . This change makes it more useful on a lot of boss fights where triggering the proc effect was impossible or hard to use in an ideal way . I 'm a sucker for movement speed increases , too , so you can bet I 'll be messing around with this ring and Feral Affinity . <p> Ekowraith now has haste as a third secondary stat . This took an already decent legendary and made it a bit better . It 's still not a huge throughput boost compared to other legendary items , but the utility aspect has always made it something I 've been interested in testing . <p> Titan 's Advice now has a 5% chance to proc Lifebloom 's " bloom " healing every time it heals , which of course still heals for 200% more . You probably see the theme here , this takes a decent single-target healing legendary and makes it a bit better . It gives an opportunity for the 200% increased bloom healing to come into play more often . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20% , in addition to its previous effect . This gives the opportunity to use the effect more often , and coupled with our Stonebark talent reduces Ironbark 's cooldown to a mere 48-seconds . <p> Essence of Infusion now causes Tranquility to heal players for 60% more when they 're below 60% health . This helps the legendary apply to more situations , but I still feel it 'll remain best on fights where the extra Tranquility healing is really needed to keep people alive . <p> Aman'Thul 's received a full redesign and now causes your Rejuvenation ( and Germination ) to have their duration increased by 3-seconds ( up to a maximum of 15-seconds ) each time they heal a full health target . This brings it more inline with how Druid healing works by no longer requiring you cast heals on full health targets to use the effect . <p> The Tearstone is the only legendary that received a nerf . Wild Growth now has a 15% chance to proc Rejuvenation , down from 20% . This drops the ring performance down to be closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it knocking the ring out of the best in slot spot . <h> Other Item Changes <p> The Drape of Shame from Karazhan is being decreased from 10% increased critical healing to 5% . This was unexpected given Blizzard 's stance on trinkets like the Unstable Arcanocrystal , where they recognized it was too powerful for it 's item level but opted to let it drop out of use naturally . Given that the Drape of Shame 's effect was worth as much as 50 item levels ( exact worth varied based on other gear ) , it 's likely a lot of healers would have stopped using it in Tomb of Sargeras anyway . However , with Karazhan now being available on Mythic+ keystones , it will be possible to get a high item level version of the Drape . So , if you 're lucky enough it 's still an attractive option at the right item level ! ( official source ) <p> You can use this macro ( originally from the Druid Discord ) to see what item level a new cloak would need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've modified it for the new 5% effect . As an example : If it prints " Effect : 26 Total : 891 " in your chat , you would need a cloak with at least an 891 item level before it would be better than your currently equipped Drape of Shame . <p> /script local LONG ... true do i=i-9.44-l*0.474 ; if i&gt;0 then l=l+1 ; else print ( " Effect : " , l , " Total : " , l+d ) ; break ; end end <h> Artifact Trait Changes and Updates <p> The previous " infinite " artifact trait that increased healing by incremental percentage amounts is being changed to only have one rank that increases healing by 5% . To give us something new to work towards , there 's a new set of traits to unlock after completing the The Broken Shore : Investigating the Legion quest line on the Broken Shore . Completing these quests empowers your artifact weapon and unlocks a new , smaller trait tree , as well as gives the option of increasing previous 3-point traits to 4-points . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refresh automatically when they heal a target below 35% health . This trait seems situational , but one of druid 's weaknesses is handling critical damage when we do n't have cooldowns available . The best example of this is in Mythic+ when we need to spam healing on the tank and ca n't necessarily refresh our heals on other targets - this trait could be the refresh we need . Overall , I see the biggest benefit being tank healing , they 're the most likely to drop below 35% health in most cases . <p> This is the new infinite trait , and instead of being a flat healing increase like the previous infinite trait , it 's now a proc that increases your intellect for an amount based on how many points you have in the trait . Resto Druids are lucky because we do okay with proc effects . We generally always have healing effects out , so the proc will never completely go to waste . <p> I 'll do a more detailed analysis once 7.2 is out , as well as update my artifact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the traits . 21074 @qwx221074 <h> Solo Challenge Dungeon , New Artifact Appearance <p> Completing the solo dungeon challenge for Restoration Druids will unlock a new artifact appearance and set of tints . Unlocking the solo dungeon will take a bit of work . You must be level 110 , have all 35 traits purchased in your artifact weapon , complete the quests to empower your artifact and unlock the new 7.2 traits , and finally you must construct the Mage Tower on the Broken Shore . Once you meet all of these criteria , a new quest will be available at the Mage Tower that continues your class campaign and culminates in you taking part in the solo challenge dungeon .

Druids are getting a special Lunarwing flight form , with different colors per-race , that can be ridden by other players , much like the current ground travel form . <p> Also unique to Druids is the flight form will count as a mount in your journal and towards mount collection achievements , while still retaining the benefits of being a " form " ( instant-cast , immune to polymorphs ) . Unfortunately , it will not benefit from the flight speed increase from the Pathfinder achievement .

Turning it off returns you to the normal flight form . <h> Spell Effects <p> Blizzard has started updating visual and sound effects for spells in 7.2 . A handful of Restoration Druid spells received updates : Moonfire , Sunfire , Lunar Strike ( requires Balance Affinity ) , and Efflorescence . I put together a short video previewing all of the new effects . <h> New Playable Content <p> In addition to content specific to Restoration Druids , there is a ton of new playable content being added to the game . I wo n't have detailed explanations here , but I wanted to at least mention everything . <h> Tomb of Sargeras <p> The Tomb of Sargeras is a nine boss raid instance coming sometime after the release of 7.2 . Over the next several weeks I 'll be adding boss guides to the site , so be sure to check back ! <h> The Cathedral of Eternal Night <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the release of 7.2 . It includes Heroic , Mythic , and Mythic+ versions and finishes the story you started on the Broken Shore , culminating in a fight against Mephistroth . <h> Paragon Reputation <p> Paragon Reputation is an extension of the existing reputation system . For every 10,000 reputation you earn with Legion factions after exalted , you 're given a satchel . These satchels can include mounts and toys unique to each faction . <p> You continue to earn paragon reputation the same way you did on your way to exalted , including with story quests and world quests. 21071 @qwx221071 21067 @qwx221067 21070 @qwx221070 21076 @qwx221076 
@@23353129 @3353129/ <h> Restoration Druid Artifact Traits and Relics <p> This page gives a brief overview of the Restoration Druid artifact weapon , G'hanir , the Mother Tree , with a focus on what trait paths you should take when starting out . While you 'll eventually have all of the traits unlocked , there are a few different paths you can take to get there . <p> You unlock traits by gaining Artifact Power , which is obtained from doing nearly anything in game , including : world quests , dungeons , raids , and PVP . Once you have enough Artifact Power for a new trait , you must go back to the Dreamgrove ( Druid Order Hall ) to select your new trait at the Seed of Ages , located to the west of the Circle of Spirits . <p> Feedback is appreciated , you can leave comments at the bottom of the page , or tweet @PrestonDvorak . <h> Recommended Artifact Paths , before Empowerment <p> Below , you 'll find recommended paths to take with your first 35 artifact traits . <p> Mana Efficiency ( Green ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend starting with the mana efficiency ( green ) path . Mana will be much tighter in Legion and this path focuses heavily on reducing the mana cost of spells , increasing the duration of your spells , and even giving you completely free bonus spells from the Power of the Archdruid trait at the end . <p> With the mana efficiency path done , I recommend going through the throughput ( blue ) path next . This provides the highest raw healing increase . The Dreamwalker trait at the end even provides additional mana efficiency along with more throughput . <p> Finally , you can go through the utility ( yellow ) path , or just fill in traits as you see fit . I recommend getting to the Tranquil Mind trait as quickly as possible . Its easily the best utility trait on the artifact , eliminating one of the huge drawbacks Tranquility has . 21074 @qwx221074 <h> Recommended Artifact Paths , after Empowerment <p> After unlocking all 35 initial traits , you 'll be able to empower your weapon with a short quest line , starting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your weapon unlocks a new , small trait tree and allows you to increase all of your 3-point traits to 4-points .

The order is based on simulation data as well as my own feelings on how effective each of the traits are in normal healing situations . <h> Artifact Relics <p> Artifact Relics are primarily used to raise the item level of your artifact weapon . They also provide a bonus rank to any number of artifact traits . You can put relics into your weapon just by Shift+Right-clicking the weapon . Note : if you overwrite a relic with a new one , the old relic is destroyed . <p> In most cases , you 'll want to use the relic that grants your weapon the highest item level increase .

The information in this guide is preliminary and based on the PTR Dungeon Journal , but will be updated as needed when the dungeon goes live. - If you have any suggestions or feedback , you can leave a comment below or tweet- @VirendraDG . <p> You can also watch a video version of the guide by clicking the banner below . <h> Opera Hall <p> You will face one of these encounters at random every week . <h> Wikket <p> There are two targets in this fight that share damage : - Elfyra- and- Galindre . The two bosses are light on mechanics but good execution and spatial awareness is still essential . <h> Mechanics <p> Elfyra and Galindre are active at the same time and share a health pool . <p> Elfyra- will use Summon Assistants- - to bring in adds . Kill these and do n't let them get out of control . <p> Elfyra- will launch Defy Gravity- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind until it is needed. - Getting into the vortex will consume it ; if too many are consumed before Magic Magnificent- there will not be enough for the whole party to avoid the attack . <p> Galindre- uses Magic Magnificent , - filling the ground and dealing a huge amount of damage . Jump into a vortex from Defy Gravity- to be launched up and avoid the damage . The vortex itself causes a small amount of damage , so keep that in mind . <p> Melee should be somewhat cautious when Wondrous Radiance- is cast on the tank , as it deals damage to anyone within 4 yards . <h> Stage Three - Somewhere <h> DBM Settings <p> Coming Soon <h> Beautiful Beast <p> There are four castle servants to defeat , and after each one is killed , the remaining servants are fully healed and gain a stacking 25% damage increase for the rest of the fight . This means that you should focus each target one at a time , and multi-DOTting is pointless . <h> Luminore <p> Uses Burning Blaze , tossing a candle at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Move away from this . <h> Coggleston <p> Coggleston- is immune to all damage until the other three servants are defeated . <p> He will periodically increase the haste of all the servants for 12 seconds . <p> Summons- Silver Fork- adds <p> Flashing Forks- find a target and spin in place at that location . Dodge the whirlwind . <p> When not using- Flashing Forks , - Forks- will deal damage and apply DOTs . <p> Luminore , Mrs. Cauldrons , and Babblet must be defeated before Coggleston can be attacked . <h> DBM Settings <p> Coming Soon <h> Maiden of Virtue <p> This fight involves a lot of stacking damage . As DPS , it is up to you to help the tank on interrupts , pay attention to your own positioning , and burst at appropriate times . <h> Mechanics <p> Holy Bolt will target a player and then bounce to another player within 6 yards , increasing damage with each jump . The party should stay spread out at all times , as this ability will one-shot someone with too many jumps . <p> Sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a player 's feet and slowly expand , dealing damage with a stacking effect every 3 seconds . When targeted with Sacred Ground , run as far away as possible . Drop the patches as close together as possible , but taking more than one stack at a time will add up . After it drops , move away from the area unless you are using it to break Mass Repentance . <p> Maiden will cast Mass Repentance , stunning the entire group for 30 seconds or until they take damage . Get a stack of Sacred Ground- during her cast to break the stun as quickly as possible , but do n't linger . <p> While shielded , she will cast Holy Wrath- repeatedly. - Burn through the shield quickly and get to interrupting before the stacking damage causes a wipe . With all three dps alive and focusing , you have plenty of time to break the shield and interrupt . <p> Maiden will use Holy Shock- on the tank , but DPS needs to help with interrupts , as that damage stacks as well . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attumen and Midnight together and fighting them separately . Attumen and Midnight start out the fight together until Midnight reaches 50% , at which point they will separate while Midnight recovers her health . <h> Horse and Rider as One <p> Damage Midnight until she reaches 50% . Attumen is untargetable in this phase . <p> Mighty Stomp- will deal damage and interrupt any spellcasts in a 30 yard range . The damage is low , but the 4-second interrupt will cause problems . Stop casting when Midnight uses this ability . <p> Spectral Charge- will summon a line of ghost horses that charge across the battlefield straight in front of them . The fight is in a cramped room , but try to avoid the horses . One tick will not kill you ( at full health ) , but multiple ticks could . <p> Intangible Presence- can typically be handled by the healer , though sometimes DPS will need to assist in finding the correct player to dispel . Every party member will get a DOT , but only one will have an actual specter shadowing their moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dispelling any other player causes heavy damage to the group . <h> Fighting on Foot <p> When Midnight is at 50% , Attumen fights on foot and is finally targetable . <p> Midnight will charge around using Mezair , dealing damage in front of her . Move out of her frontal cone . <p> Do n't stand in front of Attumen . Mortal Strike- will hit any player 12 yards in front of him . <p> When Attumen casts Shared Suffering , move to stand- in Attumen 's arc . The whole party needs to do this . His strike range is indicated by a dark purple arc . <p> When Midnight recovers her health , the two will recombine and you will have to get Midnight back to 50% . <p> When Attumen reaches 0% , Midnight enrages . Defeat her to end the fight . <p> Separately , Midnight and Attumen have low health . Midnight will go down quickly enough that you should save your strong DPS cooldowns and Heroism/Time Warp/Blood Lust for the first separation . The most difficult part of this fight is Intangible Presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dispelling the wrong player could easily wipe the group . <h> DBM Settings <h> Moroes <p> Moroes comes with 4 adds randomly generated from a group of 6 . Your group can grab two Ghost Traps from the Grand Ballroom and two from the Banquet Hall . Only two adds can be trapped at a time . You should prioritize the two active adds before focusing Moroes . At 60% , Moroes 's Ghastly Purge- will make the remaining adds immune to CC . If the fight goes on too long , stacking damage from Garrote- will wipe the party . <h> Lady Catriona Von'Indi <h> Baron Rafe Dreuger <h> Lady Keira Berrybuck <p> Berrybuck will give Moroes a significant damage buff , making it difficult to keep the tank up . Prioritze killing Berrybuck . <p> Focus this add first if you have her . <h> Lord Robin Daris <p> Whirling Edge- will target a random player and spin at their location . Move away from the blade . <p> The room for the boss fight is huge , so these spinning blades do n't cause a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage to targets in a line in front of the caster . <p> Before the pull , decide which two adds will be trapped . Using a Ghost Trap- will start the fight . Drop cooldowns to burn the two active adds , then DPS Moroes until 60% . Your next priority depends on the composition of the adds . Pick one to kill and leave the other alive to focus on Moroes . For example , Lord Robin Daris is trapped until 60% , and then left to free roam because his ability is entirely avoidable . At this point in the fight Garrote- damage will be building up , so finish it quickly . <h> DBM Settings <p> Coming Soon <h> The Curator <p> The Curator will attack the party with spellcasts until it reaches 10% mana . At that point , all attacks cease and it will rapidly regenerate mana . Save your strong DPS cooldowns for this phase , as The Curator becomes more vulnerable to attacks . <h> Active <p> The Curator will summon Volatile Energy - balls of lightning that need to be DPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arc Lightning- will target a random player and deal arcane damage . Damage increases every time the Volatile Energy casts Arc Lightning . <p> The Volatile Energy will randomly pick a target for Static Charge- and deal arcane damage to all enemies within 8 yds. - Static Charge- has the same animation as Power Discharge , so the two can be confusing . <p> The Curator will periodically use Power Discharge- on the group , which deals damage and makes a pool at the impact location . The pools persist throughout the fight and serve as a soft enrage . Be mindful of where you allow the pools to fall since it is so easy to run out of room here . <p> Make generous use of your personal cooldowns in this phase . Power Discharge- pools deal a lot of damage and are n't the easiest to avoid . <h> Regenerating Mana <p> At 10% mana , The Curator will start channeling Evocation- to regain mana . It takes 100% increased damage during Evocation , so save your cooldowns for this phase . <p> When Evocation- is finished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger after every cast . <p> Drop your strong DPS cooldowns in this phase . <p> In the active phase , focus the Volatile Energy before they get overwhelming . Start the fight on one end of the room and work your way to the other . The party should stick as close together as possible so that Power Discharge- pools do n't eat up all your space . He casts Power Discharge- one more time before using Evocation , and melee could accidentally cut themselves off from Curator if they do n't pay attention . <h> DBM Settings <p> A timer for Power Discharge- will help you position yourself when the cast comes . <h> Shade of Medivh <p> The Shade of Medivh rotates between several spells that can all be deadly in their own way . Coordinated interrupts by the entire group is the key to success.He will constantly cast , and there will be no way to interrupt every spell . <h> Medivh 's Spells <p> Medivh channels Piercing Missiles- on the tank for 5 seconds . If channeled for the full duration , the tank will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 20 seconds . Interrupt this spell to keep the tank from taking significant damage . <p> Inferno Bolt- will target a random player . It deals damage to the target and every player within 8 yards . This spell can be handled without interrupts , but be sure not to be near other players when you 're targeted . <p> Frostbite- will deal heavy damage and freeze a player indefinitely . If there are enough interrupts , interrupt Frostbite . If one gets through , the frozen player can be thawed with Inferno Bolt , just run to the frozen player when targeted . <h> Focused Power <p> At full mana , the Shade of Medivh will use one of his more powerful spells . These spell effects last for 20 seconds , and you will have to deal with his normal abilities on top of them . <p> Ceaseless Winter- will fill the room with ice for 20 seconds . The ice will afflict players with a stacking DOT and movement speed debuff . Moving around cancels one stack . Remember to move every few seconds to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players with fire for 20 seconds . If the fire ring is crossed , it explodes for 2500000 Fire damage to all players . This will wipe you . Do not move when Flame Wreath- is cast . <h> Mana Devourer <p> The main mechanic of this fight is to keep the Mana Devourer from reaching full mana . At full mana , it will instantly one-shot the group . When the Devourer discharges its mana , all players will need to pick up the Loose Mana and drop it off in Energy Void . <h> Abilities <p> Coalesce Power- reduces damage taken by 75% and causes the Devourer to drop all of its mana . <p> Loose Mana will be floating around . Picking up the mana will grant a stack of the Unstable Mana- debuff . For every Loose Mana that makes contact with the Mana Devourer , he will gain 5% mana . <p> Unstable Mana- will give you a damage buff , but also a DOT. - The DOT deals heavy damage and will probably kill you before you can get any benefit from the damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the Loose Mana in an Energy Void. - One tick in the zone drops one stack . Be mindful of the damage you take during this phase and remember defensive cooldowns . <p> Arcane Bomb- will cause an area to explode and inflict massive damage . Move away from any bomb locations . <p> Drop your strong DPS cooldowns on pull . During the Loose Mana phase , gather and remove what you can , but more than 2 stacks at a time will make it difficult for the healer to keep up . You will not be able to get rid of all the mana on the field . The fight is not about keeping Devourer low on mana , it 's about keeping him from full mana . <h> DBM Settings <p> Coming Soon <h> Viz'aduum the Watcher <p> This fight takes place in space . You will be chasing Viz'aduum across three locations . At 66% and 33% HP he will open a portal to the next Legion ship . <h> Stage One : Netherspace <p> Command : Fel Beam- will fixate a random player and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to kite the beam away from the group . <p> Chaotic Shadows- will leave a debuff on a random player . When the debuff expires , the player releases a ring of shadowy orbs that travel outward . Players afflicted with the debuff need to run out of group , and other players need to be dodge any incoming orbs . The debuff is dispellable , and doing so will cause the immediate release of shadow orbs . <p> Disintegrate- is a frontal blast and knockback targeting a random player . You can simply side-step to avoid it . <p> Viz'aduum will cast Burning Blast- on the tank . It needs to be interrupted or else the tank will gain a hard-hitting DOT . <h> Stage Two : Command Ship <p> At 66% health , Viz'aduum opens a portal and escapes . The party will need to follow him through to continue the fight . <p> When you land on the next Legion ship , you will have to run past some damaging pylons to get to Viz'aduum . Try to dodge the damaging arc ( Soul Harvest ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of Disintegrate- and its knockback. - You can zig-zag your way to Viz'aduum , avoiding Disintegrate- by ducking between pylons before a cast and running down the middle after. - Pylons screenshot for reference . <p> When you reach Viz'aduum , the fight continues as in Stage One , minus the Command : Fel Beam , - but now two players are afflicted with Chaotic Shadows- instead of one . <p> The battlefield size is significantly reduced , so keeping up with interrupts , dodging bombs , dodging orbs , and not being knocked off with Disintegrate- gets hectic . <h> Stage Three : The Rift ! <p> At 33% health , Viz'aduum jumps through another portal . Follow him to another Legion ship , where he will start to channel - for 30 seconds . If - completes , the party will be overwhelmed with adds and wipe . <p> Instead of pylons blocking the path , there are a number of Felguard Sentry instead . DPS them down and continue towards Viz'aduum to interrupt his cast . <p> Two Felguard Sentry spawn every 25seconds . <p> Viz'aduum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now Chaotic Shadows- affects three players . <p> The fight gets insane in the last phase with tons of damage going out and a lot of abilities to manage . Pop your personal cooldowns and your strong dps cooldowns and burn down the boss before the party is overwhelmed . 21071 @qwx221071 21067 @qwx221067 21070 @qwx221070 21076 @qwx221076

@@23353132 @3353132/ <h> Restoration Druid Talents <p> Below you 'll find details on how each Restoration Druid talent functions and what its best use conditions are . Druid talents allow you to customize your setup for any encounter , be it single-target healing , group-healing , or utility . This information is geared towards new and intermediate players , so I 've done my best to avoid lots of math or complex theories . Feedback is greatly appreciated ! Feel free to leave comments at the bottom of the page , contact me using the form at the bottom of the site , or tweet @PrestonDvorak . <h> Talent Builds <p> Use the buttons below to select builds for different situations . Certain encounters or instances may deviate from these suggestions , so do n't be afraid to experiment ! You can click on any of the talents to scroll to a section with more information on that talent . <h> Level 100 ( Tier 7 ) <h> Level 15 ( Tier 1 ) <p> This talent will be best used when you 're single-target healing or are in a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heal . In most large-group settings , Cenarion Ward will be the way to go instead because it 's cheaper and heals for more over its duration . You should always take this talent if you take the Soul of the Forest talent in Tier 5 . <p> This fills a similar role to Prosperity in that it gives you a second Swiftmend-type heal . It 's not as burst-y as Swiftmend , but over its duration it will heal for more than Swiftmend and costs less mana . Being able to cast it on a target before damage happens gives it some extra flexibility , too . It 's great for situations where there is predictable , moderate to heavy sustained damage on a single target . It will also works great as a personal survivability cooldown . <p> situations where lots of Rejuvenations are maintained but Healing Touch is still needed frequently <p> You 'll likely use this talent in situations where you 're able to maintain a lot of Rejuvenations . If you 're finiding that the damage the group is taking is too much for Rejuvenation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Wild Growth and Swiftmend , this might be the talent to take . It will allow you to maintain all of your Rejuvenations as normal and then spot-heal with Healing Touch much more quickly . <p> A great mobility talent that I recommend for most situations . It functions like a Mage 's blink , instantly teleporting you forward , even allowing you to pass over harmful spells on the ground . It gives you a short speed buff and places you in cat form , further increasing your mobility for a short time . Being in cat form is a small inconvenience because casting any healing spell will immediately pull you out of cat form . <p> This talent offers a lot of flexible movement options , but they 're all slightly harder to make use of than Displacer Beast . Most of the time , you 'll make use of your caster form where you fly to friendly player 's location . Unlike Displacer Beast , the fact that you 're " flying " to the location allows you to move to allies that are across gaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Tier 3 ) <p> From a raiding standpoint , your talent choice in this tier will be almost completely situational depending on the passive effect . There could be fights were the extra damage from Balance or Feral is needed , but it 's unlikely . Even less likely is you 'll need to tank something ( although I have been an emergency tank on some boss kills ) ! If extra damage is required , Balance will be the best option because you can stay out at range , but it will ultimately be up to you and your raid . <p> Druids are very mobile healers to begin with , and already have Dash by default , with the option to take Displacer Beast for even more mobility on top of that . Those things make this talent a little less attractive , but it 's still something to keep in mind if you feel like you need to move even faster . <p> This will likely end up being the go-to talent . Taking 6% less damage is never a bad thing , and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be managed more carefully than ever in Legion . <h> Level 60 ( Tier 4 ) <p> This is a good choice if there are enemies that can be stunned or need to be stunned and you do n't have enough stuns otherwise . It can be difficult to use because it requires you be in melee range of whatever you 're stunning , so coordination will be key . <p> This will work best on enemies that are n't being damaged by anything and just need to be held in place , either for a tank to come pick them up or for a stronger crowd control to hit them . The biggest problem with this talent is the roots will break on even the smallest amount of damage , making it an inconsistent crowd control in most group settings . <p> This is a good all around talent for any encounters with adds that need to be managed . I consider it a nice compromise between the other two talents in this tier , it 's much more consistent and easier to use at range . Note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the daze , so you 'll need to experiment ! <h> Level 75 ( Tier 5 ) <p> This talent is great for situations that require sustained , moderate to heavy group-healing when used to buff Wild Growth . I have n't personally found situations where I consistently use it to buff Rejuvenation or Regrowth for single-target healing , but it could be useful if you find your primary job is to heal the tanks . Consider pairing this choice with the Prosperity talent in Level 15 ( Tier 1 ) for added flexibility . <p> Tree of Life is a substantial healing cooldown . For group-wide damage , it works best when you know the damage is coming ahead of time and can place heal over time effects on as many players as possible . Once you use Tree of Life , all the existing heal over time effects will heal for more and you can focus on topping off low players . Finally , there are some situations where you may need to use it to heal critical single target damage . This is rare , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead ( Ironbark , Swiftmend , Cenarion Ward , etc ) . More information on group-healing and single-target healing can be found on the tips and tricks page . <p> On paper , this talent seems like it would rarely ever proc at all , however , when doing difficult content ( raids , mythic+ dungeons , etc ) players often spike below 60% health , which is enough to trigger the Cultivation heal over time . Even casting a fresh Rejuvenation on a player below 60% health instantly applies Cultivation to them . This turns it into a great emergency heal that happens automatically and does n't cost any mana . It becomes even better when you consider that Cultivation counts as a heal over time for our mastery . <h> Level 90 ( Tier 6 ) <p> This talent is best used for situations when most of the group is stacked and there 's consistent , group-wide damage happening . The small HoT does n't do a lot by itself , but it does count toward our mastery , making subsequent HoTs more powerful . You 'll need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of mana if the group is moving a lot , so keep that in mind . <p> With the changes to Tranquility in Legion , this talent is really strong when it 's needed , but only if it 's needed . Take it any time your group is lacking large raid cooldowns or you feel using Tranquility one minute faster is beneficial . Otherwise , you 'll see more benefit from the other talents in this tier . <p> group-healing encounters where the group is spread out or there is frequent movement <p> when small numbers of players need heavy healing <p> This talent works best in situations where the group is spread out and healers are each responsible for a portion of the group . It 's also nice when specific players will need heavy healing over an extended period of time , such as fights where high-damage debuffs are applied . It 's also the best pick for Mythic+ dungeons where you 'll be able to get two Rejuvenations on all players reliably . <h> Level 100 ( Tier 7 ) <p> This talent is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use Regrowth three times for free during Omen of Clarity , while also buffing the healing those Regrowths do . The main problem being it relies on Omen of Clarity procs , making it a bit inconsistent . I see this having a lot of use in small groups where the tank damage is incredbly heavy and you 're making frequent use of Regrowth to keep them alive . The talent is also slightly more flexible than Stonebark because you can cast the Regrowths on three different players if needed , as opposed to only one Ironbark . <p> This is another increase to single-target healing , allowing you to use Ironbark every minute . It 's great for slowing incoming damage on a tank or helping heal a player when they 're already low , thanks to the 20% buff to HoT effects . I would take this talent anytime you 're not going to be making regular use of Flourish . <p> healing moderate to heavy group-wide damage , especially in large groups <p> This is a very substaintial group-healing cooldown when used properly . It requires that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group as possible before the damage happens . You 'll start placing Rejuvenations 10 seconds before the damage is going to happen , use Wild Growth as the damage begins , and then use Flourish . This allows you to place Rejuventions on additional players before your previous ones fall off , or gives you time to spot heal critical damage .

@@23353133 @3353133/ <h> Mistweaver Monk Stat Weights and Gearing <p> This page briefly covers the stats that are relevant for a Mistweaver Monk and what kind of things you should look for when gearing up . Feedback is always welcome , feel free to leave a comment at the bottom of the page or tweet @Daemagor . <h> Stat Priority and Relative Weights <p> This is a quick glance at the stats you want . You 'll find stat weights in parenthesis next to each stat . You can use these weights on sites like AskMrRobot with decent results . Note : the weights do n't always work well with trinkets , so default to your best judgement using the information in the Best in Slot lists . For returning players , you 'll notice that Spell Power and Spirit are gone . These stats are no longer available on gear starting in Legion . Intellect now directly plays the role of Spell Power , and Spirit has been removed from gear so Blizzard can more precisely tune the mana regeneration of healers . <p> *If you have mana problems you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Stat Explanations <p> Intellect increases your Spell Power which makes your healing spells more powerful . Look to get as much Intellect as you can . <p> Versatility is a flat damage and healing increase while also giving you a slight damage reduction . As a Mistweaver who does n't have much damage reduction spells , any little bit from Versatility can help . <p> Haste reduces your healing spell cast times and lowers the cooldown of Blackout Kick and Rising Sun Kick . It also let 's your Renewing Mist and Enveloping Mist tick faster , which in turn can give more Uplifting Trance procs . <p> Mastery causes all your main healing spells to to heal your target for even more free healing ( based on amount of Mastery ) . 21074 @qwx221074 <h> Best in Slot Gear <p> With the expansion of the warforged/titanforged system and the removal of primary stats from necks and rings , definitive Best in Slot lists are harder to create . Despite where an item may appear on the list , you should almost always use the the piece with the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necks , and trinkets , using a lower item level piece with better stats or effects is almost always better ( the exception to that being huge item level differences ) . The lists below assume all items are at their base item level . <p> For the sake of keeping the lists organized , it is assumed the raid gear being obtained is of Mythic-quality . At Heroic-quality and lower , there is much more overlap in items and the lists become almost impossible to rank . <h> Raiding <p> This list of gear was built with the Raiding stats above . <h> Breakdown by Boss <p> The goal of this section is to make it easier to decide which bosses to use Bonus Roll Tokens on and which Mythic instances you should run . The numbers include all gear drops from the Best in Slot list as well as the Picking Trinkets section below it . <p> Set Priority : LONG ... This will let you figure out what pieces to use depending on what legendaries you have . I do n't  recommend getting rid of 4pc T19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your 4pc T19 with 4pc T20 . Both 4pcs are really good and you do n't  want to break up either for 2 mediocre 2pcs . <h> Legendary Item Overview <p> Below you 'll find information on all of the legendary items that are available to Mistweaver Monks in Legion . Any legendary item will be good simply because of its high item level . However , some effects will be more useful in certain situations . <p> At the start of Legion , you will be able to equip one legendary item at a time . The final Order Hall Advancement talent will allow you to equip an additional legendary item . Blizzard has started they may raise the cap as the expansion goes on , but no specific date has been set . Blizzard has also said legendary items can drop from anywhere in the game ( Legion content ) . They are confirmed to drop from the following sources : dungeon bosses , raid bosses , world bosses , emissary caches , PvP strongboxes , and mythic+ weekly caches . There is currently no way to target a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your selected Loot Specialization . <p> I 've done my best to explain the best usage scenarios for each legendary , but I want to stress again that its always worth equipping a legendary for the additional stats you 'll gain from the item level , even if the effect does n't  benefit your current situation . <p> This Legendary will greatly increase the versatility of Thunder Focus Tea with having potentially large HPS increases or mana savings if you can get the luck of the draw . Great when paired with Rising Thunder . <p> Great choice to pair with Leggings of The Black Flame . If you find yourself using Thunder Focus Tea on cooldown for more Renewing Mists like I do , then this legendary will do very well . Another legendary that pairs well with Rising Thunder . <p> Legendary changed in 7.2 . Uplifting Trance now increases the healing of Vivify by an additional 20% and causes it to heal one additional target . This will be pretty strong for Mythic+ , this will allow Vivify to heal 4 people total . <p> A good legendary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having an extra 15% effect HP shield is nothing to laugh at . It can help you and your other healers save mana in not needing to heal you . <p> Unfortunately probably the worst legendary you can have for raiding/PvE . It can be an alright choice for dungeons where you can actually CC mobs , but for almost all boss fights it will be just a stat stick . <p> Paired with Prydaz , Xavarics Magnum Opus this will be one of the best legendaries for a Mistweaver . Being able to pair it with a well timed Revival will give you even more burst raid healing . WIth it having a relatively short CD it can be paired well with Chi Burst for more more burst raid healing as well as helping with the overhealing the Chi Burst inevitably gets . <p> A Mistweaver legendary that was introduced with 7.1.5 . This turns Sheiluns Gift in to a decent burst raid cooldown when paired with Thunder Focus Tea + Renewing Mist , things can get even better if using Sheiluns Gift on a target with Enveloping Mist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fonts you cast the better the legendary is . However , with Essence Font now having a 12 second CD this puts the legendary middle of the road even with being able to get more than one Chi-Ji up at a time . <p> Legendary introduced in 7.2.5 . On paper this sounds like a fun legendary with being able to take two talents in our level 45 row , in practice it is n't that good . With our Tomb tier bonus reducing the mana cost of Enveloping Mists , being able to take Mist Wrap + Lifecycles does n't  save you much mana overall . 21071 @qwx221071 21067 @qwx221067 <h> Tyler Dvorak <p> Tyler has been raiding on his Mistweaver Monk , Daemagor , since Mists of Pandaria .

If you have any suggestions or feedback , you can leave a comment below or tweet @PrestonDvorak . <p> The Challenge Dungeon consists of seven stages , during which you 're asked to both heal friendly NPCs and DPS enemy NPCs on your own while also avoiding harmful mechanics . <p> You 'll have to decide if you can stand and tank the damage yourself or if you have to kite or stun the Soldier . <p> It will also use Knife Dance , dealing moderate damage to you and the friendly NPCs . <p> This can be interrupted with knockback or stun effects , although it 's not really worth using one just on this ability . If you can interrupt it along with the Mage , that 's the best option . <h> Wave 4 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Corrupted Risen Soldiers . <p> The enemies continue to function the same as before . <p> If you have a knockback effect or an AoE stun , I recommend using it when the Soldiers start channeling Knife Dance while the Mage is also casting Arcane Blitz . This stops a lot of incoming damage at once . <p> Be prepared to use a group-healing cooldown the second time the two Soldiers start using Knife Dance if you ca n't interrupt them again . <h> Wave 5 <p> The fifth wave consists of a Corrupted Risen Arbalest , a Corrupted Risen Mage , and a Corrupted Risen Soldier . <p> The enemies continue to function the same as before . <p> Once again , if you have a knockback effect or AoE stun , use it when the Solder is casting Knife Dance and the Mage is casting Arcane Blitz . <p> Keep an eye out for Mana Sting , it 's easy to miss it and sometimes hard to keep track of the friendly NPCs locations . <p> I recommend having some kind of healing cooldown to use by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second time . From then on , the damage to the group will be high and sporadic . <h> Stage 2 <p> Stage 2 is just a " filler " stage where you run ahead to the next room . You should use this time to drink and regain mana. 21074 @qwx221074 <h> Stage 3 <p> During this stage , your friendly NPCs are captured and you must rescue them . To do this , you 'll be DPSing various enemies while avoiding harmful mechanics and keeping yourself alive . For the sake or organization , I 'll divide things into " waves " again , just note that the enemies do n't come to you this time , instead you 'll move through the hallways as quickly as possible . <p> You have five minutes to complete this Stage , so high , efficient DPS is required . <h> Wave 1 <p> The first wave contains six Flickering Eyes . <p> These constantly pulse light damage while alive , and heavy damage if you get near them . <p> When killed , they explode for a heavy amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time while applying any damage over time effects you have to the next eye you 're going to kill . <p> If you have strong defensive cooldowns , you may be able to kill two or more Eyes at once . <h> Wave 2 <p> Moving ahead to the next hallway , you 'll be contending with two Unstable Fel Orbs , three Fel Bat Pups , and one Felspite Dominator . <p> The Unstable Fel Orbs can be " killed " in one hit , which deactivates them and makes it safe to pass by for a short period of time . <p> Getting near an active Orb applies a moderate damage over time effect and slows your movement speed considerably . <p> You can completely ignore the two Orbs for now by pulling the other enemies into the circular room where you fought the Flickering Eyes . <p> I recommend killing all of the Bats first as they have relatively little health but deal a significant amount of damage . <p> If you have reliable damage over time effects , you should apply them to all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special abilities and simply deals a moderate amount of damage . <h> Wave 3 <p> When moving ahead , remember to damage the two Unstable Fel Orbs to deactivate them . You will then go to the left and have to open a gate . I recommend standing to the far-right corner of the gate so you can open it before the Orbs reach you . <p> Once the gate is opened , you 're presented with three friendly Damaged Souls , a Panicked Soul , and a Corrupted Risen Arbalest . <p> The Damaged Souls need to be healed as quickly as possible . <p> I recommend using a cooldown that buffs your healing throughput to heal them faster . <p> You can safely stand at the bottom of the stairs to heal them without worrying about Unstable Fel Orbs or the Panicked Soul running up and down the stairs . <p> Once the Damaged Souls are healed , you can pull the Arbalest from the bottom of the stairs . <p> The Arbalest functions the same as in Stage 1 , except now when it uses Mana Sting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block it . <p> This is made complicated by the Panicked Soul running up and down the stairs . Touching the ring around it will fear you for 5-seconds . <p> Standing right against the wall while on the stairs allows you to avoid the fear ring in all cases that I 've seen . <h> Wave 4 <p> The fourth wave begins with another gate . I again recommend standing near the far-right corner of the gate to avoid the Panicked Soul . <p> Once the gate is opened , you 're presented with a gauntlet of a dozen Unstable Fel Orbs . Damage these to deactivate them quickly as you make your way up the stairs . <h> Wave 5 <p> The fifth wave begins with yet another gate , which you can open safely from the far-right corner again . <p> Once the gate is open , you 'll face a Dread Corruptor and three Flickering Eyes . <p> The Flickering Eyes function the same as before . <p> I recommend killing these first as you do n't want one accidentally dying when you do n't expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also periodically places three to four eyes on the ground ( they look very similar to the Flickering Eyes ) , which shoot out short beams and rotate . You should avoid these beams , however , they did n't seem to be particularly fatal . <h> Stage 4 <p> This is another filler stage . You can drink and regain mana if you need to and even wait for your cooldowns to come up , then open the gate when you 're ready to proceed . <h> Stage 5 <p> During this stage , you 're once again healing your friendly NPCs and Damaged Souls . <p> Your friendly NPCs are corrupted and turn against each other , so you must keep them alive while they fight . <p> It seems one of the NPCs ends up being targeted by the other two , and will be taking the bulk of the damage . <p> You 're also required to heal a total of eight Damaged Souls . These appear in sets of three and pre-set locations around the room . <p> Every Soul you do n't heal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stage 6 . <p> I recommend using a throughput boosting cooldown and healing as many adds as you can in the first three to four sets . <p> I was able to heal three Souls on the first set , two Souls on the second and third sets , and one Soul on the fourth set before any of them reached Erdris . This meant I had two adds to face in Stage 6 . <h> Stage 6 <p> During this stage , you 'll be fighting against a number of enemies which is determined by how many Damaged Souls you did n't heal in the previous stage . The enemies are the same types from Stage 1 and should be handled as such . <h> Stage 7 ( Final Stage ) <p> During this stage , you 'll finally be fighting against Erdris . <p> Erdris will randomly jump to your location and leave behind a fel pool , do n't stand in these except as-noted below . <p> Try to position these as close to each other as possible , you will run out of space in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're affected by Ignite Soul , stand in a fel pool or otherwise damage yourself as low as safely possible to mitigate the damage you do to the friendly NPCs when it expires . <p> If you have around 3.5 million health , plan on damaging yourself to at least half-health to be safe . <p> After this goes off , plan on using a group-healing cooldown to bring all the NPCs back to full health . <p> I recommend helping DPS as much as possible in this stage .

The tank should move away from the group and this should be dispelled at around 3 stacks . <p> If you 're affected with Nightmare Blades , you and the other player who 's affected should move out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop area .

@@23353145 @3353145/ <h> Mistweaver Monk Healing Tips and Tricks <p> Healing does n't really have a rotation of spells to go through like a DPS spec does , however , there are often certain types of situations that arise where you can respond in a certain fashion . I 've detailed some of the most common situations below , as well as how to heal them . In the heat of battle , you may not always be able to stick to these things exactly , but with a little practice they should become second nature . <p> If you have any quetions or feedback , you can leave a comment below or tweet @Daemagor . <h> Things to always do <p> Cast Renewing Mist on cooldown . You can essentially use it on anyone in the raid since it will bounce to a player missing health , although I would recommend using it on someone who is already missing health to gain your Mastery heal as well . <p> Use Thunder Focus Tea as much as possible . I usually use Thunder Focus Tea on cooldown and with Renewing Mist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with Vivify can save a lot of mana and do a lot of burst healing . <h> Tank/single-target healing <p> Cast Enveloping Mist on the target . You 'll want to have this up almost all the time if you are a main-tank healer because it makes your target take 30% more healing from all your other heals . <p> If casting Enveloping Mist on the target and healing through Soothing Mist is not enough , you can spam cast Effuse while refreshing Enveloping Mist . Doing so can drain your mana quickly but the combo of the Effuse heal as well as Gust of Mists is a high amount of single-target healing . <p> If there are 3+ targets in range you can use Vivify instead of Effuse . Do not use Vivify for pure single-target healing . <p> Sheiluns Gift is a very strong single-target heal . You gain 1 stack every 10 seconds in combat , up to 12 stacks . Using it at max stacks on a target affected by Enveloping Mist can heal them for more than their max health . <p> Use Life Cocoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life Cocoon is n't used as an external cooldown on the tank , it can be used to save someone who is at low health and would die if you tried to use any other healing spell on them . <h> Raid/AoE Healing <p> For the most part , Renewing Mist will be your go-to AoE healing spell for light-moderate damage . <p> For moderate-high healing , Essence Font and Vivify will be your go-to . Try to use Vivify only with Uplifting Trance procs . Try to use one Essence Font prior to casting Mana Tea and span Vivify during the Mana Tea duration and finishing it off with one more Essence Font before Mana Tea is done . Try to prioritize players that have the Essence Font HoT on them for the double Gust of Mists healing . <p> If you are lucky enough to get an Innervate , try to time parts of the fights where the raid will be taking a lot of damage and spam cast Vivify and Essence Font on cooldown . Casting one Essence Font outside of Innervate wont hurt too much and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will most likely be planned in your raid cooldown list but if it is n't it can be a very good emergency survival tool . <h> Fistweaving/DPS <p> Rising Sun Kick is the highest priority . If using the Fistweaving build you will use Thunder Focus Tea prior to the start of the encounter . <p> When Rising Sun Kick is on cooldown you will cast Tiger Palm to gain stacks of Teachings of the Monastery , once at 3 stacks you will cast Blackout Kick . <p> Each Blackout Kick has a 15% chance to reset the cooldown of Rising Sun Kick . <p> Thanks to the Rising Thunder talent , every time you Rising Sun Kick , Thunder Focus Teas cooldown will get reset . This in turn will lead to more Renewing Mists being blanketed on the raid . 21071 @qwx221071 21067 @qwx221067 <h> Tyler Dvorak <p> Tyler has been raiding on his Mistweaver Monk , Daemagor , since Mists of Pandaria .

@@23353147 @3353147/ <h> World of Warcraft Macro Guide <p> Macros allow you to refine your playstyle and spell usage without installing an addon . Below are some common macro types that can be applied to nearly any class and spec . I 've used Restoration Druid spells as examples , but you can substitute your own spells in . <p> Feedback and macro ideas are always appreciated . You can leave a comment at the bottom of this page or tweet @PrestonDvorak . <h> Basic Macro Parts <p> Below is a basic macro that casts a spell on your current target . This macro is pointless to use because it does the same thing as having the normal spell on your action bar , but I thought it would work well to explain some basic macro pieces that well build on later . <p> #showtooltip /cast @target , exists , nodead , help Rejuvenation <p> #showtooltip causes the macro to take on the icon and tooltip of whatever spell is in the macro . That means there 's no need to manually select the icon if you do n't  want to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a spell . Another common one is /use if you 're going to be telling the macro to use a trinket or item . <p> @target tells the macro to cast the spell on your current target . You can technically omit this part for casting things on your current target , but well be doing some more advanced things with it below so its nice to have . Other common options you 'll use are @player to cast on yourself , @mouseover to cast on the thing your mouse cursor is over , and @focus to cast on whatever you have set as your /focus target . <p> exists , nodead , help tells the macro to only cast the spell on your target if it exists , is not dead ( nodead ) , and is a friendly player ( help ) . This prevents you from trying to cast on an enemy by mistake and getting errors telling you that you cant do that . Other common options include harm ( to cast on enemies ) and dead ( to cast on something that 's dead ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cast . You can either type it out yourself or Shift+Click on a spell in your spellbook when editing a macro to automatically put the name in . <p> Now well build on this basic macro concept ! <h> Mouseover Macros <p> Mouseover macros allow you to use a spell or ability on a player or enemy by having your mouse cursor over their physical character or their raid frame . No clicking to target required ! Some players , healers in particular , go as far as having all of their spells used through mouseover macros , but this is mostly a playstyle choice . I personally use a mouseover macro for my my dispel abilities , such as Nature 's Cure . <p> @mouseover , exists , nodead , help will cast Natures Cure on your friendly mouseover target . If you do n't  have a mouseover target , @target , exists , nodead , help will cast it on your current friendly target instead . Finally , if you do n't  have a friendly target either , @player it will cast it on yourself . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something on whatever you have set as your focus target ( target something and type /focus in chat to set one ) . These macros are commonly used for crowd control abilities and interrupts , but I also use them for my DPS abilities as a healer . This allows me to set the boss as my focus target and DPS without switching targets from whomever I 'm healing . <p> #showtooltip Solar Wrath will display the Solar Wrath icon and tooltip no matter what . We cant just use #showtooltip alone in this macro or the icons will only show up when we have an enemy targeted or an enemy set as the focus . Doing it this way prevents the generic question mark icon from appearing otherwise . <p> You 're probably picking up on the pattern by now - @target , exists , nodead , harm will try to cast Solar Wrath on our target if it exists and is an enemy . If we do n't  have a target that 's an enemy , @focus , exists , nodead , harm will cast it on your focus target if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those situations exist , nothing will happen . 21074 @qwx221074 <h> Dynamic Talent Macros <p> In some cases , you have two talents you often switch between , but you do n't  want to keep changing the spells on your bar . Macros can help with that too ! <p> talent:5/2 Incarnation : Chosen of Elune will use the Incarnation talent if it is chosen . The talent:5/2 section is important . 5/2 corresponds to the row/column the talent is located on . In this case , its located on the fifth row , second column . If the Incarnation talent is n't chosen , the macro will use Celestial Alignment instead . <p> The example below shows what it looks like when two talents are used alongside a general ability . This macro is n't particularly functional as far as the talents/abilities chosen , but it should serve as another good example . <p> The macro will first try to cast Tree of Life if that talent is taken , then it will try to cast Flourish if that talent is taken , and if neither are taken it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it shows that you can chain this type of thing together as long as you want to . <h> Targeted/Reticle Spell Macros <p> Some spells have a " target reticle , " a big green circle that appears at your mouse cursor when you use the spell , most commonly these are area of effect spells and things like Efflorescence and Healing Rain . If you use these spells normally , you must " cast " the spell and then click at the location you want the spell to be used at . There 's nothing wrong with doing it this way , but there are some ways macros can speed up the process . <p> #showtooltip/cast @cursor Efflorescence <p> @cursor will cast the targeted spell at your cursor 's current location , removing the need to " click " after casting the spell . <p> #showtooltip/cast @player Efflorescence <p> Similar to the other macros above , @player will place the spell directly underneath yourself , without needing to " click " after casting . <h> Further Learning <p> There is a lot more you can do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can try the Wowpedia Macro Guide , otherwise , if you have any questions you can leave a comment below and I 'll try to answer it ! I may even update the guide with what 's discussed . 21071 @qwx221071 21067 @qwx221067 21070 @qwx221070 21076 @qwx221076

@@23353154 @3353154/ <p> The Scarab Dais is located in southern Silithus on the Kalimdor continent , just outside of AhnQiraj . The Dais , and the Scarab Gong it holds are relics of the Qiraji empire that were reconstituted by Fandral Staghelm and Anachronos following the War of the Shifting Sands nearly 1,000 years before World of Warcrafts time . Following the War , the duo and their armies created a magical barrier around the walls of Ahnqiraj and set the Scarab Gong atop the Dais to be used as the mechanism to open the Scarab Gate , should the need ever arise . The Gong has seemingly been guarded by Jonathan the Revelator , a Watcher from the Bronze dragonflight , since it was put in place . <p> The need to open the Scarab Gate and face the Qiraji inside came almost 1,000 years later , during the middle of Classic World of Warcraft , when it was discovered the old god CThun had awakened and begun empowering the Qiraji .

This event is widely considered the largest and most spectacular event in World of Warcraft , one which has never quite been replicated on the same scale . The Scepter questline took heroes through the process of acquiring shards from each of the dragonflights , requiring them to face many of the toughest bosses at the time , all while " racing " against each other for the coveted Scarab Lord title and mount . The collection of war supplies took the effort of all heroes on a realm and required tens of thousands of materials to be turned in before the Scarab Gong could be rung , ushering in the AhnQiraj War . <p> With the Qiraji and CThun defeated , the Scarab Dais has remained unused for years , serving simply as a reminder of the efforts put forth by the Horde and Alliance leading up to and during the war .

@@23353155 @3353155/ <p> The Stormspire is a neutral town located in Netherstorm on the Outland continent and was introduced during the Burning Crusade expansion . The town is controlled by the Consortium , a band of ethereal smugglers led by Nexus-Prince Haramad . The town is surrounded by lush vegetation and protected from the constant magical storms by two eco-dome generators called Sutheron and Skyperch . This gives it a unique appearance that stands in stark contrast to the rest of Netherstorm which has been stripped bare by the magical energies . The town was built on top of a high plateau and is only accessible by flight or by elevator . This height , combined with the vegetation and the eco-domes gives it a secluded feel and could be why the Consortium settled here . Several dialogues and quests in the area tell stories about the Consortiums enemies , including the Ethereum , a rogue faction of ethereals seeking to " become void , " as well as Prince Kaelthas Sunstrider and his followers , who were former customers of the Consortium . Also present is Advisor Rahim , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stamp out the Ethereum and those who seek to harm the other ethereals . Their presence here suggests the Consortium is a sanctioned ethereal faction and not a rogue black market operation as their name and activities suggest , at least in the eyes of the other ethereals . <p> The areas protected by the eco-domes give a glimpse into the past and what Stormspire and Netherstorm used to look like . Prior to the end of the Second War , and long before World of Warcrafts time , Outland was known as Draenor and it had n't  yet been broken apart . During this time , the Netherstorm was a lush forest island called Farahlon . Farahlon itself was the remains of a sporemound , which were large carnivorous plants that nearly took over Draenor before being destroyed by Grond , a huge elemental giant . Not much is known about Farahlon , but given the architecture of Stormspire , we can assume the Draenei had settled in the area and that this was one of their main towns on the island . <p> Following the orcs defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open portals to new worlds for them to conquer . Trying to open so many portals released a large surge of magical energy that tore Draenor apart , turning it into Outland as we know it today . This surge of energy had a particularly damaging effect on the Netherstorm area and weakened the divide between it and the Twisting Nether . With the introduction of manaforges by KaelThas several decades later , the area became tumultuous and unstable , with almost constant mana storms tearing apart the remaining landscape . Its unclear when the eco-dome generators were put in place to protect Stormspire , but we know they were built by the ethereals . Given the pristine condition of everything protected by the domes , we can assume they were at least built before the manaforges were put into production . <p> Stormspire is a unique place and offers a rare glimpse deep into the past through the care of the ethereal race , who themselves are still quite mysterious today .

He has more one-shot mechanics than other bosses , and on top of that has a strict 4 minute enrage timer . This fight is only one phase . <p> Guarm will use Guardian 's Breath from each of his three heads . Each head will randomly use either a Shadow , Frost , or Fiery attack in a frontal cone . Example : On breath 1 , the right head uses Fire , center head uses Shadow , and left head uses Frost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use Fire , but the center head uses Frost , and the left head uses Shadow . <p> Fiery Phlegm , Salty Spittle , and Dark Discharge are applied with their respective breaths ( ie , Fire breath applies Fiery Phlegm , etc ) . The damage from these abilities are split evenly among the players in each cone . <p> You will gain the debuff associated with each breath . If you are caught in any other type of breath after , you will instantly die . If you have , say , Fiery Phlegm , getting either Salty Spittle or Dark Discharge will kill you . <p> The raid will be split into three groups to soak each type of breath . Stick to your group and stay aware of where your breath will be . <p> The entire raid must be hit by a breath attack .

The stun is dispellable . <p> Roaring Leap will knock back everyone within 25 yards of the boss . Guarm will then jump at the largest group of players , deal moderate damage , and knock everyone within 12 yards into the air . <p> Periodically , Guarm jumps to one end of the arena and starts using Headlong Charge . He will run back and forth , dealing deadly damage to anyone in his path . <p> Guarm enrages after 4 minutes . <h> DPS Strategy <p> Stay 5 yards apart at all times to prevent Guardian 's Licks debuffs from splashing . <p> Ranged should stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or to his side if there is n't enough room ) to avoid Flashing Fangs . <p> Always stand in your assigned breath .

@@23353171 @3353171/ <p> The Frozen Throne was originally a diamond-hard block of ice that was cast down to Azeroth from the Twisting Nether . It was the physical embodiment of the Lich King 's spirit until Arthas Menethil shattered it with the runeblade Frostmourne . The remnants of the block of ice resembled the form of a throne , giving way to its name : The Frozen Throne . <p> The block of ice was originally created by Kil'jaeden the Deceiver , acting leader of the Burning Legion . It was created to contain the spirit of Ner'zhul after his physical body was destroyed as punishment for trying to escape his blood-pact with the Burning Legion . After Ner'zhul 's spirit was twisted into that of the Lich King , the block of ice was cast down to Azeroth . <p> The block of ice crashed into a glacier in Icecrown on the Northrend continent .

Some time after , Kil'jaeden tasked Illidan Stormrage with destroying the Throne when Ner'zhul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used them to create an earthquake centered around Icecrown and the Frozen Throne . While he failed to destroy it , he did damage it , causing the Lich King 's power to begin seeping out . <p> Following his failed attempt , and once again at the orders of Kil'jaeden , Illidan led a direct assault on the Throne . He was defeated by Arthas Menethil who took it upon himself to ascend the icy spire and shatter the Throne himself . Shattering the ice revealed the Helm of Domination , which contained the Lich King 's spirit . Arthas donned the Helm , effectively merging his spirit with Ner'zhul 's and creating a new Lich King . <p> While the new Lich King lay dormant , the Icecrown Citadel was built around the Frozen Throne by its Scourge minions .

From here , the Lich King tortured Bolvar relentlessly , but Bolvar never surrendered to his will . Following the Lich King 's defeat , the spirit of Terenas Menethil , Arthas ' father , was released from Frostmourne . He stated that an uncontrolled Scourge would be much more dangerous , and that there must always be a Lich King . As his last act of service to Azeroth and final defiant gesture against the evils of Azeroth , Bolvar asked that the Helm of Domination be placed on his head . As the Lich King , he would work tirelessly to contain and control the Scourge from within .

@@23353176 @3353176/ <p> In the ancient times of Azeroth , the Vale of Eternal Blossoms was created by the Titan Freya as one of several locations where she could experiment with creating life . The waters of the Vale held the same power as the Well of Eternity itself . From these waters the Wild Gods came to be , including the four August Celestials who watch over Pandaria . It was this power that drew the Horde and Alliance to the Vale during the Mists of Pandaria expansion . <p> During the time Freya created the Vale , her and the other Titans were fighting against the mantid , a bug-like race that served the Old Gods . To help preserve the Vale , the Titans created large humanoid-creatures made of stone , called the Mogu . After the Titans defeated the Old Gods , the Old Golds released the Curse of Flesh onto Azeroth . This affected the Mogu and turned them from stone to flesh and blood . Lacking direction and a leader , the Mogu began forming clans and fighting against each other . Not long after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the first Mogu emperor . Under the new leadership , they enslaved the other creatures of Pandaria and forced them to build the Great Wall . The Great Wall helped keep the mantid out of the Vale of Eternal Blossoms where the Mogu had set up their palace . <p> At some point between the fall of the Old Gods and the rise of Lei Shen , a race of fish-like people called the Jinyu ruled Pandaria from the Vale . The Jinyu evolved from murlocs who were fortunate enough to live around the powerful waters in the Vale . Under the leadership of Rassharom , the Jinyu held strong against the Mogu 's attempts to take the Vale . They eventually fell after being betrayed by the Hozen , a monkey-like race who at the time believed they would be given special treatment if they helped the Mogu . The Hozen never received their special treatment and were enslaved like the other races . <p> Thousands of years later , and still before World of Warcraft 's time , the Pandaren started an uprising against the Mogu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and utilizing his new form of unarmed combat , the Pandaren enjoyed easy victories against the Mogu . The Mogu 's new emperor , Lao-Fe , eventually barricaded himself inside the Vale , but this only delayed the inevitable . With the Mogu emperor killed , the remaining Mogu were ousted from the Vale of Eternal Blossoms and the gates were sealed . Over the next several thousand years the Vale became a mythical place in the Pandaren culture . No one entered or left the Vale , and only members of the Golden Lotus and Shado-Pan factions remained inside to keep it pristine and safe . <p> It was not until The Sundering that the gates were opened again . The Pandaren Emperor Shaohao was allowed to enter the Vale . Having purged himself of his burdens , he became one with the land in order to protect Pandaria from The Sundering . This act and The Sundering itself gave way to the Pandaria that exists in World of Warcraft today . <p> The Vale of Eternal Blossoms was not disturbed again until shortly after the Horde and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was around this time the Golden Lotus started noticing Mogu forces assembling in the Vale .

The Horde reside in the Shrine of the Two Moons and the Alliance reside in the Shrine of Seven Stars . Unfortunately , this unfettered access to the power within the Vale was too much for Garrosh Hellscream , the Horde Warchief at the time .

This week , we 're taking a look at the Temple of Karabor ( now commonly known as the Black Temple ) ! <p> The Temple of Karabor began as a draenic refuge and home of the Prophet Velen in Shadowmoon Valley on Draenor . It was eventually taken by Gul'dan to be used as the base of operations for the Shadow Council . Gul'dan renamed it to the Black Temple , which is what it 's mostly known by today . Since then , it has changed hands many times over the years . The Black Temple is located in Outland as part of the Burning Crusade expansion , while a pristine version of the Temple of Karabor can be found in the alternate-universe Draenor as part of the Warlords of Draenor expansion . <p> The Temple of Karabor was originally built by the draenei to serve as their capital city and holiest temple on Draenor . The temple was assaulted by demon-blood corrupted orcs by the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle , the Temple fell to the orcs .

It was n't until the Second War when the Alliance pushed the Old Horde back through the Dark Portal that the Temple was cleansed of its demonic inhabitants . Immediately following the Alliance liberation , Ner'zhul , the Warchief of the orcs on Draenor , attempted to retreat by opening several portals to other worlds . The extreme energy from these portals caused Draenor to be torn apart , turning it into Outland as we know it today . <p> These portals offered a strategic advantage for the demons on Outland .

After finishing Kil'jaeden 's bidding on Azeroth , Illidan finally returned to the Temple and established it as his seat of power . <p> During the Black Temple raid , Horde and Alliance heroes destroyed Illidan 's forces and defeated The Betrayer himself . Illidan was not killed but was instead imprisoned by the Warden Maiev Shadowsong . It is implied that Akama and the Narru stay behind to clean up the temple , but this is not something we experience in game . <p> As part of the Warlords of Draenor expansion , the Temple of Karabor can be visited in all of its original glory on the alternate-universe Draenor .

During this battle , they revealed a secret weapon : the Dragon Soul ! The Dragon Soul possessed the essence of every dragon in each flight , including the Aspects themselves ( with the exception of the duplicitous Neltharion ) . Neltharion the Earth-Warder used the Dragon Soul to obliterate a swathe of demons in a single blast . He then turned on the night elves , cutting down hundreds . Horrified , the Aspects urged him to cease . The blue dragonflight leapt to action , surrounding Neltharion and using their magic to subdue him . Unfortunately , their magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blues , killing all of them . With the Dragon Soul , he scattered the remaining flights to the winds , and departed the battle . <p> Despite Illidan 's growing power , he saw his twin was more respected and , more importantly , had won Tyrande 's heart . Driven by jealousy and ambition , Illidan formed a plan in secret . Sneaking away from the resistance army , Illidan approached Zin-Azshari , swearing allegiance to Sargeras and promising to steal the Dragon Soul for him . To reward him , Sargeras burned out Illidan 's eyes and granted him tattoos that magnified his already impressive power and heightened his senses . Illidan successfully recovered the Dragon Soul , now referred to as the Demon Soul , for Sargeras . Instead of wielding it as planned , Illidan was forced to bide his time . For his actions , he was branded a betrayer to his people . <p> Running out of time , the night elves reluctantly allied with tauren , furbolgs , and Earthen . The reinforced host held out for a time , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stemmed . Sargeras knew the only way to build a portal strong enough for his passage into Azeroth was to use the Well of Eternity itself , and with the Demon Soul , that portal could finally be built . The Wild Gods finally joined the battle , destroying countless demons , though many fell themselves , including the boar Aggamaggan , brother bears Ursoc and Ursol , feathered Aviana , and even the white stag Malorne , father of Cenarius . As the tide turned in favor of the boundless Legion , the green , red , and bronze dragonflights returned . <p> Illidan stole away from the palace , preparing to enact his plan . Astride the green Aspect , Ysera , Malfurion flew to the Well to retrieve the Demon Soul . Neltharion , now known as Deathwing , also made his return , nearly destroying himself to get the Demon Soul . When he finally had the Soul in his grasps , a bolt of energy from the well struck him , casting him away and causing him to lose his hold on the device . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell that sucked every demon in Azeroth back into the Well . As the portal collapsed , so did the Well . The catastrophe destroyed much of Kalimdor 's landmass and broke apart the continent . This event would forever be known as the Sundering . At the last moment , Azshara and her loyal followers in the palace of Zin-Azshari were transformed into naga by the Old Gods , saving their lives . <p> In the aftermath , Illidan made a new font of energy on Mount Hyjal using vials of water from the Well of Eternity . To his surprise , the night elves were horrified with him . Lashing out , Illidan slew some of the sorcerers that spoke against him . He insisted the Legion would return and the night elves needed a magic source to draw from . Malfurion agreed the Legion would someday return , and requested Illidan be imprisoned instead of executed . To prevent the new Well 's energies from drawing the Legion , dragon Aspects Alexstrasza , Ysera , and the recently-returned Nozdormu planted a great tree and blessed it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have immortality . <h> Intermission - The Guardian and the Dark Portal <p> The Legion remained relatively quiet for millennia , but they were far from inactive . 3000 years ago a group of human and elven wizards formed the Council of Tirisfal in secret . Their mission was to hunt down any stray demons that made it into Azeroth . Eventually , they realized the best way to defeat the demons was to infuse a single being with all of their power . That being became known as the Guardian of Tirisfal , the first of whom was named Alodi . Some time later , a female mage named Aegwynn became the Guardian . Aegwynn became extremely powerful , even using the magic to extend her life by centuries . <p> Roughly 850 years before World of Warcraft , Aegwynn detected demonic activity in the icy reaches of Northrend . When she arrived , Aegwynn found out the demons were hunting down the green dragonflight and draining their magic . In the ensuing battle , Sargeras managed to create a physical manifestation of himself on Azeroth . Aegwynn triumphed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomb of Sargeras . Though she thought Sargeras vanquished , he had managed to bind some of his essence to her soul where it lay dormant for ages . <p> As the centuries passed , Aegwynn decided she would not relinquish her powers to a Guardian of the Council 's choosing . Instead , she would pass them on to her child . She searched for a mage to father this child , choosing Nielas Aran . When Aegwynn bore Medivh , Sargeras 's essence passed from her to her son . As Medivh came to power , Sargeras twisted his thoughts , using him to contact the orc warlock Gul'dan on Draenor . Together , Medivh and Gul'dan collaborated to bring the demon-corrupted orcish Horde to Azeroth by creating the Dark Portal . After Medivh 's treachery was discovered , he was slain by childhood friend Anduin Lothar , but by then the Dark Portal was long opened . <h> The Second Invasion <p> Reign of Chaos <p> Twenty years after the First War between orcs and humans , a new threat rose . A nightmarish plague ripped through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walking dead . Prince Arthas tracked the source of the plague to a dreadlord named Mal'ganis , chasing the demon to Northrend . While in Northrend , Arthas found the powerful runeblade , Frostmourne . Wielding the sword enthralled him to the Lich King , who in turn was a servant of the Burning Legion . After slaying Mal'ganis , Arthas turned his undead army on Lordaeron , and then the mage-city Dalaran . He was joined by Tichondrius to keep watch and ensure Arthas was working towards the Legion 's ends . <p> Once in Dalaran , the lich Kel'Thuzad used powerful magic to once again summon the Eredar Lord Archimonde into Azeroth , heralding the start of the Legion 's second war on the planet . The demons make their way over to Kalimdor , intent on destroying Nordrassil . Simultaneously , the Pit Lord Mannoroth sought to destroy the orcs for their failure to take over Azeroth in the First War . He also had another enemy that needed dispatching : the demigod Cenarius . As luck would have it , the orcs were also at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power to seduce the orcs to drink his blood , giving them the strength to kill the demigod . To Mannoroth 's surprise , the orcs turned on him and killed him as well , freeing themselves from his demonic curse . <p> Knowing the horrors of the Legion firsthand , Tyrande Whisperwind released Illidan Stormrage from his 10000 year imprisonment . <p> Despite losing Mannoroth , Tichondrius continued his plans , using the skull of Gul'dan to corrupt Felwood . Tipped off by Arthas , Illidan hunted down the skull , consuming its magics before killing Tichondrius . With the skull of Gul'dan , Illidan became even more monstrous and demonic , growing horns , wings , and hooves . <p> As Archimonde lead his army in a march on Hyjal , orcs , humans , and night elves banded together to fight . Once again , Malfurion Stormrage devised a desperate plan to stop the Legion . When Archimonde finally reached Nordrassil , Malfurion blew the Horn of the Ancients , summoning thousands of wisps who detonate themselves on the demon , destroying him and laying waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing the night elves to lose their immortality . In the aftermath , the Lich King breaks the Legion 's hold over himself , eventually merging with Arthas while Illidan fled to Outland to fight the Legion on his own terms . Thus , ends the second invasion . <h> The Third Invasion <p> The Burning Crusade <p> The Legion has taken up residence in the ruined remnants of Draenor , now known as Outland . In Outland , Illidan has overthrown Magtheridon to take over the Black Temple as his main base of operations . He formed alliances with the blood elf prince Kael'thas Sunstrider and with Azshara 's handmaiden , the naga Lady Vashj . <p> Legion forces on Outland learned how to open the Dark Portal once again . Led by Highlord Kruul , demons poured into Azeroth . This time , the Argent Dawn kept the invasion contained until Alliance and Horde reinforcements arrived . They pushed the Legion back through the portal , eventually defeating the forces on Hellfire Peninsula . While in Outland , Alliance and Horde forces worked to rout the demons from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they saw as no better than the Legion . <p> Even with Illidan defeated and Outland secured , the Legion was n't done . Prince Kael'thas survived his defeat in Tempest Keep and returned to Azeroth , allying with the Legion . He promised to deliver the Sunwell to them in return for great power . Demons swarmed over the Isle of Quel'Danas and the Sunwell Plateau itself . Using the Sunwell as his portal , Kil'Jaeden , one of Sargeras 's lieutenants , was halfway into Azeroth before he was defeated and forced back by Alliance and Horde forces . For now , the Legion was defeated once again . <h> The Fourth Invasion <p> Legion <p> The seeds of the Fourth Invasion were planted when Garrosh Hellscream jumped to a past version of Draenor to subvert history . He convinced the orcs to reject Gul'dan 's offer of Mannoroth 's blood . Gul'dan , servant of the Legion , would eventually wrest control of the Iron Horde from Grom Hellscream and corrupt most of the clans anyway . He allowed the Legion to pour into Draenor , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he worked to once again summon Archimonde . The Legion intended to use Draenor as a rallying point for their forces before going after Azeroth once again . However , Archimonde was defeated by Azerothian and Draenor forces . In his death throes , he sent Gul'dan to Azeroth to finish his work . <p> The Fourth Invasion of Azeroth is the subject of World of Warcraft : Legion . In the pre-launch event , Legion transporters have started appearing all over the world , bringing countless demons raining from the sky . After Alliance and Horde heroes fend off the attacks , they will take the fight to the Broken Isles to hunt down the Pillars of Creation , powerful artifacts that will enable the heroes to stand against the Legion once again .

Using their shared connection of servitude to the Old Gods , Chogall , a high-ranking member of the Shadow Council , convinced Ragnaros to let them occupy the upper area of Blackrock Mountain ( known as Blackrock Spire ) while Ragnaros and his minions stayed in the lower area ( known as Blackrock Depths ) .

Guardian Aegwynn , Medivh 's mother , went rogue from the Council of Tirisfal , believing they had drifted too far from their mission to defend Azeroth from the Burning Legion . The Council refused to let Aegwynn run wild with the power of the Guardian and sent the magus Nielas Aran to bring her to heel . Instead of turning over the renegade Aegwynn , Nielas began to see the Council 's political machinations for himself . Together , the two mages devised a plan for Aegwynn 's successor to be free of the Council 's influence . Aegwynn passed her Tirisfalen powers down to her and Aran 's child . He was named Medivh , which means " Keeper of Secrets " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter with the Dark Titan Sargeras had left her soul tainted with his essence . This taint also found its way into her child where it lay dormant for years . Nielas Aran took up a position in Stormwind as the court 's conjurer so he could train Medivh far from the Council 's influence . Aegwynn went into hiding shortly after Medivh 's birth . <p> Medivh grew up with his close friends Anduin Lothar and Llane Wrynn . The trio grew close and caused much mischief in their youth . Their misadventures offered a reprieve from Aran 's hard training and stern upbringing . On the eve of his fourteenth birthday , the full power of the Guardian manifested within Medivh , killing his father and forcing him into a coma that lasted years . <p> He awoke to a world changed . Anduin Lothar was a knight in Stormwind 's army while Llane Wrynn had taken the throne . Both Medivh 's power and Sargeras 's darkness woke with him . He became reclusive and mysterious , withdrawing to the magical tower of Karazhan . For years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moroes and his resident cook . Secretly , Medivh fulfilled the role of Guardian , banishing demons and protecting Azeroth . He grew to resent his burden , falling prey to Sargeras 's influence .

This time , Medivh was free of both Sargeras and the burden of the Guardian 's mantle . He made his return in the guise of " The Prophet " , a mysterious stranger who appeared just as the Scourge threat was mounting . The Prophet urged King Terenas to flee Lordaeron and sail west across the sea . King Terenas thought him to be a madman and ignored his words . He ran into the same sentiment as he appeared to Prince Arthas and Archmage Antonidas as well . All was not lost , however , as Jaina Proudmoore heeded the advice .

Though Medivh has n't been physically seen since the events at Hyjal , his presence is still felt . <h> Medivh 's Legacy <p> Robbed of youth by his power and robbed of sanity by Sargeras , Medivh 's legacy is a tragic one .

Interestingly enough , his schemes to bring the orcs to Azeroth might have saved it in the end , as the orcs were essential in stopping Archimonde . We have n't seen the last of Medivh.

The city was invaded and destroyed by the orcs after they became corrupted by drinking demon blood . The orcs would go on to invade Azeroth through the Dark Portal , starting the First War . Following the orc 's defeat in the Second War , their then-chieftain Ner'zhul attempted to open several portals to other worlds . The power released from the ritual tore Draenor apart , turning it into Outland as we know it today .

The Sha'tar are a powerful faction of naaru led by A'dal , and they came to Outland in their quest to stop the Burning Legion .

The naaru made their home in the Terrace of Light at the center of the middle tier , while the lowest tier was home to hundreds of refugees displaced by the Burning Legion , along with various shops and vendors . <p> Throughout the Burning Crusade expansion , Shattrath City would serve as the central hub for Horde and Alliance heroes in their fight against the Burning Legion and its allies .

If you have any suggestions or feedback , you can leave a comment below or tweet @PrestonDvorak . <h> Pets Needed <p> Below are all of the pets I used , as well as notes about what abilities are most important in case you have similar pets available . When completing the challenge version of the dungeon , you wo n't be allowed to heal or revive pets , so having additional backups besides when I have listed can be a nice safety net . <h> Aquatic <p> Just about any aquatic pet with Surge and a strong healing ability will work here . However , I had the most luck with the below pet because it also has a damage reduction buff . <h> Beast <p> Any beasts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarm abilities that provide a damage buff like Hunting Party should work here . You should also have two beasts with high health to use as filler on the last boss , although I never had to use the two filler pets in combat so it 's not too important what they are . <p> For last boss filler I used : Smolderweb Hatchling , Argi - these can be anything you want if you have a Magical Crawdad or similar pet , as explained in the strategy for the Final Stage . <h> Flying <p> Most of these flying pets are used as filler to clean up misc pets after boss fights . You can really substitute them for any pets with swarm type abilities that provide a damage buff , such as Falcosaur Swarm ! , Swarm , Flock , Stampede , or Murder . <h> Magic <h> Mechanical <p> Any mechanical pet with mechanical abilities should work here , however , the Iron Starlette is very powerful for its intended fights , so I recommend getting at least one if you can . I tried both a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P/P ) Iron Starlette , and only the high attack version worked for the strategy . It 's possible a balanced ( B/* ) version will work as well , but maximum attack power is the best . <p> You should switch your starting pet to counter whatever enemy pet you 'll be clicking on to start the fight , but besides that these fights do n't really require any special ability combinations or strategies and should play out like normal wild pet battles . It 's possible to get unlucky and face three of the same enemy pet during these fights . If this happens , make sure you leave your Darkmoon Tonk alive with a decent amount of health , it 's the only pet you 'll be using later . <h> Stage 2 - Son of Skum <h> Enemy Pets <p> During this stage you 'll be fighting against a single Boss pet accompanied by two random pets from Stage 1 . <h> Team and Strategy <p> For these three Elites and their companion pets , I highly recommend an Iron Starlette . You 'll be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean up the other pets , I used a Magic pet and another Mechanical pet to serve as a backup in case my Iron Starlette died early . Having a second Iron Starlette is a great insurance policy , but I did n't need a second one personally . <p> Note : On the second serpent , you want your Iron Starlette to die before switching to another pet to trigger the Mechanical passive effect . That way when the fight ends the health it gains gives it more overall health than if you switched early . <p> With the Elite dead , switch to either other pet depending on the enemy pet 's family , the fights should play out like normal wild pet battles . Use Enchanted Lantern against Beast types , or the Darkmoon Zeppelin against Flying and Aquatic types . Do n't use your Iron Starlette for anything besides the serpents , you want it to retain as much health as possible . 21074 @qwx221074 <h> Stage 4 - Call of the Serpent <h> Enemy Pets <p> During this stage , you 'll be fighting against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Stage 1 . <p> These fights do n't have any particularly tight ability requirements , you just want to maximize damage on the Growing Ectoplasm . These pets are only used for this fight , so do n't worry about any of them dying . <h> Enemy Pets <h> Team and Strategy <p> Defeating this boss hinges pretty heavily on having a high-health Aquatic pet with a strong aquatic damage dealing ability , a heal , and a damage reduction buff for itself . If you can meet those criteria , the other two pets you bring along wo n't even be necessary . 21071 @qwx221071 21067 @qwx221067 21070 @qwx221070 21076 @qwx221076 
@@23353233 @3353233/ <h> Character Corner : Odyn <p> Welcome to Character Corner , where we dive into the life and exploits of various lore figures in the Warcraft universe . With this week 's release of Trial of Valor , it 's a great time to discuss the arrogant and mighty Titanic Keeper , Odyn . <p> Millennia ago , the Titanic Pantheon discovered a world-soul across the cosmos . They named this nascent titan " Azeroth " , believing Azeroth to have potential to overcome even Sargeras . When they finally reached Azeroth , they discovered the darkness and taint of the Old Gods working to corrupt the world-soul . The Pantheon 's sheer physical size made fighting the Old Gods head-on too risky , for they could possibly kill Azeroth in the process . Instead , they created an army of metal and earthen constructs , known as the Titan-forged . To lead their war effort and watch over Azeroth , several titan-forged were elevated above the others and blessed by the Pantheon , becoming known as the Keepers . Aman-thul himself imbued Odyn with a portion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Black Empire of the Old Gods . The war escalated when the Old Gods enlisted the elemental lords to sow more chaos . Odyn and Tyr worked together to push the Lord of Fire , Ragnaros , back to his realm , their metal bodies protecting them from the onslaught of magma and flame . Eventually , Ragnaros and the other elemental lords were sealed in their own realms , removing them from the fight . <p> Even with the elemental lords vanquished , the Keepers had much more work to do . The Old God Yogg-Saron and his C'Thraxxi army were beginning to overwhelm the titan-forged . Odyn commanded his fellow Keeper Loken to cast a huge illusion spell , compelling the C'Thraxxi to see each other as the enemies . Odyn made his attack amidst the confusion , thwarting the C'Thraxxi and sealing Yogg-Saron beneath the earth . For his heroic achievements , the Pantheon named Odyn the Prime Designate - the being in charge of the titan-forged and keeping Azeroth safe . The city of Ulduar was built on top of Yogg-Saron 's prison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Empire toppled , the Keepers retreated into their temples and refuges , growing apathetic . When the monstrous dragon Galakrond rose to power and began threatening life on Azeroth , only Tyr stood against him . With the assistance of five proto-dragons , Galakrond was defeated . Only then were the Keepers roused and ventured back into the world . Tyr argued that the five proto-dragons had proven themselves capable stewards of Azeroth , and they should be blessed with the Titans ' powers . All of the Keepers agreed , except Odyn . He believed that he should have the final say , as he was the Prime Designate . Despite his protests , the other Keepers went ahead with their idea , imbuing the proto-dragons with power and creating the first Dragon Aspects . Seeing as how all but one of those same Dragon Aspects have threatened Azeroth 's safety over the years , perhaps Odyn had a point . <p> An angry Odyn refused to turn over Azeroth 's defense to lesser beings . He decided to form his own army and train them apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known as the Halls of Valor , a floating sky fortress . Odyn asked his adopted daughter , the titan-forged sorceress Helya , to help him . Helya used her vast power to break off a section of Ulduar and raise it to the sky . <p> For his army , Odyn wanted to train only those he saw as worthy and battle-tested : the vrykul . He would bless the vrykul with new metal bodies , becoming the Valarjar . The last piece of his plan required a way a get the souls of the fallen vrykul up to the Halls of Valor . Odyn came up with the Val'kyr : winged specters that would ferry worthy souls to him . These Val'kyr would forever be enthralled to this task , never moving on or finding peace . Unsurprisingly , there were no volunteers to become Val'kyr . Helya thought that plan ludicrous , and threatened to return the Halls of Valor to Ulduar unless Odyn abandoned the Val'kyr idea . <p> Never one to suppress his anger , Odyn painfully transformed Helya into the first Val'kyr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bringing souls to the Halls of Valor . For thousands of years , her anger and resentment seethed . In the mean time , Keeper Loken fell prey to Yogg-Saron 's whispers and was descending into madness . Loken devised a way to get rid of the other Keepers , but knew he needed to move against Odyn first . Loken first granted Helya her freedom , then gave her an idea . Using the same type of spell that banished the elemental lords , Helya sealed Odyn and his Valarjar inside the Halls of Valor , where he 's been for ages . <p> Odyn managed to find a way to leave the halls in the guise of a simple vrykul , Havi . Havi is typically accompanied by the huge ravens Huginn and Muninn . In Norse mythos , Odin also has two ravens named Huginn and Muninn .

This is important because there are n't  enough indicators in Grid by default to cover all of the pertinent information . I also like being able to put them in any location as opposed to only the corners . <h> GridStatusAurasExt <p> While Grid allows you to add your own buffs or debuffs to track by default , this plugin allows you to create custom groups and behaviors , keeping things a little more organized . <h> GridManaBars <p> This simply adds power bars to Grid boxes .

@@23353238 @3353238/ <p> Wyrmrest Temple was created by the titanic watchers shortly after blessing the Dragon Aspects with their power . It would go on to serve as a meeting place for the Aspects as well as the home of the Wyrmrest Accord , an alliance of the red , bronze , green , and black dragonflights who sought to stop the blue dragonflight 's abuse of magic . The Aspects who made up this alliance were Alexstrasza ( red ) , Nozdormu ( bronze ) , Ysera ( green ) , and Neltharion ( black ) . <p> The Dragon Aspects began their lives as mortal proto-drakes who united against Galakrond . Once the proud progenitor of all dragon-kind , Galakrond had fallen victim to an unknown force and began cannibalizing the other proto-drakes to drain their life-essence . Alongside Watcher Tyr , the would-be Dragon Aspects defeated Galakrond over a series of battles . Recognizing their resolve and teamwork , Tyr worked with the other Watchers to imbue the Dragons Aspects with a portion of their power . He then worked on constructing what would become known as Wyrmrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragons return to the area around the tower when they are nearing death , in the hopes of imbuing the lands with their essence . <p> First appearing in game during the Wrath of the Lich King expansion , Wyrmrest Temple is not far from the resting place of Galakrond in what is now the Dragonblight zone in Northrend . The temple looks like most titan structures and stands out against the mostly-flat , white backdrop of Dragonblight . At the very top of the tower sat the Orb of Unity , a purely symbolic reminder of the Dragon Aspects allegiance to each other . Most impressive is what sits underneath the Temple , a large , hollowed-out room called the Chamber of Aspects . It 's believed this is where the Aspects would meet in secret , as there are portals to each of the dragonflight 's Sanctums inside the Chamber . These Sanctums are unique to each dragonflight and exist outside of space and time , making them accessible to the Aspects at any time and from anywhere . <p> During the Wrath of the Lich King expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twilight dragonflight . With the Aspect 's forces weakened from their war with the blue dragonflight , they called upon Azeroth 's heroes to defeat the twilight dragons . As you would expect , the heroes were successful and the Sanctums were once again in the hands of the Aspects . This is the state Wyrmrest Temple appears in if you were to visit it in game today . Everything beyond this point took place in lore outside the game or separate instances in the game . <p> Leading up to the Cataclysm expansion , the Aspects called a meeting at Wyrmrest Temple , the first one where the blue dragonflight was n't in attendance . The meeting was interrupted by an attack from the twilight dragonflight , during which it was thought Alexstrasza 's consort had betrayed the Wyrmrest Accord . In a fit of rage , Alexstrasza shattered the Orb of Unity and all members of the Wyrmrest Accord fled the Temple . It was later revealed there was no betrayal , and that it was all a ploy by the twilight dragonflight to get the Aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aspects after the battle , and with his encouragement they once again united and took back Wyrmrest Temple . <p> During the Cataclysm expansion , the Temple would become the focal point for the final battle against the former-Aspect Deathwing in the Dragon Soul raid instance . Horde and Alliance heroes cleared out the area surrounding the Temple before ascending it and taking to the air in their gunships to face Deathwing himself . As before , the heroes were successful and Deathwing was killed . <p> Azeroth 's heroes were also afforded the opportunity to see a world in which Deathwing was not defeated , as part of the End Time instance located in the Caverns of Time . Inside the instance , you can see Deathwing sitting atop a destroyed Wyrmrest Temple and visit each of the dragonflight 's Dragonshires , wherein you fight echoes of some of Azeroth 's most notable lore figures . <p> Having put all of their power into the Dragon Soul used to defeat Deathwing , the Dragon Aspects were returned to their mortal state . They met once again at Wyrmrest Temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling it had served its purpose . Kalecgos would later call a second meeting where he used an artifact from Tyr himself to remind the dragons what they had been through and what their duties were . Inspired once again , the Aspects agreed to continue to help protect Azeroth even as mortals , using Wyrmrest Temple as their base of operations . <p> The Wyrmrest Temple itself is unlikely to see any direct action in the near future , however with the Dragon Aspects still working to protect Azeroth as mortals , it has surely become an even more tantalizing target for those who wish to destroy the planet .

@@23353241 @3353241/ <p> Spanning between the two Alliance cities of Ironforge and Stormwind , the Deeprun Tram provides transport under mountainous terrain and water that would otherwise take days to traverse ( or minutes of in-game time ) . <p> Following the conflict between the Alliance and Old Horde during the Second War , the kingdom of Stormwind was badly in need of supplies and labor . King Magni Bronzebeard and his dwarves were eager to lend their help . However , it was n't long before Magni became frustrated with how long it took to move men and supplies through the mountains . He needed a better solution , so he enlisted the help of High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque of Gnomeregan . <p> Together , they drafted plans for an underground tram system that would link the two cities and expedite the movement of supplies and men . Gelbin went as far as to build a scale model out of pie tins to show off the great tram system . This model is supposedly viewable in game , inside Sector 17 area of Gnomeregan ( I was unable to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was n't long before the tram system was up and running , bolstering cooperation and building a permanent connection between the two cities . <p> Since World of Warcraft 's release , the tram has remained relatively unchanged . It is accessed on the Ironforge side through the gnome district of Tinker Town . In Stormwind , it is accessed through the Dwarven District , which sprung up around the construction of the tram . <p> Besides offering transportation , the Deeprun Tram plays host to two quests . In the first quest , players meet with a gnome named Monty to complete Deeprun Rat Roundup . He provides a special Rat Catcher 's Flute to help you persuade rats in the tram to follow you . After returning to Monty with your conga-line of rats , he rewards you with a crate of mystery meat ( which is probably not made from rats ) . You take this crate to his brother , Nipsy , who rewards you with some Deeprun Rat Kabob- ( turns out the meat was probably made from rats ) . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , you can sometimes find a mythical beast named Nessy . Nessy is a threshadon boss who is inaccessible to players , and an obvious reference to the Loch Ness Monster . <p> Leading up to the Cataclysm expansion , Magni 's daughter , Moira Thaurissan , returned to Ironforge to claim the throne after her father was petrified during an elemental-ritual gone wrong . While she ruled Ironforge only briefly , she did so with an iron fist . She barred transportation to and from the city , including closing the Deeprun Tram . This is the only time the tram has ceased operation since it was built . In an attempt to end her short reign , Varian Wrynn had SI:7 agents infiltrate Ironforge through the tram tunnel . With the tram shutdown , they had to walk the entire distance .

It has already stood the test of time and avoided the wrath of many enemies of Azeroth , perhaps to their own peril .

@@23353243 @3353243/ <h> Patch 7.2.5 Restoration Druid Changes , Updates , and Overview <p> With Patch 7.2.5 coming on June 13 , 2017 , I wanted to compile a list of changes that are affecting Restoration Druids . As usual , you can tweet @PrestonDvorak or leave a comment at the bottom of the page with any questions or feedback . <p> There are quest and content spoilers ahead , proceed with caution if you want to avoid them ! <h> Table of Contents <h> Official Patch 7.2.5 Survival Guide <h> Spell Changes <p> A few Restoration Druid spells received changes or updates in patch 7.2.5 . <p> Most of our healing spells received a 4% decrease in effectiveness . <p> This sounds scary , but overall 4% is n't all that high . Blizzard is attempting to dial back Restoration Druid 's power without making them too weak . While playing with the 4% nerf on the PTR , I did n't notice any difference . In fact , I did n't even realize there was a nerf until someone asked me about it on Twitter ! <p> Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This change will help anyone who does world quests and other content while in Restoration spec , as well as make the damage we can contribute during raids and Mythic+ 's even more effective . <p> Even with the decrease , Cultivation should still end up being the default talent choice , but it opens up things a little more on fights that my see a benefit from other talents in the tier . We 'll have to wait to see how logs from live servers play out , as well as what effect the new legendary items have . <p> Our mastery now increases the healing done by the Mark of Shifting artifact trait . <p> This is a nice little boost for PvP , or if you find yourself in Restoration spec running away from enemies that were too difficult ! <h> Player Versus Player <p> There are also several PvP-specific changes to spells and honor talents . Keep in mind , I 'm not a highly competitive PvP'er , so some of my theories on the changes may be wrong . I 'm always open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resto Druid 's ability to respond to heavy single-target focus by making Ironbark less potent and usable less often . The new effect still gives the possibility of reducing damage by peeling melee away , but it 's much less consistent . <p> Combined with the other change above , this makes the Healing Touch cast time reduction situation a lot less confusing by simply allowing the reduction from one talent . <p> Revitalize has been redesigned : Rejuvenation ( and Rejuvenation ( Germination ) ) grant the target 2 stacks of Revitalize . Revitalize will heal the target for 2x spell power and increase the duration of Rejuvenation or Rejuvenation ( Germination ) by 3 seconds ( whichever has the lowest remaining duration ) . <p> This change makes Revitalize slightly less powerful but still a viable counter when facing a lot of melee or if you prefer not to use Healing Touch with the Nourish talent . <h> Legendary Items <p> Some existing legendary items are receiving small changes alongside the new legendary items being added . <h> New Legendary Items <p> This ring simply gives you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the PTR , I expect this ring to be of average power . It 'll be something you may like if you enjoy the Soul of the Forest playstyle , or if a boss encounter can make use of the buffed heals consistently . It also synergizes pretty well with the T20 2-set bonus , assuming you 're reducing the cooldown of your Swiftmend consistently . Overall , it 'll be an interesting legendary to watch once more logs are available from live servers . <p> This helmet gives your Wild Growth a chance to grant you Tree of Life for 12-seconds , with the Tree of Life functioning exactly how the talent does ( increased healing , extra targets for Wild Growth , instant Regrowth , etc ) . I expect this to be another average legendary item . I was n't able to test it on the PTR during fights with consistent Wild Growth usage , but I imagine it could be a situational legendary for fights that have you using Wild Growth nearly on cooldown . The Tree of Life buff lasts long enough to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets , giving it an even larger benefit on fights that need Wild Growth constantly . As with the other new legendary , it 'll be interesting to see how things play out when more logs are available from live servers . <h> Changed Legendary Items <p> Aman'Thul 's received a change to the maximum number of seconds a Rejuvenation can be extended , from 15-seconds to 9-seconds . This change is n't very noticeable other than when you 're pre-HoTing in preparation for damage , making it a little harder to get Rejuvenations on everyone . Overall , I did n't make any changes to my play style and the shoulders still seemed effective . This change just dials back how insanely powerful they were . As with the other items , I 'll be watching live logs closely to see how the shoulders perform with the change . 21074 @qwx221074 <h> Tier 20 Set Items and Bonuses <p> While not coming immediately in 7.2.5 , a new tier set will be released with the Tomb of Sargeras raid on June 20 , 2017 . This particular set is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raid in Burning Crusade , with several re-colors , high-res textures , and special effects on the Mythic version . <p> The set bonuses are also quite good . Maybe not quite as easy to use as the T19 bonuses from Nighthold , but if you 're already used to using Efflorescence and Swiftmend , you should n't need to adjust your play style much . <p> The 4-set bonus is a very large increase to group healing if enough of the group can be inside Efflorescence . With my limited experience with Tomb of Sargeras encounters , this does n't seem like it 's going to be an issue . <h> New Playable Content <p> In addition to content specific to Restoration Druids , there is a ton of new playable content being added to the game . I wo n't have detailed explanations here , but I wanted to at least mention everything . <h> Tomb of Sargeras <p> The Tomb of Sargeras is a nine boss raid instance coming on June 20 , 2017 .

@@23353262 @3353262/ <h> Overwatch <h> Overview and Tips for New Players <p> Below you 'll find general information on Overwatch as well as tips when it comes to playing the game and building an effective team . This information is geared towards new or returning players , and may not apply to high-level ranked , competitive play . Feedback is appreciated , you can tweet @PrestonDvorak or leave a comment at the bottom of any guide page . <h> Map Types <p> Overwatch consists of four map types . It 's important to understand the differences between these types as some heroes will perform better than others depending on the objective and whether you 're attacking or defending . <h> Escort <p> On Escort maps , the attacking team must move a payload to its destination within the time limit while the defending team tries to stop them . Along the route , there are several checkpoints that will extend the attacking team 's remaining time . <p> To move the payload , players from the attacking team must be standing near it , and the more players standing near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team players are standing near the payload , it will slowly move backwards , up to the last checkpoint . At any point if there are players from both teams standing near the payload , it will not move , even if there is only one player from one team and six from the other . <p> It becomes increasingly more difficult for the attacking team as the payload moves closer to the end because the defending team 's spawn point is closer to the final destination . <p> The meter at the top of the screen on Escort maps shows the time remaining in the round , your objective ( stop or move the payload ) , and the progress of the payload . On the progress bar , you see the current location of the payload , which direction it 's moving and how many players are moving it , as well as all of the check points along the path ( denoted by the white markers ) . <h> Assault <p> On Assault maps , the attacking team works to capture a series of objective points within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The objective points are denoted by large blue or red squares on the ground ( blue for the defending team , and red for the attacking team ) . Each objective the attacking team captures will give them additional time to capture the others . <p> If the attacking team is standing on the point with no defending players present , the progress circle will begin filling up , and when it fills up completely the objective is captured . The defending team can pause the capture by also standing in the marked area , and can revert some of the progress by standing in the area while no attacking team players are present . <p> Again , it becomes increasingly difficult for the attacking team to capture the final objectives because the defending team 's spawn point is closer . <p> The meter at the top of the screen on Assasult maps shows the time remaining in the round , your objective ( attack or defend ) , and the capture progress of the current active point . Around the progress circle , you 'll see white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress bar passes one of these checkpoints , it can not be reduced any lower by the defending team . Finally , the small white circle at the bottom shows the number of enemy players currently contesting the point . <h> Hybrid <p> Hybrid maps combine the Assault and Escort mechanics . The teams must first attack or defend an objective point . If the point is captured by the attacking team , a payload is released , at which point the payload must be moved or stopped , as explained above , to win the match . <p> The meter on Hybrid maps combines the same elements from Assault and Escort maps . <h> Control <p> Control maps function similarly to Assault maps , except there is only one objective point that both teams are fighting over at the same time . While a team controls a point , their progress bar fills up , and the first team to reach 100% will win that round . The final winner is the first team to win two rounds . You can think of this mode as being like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Control maps is divided into two sides , one for the blue team , and the other for the red team ( your own team always shows up as blue ) . The white circles on the outer edges of the meter show how many wins each team has when they 're filled in . Next , the two rectangles on either side show the victory progress for each team . Finally , the inner circle shows which team currently controls the point as well as the capture progress if the enemy team is currently capturing the point . The small circle at the bottom shows the number of enemy players currently capturing the point . <h> Hero Types <p> There are four types of heroes in Overwatch : Offense , Defense , Tank , and Support . <h> Offense <p> Offense heroes specialize in dealing damage on the front lines or behind enemy lines . They have moderate health pools , self-healing , and high-mobility . <h> Defense <p> Defense heroes specialize in controlling sections of the map and slowing down enemy heroes . While they can deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they can setup and stay in one area . They have higher health than Offense heroes , but much lower mobility , and often less direct damage . <h> Tank <p> Tank heroes specialize in defending their team from damage , helping to split up the enemy team so they 're more easily killed , and staying on objective points . They have high health pools , defense abilities , and usually low-mobility . <h> Support <p> Support heroes specialize in healing friendly players and hindering enemy players through various buffs or debuffs . They are suitable for both attacking and defending . They have small health pools and low mobility . Protecting support heroes is key , and if you 're playing a support hero you should usually stay behind the rest of the players on your team . <h> General Tips <p> These tips apply to most heroes on most maps , and while they can seem obvious after reading them , they 're often forgotten during a match . <h> HUD Overview <h> Do n't forget your melee attack button <p> Every hero , except Reinhardt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by default ) . While melee attacks are n't particularly powerful , they can be great for finishing off an enemy if they 're low and you would have to reload your weapon otherwise . <h> When defending , defend the objective , do n't attack the enemy team 's spawn point <p> When your team is defending , it 's important to remember that your objective is n't to push the enemy team back into their spawn point . While it can be a fun display of power to do so , it leaves you easily open to a counter attack and the long run back if you 're killed . You should hang out on the control point or the payload , or at the nearest convenient choke point , and wait for the enemy team . <h> When attacking , move in as a team <p> When your team is attacking , chances are you 'll be trying to push through a choke point or into the enemy team 's established defenses . The worst thing you can do is run in one or two at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move in as a large clump , you want to make sure everyone is pushing in at the same time through whatever method their hero is best at . Some will follow the tank on the front-line , while others will move around behind the enemy team to further disrupt them . <h> Team Composition <p> Team composition is a huge strategy piece in Overwatch . Some heroes are strong on certain maps , or while fighting against specific heroes , or when paired with another hero on their team . Despite how complex it can get , there are some general rules I like to follow to help my team 's success . <h> Have at least one tank and one support hero who can heal <p> Tank heroes excel at getting close to the enemy and taking a lot of damage , and they can help split the team up and allow the weaker heroes to be picked off while also protecting the weaker heroes on their own team . Having a support hero that can heal will help give your team the ability to stay in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no healing . <h> Have no more than one Sniper , and preferably none when attacking <p> Snipers tend to hang back and pick off targets from afar , which sounds great , but not so much in an objective-based game like Overwatch . While a single good sniper can make a huge difference , having two or three on your attacking team is never good . Arguments could be made for having multiple snipers while defending , but as a general rule it 's still not worth it . <p> An exception to this rule is Ana , while she is a sniper , she 's also a support hero that can heal and follow closely behind the team to great effect . <p> Another hero that complicates this rule is Pharah . While not technically a sniper , her play style does n't usually support sitting on an objective , but rather flying above it or behind the enemy team . This means in many ways she does count as a sniper , but is still more flexible than traditional snipers . If there 's already a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sniper . <h> If your team is having trouble pushing into an objective , and you only have one tank , consider switching so you have a second tank <p> Pushing into objective points or passed choke points is the bread and butter of being on the attacking team in Overwatch . If you 're finding your team is having trouble breaking through the defenses , and you only have one tank hero on your team , consider switching to a second tank . Having a second tank gives your team another large , hard to kill target to keep the enemy team busy while your offense heroes do their work . The exception to this advice is if you 're playing a support hero and switching would leave your team without a support hero . <h> If your team is dying a lot despite going into team fights as a cohesive group , consider switching to a second support hero . <p> Similar to the above advice , having a second support hero , especially one that can heal , can give your team the longevity it needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is if you 're playing a tank hero and switching would leave your team without a tank . 21071 @qwx221071 21067 @qwx221067 21070 @qwx221070 21076 @qwx221076 
@@23353263 @3353263/ <h> Overwatch <h> Recommended Heroes for New Players <p> While you can play and learn any hero you 'd like , there are some that I consider easier to learn while still contributing to your team 's performance . With team composition being so important , I 've included one hero for each role . I highly recommend learning each of the roles so you 're comfortable filling in any spot the team needs . You 'll also be better at the game overall by learning how different heroes and roles function . As with the rest of this guide , this information is intended for new or returning players and may not necessarily apply to high-level ranked , competitiva play . Feedback is appreciated , you can tweet @PrestonDvorak or leave a comment at the bottom of any guide page . <h> Offense - Soldier : 76 <p> If you 've ever played an FPS game , Soldier : 76 will feel incredibly familiar . Playing him should feel straightforward and allow you to focus on the finer points of each map and what it 's like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left-click ) <p> His primary ability is a Pulse Rifle which functions just as you would expect an assault rifle to . You can hold down left-click to fire it fully automatic , which is quite accurate at close and medium range . At long range , you can maintain accuracy by firing in short bursts instead . Whatever the case , you can expect all of the bullets to go where your crosshairs are . This is because the weapon is hitscan , meaning there is technically no travel time between when you fire the bullets and they hit their target . <h> Secondary Ability ( right-click ) <p> Soldier 's secondary ability is Helix Rockets which fires a set of three rockets at whatever location you 're targeting . These rockets deal heavy damage and travel in a straight line , making them easy and intuitive to aim . They do travel slowly , so aiming ahead of moving targets will be necessary if they 're far away . You can damage yourself with your own rockets , so be careful when firing them at close range . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability allows you to Sprint , greatly increasing your movement speed until you turn it off , however , you ca n't use your primary or secondary abilities while sprinting . <h> E Ability ( E key ) <p> His E ability will drop a Biotic Field which will heal you and any friendly players who stand in it . This is great to help keep yourself and your team alive during a fight . You should be using this ability any time it is off cooldown when your team is fighting . Even if you 're not missing any health , someone nearby probably is . <h> Ultimate Ability ( Q key ) <p> When you activate Soldier 's ultimate ability , you will automatically lock onto targets in front of you when firing with your primary ability . You can influence which target you lock onto by putting your crosshairs near them , this is useful when you need to take out a high-priority target such as an enemy support hero . The ultimate ability will not cause bullets to go through walls , and some tanks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abilities . <h> Defense - Mei <p> Mei excels at controlling enemies and slowing them down to allow her team to pick them off . Playing her will allow you to learn the choke points of each map and what it 's like to fight up close . <h> Primary Ability ( left-click ) <p> Her primary ability is an Endothermic Blaster , which is just a fancy name for a " freeze gun . " It 's a short-range weapon that sprays ice-cold water , freezing enemies if you hit them enough times consecutively . While frozen , they 'll be unable to move or use abilities , including defensive abilities and ultimates . <h> Secondary Ability ( right-click ) <p> Mei 's secondary ability will shoot a highly-accurate icicle at medium to long range . You should use this ability on frozen enemies to shoot them in the head for bonus damage , even at close range . A headshot from an icicle can kill most heroes after being frozen and some weaker heroes even without being frozen . <h> Shift Ability ( shift key ) <p> Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making her immune to all damage while healing herself . While you 'll usually use this ability to save yourself , you can also use it to shield friendly players from damage or to block enemy players in a doorway . <h> E Ability ( E key ) <p> Mei 's E ability creates a huge ice wall at the targeted location . This ability is incredibly versatile and can be used to block enemies , block damage and enemy ultimates , or even boost yourself or friendly players up to a higher location . Most commonly , you 'll place the ice wall in a doorway to either completely block or split up the enemy team . <h> Ultimate Ability ( Q key ) <p> Her ultimate ability throws out a weather-control drone , which has a small arc like a grenade and can be lobbed far away if needed . When the drone hits the ground , it begins freezing all enemies in a large area . Depending on how close you threw the drone , you can run in and help it freeze enemies with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around quickly and headshot them with your secondary ability . Using her ultimate is a little tricky , but generally you 'll want to use it in the middle of a team fight directly on the location you 're fighting on . This forces the enemy team to retreat and spread out , or get frozen . It also works great if the enemy team is pinned down in a narrow choke point and will have a tough time running away from the freeze effect . 21074 @qwx221074 <h> Tank - Orisa <p> Orisa is great at shielding and buffing her allies while forcing enemies out of hiding . Playing her should feel similar to Soldier : 76 but with more defensive abilities . You 're able to throw out a small barrier to help your team pass through chokepoints , as well as give yourself a powerful personal shield to help spearhead attacks . You 're also able to pull enemies out of hiding or pull them back from running away , allowing your offense and defense teammates to get kills more easily . <h> Primary Ability ( left-click ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine gun with slow-moving projectiles . Each individual bullet deals a low amount of damage , but the high rate of fire allows Orisa to output large amounts of damage , especially up close . You can use her Cannon to keep snipers suppressed from a distance or to damage enemy barriers . <h> Secondary Ability ( right-click ) <p> Her secondary ability is the Gravitron Charge , an orb that travels slowly in the direction you 're aiming and slows enemies near it . You can active the orb by right-clicking again to pull affected enemies towards the orb ( the orb will also activate automatically if it hits a solid object like the ground or a wall ) . You can tell which enemies are within range of the orb by the green lines connecting them to the orb . This ability is great for grouping up enemies for other players ultimate abilities , pulling enemies off of their positions , or even pulling them off the map in some cases . I would make liberal use of this ability to throw off enemy positioning and movement as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The shift key ability is Fortify , it reduces the damage Orisa takes by 50% and makes her immune to movement impairing effects ( such as slows and stuns ) . This ability can be used offensively to help your team push through a chokepoint or onto an objective , or it can be used defensively to get away from a bad situation . You can still use your other abilities while Fortify is active . <h> E Ability ( E key ) <p> Orisas E ability launches a Protective Barrier device in a shallow arc that creates a barrier when it lands . This allows for more dynamic barrier positioning over other heroes barriers . As you would guess , you should try to position the barrier between you and the enemy team , especially their long-range heroes and turrets . <h> Ultimate Ability ( Q key ) <p> Her ultimate ability is a Supercharger , which is a small , stationary pylon that buffs the damage of nearby friendly heroes by 50% . The pylon can be destroyed , so you should try to position it behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to block it from being killed . Its best used when your team needs to push through a chokepoint or get to an objective . <h> Support - Lucio <p> Lucio is unique for a healer because instead of actively healing friendly players , he passively heals nearby players that are in line of sight for a small amount . Playing him should help make you aware of friendly player 's health bars , while also not penalizing you too much if you do n't see someone out of your field of view . Playing him will also make you aware of the sound and movement cues for other heroes ' ultimate abilities , as Lucio 's ultimate can counter many of them when timed properly . <h> Primary Ability ( left-click ) <p> Lucio 's primary ability is his Sonic Amplifier , which fires a stream of sonic projectiles when used . These projectiles travel rather slowly , but deal a moderate amount of damage . With Lucio 's healing being mostly passive , you can be firing off this ability almost constantly as extra damage . <h> Secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound wave that knocks back enemies a short distance in front of him and deals a small amount of damage . This ability is great to push tank and offensive heroes away , messing up their aim or their positioning . You can also push enemies off the edge of some maps if positioned properly . <h> Shift Ability ( shift key ) <p> Lucio 's shift ability allows you to change his passive effect between a speed boost or healing , both of which will affect nearby friendly players inside the yellow or green circle around you . In most cases , you 'll want this to be set to healing , however , the speed boost can be great when running to the objective from your spawn room or for avoiding enemy ultimates . Similarly , if your team is already at full health and not taking much damage , you can have your speed boost active to give your team a movement advantage until they begin taking damage . <h> E Ability ( E key ) <p> The E ability will boost whatever your currently selected passive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause your passive healing effect to heal for more for a short time . If the speed boost is active , it causes affected friendly players to move even faster for a short time . Again , you 'll generally use this with the healing buff . You should try to boost your healing when one or more friendly players is missing at least + of their health and you 're actively fighting the enemy team . Try not to use this too often when your unboosted passive healing will be enough to heal someone back up . <h> Ultimate Ability ( Q key ) <p> His ultimate ability provides a massive , temporary barrier to all nearby players when used . This barrier degrades quickly after it is applied , even if the affected player is n't taking damage . It 's best used shortly after you engage the enemy team or if an enemy ultimate is being used and your team ca n't get away . Knowing exactly when to use this will take some practice , but it 's almost always better to wait as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player die in the process . 21071 @qwx221071 21067 @qwx221067 21070 @qwx221070 21076
