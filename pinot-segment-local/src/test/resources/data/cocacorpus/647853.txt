In order to be useful , the heat has to be moved to boilers to make steam . In a CANDU- reactor , heavy water does this job . It is pumped constantly through the fuel channels in the reactor and takes the heat from the fuel bundles up to boilers above the reactor . In the boilers , the heated heavy water heats up ordinary water to make steam . This steam is piped out of the boilers and over to the turbine hall where it drives the huge turbines/generators that make the electricity we use .

@@109595593 @4995593/ <p> A decision to proceed with the DeCew Falls development was reached in 1941 . The decision was influenced by a number of considerations . <p> First , the setbacks during World War II , including the fall of France , which were experienced during the early years of the war , made it evident that the war might last much longer , that Canada would be called upon to speed up the production of munitions and undertake many new industrial tasks , and that as a result the large actual and potential reserves of power which the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario had available at the outbreak of war might not be sufficient should the war last until 1943 or 1944 . <p> Second , the delays experienced in obtaining approvals for the St. Lawrence project made it evident that power from this source could not be relied upon and that Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario must plan immediately for increased power production from any source which could be started immediately , and which would afford relief in strategic areas . <p> Ever since the purchase of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power Commission of Ontario , the development of further power at DeCew Falls was visualized as economically attractive if operated in conjunction with the Niagara River power plants . It was recognized that the agreement respecting the Ogoki and Long Lac diversions would provide the water required for the operation of a new plant at DeCew Falls . The decision to proceed was therefore made . <p> In 1986 the spillways at Port Dalhousie were replaced by the construction of the Haywood Generating Station , owned and operated by the City of St. Catharines Hydroelectric Commission . The original spillways were designed to provide the additional capacity , necessary to carry the increased flow from the DeCew power plants . A channel 215 m ( 700 ft ) long , with control structure and concrete highway bridge was constructed immediately to the east of the navigation channel and Lock No. 1 of the Third Welland Canal . <p> The control structure contained four submerged sluiceways designed to accommodate Taintor gates between piers , with supporting gravity wing walls at each side of the channel .

Unit 1 was brought from the Abitibi Canyon development where it had been a stand-by unit . Being the right size and speed for the DeCew Falls plant , its transfer to the new development effected a considerable saving in time and materials . <p> The necessary water to operate the plant was provided by two diversions in the Lake Nipigon area . <p> The Ogoki River diversion , the construction of which began in November 1940 , was completed and officially opened on July 20 , 1943 .

This reservoir extends southerly through Mojikit Lake into a small lake known as North Summit Lake . From North Summit Lake , a channel was cut through a saddle in the height of land to permit the water to flow into South Summit Lake and then by way of a chain of connected lakes and the Jackfish River to Lake Nipigon . <p> Waboose dam is the largest dam in the project .

It is pumped constantly through the fuel channels in the reactor and takes the heat from the fuel bundles up to boilers above the reactor . In the boilers , the heated heavy water heats up ordinary water to make steam . This steam is piped out of the boilers and over to the turbine hall where it drives the huge turbines/generators that make the electricity we use .

@@109595707 @4995707/ <p> As part of the Lower Mattagami Project , in partnership with the Moose Cree First Nation , a third unit- was added to Little Long GS . <p> HISTORICAL NOTES : <p> The name Mattagami comes from the Indian word meaning " where the waters meet . " <p> In 1958 , the Commission embarked on a plan to develop a number of hydraulic sites in the northeastern part of the province in the James Bay watershed . Extensive field investigation had indicated that approximately 2000 MW of peak capacity would be economical for development there for transmission at extra high voltage to load centres as far as 805 km to the south . Much of the available capacity was located on the Abitibi , Mattagami and Missinaibi Rivers and the Moose River into which they flow . <p> Little Long was one of three stations which the Commission used to develop power potential in a 32 km stretch of the river on either side of Smoky Falls . Ninety per cent of the run-off from the Mattagami River watershed is channelled to the Little Long generating station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new Mattagami River stations , Little Long , Harmon , Kipling and the new Highway 807 were officially opened by the Honourable John P. Robarts , Prime Minister of Ontario on July 21 , 1966 . The ceremony took place at the Harmon station . <p> INTERESTING FACTS : <p> A diversion project with a difference was part of the construction of the Little Long generating station . Instead of diverting extra water into the river to increase the flow of the Mattagami , the Adam Creek diversion project uses a diversion to route water around two downstream projects which were under construction . <p> The 8 km of dykes and dams built to form Little Long 's head pond were the longest ever built by the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario at the time . The unpredictable Mattagami River goes on a real rampage in the spring and the Adam Creek diversion provided an economical method of coping with spring floods . <p> The Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario estimated that the diversion would save about $13,000,000 in reduced sluiceway construction and cofferdam costs at the downstream Mattagami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reducing the tailwater level at all three stations . <p> Many years ago , Adam Creek was a Mattagami channel that did not erode as much as the present riverbed . It became a meandering stream , rising 0.4 km ( 0.25 miles ) from the river and draining a local area . When the water was raised in the 48 km2 ( 30 miles2 ) lake formed by the head pond , water was diverted through the eight-sluice control structure , making the creek into a river channel once more <p> Trees and brush along part of the creek were removed to improve the channel . By gradually stepping up the flow of water , engineers planned to control erosion until the water itself carved a satisfactory diversion channel . The development of this channel was expected to continue for several years . <p> Even filling the massive head pond at Little Long had to be done with extreme caution . Over 100 piezometer wells were sunk on the dry side of the dykes to assess seepage and ground water pressure . Trash booms were installed to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sluices , while hydro crews patrolled the water surface in boats . Two helicopters patrolled Adam Creek to report logjams and chart erosion patterns by radio . <p> The filling operation was timed to coincide with the spring freshet in order to store sufficient water for future operations . But every step of the process had to keep- two factors in mind . Sufficient water had to be let through the Main dam to supply the needs of Smoky Falls generating station , owned by the Spruce Falls Power and Paper Company . At the same time , this flow had to be kept at a level that would not endanger the cofferdams at the Harmon project . <p> Similarly , the Adam Creek diversion was broken in slowly by gradually increasing the flow through the 259 m ( 850 ft ) control structure at the outlet . While all of these factors were being considered , the dykes at Little Long had to be protected against excessive water pressures until they demonstrated their effectiveness . <p> A control office was set up with telephone or radio links to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate operators , and other affected groups . The head pond was gradually raised to an elevation of 195 m ( 640 ft ) and held there to test the dykes . Then it was slowly raised to within a few meters ( feet ) of the 198 m ( 650 ft ) final elevation . <p> The Little Long colony was built in 1960 and included a recreation hall , a four-room school , a supermarket , an office building , rows of neat houses as well as staff headquarters for single employees . A road was built from the Spruce Falls Power and Paper Company 's railway to the campsite and a spur railway line running parallel to the road . <p> The Little Long project was well into black fly country . The Black Fly Song , a truly Canadian folk song , was written and composed by Wade Hemsworth . Mr. Hemsworth was working with a survey party in northern Ontario . He wrote the Black Fly Song while he was doing survey work in eastern Quebec . <p> When the Little Long station went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel engaged in the work of harnessing the Mattagami at Harmon and Kipling . Once all three projects were completed , the colony was dismantled . Key personnel were moved to begin work on the $26 million hydroelectric project near Aubrey Falls , 72 km ( 45 miles ) northwest of Elliot Falls on the Mississagi River . A smaller version of the Little Long camp was established there for 350 workers while many buildings removed from Little Long were erected jigsaw fashion at the new camp . In the six years more than three million meals were served at the camp , including 1,247,400 kg- of meat and nearly 340,200 of flour . <p> The Little Long Express was owned by the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario and operated and maintained by the Spruce Falls Power and Paper Company , on whose rails it ran began operating in the fall of 1960 . In its first year , it hauled more than 18 144 tonnes of equipment and carried approximately 24,000 passengers to and from the project , where more than 600 men worked . For Little Long alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch of the river developed in 1966 " an estimated 54,000 to 63,000 tonnes of material was moved by the train . <p> The Little Long Express got the job done . Seven times a week " once a day " it headed out from the Hydro siding and warehouse built on the western outskirts of Kapuskasing along the Spruce Falls line to Smoky Falls . At 69 km it veered off on more than a 2.4 km of spur line built by Hydro to the station and security office on the west side of the river at Little Long Rapids . Material and equipment aboard was unloaded and transported across to the campsite . <p> One of the biggest pieces of equipment moved in one piece was a 2.5-yard shovel . <p> The trip up took between two and three hours , depending on the weight the 600 hp engine was pulling . If it could n't make the grade the train was split up into two sections , which were taken in one at a time . In addition to its own cars , The Commission rented Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars , loaded with material , were switched over onto the siding at Kapuskasing to save transshipments . Transports were carried " piggyback " on two Commission flatcars brought up from Toronto . <p> Six days a week , the Little Long Express left the Kapuskasing siding at noon . The mail was brought over from the C.N.R. station 1.5 km away , and with two toots on the whistle away she went . On Sunday , it did n't leave until 8 p.m. , giving those who came in on the weekend a chance to enjoy the day in town . Fare was $2.00 round trip and $1.25 one-way . <p> For emergency runs and special travel arrangements , a Chevrolet station wagon fitted with " bogie " wheels ( flanged wheels that fit on the rails ) was used . This unusual car made the trip in a little under two hours , but did n't exceed 56 km an hour because it could jump the track . <p> Including the rolling stock , sidings , spur line and other equipment , The Commission spent more than $200,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared the cost of keeping the Spruce Falls line in good repair . <p> Alternative to the train was construction of an access road from Kapuskasing to the site . Studies showed , however , that utilizing the existing track was more economical than building and maintaining such a road . <p> Forty-three km to the northeast of Little Long , as the crow flies , is Otter Rapids generating station , which was scheduled for initial operation in 1961 , but there was no direct access between the two sites . Buying a train was a rather novel departure for the Commission , but not new . For a number of years it operated a train from the Ontario Northland Railway station at Fraserdale to the Abitibi Canyon Colony , a distance of some 5.6 km . <p> The Little Long train was used for the construction of both the second and third stations on the river ( Harmon and Kipling ) . The access road at the Little Long site was extended to the Smoky Falls , Harmon , and Kipling generating station sites . <p> The Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two mail and baggage cars , three boxcars and the caboose .

The same could be said for the caboose and the other cars . Little Long Express was a welcome sight when it rolled into the campsite . It played a vital role in the program to develop remaining hydraulic resources along the northern frontier. -

@@109595874 @4995874/ <h> Protection of Fish <h> 2015 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT <p> Electricity generating facilities located on waterways can impact fish in a number of ways . At nuclear and thermal stations , the intake of water for equipment cooling purposes can result in fish being impinged on station equipment and fish larvae and eggs can be entrained in the water as it passes through the station . The warmer water returned to the water body also has the potential to impact aquatic organisms and habitat near the station . At hydroelectric stations , the flow of water through the station turbines can result in fish impingement and entrainment . Physical barriers such as dams can prevent the migration of fish . <p> OPG utilizes measures such as a fish ladder , trap and transport programs , stocking programs , barriers and deterring structures , water flow alterations , habitat protection and creation , and station effluent temperature limits to manage and mitigate impacts to fish . OPG also works cooperatively with its regulators , the scientific community , and partner utilities on matters related to fish and fish habitat . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstream of Smoky Falls GS was completed . The spawning shoal is intended to support walleye and lake sturgeon spawning , among other species , and serves as an offsetting measure for habitat disturbances incurred as part of OPG 's Lower Mattagami River hydroelectric project . <p> OPG continued the partnership with the University of Waterloo and Manitoba Hydro to investigate technologies focused on minimizing entrainment risks and safe downstream guidance of lake sturgeon at hydroelectric stations . <p> ReportEditableArea3 <p> - <p> OPG continued the implementation of 11 mitigation plans for lake sturgeon and American eel for hydroelectric stations where these species may be impacted . OPG conducted extensive lake sturgeon spawning and assessment studies and implemented enhanced flow mitigation at a number of stations in northwestern and eastern Ontario . <p> The eel ladder at RH Saunders GS passed 12,380 eels upstream to the upper St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario . OPG 's American eel trap and transport program relocated 1,899 large yellow eels downstream of hydroelectric stations on the St. Lawrence River . <p> OPG participated in an Electric Power Research Institute ( EPRI ) project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at hydroelectric stations , such as behavioural guidance field trials to guide and concentrate migrating American eels . This work forms part of the five-year action plan ( 2013-2017 ) for offsetting turbine mortality of American eels at RH Saunders GS . <p> Studies to better understand the potential impacts of Pickering Nuclear 's thermal effluent on fish species in Lake Ontario were completed and the results indicated the effluent may not be significantly impacting fish habitat . Additional studies will be conducted over the next few years . <p> The fish barrier net installed at Pickering Nuclear 's water intake continued to be an effective fish diversion system and has significantly reduced fish impingement compared to impingement levels before the net was installed in 2009 . There were two days in 2015 when fish , primarily alewife , were able to pass through a split seam in the net and fish were impinged at the station . Immediate action was taken to repair the net .

@@109595902 @4995902/ <p> One day in early Dec. 2015 , a white-winged scoter sat still and alone on the platform of OPG 's northern Abitibi Canyon GS . Darryl Demers , a mechanical tech from the Rock Falls work station , noticed its unusual behaviour and approached it to find the duck immobile and lethargic , yet very much alive . Darryl and his supervisor Doug Chalklin contained the duck and called the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources ( OMNR ) for assistance . <p> The emergency hotline staff working at Toronto Wildlife Centre ( TWC ) were certainly surprised to receive a call from the OMNR about a duck so far north " a 10-hour drive from the wildlife centre . They provided temporary care instructions and planned for its journey ; OPG 's trades representative Jean Archibald transported the scoter to the OMNR office in Cochrane and from there a representative from the OMNR made the long drive to get the scoter the help it so desperately needed . <p> Upon arrival , the scoter was rushed to the assessment room where it was examined by TWC 's expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its upper beak , the duck was in poor condition and- would have surely succumbed to its ailments had it not been found by an empathetic OPG employee . <p> Medical staff provided a variety of therapies including pain management medications , fluids for rehydration and supplemental feeding in order for it to regain its strength . <p> After a week in care , the patient was lively and healthy once again . Volunteer bird-watchers had already been keeping an eye out for other migrating scoters in the area ; luckily , many were spotted at Colonel Sam Smith Park on Lake Ontario in the west end of Toronto . Not wanting to miss the window of opportunity , or keep the scoter in captivity longer than absolutely necessary , TWC Rescue staff released the bird back to the wild , to live among its kind once again . <p> It takes a village , as they say , and this duck is healthy and free thanks to the combined efforts of the OMNR , TWC and OPG !
