I 'm from manila by the way .. <p> Got the B7 update some 4 weeks ago now ( BE/Proximus ) . This update is n't pure ! I strongly advise anyone to refrain from upgrading to this Kitkat 4.4.2. release and to stay instead with the previous original Jelly Bean firmware . With 4.4.2. , the device is suddenly behaving like affected by bug(s) : its lagging behind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then and the device needs to restart or is restarting on its own ; the phone becomes difficult to use ( cant pick up calls ) , messages are not getting out right away ; many apps are adversely affected , as well the downloading from playstore ; battery is heating and running dry twice or three times the speed depending on the application(s) you 're using ; the balk above the screens ( the notification area ) is not working properly ( most of the time useless ) which forces you to reorganize the device in order to be able to access your applications from the screen e.g. email etc How do you downgrade the device back to Jelly Bean ? ? ?
